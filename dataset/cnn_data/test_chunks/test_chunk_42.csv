"Prince William and Prince Harry once tried to get their personal chef to cook them pizza by forging a note to him, it emerged yesterday. Former Royal chef Darren McGrady said that as children the brothers swapped the instructions from their nanny for their own in which they asked for fast food. William and Harry were apparently fed up with the endless diet of traditional English food so wanted a change. Scroll down for video . Former Royal chef Darren McGrady (right) said that when the Royal princes were children (left) they swapped the instructions from their nanny for their own in which they asked for fast food . William and Harry (pictured as children at Balmoral Castle with the rest of the Royals) were apparently fed up with the endless diet of traditional English food so wanted a change . William and Harry, pictured with their mother, dressed for the start of a new term at school in April 1990 . Mr McGrady said that their 'juvenile handwriting gave their identity away' - and that they ended up with roast chicken anyway. He said that he was 'more scared of the nanny than I was of William' so obeyed her rather than the third in line to the throne. In an interview with People magazine, he said: 'They may be royal children, but they still have children's palettes'. Mr McGrady is the former chef to The Queen and Princess Diana and spent a total of 15 years cooking for them at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace. During that time he got to know the family and their culinary tastes very well. 'I remember holding the boys as babies, when the Princess was eating cereal in the kitchen, thinking, 'Wow, here I am, literally holding the crown jewels,' McGrady he told People. Mr McGrady said the young princes' (pictured with Princess Diana and Prince Charles) 'juvenile handwriting gave their identity away' - and that they ended up with roast chicken anyway . When the Princes (left with Prince Charles on a sking holiday) were growing up the chef of the day at the Palace would send a list of suggestions to the nursery for what they should eat and the nanny (pictured right, with a young William) made her choice and then a butler would bring the meals down to the children . He said that when the Princes were growing up the chef of the day at the Palace would send a list of suggestions to the nursery for what they should eat. The nanny made her choice and then a butler would bring the meals down to the children. William and Harry would eat the same food as adults only it would often be diced or pureed. Mr McGrady said that they were served 'traditional, English food' and William was supposedly fond of cottage pie and peas, poached chicken and rice and fish cakes. He said: 'Everything a normal British child would have. The only difference is that they had a chef cooking it for them.' When it came to dessert they went for 'quintessentially British comfort food' and their favourite was jam roly-poly. He said: 'Each time, I'd send up six pieces, and each of them would go.' Other desserts which were popular with the Princes included summer pudding and sticky toffee pudding which also happens to be a favourite of Princess Kate. Rank played its part even in what the children ate and whenever the Princes were joined by their cousins such as Zara and Peter Phillips or Prince Andrew's daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, their nanny decided what everyone ate as they were more senior. Mr McGrady said: 'So when William came in, his nanny was the senior nanny, because she had the senior royal, so the boys always had their choice of foods on the menu'.

"Britain's obsession with home ownership could be hindering the nation’s economic recovery, a leading global watchdog has said. Families in the UK are more indebted than those in many other major developed nations, said the International Monetary Fund – mainly due to borrowing to buy expensive homes. The UK was singled out as having a problem with household debt, along with Portugal – lumping Britain together with a country that was forced to seek emergency funding during the eurozone crisis. Families in the UK are more indebted than those in many other major developed nations, said the International Monetary Fund . The findings, in the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report, are a stark reminder that the recovery remains fragile. ‘High debt levels in the private sector continue to hinder growth and financial stability,’ the report said. ‘Gross household debt in Portugal and the United Kingdom is projected to remain high compared with that of other advanced economies.’ Soaring house prices have pushed up household debt in Britain in recent years – raising fears that families are over-stretching themselves to get on the property ladder or buy a bigger home. The Bank of England has clamped down on the sort of risky mortgage lending that was rife in the build-up to the financial crisis, in an effort to prevent another housing boom and bust. But the IMF said: ‘Containing financial stability risks from housing and mortgage markets remains important.’ It also said ‘measures to increase housing supply are a priority’ for the UK given the shortage of homes and swelling population. Both the Tories and Labour have promised to step-up house building after the General Election. IMF figures showed household debt in the UK was worth 87.1 per cent of gross domestic product, or total economic output, last year. That compares with 82.6 per cent in Portugal and 76.9 per cent in the United States. Debt levels are far lower in much of Europe, at 72 per cent in Spain, around 55 per cent in Germany and France, and just over 40 per cent in Italy. Douro River, Porto, Portugal: The IMF report lumped Britain together with a country that was forced to seek emergency funding during the eurozone crisis . A separate report will today claim 13million Britons will dive further into debt this year – a 40 per cent rise on 2014. The survey of 2,000 people found that, of the two-thirds of British adults already in debt from credit cards, overdrafts and loans, a quarter will have to borrow even more to cope. Kevin Mountford of MoneySuperMarket.com, which was behind the research, said: ‘It’s important that those relying on credit keep in control of the situation, so their debt doesn’t spiral out of control. ‘Simply working out a realistic monthly budget and cutting out unnecessary expenditure should be the first step.’ THE cost of moving house has soared to £12,000, figures show. Rising estate agents’ fees, removal costs and stamp duty helped push the total bill up 60 per cent between 2004 and last year – double the inflation rate. And it is forecast to hit £15,000 in five years despite recent reforms to curb stamp duty costs. The sky-high price of moving does not include the deposit – £90,000 for the average buyer. Experts said it could be putting families off moving house at a time when demand for properties has already fallen away. A study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research found the bill for moving typically includes more than £5,000 in estate agents’ fees, £3,600 in stamp duty and £1,400 in solicitors’ conveyancing bills. Paula Higgins, of consumer group the HomeOwners’ Alliance, said: ‘This is more bad news for struggling families.’","Borrowing to buy has left UK more indebted than other developed nations .

"All the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics . Out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in South Wales, the trade union firebrand's manner was as warm as the weather. 'Didn't you once call me a slab-faced Marxist?' the famously militant leader of Unite asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing. I had to confess I had. But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause. Watching him in action, it was clear that he is highly popular with activists. His gospel of traditional hard-left socialism goes down well with the converted, as does his hackneyed anti-Conservative bile. 'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose. Indeed, McCluskey, a former Liverpool dock worker who keeps a drawing of Lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss, is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom: 'We are supposed to believe that the Seventies was a horrible time. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. Labour's umbilical link to McCluskey's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing, anti-austerity SNP, yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country. Not only is Unite – which has a claimed membership of 1.42million – intertwined with the Labour Party's structure, MPs and finances, but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past, including a major expansion in the public sector, less flexibility in the workplace, higher taxation and ever more state spending. Just like Nicola Sturgeon, McCluskey wants to make Labour bolder, 'more radical, courageous and brave'. Only last month, he appeared to threaten illegal action if a Tory Government pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector. 'When the law is misguided, when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question, I'm giving the answer. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. Despite all his talk about the oppression of working people, however, he has not done badly for himself. Last year it was revealed he received a £5,000 rise, taking his pay and pensions package to £140,281. McCluskey has denied that he has too much influence over Ed Miliband, adding that Unite is supporting the party '100 per cent' McCluskey's determination to influence Labour was all too evident in Wales. With an air of quasi-regal grandeur, he visited several factories, gave talks to Labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities – including one in Cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist Nye Bevan. When I spoke to McCluskey, he downplayed his hardline socialism, instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy. And he denied that he had too much influence over Ed Miliband's party: 'If only that were true,' he said, while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. As I watched him at close quarters, it became more apparent that he was going through the motions. When asked in an interview with BBC Radio Wales about Miliband's leadership, McCluskey could say only: 'He's doing OK'. Beneath the surface, I have no doubt he longs to hear Ed offering more nakedly socialist policies, rather than trying to appeal to Middle England. Moreover, if Labour and Unite really think that McCluskey is an asset in the election, they are doing their best to keep quiet about it. When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. No one would give me any information. It was only through persistence and good luck that I managed to track him down, to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally: 'How did you find us? Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' That kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence. It reveals a fear that, just as with Sturgeon's spendthrift radicalism, the hard-Left dogma of Unite is likely to alienate floating middle-of-the-road voters. Such fears are, of course, only too justified. For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David, who enjoyed greater popularity among Labour MPs and the rank and file. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least £14.4million to Labour's coffers. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband (pictured left) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David (right) The dominance of Unite runs right through Labour's organisation, with huge implications for the make-up of a putative Miliband government. One recent analysis showed that 159 Labour MPs from the last parliament receive sponsorship from Unite or are members of the union, including senior frontbenchers such as Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite. As Martin Mayer, chairman of Unite's political committee and a member of Labour's National Executive recently admitted, the union is involved in a 'serious attempt to win back the party'. Tragically for Britain, there is now a real danger that an incoming Labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the Left, not just by SNP by also by Unite, with Miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in Downing Street.","The scale of influence Unite holds is chilling given what it seeks to impose .

"A professor testifying in a cold-case trial in Southern California said Thursday that she was intimidated into identifying her rapist to the man now charged with killing him in 1995. Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. 'I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim, Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in Europe and the mother of a little girl (left). Esparza is pictured right upon her arrest while re-entering the U.S. in 2012 . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client had no role in the murder and knew nothing of any plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza — who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France — was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from advocates for sexual assault victims who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. Esparza, 40, is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. During opening statements this week, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center)  and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.' 'He felt that he had been violated,' Murray said of Van.","Norma Esparza, 40, is facing six years in state prison after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter .

"An engaged couple have joined forces and lost a combined weight of 11st in time for their big day after the bride-to-be was bullied about her size. Holly Beard, 24, and her fiance Steve Hancock, 27, from Adderley Green, Staffordshire, tipped the scales at over 41st between them when they set a date for their big day in January last year. But Holly decided to slim down when she was teased at the opticians where she worked after her boss brought in a cake as a treat. Scroll down for video . Holly Beard and Steve Hancock reached a combined weight of 41st after moving in together . Before she could tuck in, a member of the public shouted at her: 'She doesn't need a cake - look at the size of her.' Holly, who has since left her job, was left mortified and crying in the toilet after being humiliated in front of her colleagues last April. After vowing to lose weight for her wedding day this May, she joined Weight Watchers in June last year. She has since gone from 17st 8lb to a slim 11st 9lb in just nine months. Steve also began to shed the pounds after joining Holly on her diet plan and switching his meals to align with hers. The warehouse manager lost 5st and going from 23st 7lb to a healthier 18st 7lb since June last year. But after Holly received cruel taunts in her workplace the couple went on a joint diet losing 11st between them . Holly, who lives with Steve says that before she started her diet she would eat without thinking. 'I was getting comfortable with Steve after we moved in together and I didn't realise how to look after myself properly. 'It was just eating too much of everything, too many potatoes, too much lasagne and a pudding after even when I wasn't hungry.' But after her embarrassing incident at work Holly knew that something had to be done. 'In April last year the boss had brought a cake for everybody as a treat that day. 'He gave us the cake and there was a patient standing next to me who shouted: ""She doesn't need a cake - look at the size of her."" 'It was awful. I cried in the toilets and cried the rest of the day. When other people lost weight, I would find myself defending my own weight. It was a horrible way to live. 'When I went to have a wedding dress fitted in June last year it was a size 22. I decided to join Weight Watchers that month and haven't looked back since.' The dramatic weight loss has also seen Holly slim down from a size 22 to a ten to 12 which has proven to be a nightmare for her wedding dress fitter. Holly went from 17st 8lb to a slim 11st 9lb in just nine months after joining Weight Watchers . 'I've had to have my dress fitted every two months because I am down to a size ten to 12 now. 'She has only just started making the dress and I haven't even seen it. I am giving the poor woman a heart attack.' Holly says that her new size will come as a shock when she gets married, especially guests who live far away. 'I lived in Scotland for half my life so there are so many people who haven't seen me this small. It will be a shock for them when I walk down the aisle.' As well as her health improving, Holly says that her confidence has seen a complete turnaround. 'I would never go out without make-up before. Now I don't even care what I wear because I know I look good on the outside, and I also feel good in myself. 'I'm always going to be curvy, but if Kim Kardashian can be curvy and slim, so can I. 'The best thing has been taking the journey with my future husband. Steve has done so well and I don't want people to forget that we've been through it together.' Steve says that he would never have reached his new weight without the help of his fiancé. He said: 'I'm a typical man and I can't cook. Steve has gone from 23st 7lb to a healthier 18st 7lb since June last year . 'Holly cooks all my food and I couldn't have lost the weight without her. She is a different woman now. 'It's crazy how much we've both changed, and I'm so glad we did it before the wedding. It feels like a fresh start.' The couple halved the size of their portions and ate from smaller plates in order to lose weight for their big day. They also cut out carb-heavy lunches and dinners, instead eating healthier salads and well-balanced meals. The pair now plan to tie the knot in front of 40 friends and family at the Three Horseshoes Inn in Blackshaw Moor, Staffordshire on May 21. Holly's mother Pat visits her daughter - who now works as a weight loss consultant for Weight Watchers - every three months and has been stunned by the dramatic weight loss. She said: 'The support Holly and Steve have given each other has been incredible. The wedding gave them both something great to aim for. I'm just so proud. 'They have both been very enthusiastic and such an inspiration. They never looked back. I always thought my daughter looked nice, even before. 'Now she looks absolutely fantastic.'","Holly Beard and Steve Hancock tipped the scales at 41st between them .

"A professional Kate Middleton lookalike has said the royal mother dresses 'too boring' for her age - and admits that she fancies Prince Harry more than William. Jodie Bredo, 26, from Essex, has been a Kate lookalike for six years and wishes the Duchess of Cambridge would 'change her hair for once' - suggesting she opt for a bob style. Jodie, who is now single after splitting from her boyfriend, said of the Duchess, who is expecting her second child: 'Kate’s just too frumpy for her age. Scroll down for video . She often does jobs with a Prince William lookalike (left) but says she fancies the younger Prince Harry more . Jodie Bredo, 26, (pictured) has been a professional Kate Middleton lookalike for the past six years . 'I know I'm seven years younger than her but she should dress more fun. I like wearing fitted dresses and showing my figure off. I’d love her to get something more fashionable like a bob.' Miss Bredo admits she does not fancy Prince William and is not tempted to have her own happy ending like the royal couple. She said: 'I do lots of jobs with a William lookalike, but I don’t see him like that. Prince Harry's the better one. His bad boy image is more for me.' Although her counterpart is in the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in London currently awaiting her second child, Miss Bredo is not keen to start a family herself. The glamorous Essex resident said: 'I've recently broken up with a long-term boyfriend so I’m not thinking about babies. 'Kate’s new baby isn’t making me broody,' said the lookalike (with her nephew Louis). 'I've got two nephews and one's the same age as Prince George - but it’s nice to hand them back to their mum at the end' 'I know I’m seven years younger than her but she should dress more fun,' said Miss Bredo (left).

I’ve got two nephews and one's the same age as Prince George - but it’s nice to hand them back to their mum at the end.' Miss Bredo started her career after noticing her resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge. She was routinely stopped in the street when Kate first came into the public eye while dating Prince William. She said: 'I was shopping in Debenhams with my mum when this woman came running after us. 'I thought I’d left something, but she just said, ""I have to tell you, you look so much after Kate Middleton."" 'Even at the opticians having my eyes tested, the optometrist told me I looked like her. Miss Bredo (left, with her mum and sister) began her career after people kept commenting on her likeness to Kate Middleton . She sent an email to a lookalike agency with her photographs in 2009 and was hired for a shoot in Tatler . 'My family were on holiday in Cyprus and Kate was in the newspaper. My mum told me I looked like her and needed to do something with it.' Miss Bredo sent an email to a lookalike agency with her photographs in 2009. She said: 'I was accepted but didn’t hear from them about any jobs. I wasn’t too bothered. I was working as a personal assistant at the time and didn’t think about it. 'In March 2009, I had a call from them saying I had my first job. When they said it was for Tatler magazine, I couldn’t believe it. 'I took the day off and had to go to Aintree races, the shoot was based around what they thought Kate should be wearing. I was in these mad outfits. 'This one dress had plastic panelling all down the arms so I couldn't even move my arm to have a drink.' After the royal couple’s engagement in October 2010, Miss Bredo (third from left) began working as a lookalike full-time . After the royal couple’s engagement in October 2010, Miss Bredo began working as a lookalike full-time. She said: 'I had so many calls I was doing four to five days a week, appearing at corporate events and doing shoots. 'It was really strange, people wanting a picture with me, but I got into it and really had fun.' Miss Bredo studies Kate’s mannerisms as well as following her beauty regime. She said: 'I have regular trims to keep my hair looking good, every two months and curl the ends the same as Kate. 'Her signature look is a lot of black eyeliner so I get through that really quickly. 'I spend £30 a month buying black eyeliner. My favourite brand is Bare Minerals. She has regular trims to keep her hair in good shape, spends £30 a month on black eyeliner, has regular manicures and buys clothes that are distinctly 'Kate' Since the duchess gave birth to Prince George last year, Miss Bredo (middle) has had plenty of shoots with tots and has even has to wear a baby bump . 'She also wears very harsh blusher and has natural nails so I give myself regular manicures.' Miss Bredo spends hours searching for the Duchess on the internet so she can keep up-to-date with her wardrobe. She said: 'If she’s wearing something new, I’ll try and find it but it’s usually sold out instantly. 'I know what kind of clothes she’ll wear now. 'When I’m going clothes shopping I’ll choose some things that I think are ""Kate."" 'I picked up this black and white spotted dress and my mum didn't think it was something the Duchess of Cambridge would wear. 'Then I saw a picture of her when she was pregnant with George – it was the same one I’d bought. 'I think she’s copying me now.' Kate Middleton (pictured in London on 12 March) is due to give birth to her second child with Prince William any day now . Miss Bredo usually appears with a William lookalike and their after-work drinks get plenty of attention. She said: 'You can tell people are staring and some people take sneaky pictures of us. 'But a lot of people come up and ask to take a picture, it’s funny we’re just two friends having a drink. 'Even on my own I get lots of double takes – especially if I’m in London.' Since the duchess gave birth to Prince George, aged one, Miss Bredo has had plenty of shoots with tots. She said: 'I’ve got used to holding babies now and when I do events they provide me with a bump.

"The bereaved teenage son of a Tulsa man shot and killed by a 73-year-old volunteer deputy says his father's killer should have never been on a police force. 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad,' Aidan Fraley said of Robert Bates. The 16-year-old told NBC he believes everyone on the Tulsa force is to blame for his father the April 2 death of his father Eric Harris and says 'they should all go down.' 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad': Aidan Fraley (right), 16-year-old son of slain unarmed Tulsa suspect Eric Harris (left) has spoken out to say that his father's 73-year-old killer should never have been deputized and given a gun . 'They should all go down': Fraley (here with his uncle Andre Harris), says all the Tulsa police who allowed Bates to become a cop should be held accountable for his death . Meanwhile, his own mother--who calls Harris her 'soulmate'--has already forgiven his killer. 'The Lord has forgiven me for my sins, and who am I not to forgive him?' Fraley told NBC as she spoke out on the case for the first time. Her young son, however, is not ready to forgive and wants to see the other police officers at the scene brought to justice. 'They were involved in it,' he said. 'One of the dudes had his knee on his head, and I feel like that played a part in his death after the shooting.' Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Defense attorneys released some of the training records Saturday for a 73-year-old volunteer sheriff's deputy charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect in Oklahoma. The records for Robert Bates include certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008. Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Bates' attorneys said the 64 pages of records released to The Associated Press and other news organizations include records Bates copied and kept for himself. Although there are time gaps in the documents provided, some of the records seem to indicate Bates was proficient in firearms and dozens of other training courses. 'For the first time today, we feel like someone's starting to look at the other side of this as far as his qualifications,' Scott Wood, an attorney for Bates, said after the documents were released. The Tulsa County volunteer deputy has disputed a Tulsa World report that sheriff's office supervisors were ordered to falsify his training records. The World said at least three of Bates' supervisors were transferred for refusing to go along with the requests, and said it consulted multiple sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, but it gave no indication how those sources were familiar with the situation. Bates told NBC's 'Today' show on Friday that he was certified for his position and had the documentation to prove it. Harris' family attorney - who had questioned Bates' qualifications as a reserve deputy - did not return a message seeking comment Saturday. A call to the district attorney's office rang unanswered, and the sheriff's office referred questions to Wood. 'I want to do everything I can to make sure that people know that this allegation of falsified records is not true,' Wood said.

"Raheem Sterling has prompted new concerns over smoking after fresh pictures emerged of him holding a shisha pipe – this time joined by his teenage Liverpool team-mate Jordon Ibe. The pictures, believed to have been taken in a London bar earlier this season, show the young stars sat together and both are holding shisha pipes. Casually dressed, the pair are sat on a sofa in front of a table with shisha pipes, cans of fizzy Fanta orange and a portable music speaker. Sterling, who is considering his future at Liverpool, and Ibe are considered as the two brightest stars to emerge at the club as they battle to stay among the Barclays Premier League pacesetters. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The pictures will heap further embarrassment on Liverpool after other recent revelations involving Sterling . Sterling on his feet holding a shisha pipe . Sterling, 20, is battling controversy after the first picture, revealed on Sunday, showed him smoking a shisha pipe. A video then emerged showing him passing out after inhaling nitrous oxide – otherwise known as ‘laughing gas’ or ‘hippy crack’. The England international has been the subject of a club probe into why he was taking the legal high. But the sight of 19-year-old starlet Ibe, who has made his breakthrough into the Liverpool first team this season, will cause even more concern with club officials, who have declined to comment on the latest pictures. Sterling's representative also refused to comment. Ibe, wearing a red hoodie and ripped black jeans, is pictured holding a shisha pipe. He is sitting next to Sterling, who is wearing a tight white v-neck t-shirt and blue jeans, on the sofa. The pair can be seen smiling and joking as they hold on to the pipes in the bar. Liverpool will be anxious that Sterling does not further damage his public image after a tempestuous period, in which he has become involved in a contract stand-off with the club. He was heckled at the launch of the club’s new kit last week, while a pocket of supporters chanted ‘Raheem Sterling, your agent’s a c***’ during the 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday night, in which Sterling scored the opening goal. Sterling has turned down a deal worth around £100,000 per week and does not want to resume negotiations until the end of the season. He infuriated Liverpool when he gave an interview to the BBC — without permission — to talk about his contract stand-off and why he did not want to be perceived as a ‘greedy 20-year-old’. Asked on Monday if he will be reminding Sterling of his responsibilities, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: ‘I will do. He’s a young kid who has been in the spotlight now so he knows the demands of being a top class professional — it’s not just on the field it’s off the field, but I will speak with him on it and we’ll move on.’ The players, wearing casual clothing, inhale from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) It appears that the two players have a shisha pipe apiece and are also drinking Fanta . Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. Ibe is seen as a potential star at Anfield after he announced his talent with a sensational display in February’s Merseyside derby draw at Everton. He had spent the past six weeks on the sidelines with a knee injury but returned to the starting line-up during Monday's 2-0 win over Newcastle. The injury has delayed him signing a new contract with the club, although that is expected to be a formality. Shisha pipes are used to smoke fruit-flavoured tobacco, which is burned on hot coals, through a long tube. They are commonly used in the Middle East. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes, which calls into question the professionalism of any athlete using the pipe. The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: ‘Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was pictured on a social media site with the picture captioned ‘1 down 3 to go’, suggesting he did not just take a single drag on the pipe. In February, Arsenal and England midfielder Jack Wilshere faced criticism after he was pictured with a shisha pipe on a night out while recovering from ankle surgery. But the Arsenal star, who has previously been pictured smoking cigarettes, was defended by England manager Roy Hodgson who said he'd tried the Middle Eastern pipe himself and did not think it was a problem. Sterling was pictured on social media whilst smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday night's Premier League match at Anfield . In the video footage, Sterling is seen sucking on an orange balloon then laughing and giggling before he asks one of his friends to give him another hit. When the camera pans back to the 20-year-old, he is either unconscious or has fallen asleep. It is claimed that the video, obtained by The Sun, was taken at his home in Southport in the days before a game. Sportsmail contacted Sterling’s agent, Aidy Ward, on Monday night. He refused to comment on the story but did not deny that it was his client. Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool captain Jamie Carragher said: ‘In years to come he’ll look back over this period now as a massive learning curve. When you’re a 20-year-old kid, you make mistakes. I did, I’m sure we all do. It’s just important that he learns from it because Raheem Sterling needs to be on the back pages, not the front pages and that’s a problem for him in these last few months.’ Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Players' union chief Bobby Barnes called for understanding after Sterling 'made a mistake'. He said: 'Nobody would condone the use of these types of substances whether legal or otherwise as footballers are seen as role models. It does send a message to young people that if it's good enough for footballers then it's good enough for them and that is not desirable. 'But you have to bear in mind that we ask an awful lot of young players growing up in the public eye. Many of us look back at things we have done in our teens and early 20s and wish we hadn't done them. 'He's made a mistake and people are human. I am sure this will be a minor blip on his path to a fantastic career.’ Nitrous oxide starves the brain of oxygen and makes users feel light-headed and dizzy. It has been nicknamed ‘laughing gas’ due to the euphoric and relaxed feeling people who inhale it can sometimes feel. Official figures show 460,000 16-24 year-olds took it last year. It has been the cause of 17 deaths since 2006. Tottenham defender Kyle Walker was pictured inhaling a balloon in 2013, while last year Saido Berahino was pictured doing it at the wheel of his Range Rover.","New pictures show Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe with shisha pipes .

"Transgender model Andreja Pejic has revealed that she was told by people within the fashion industry that she would no longer seem ‘special’ or ‘interesting’ once she completed her transition into a woman. The 23-year-old Serbian-born fashion star, who appears in a solo editorial in the May issue of Vogue, told the publication that she was advised not to undergo her gender reassignment surgery because it would transform her from an interesting enigma into just another pretty girl. Andreja noted that there were people who warned her not to transition, explaining: ‘There was definitely a lot of, ""Oh, you’re going to lose what’s special about you. You’re not going to be interesting anymore. There are loads of pretty girls out there.""' Scroll down for video . Fashion pioneer: Transgender model Andreja Pejic posed for photographer Patrick Demarchelier for a spread in Vogue. The 23-year-old revealed to the magazine that she is the new face of Make Up For Ever . Major debut: The model, who underwent gender-confirmation surgery last year, took to the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show in February (pictured) One agent even told her that 'it's better to be androgynous than a tranny', but Andreja refused to fall prey to those opinions. 'It is about showing that this is not just a gimmick,' she said of being transgender. Andreja also revealed during the interview that she has been signed as the newest face for beauty brand Make Up For Ever, and is thought to be the first ever transgender model to land a major cosmetics campaign. And her success is, she hopes, a sign that there is a cultural shift occurring within the industry when it comes to gender identity. 'There are just more categories now,' she told Vogue. 'It’s good. We’re finally figuring out that gender and sexuality are more complicated.' Andreja was born in what is now known as Bosnia-Herzegovina and later to emigrated to Melbourne, Australia. She grew up as a boy named Andrej, although she admitted that she was unsure where she fit in during her adolescence. She even considered being gay, but explains that even that 'didn't fit', saying: 'Society doesn’t tell you that you can be trans.' Andreja recalled wanting to 'stop puberty in its early tracks' because she was worried about her jawline becoming too strong and her feet and hands growing too large . Fashion friends: Andreja posted this picture of herself posing alongside Kendall Jenner while the pair were backstage at the Giles  show . Two worlds: Before her sex reassignment procedure, Andreja made a name for herself as both a male and female model, having modeled menswear (L) and womenswear (R) for Jean Paul Gaultier . But at 6'1, Andreja, who also wears a size 11 shoe, fits in perfectly with her fellow models. On her first modeling gig she looked around the room and told herself she didn't need to worry because 'every girl in fashion is exactly the same'. Before undergoing her sex reassignment surgery, Andreja made a name for herself within the fashion industry as both a male and a female model, with her androgynous look allowing her to showcase both male and female designs. She modeled Jean Paul Gaultier's Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2012 collection in Paris in July 2012, before going on to showcase the same designer's menswear range as part of Paris Fashion Week in January 2013. She took the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show show at London Fashion Week in February. And her new cosmetics campaign is just the latest means of her continuing to break boundaries – something which is already being echoed throughout the fashion industry by many other models. Last month, it was announced that transgender teen Jazz Jennings, 14, would be the new face of skincare brand Clean & Clear's new 'See The Real Me' campaign. And in November Brazilian transgender model and Givenchy muse Lea T landed a highly-coveted campaign with the American hair-care brand Redken.

"A monster 50-foot sperm whale found washed ashore in California is attracting dozens of camera-wielding tourists while experts decide what to do with the carcass. The marine mammal was discovered bleeding from its head along  the south end of Sharp Park State Beach in Pacifica on Tuesday. On Wednesday scientists and biologists sought to determine how the massive animal died. It is the seventeenth dead sperm whale to beach along the North Coast of California in over the 40 years, a spokeswoman for the Marine Mammal Center said. Officials say it's not immediately clear would be done with the decomposing carcass after the examination. In the meantime, people have been spotted photographing the animal and even stopping to touch it. Scroll down for video . Unexpected arrival: The carcass of a 50-foot sperm whale has washed ashore at a beach just south of San Francisco . Local attraction: Biologists and veterinarians arrived to the beach in Pacifica to examine the decomposing remains, believed to be an emaciated adult male, early Wednesday . Rare occurrence: The animal is one of 17 dead sperm whales to beach along the North Coast of California over the 40 years that the California Academy of Sciences, has been handling such cases, a spokeswoman said . In January, a rare pygmy sperm whale died after beaching itself in Point Reyes. Investigators said it had likely gotten sick and was too weak to swim. The San Francisco Chronicle reports  the decomposing carcass, believed to be an emaciated adult male, washed up sometime Tuesday. Whales, in general, are at risk in the waters where they live. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has asked San Francisco Bay Area boaters to watch out for and steer clear of whales, which migrate into the San Francisco Bay Area in large numbers during the spring and summer. Gray whales are at a particularly high risk of collisions with ships and boats, as they often travel near shore and may even wander into the bay this time of year, the administration reports. Boaters should not approach within 100 yards of any whale, cut across a whale's path, make sudden speed or directional changes or get between a whale cow and her calf.

"The days of filling your car with petrol may be numbered because researchers have boosted the efficiency of making hydrogen fuel from plant waste. US scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that doesn't pollute the environment like fossil fuels. The breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside bioreactors instead of pumping petrol into their motor. US scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that doesn't pollute the environment like fossil fuels and it could accelerate the take up of biogas for cars . Eco-friendly hydrogen cars, which are already a reality, emit only water, but the gas is expensive and is not easy to store, meaning more research is needed for  hydrogen cars to become mainstream. Now, researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University have shown that it’s possible to convert 100 per cent of the sugar in corn stalks and husks – a by-product of farming – into hydrogen gas, which can be used to power vehicles. It’s previously only been possible to convert between 30 and 60 per cent of plant sugar into hydrogen, by using industrial catalysts or fermenting techniques, The Independent reported. The ultimate aim is to produce large quantities of hydrogen from crop waste efficiently, because many present methods either cost too much or use food crops. The breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside bioreactors instead of pumping petrol into their motor. For years, scientists have been working out how to develop fuel cell cars powered by pure hydrogen, but are unsure how to store the substance effectively. Now, researchers from India's Benaras Hindu University may be close to solving this problem using coconut kernels to store hydrogen in gas form. Storing liquid hydrogen is notoriously difficult as it must be held at extremely low temperatures, which is expensive and tricky in the confines of a car. To store it in its gaseous state, would mean that vehicles would have to be fitted with large, pressurised tanks, which is not practical. So instead, experts have focused on finding materials, such as carbon, which can absorb hydrogen and release it on demand. Professor Viney Dixit and his team, at the university’s Hydrogen Energy Centre created carbon from coconut kernels, which contain fatty and organic acids as well as potassium, magnesium and sodium. He says that the kernels, which are easily found, are cheap and can easily be converted into carbon. ‘Unlike graphene, Carbon nano tubes (CNTs) and other type of carbons, the production of carbon from solid endosperm is not time taking, he wrote in a research paper. ‘Therefore, its cost-effectiveness, good adsorption capacity and easy availability are its advantageous factors in regard to hydrogen storage.’ The researchers found that the carbon produced from the kernels could store a ‘considerable’ amount of hydrogen. Two scientists developed a process to make more efficient fuel by mixing biomass with a special solution comprising 10 enzymes that turn plant sugars into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The enzymes were created in microbial fermenters using genetically engineered bacteria, which were then added to the plant waste and left for several weeks – although they would be left for far longer if the fuel was produced on a large scale. The breakthrough could produce a zero-emissions fuel that could speed up the movement toward hydrogen-powered vehicles, according to the study, which was published in the journal PNAS. ‘We have demonstrated the most important step toward a hydrogen economy -- producing distributed and affordable green hydrogen from local biomass resources,’ said study co-author Percival Zhang, a professor at Virginia Tech. Together with former doctoral student Joe Rollin, he founded a start-up called Cell-free Bioinnovations to work on the fuel. The process builds on previous research using xylose, ‘the most abundant simple plant pentose sugar, to produce hydrogen yields that previously were attainable only in theory,’ according to the study. Other hydrogen fuel production methods rely on highly processed sugars, but the Virginia Tech team used corn husks and stalks, which are known as dirty biomass, to cut costs and make the fuel easier to produce locally. Dr Rollin found that the process of breaking down corn husks and stalks into hydrogen and carbon dioxide can use both sugars glucose and xylose at the same time - not one after the other. The discovery means it is possible to speed up the rate at which hydrogen is released, while decreasing the area of the facility needed to produce it to the size of a gas station. Other hydrogen fuel production methods rely on highly processed sugars, but the Virginia Tech team used corn husks and stalks, (a stock image of the whole plantis shown) which are known as dirty biomass, to cut costs and make the fuel easier to produce locally . ‘We believe this exciting technology has the potential to enable the widespread use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles around the world and displace fossil fuels,’ Dr Rollin said. Experts say it is hard to know how much the new approach might cost, but Lonnie Ingram, director of the Florida Centre for Renewable Chemicals and Fuels at the University of Florida - who was not involved with the study - said the work ‘represents a revolutionary approach that offers many new advantages. ‘These researchers have certainly broadened the scope of our thinking about metabolism and how it plays into the future of alternative energy production,’ he said. Researchers say they have the necessary cash to scale up their findings to a demonstration-level, which is the next step of the project. Professor Zhang said: ‘I think in three to five years we should be able to build a bioreactor that is something like a gas station which can produce 200 kilos of hydrogen fuel a day. ‘This would be enough to re-fuel about 40 or 50 cars.’","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University researchers found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel .

"The Church of Scientology is one on a long list of organisations that have been barred from using the Anzac brand by the Department of Veteran Affairs ahead of April 25. Out of 384 applications that have inundated the department over the past 12 months about 80 per cent have been approved to use the word Anzac, which stands for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corp. Forty-four items were rejected for a range of reasons, including it was too commercial or its name was inappropriate. Scroll down for video . The Church of Scientology is one on a long list of organisations who have been reprimanded for using the word Anzac . An Anzac-branded port, an educational app for iPhones called ANZAPP and medallions with the word Anzac on them were among the list of denied products. Organisations such as the Church of Scientology, Woolworths, and online sites Teespring, Zazzle and Redbubble were reprimanded for using the word Anzac. The church used the brand in an attempt to raise $10,000 worth of donations to open new centre in Auckland in New Zealand, while Woolworths caused controversy for overlaying its logo and 'Fresh in our memories' on photographs of war veterans. A Scientology spokeswoman told Fairfax Media this was oversight made by someone who did not know expressed permission needed to be granted to use the word Anzac. Woolworths also caused social media controversy earlier this month for using Anzac to market itself . Victoria Bitter was one of the organisation who were allowed to use Anzac in its 'raise a glass' campaign . The AFL won the right to use Anzac to brand its games and merchandise as it donated to the RSL . 'No funds were raised from this action. Once the church was notified of the use of the term, an apology was sent forthwith and the term was never used again, nor will it be,' the spokeswoman said. 'We meant no disrespect to anyone, particularly those people who gave their lives for both countries.' Woolworths was also forced to apologise after its marketing campaign caused a social media storm, with people labelling it 'disrespectful'. The supermarket giant said in a statement it regretted the campaign had 'caused offence'. 'This was clearly never our intention. Like many heritage Australian companies, we were marking our respect for ANZAC and our veterans,' it said. On the other hand, the AFL was permitted to use Anzac at its football games and on its merchandise as it donated to the RSL and Victoria Bitter was given the green light to use the term in its 'raise a glass' campaign. The alcohol brand was allowed the right as it also contributed to the RSL and Legacy. Penalties for misuse include a maximum of 12 months imprisonment for serious breaches, a $10,200 fine for individuals and a $51,000 fine for organisations. Permission to use Anzac for commercial purposes can only be granted by the department's minister. It cannot be used to name a boat, house, building or a car without approval. An iPhone app called ANZAPP was barred from using Anzac to promote its educational uses . An Anzac-branded port (not pictured) was also denied permission to use the term . Goods with the Anzac brand also cannot be imported without seeking authorisation. Approval is usually granted to businesses that operate on a road with the word Anzac in it. Applications are also cleared if a company donates to ex-service community organisation, such as the RSL. The same goes for Anzac biscuits as long as they are made in line with a traditional recipe and are of a certain shape. The term ANZAC, normally written as Anzac, was first used in early 1915 by Major General William Birdwood's staff in Cairo, according to the Department of Veteran Affairs. General Birdwood called for its accepted use following the landing at Gallipoli. He asked for the area held by Australians and New Zealanders on the peninsula be called Anzac to distinguish it from the British position at Helles.","Port, phone app and photo-sharing project were barred from using Anzac .

"David Cameron is narrowly winning the battle for floating voters, according to a major poll out today. The ComRes survey of 4,000 undecided voters found a slim majority have been more impressed with the performance of the Prime Minister than that of Ed Miliband during the Election campaign. A separate poll of marginal seats by the former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft suggests that Ukip’s vote is being squeezed in key constituencies as election day approaches. A ComRes survey of 4,000 undecided voters across the UK found a slim majority have been more impressed with the performance of Prime Minister David Cameron than that of Ed Miliband during the Election campaign . It also suggests Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is set to hold her marginal seat in Loughborough. Today’s ComRes survey, for ITV’s Good Morning Britain show, found that 37 per cent of floating voters have been impressed with Mr Cameron’s performance on the campaign trail so far, compared with 31 per cent who think Mr Miliband has done well. Nigel Farage was just behind on 30 per cent. Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, has impressed 21 per cent of voters on the back of her strong performance in last week’s televised leaders’ debate. Ms Sturgeon appears to have been biting her nails . Is the pressure starting to tell on Nicola Sturgeon? From the look of her hands as she met her party’s candidates in Aberdeen yesterday, it looks like the 44-year-old SNP leader has been struck by a bout of behind-the-scenes finger-chewing. Mr Cameron also suffered less badly from negative appraisals. While 49 per cent said they were ‘unimpressed’ with the Prime Minister’s performance, 54 per cent said the same of Mr Miliband. But the poll also shows that politicians have yet to shift many of the undecided voters whose support is likely to be critical in next month’s election. Just 12 per cent of the group said they had made up their minds since they were last polled in March. Another 48 per cent said they had a ‘good idea’ who they would back, while 16 per cent said they were ‘starting to lean towards a certain party’. Almost a quarter (24 per cent) said they were ‘completely undecided who to vote for’. Floating voters identified the NHS as the most important issue, followed by immigration, the cost of living and the economy. Meanwhile, Lord Ashcroft’s survey of Labour-Tory marginals suggests Mr Cameron still has a lot of work to do just to hold on to the seats he won in 2010. Of ten Tory-held marginal constituencies, Labour is ahead in four seats, with the parties tied in another. Mr Cameron also suffered less badly from negative appraisals, with 49 per cent of undecided voters saying they were ‘unimpressed’ with his performance and 54 per cent saying the same of Mr Miliband (pictured) Lord Ashcroft said the study showed Ukip’s vote was being squeezed since the same seats were polled last year. ‘The Ukip share had fallen significantly – by up to 10 points – in nine of the ten seats polled,’ he said. The decline in Ukip support has helped the Tories consolidate their grip in Blackpool North, Pendle, Gloucester, Kingswood and Mrs Morgan’s Leicestershire constituency. The Education Secretary, whose 3,744 majority is the smallest in the Cabinet, is now nine points ahead of the Labour challenger. But Labour also appears to be benefiting from the squeeze in Ukip support in some areas, moving ahead of the Tories in Harrow East and increasing its lead in the Tory-held seats of Hove, Stockton South, and Morecambe and Lunesdale. In Pudsey, West Yorkshire, Labour and the Conservatives were tied with 40 per cent each. Nigel Farage said he was not concerned about the Ashcroft polls, saying: ‘In areas where the two big parties are firing heavy artillery and we are not, it is perhaps not entirely surprising.’ Ed and Justine Miliband on the campaign trail . Ed Miliband’s wife has revealed how he led her to believe he was single when they met at a dinner party – at the home of the woman he was dating. Justine Miliband said she was furious to discover he was seeing another woman. She also described how that evening, the future Labour leader bored her by insisting on talking about economics. Mrs Miliband told the Daily Mirror: ‘I thought he was good looking and clever and seemed to be unattached. But we just went down a conversational cul-de-sac. ‘Apparently we had nothing in common. He wanted to talk about economics – one of my least favourite subjects. None of our conversations went anywhere.’ The unpromising start to their relationship was compounded when she found out he had been going out with the woman who invited them to dinner. ‘I was furious. I bumped in to him a couple of times after that, but we didn’t start seeing each other for at least a year,’ she said. Speaking while she was campaigning in Runcorn, Cheshire this week, Mrs Miliband said: ‘Canvassing in the rain always reminds me of falling in love with Ed in 2005. ‘I had never been out leafleting before and didn’t realise you had to keep your eye out for dogs on the other side of the letterbox. ‘I’d been bitten by a Doberman. Ed bandaged me up and I fell in love with him.’ Labour slammed for 'weaponising child sex abuse in campaign . Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper released figures which showed reports of child sex abuse have risen by 60 per cent over the past four years . Labour was last night accused of ‘weaponising’ child abuse after blaming the Coalition for a rise in child sexual exploitation. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper released figures which showed reports of child sex abuse have risen by 60 per cent over the past four years, while arrests for these offences have fallen by 9 per cent. The Tories said the figures were ‘false’, and accused Labour of ‘playing politics’ with an ‘appalling crime’. They said the rise in reports was due to more awareness of the issue in light of scandals in Labour council areas such as Rochdale and elsewhere. Last night Conservative MP Julian Smith said: ‘Is there no level to which Labour won’t stoop? First they tried to weaponise the NHS, now this. It’s disgusting.’ Miss Cooper claimed the figures showed police are not able to respond to the scale of the reports, pointing out that over the past four years, almost 17,000 officers have been cut. She added: ‘[Tory] plans for deeper cuts in the next Parliament cutting over 20,000 police would be deeply damaging to the fight against child abuse.’ A Tory spokesman said: ‘Child abuse is an appalling crime, and no one should play politics with it. Labour’s conclusions are false. They are talking about the amount of crime that is reported to the police. ‘But for many people, child sexual abuse has been a hidden crime which is only now coming to light, and it is good that more people are having the courage to come forward. Rather than making up numbers about police officers, Labour should support the action we have taken to expose this evil crime, to prosecute the perpetrators and to support survivors.’","Survey of 4,000 undecided voters found slim majority favour Prime Minister .

"Four teenagers have been caught on camera kicking a rare bird and throwing another out of a window. The gang broke into an aviary and bundled 200 of the animals into sacks and containers around 3.30am on January 12. CCTV showed the men took the birds to a tower block in Walsall, West Midlands, and dumped them on the floor before kicking them and forcing them out of barely open windows. Four teenagers have been caught on camera kicking a rare bird, thought to be in the bag above, and throwing another out of a window in Walsall, West Midlands, on January 12 . The birds were also jammed into drawers, squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard. One resident reported that a dead bird was posted through his letterbox while others were dropped through windows. Three men and a youth have been convicted of their involvement and will be sentenced next month. Chad Worgan, from Walsall, admitted an offence of receiving stolen goods and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal on the basis that he kicked a pigeon. The 19-year-old knew the animals were in the bags and had a 'sick grin across his face' as he appearing to grab one of the perched birds and visibly squeeze it, the court heard. Thomas Knox, from Bloxwich, denied the same charges. A dog belonging to Knox, also 19, was let into the flat to terrorise the birds, it was revealed. Jake Higgs, 23, from Bloxwich, admitted receiving stolen goods but denied causing unnecessary suffering. A 16-year-old from Erdington, Birmingham, also attended but cannot be named for legal reasons. The birds were also jammed into drawers, shoved through barely open windows (above), squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. One of the men (above) can be seen with a grin on his face during the attack . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. Bob Thomas, chairman of the bench, said their actions amounted to 'joint enterprise'. He added: 'They arrive with a dog and are seen to be carrying a variety of bags and containers. These are emptied by them and both a large number of dead and live birds are seen. 'The CCTV shows all of them entering the property together and all playing some part in the birds' suffering. 'We are satisfied that they were all aware of the contents of the bags.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'The birds were stolen from an aviary in the Brownhills area in the early hours of January 12. 'They were then taken to Dolphin House where they were emptied onto the landing area of the block.' The birds were stolen from rare bird breeder Lee Williams who had built up his collection of rare jays, finches, doves, budgerigars, quails and pigeons over a number of years. In 2008, the dad-of-two considered giving up his passion after 270 animals worth £4,000 were stolen. Speaking at the time, his wife Michelle said: 'This has devastated him. His bird breeding plays a major part of his life.'","Gang bundled birds from aviary in Brownhills, West Midlands into sacks .

"The young woman who killed her ice-addicted partner has spoken out about the horrific moment she stabbed him with a kitchen knife and has begged his father to forgive her. Jessica Silva's ex partner, James Polkinghorne sent her a text message threatening to 'cave her f***ing head in' and 'bash the f***' out of her before arriving at her Marrickville home fuelled on 'ice' on Mothers Day in 2012. Fearing for her life, Ms Silva called her brother to come help her and sent her mother a desperate text message that said, 'Mum, the psycho is coming.' During a candid interview with 60 minutes, Jessica Silva has outlined the terrifying incident and has visited the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son three years ago. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Mr Polkinghorne has reassured Ms Silva that he holds ‘no anger' and 'no hatred' After a hesitant moment, the pair emotionally embraced and held each other for a time . 'I walked down to the front of the house and he just started punching my face,' Ms Silva told veteran journalist Michael Usher about that night three years ago. 'All he was saying was, 'all of yous deserve to die... all of yous deserve to die'' Ms Silva said he then held her brother by the throat so she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself and her brother. Upon returning to the scene, she could hear Mr Polkinghorne screaming, 'I'm going to kill yous.' It was then that she stabbed him five times in the shoulder, chest and back. 'It was just to kind of scare him, I didn't think I was going to use it,' she said. 'But he looked up and went to grab me again and drag me down... that's when I stabbed him.' On being asked what she believes would have happened if she did not stab Mr Polkinghorne, she said she believes she would be dead. 'I don't remember stabbing him so many times,' she said. 'I didn't want it to end like that.' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' Mr Polkinghorne said his son was generous but was also 'no saint' and could have been a 'better bloke' After a hesitant moment, the pair embraced and held each other for a time . Mr Polkinghorne said his son was generous but was also 'no saint' and could have been a 'better bloke' She narrowly escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Ms Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Ms Silva escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances' James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . On visiting Mr Polkinghorne in Queensland, Ms Silva said she was nervous and was seeking forgiveness . Last month she walked free from court, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. While James Polkinghorne's father admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, he could still not understand why his son was dead. 'He was a better bloke than he ended up being,' he told 60 Minutes. 'He was always there to help someone.' On visiting Mr Polkinghorne in Queensland, Ms Silva said she was incredibly nervous and was seeking his forgiveness. 'I just need reassurance that he doesn't hate me,' she said. After a hesitant moment, the pair embraced and held each other for a few moments before composing themselves. Mr Polkinghorne told Ms Silva he is still working on forgiveness during the emotional reunion. ‘No anger, no hatred,' he told her. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said ""it was just a rash"", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all.' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' During the course of her trial, Ms Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . Before his death, during the phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I didn't mean that, I was just scared,' Ms Silva told 60 Minutes. 'I don't know why I said that.' Ms Silva's legal team are launching an appeal to have her manslaughter charge dropped. On being asked whether she will tell her son what happened to his father, Ms Silva admits she will tell him the truth when he is old enough. She is now working on moving on with her life and coming to terms with the horrific incident. 'My head is so heavy , I'm just holding everything in there,' she said. 'I just want to escape it, but I won't'","Jessica Silva stabbed James Polkinghorne outside her home in 2012 .

"A man who allegedly killed three men while they slept outside and shot a woman on her way home from  dinner  originally set out to rob his victims but was overcome with 'bloodlust,' according to a statement filed in court. Aeman Presley, 34, faces charges for the killing of two homeless men in Atlanta, another man sleeping outdoors in DeKalb County and a hairdresser in a parking garage in Decatur. Presley is set to appear in front of a DeKalb County judge today and district attorneys in both DeKalb County and Fulton County have said they will seek the death penalty. Bloodlust: Aeman Presley (center), 34, who allegedly killed four people had originally set out to rob his victims but was overcome with 'bloodlust' after killing the first man . An investigator for the Fulton County district attorney's office detailed Presley's slide and eventual turn to violence in court documents. The man had taken a Greyhound bus from Los Angeles to Atlanta last May 'hoping to rejuvenate his beleaguered acting career,' according to a sworn statement by the investigator. At first, Presley settled into a homeless shelter in Atlanta and worked small food service jobs, but when his money ran low, he bought a Taurus .45 revolver 'on the street' to use in robberies, the statement said. On September 26, Presley took a bus to DeKalb County with the intent of finding people to rob, according to documents filed in court. He came upon 53-year-old Calvin Gholston sleeping beneath a shopping center breezeway, firing three shots that killed him, the statement said. That incident produced 'a self-described adrenaline fueled high,' according to the statement. 'This high manifested into a ""bloodlust"" which compelled Presley to commit two more murders in Fulton County.' Targeted: After Presley killed Calvin Gholston (left), 53, he felt a 'self-described adrenaline fueled high' and went on to shoot Dorian Jenkins (right), 42, while he slept on the sidewalk in November . Tragic: 68-year-old Tommy Mims (left) was shot while sleeping under a railway bridge while 44-year-old Karen Pearce (right) was killed in a parking garage on her way home from dinner . Having apparently abandoned plans for robbing strangers, Presley found Dorian Jenkins, 42, sleeping on a sidewalk under several blankets and killed him on November 23, the statement said. Wanted: After killing Pearce, Presley said he decided he did not want to continue killing and tried to go back to a career in acting, before getting arrested for jumping a turnstile . A few days later, he killed 68-year-old Tommy Mims as he slept under a railway bridge, later coming across two other homeless men he considered killing before deciding it would be too risky, according to the statement. 'Since he was ""getting off on killing people,"" he wanted to kill them, too,' the statement said. 'He decided, however, that doing so would increase his chances of apprehension.' He instead turned around and went back to where he shot Mims, believing he had not killed him, and shot him twice more in the head, according to the statement. Presley was in Decatur on December 6 and found 44-year-old Karen Pearce walking alone on her way back from dinner with friends. He ordered her to hand over her wallet at gunpoint, which she did, though Presley still shot her once in the chest, killing her, according to the statement. After Pearce died, Presley said he didn't have the same feeling of adrenaline, and later told investigators he had never wanted to kill a woman. He then tried to return to acting, and was on his way to get headshots taken on December 11 when he was arrested for going through a train station turnstile without paying. During an hours-long interview by Atlanta police detective David Quinn, Presley said he didn't think he was 'a biologically malevolent person.' Some events of his life, including his father's early death and mother's illness contributed to a 'murderous spirit,' along with, Presley said, membership in Chicago's Gangster Disciples and rap lyrics.","Aeman Presley, 34, faces charges stemming from a string of murders that officials say he committed last year .

"Conman: Neil Moore was on remand at Wandsworth Prison when he sent fake email posing as court clerk . A 'hedonistic' conman who escaped from prison after sending staff a fake email saying he had been granted bail has been jailed for seven years. Neil Moore, 28, was on remand at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London for a £1.8million fraud when he emailed wardens posing as a court clerk manager at 'Southwalk Crown Court'. It allowed the fraudster to brazenly walk out of prison on March 10 last year, an escape motivated by Moore's fear he would be harmed by fellow inmates after striking up a relationship with a transgender individual at HMP Wandsworth. Moore's escape only became apparent three days later when his solicitors attended the prison for a conference with him and discovered he was gone, London's Southwark Crown Court heard. The judge, Recorder David Hunt QC, described the escape as 'sophisticated and ingenious'. He said: 'The way you contrived your escape was potentially more of a threat to the integrity of the prison system, and therefore to the public, than the mere use of brute force. 'And in my judgment there is an obvious need to deter others from trying to procure their escape through the same or similar means.' While behind bars Moore set up a website, using the address and telephone number of the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand, using an 'illicit' mobile phone that was used widely in the prison. He created a domain name similar to the court service's hmcts.gsi.gov.uk, emailing the custody mailbox from an account ending hmcts-gsi-gov-uk. Investigations, with the help of Homeland Security in the US, revealed Moore set up the website using the name of the officer who was investigating him, Detective Inspector Chris Soole. Moore grew up in Trinidad and Tobago, where he had a difficult relationship with his parents on account of his sexuality. John Femi-Ole, defending, said: 'His sexual orientation is something of a taboo, he tells me, within the community of which he was a member.' Neil Moore's partner Kristen (left) leaving London's Southwark Crown Court . Mr Hunt said: 'I accept that you may have had a troubled early life as a result of your sexual orientation, but that can be no excuse for committing fraud.' He said Moore committed 'sophisticated' frauds to fund a 'hedonistic lifestyle'. When Moore's grandfather died he left him an amount of money which he frittered away partying, the court heard. Mr Femi-Ole explained that after Moore left his native country, he changed his name and entered a civil partnership, committing the frauds to continue funding the lifestyle he had grown accustomed to. 'He became addicted and intoxicated by it, and the lifestyle he was able to enjoy. He entered into a civil partnership with a transgender individual,' he said. It was this relationship that ultimately led Moore to make his escape from prison, after they were both sent to HMP Wandsworth, it was said. Mr Femi-Ole said: 'He (Moore) and his partner were remanded into prison, Wandsworth Prison. Their relationship became revealed, he tells me, by the guards.' He described these as 'dark days' for the pair, with Moore fearing being raped or killed after his partner was granted bail. 'It was in these circumstances that he felt he could not tolerate the situation and escaped in the way the crown describe.' The court was read a letter from Moore in which he described feeling suicidal at the time of the fraud offences. It read: 'I committed these offences and continued living a fake fictitious lifestyle, pretending to be someone I am not, with a life full of glamour and partying.' 'There is something Great Gatsbyian about that', said Mr Femi-Ole, continuing to read: 'I wanted to feel loved and accepted. During the time of these offences I was extremely depressed and unhappy.' The court heard that Moore also tried to kill himself on several occasions, 'drinking excessively and partying' in an attempt to block out how he was feeling. Escape plan: Moore brazenly walked out of Wandsworth Prison (pictured) after sending a fake email to wardens saying he had been granted bail. The judge described the escape as 'sophisticated and ingenious' Mr Femi-Ole told the court the letter by his client was a 'window into his soul' and demonstrated his remorse. Opening sentencing last month, prosecutor Ian Paton said: 'Having been remanded in custody by the court, and realising the reality of what he had led himself into, and what was waiting to be uncovered, he promptly set about adapting his skills for deceit, dishonesty and forgery to that new environment and he engineered his escape.' After being contacted by his lawyers Moore contacted his representatives and surrendered. He admitted eight counts of fraud in which he posed as staff from banks such as Barclays, Lloyds and Santander to dupe major organisations such as Thomas Exchange Global into handing over significant sums of money. The court heard that Moore used up to four aliases to commit the frauds worth a total of £1,819,000, sometimes putting on a woman's voice to dupe his fraud victims. He was so convincing that his partner Kristen Moore was initially charged alongside him, believed to be involved in the scams, Mr Paton said. All charges against Moore's partner were later dropped. Moore answered phone calls from his victims with a man's voice and then pretended to transfer them to his colleague, resuming the conversation himself in a feminine voice. Moore, from Ilford in Essex, admitted eight counts of fraud, and one count of escape from lawful custody, and was jailed for a total of seven years. Dressed in a dark grey suit and black polo neck jumper, he remained impassive as he was sentenced. Ronnie Biggs escaped from Wandsworth Prison in 1965 after scaling a wall with three other prisoners . Neil Moore is not the first to escape from Wandsworth Prison. In 1965, notorious Great Train robber Ronnie Biggs broke out after scaling a 30ft wall with three other prisoners.

"United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. United Launch Alliance has unveiled a radical plans for reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' that is slated to take off in 2019.  Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres . The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. Russian-made RD-180 engines currently power ULA's Atlas rocket, but Congress banned further imports as part of trade sanctions enacted after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. ULA said the new rocket's first stage will be powered by a pair of liquid-oxygen and liquefied methane engines under development by Blue Origin. Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno told a news conference in Colorado that the engines will be designed to return to Earth, so they can be refurbished and reflown. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to grab them mid-air . Reusing the engines will enable ULA to cut launch costs to about $100 million for a medium-lift booster and about $200 million for heavy-lift variants. This is roughly half the cost of ULA's current Delta 4 Heavy rocket. Initially, ULA will use its existing upper-stage Centaur engine but plans to introduce in 2023 an advanced motor that can recycle waste propellants. Hours after unveiling its next-generation 'Vulcan' rocket,  United Launch Alliance (ULA), ran into its first problem - the rocket's name. 'Vulcan is a trademark of Vulcan Inc. and we have informed ULA of our trademark rights,' Chuck Beames, president of the Paul Allen-backed Vulcan Aerospace, told Reuters. 'Paul Allen and Vulcan were early leaders within space exploration with the launch of SpaceShipOne more than a decade ago. We are flattered by ULA's tribute to our legacy by naming their new rocket 'Vulcan',' Beames said. ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, selected Vulcan as the name of its new booster, which will be developed in phases beginning in 2019, after it won more than 1 million votes in a crowdsourcing initiative. 'We have done our due diligence regarding the legal right to use the name Vulcan,' ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye wrote in an email. 'ULA is committed to taking every reasonable step to avoid any confusion with other entities using this name and we are confident we can do so,' she said. This, it claims, will greatly extend its orbital lifetime and the number of missions it can perform. 'We can take multiple satellites into orbit. We can put them in different planes,' Bruno said. 'When we get done with that, we can fly back to the space station. We can do all sorts of things. This is truly a game-changer.' ULA also plans to reduce its launch pads from five to two, and offer a standardised menu of fixed launch prices, much like SpaceX, which posts its Falcon rocket pricing on its website. Bruno declined to say how much Vulcan's development will cost, but added such efforts typically run at least $2 billion. ULA will use its own profits to bankroll the venture. SpaceX, meanwhile, is also hoping to transform the rocket business. Today, it attempted to land the first-stage booster of a Falcon 9 rocket on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. The attempt didn't go to plan, with the rocket booster tipped over after landing. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks an important step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. SpaceX founder, Elon Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. SpaceX is also hoping to transform the rocket business. Today, it attempted to land the first-stage booster of a Falcon 9 rocket on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville.

"The birth of Alanna and Stephan Goetzinger's third daughter was meant to go like the previous two - an intimate family moment that took place in a wading pool their bedroom at home, lit by candles. Instead, the night turned to tragedy when the little girl Rana died either during birth or within minutes afterwards. A coroner found that the care given by the midwife who assisted at the birth in 2012 was 'grossly inadequate' and may have contributed to the death of the baby. But in a move many people would find extraordinary, the couple refuses to blame the midwife, and are in fact is defending her actions. Alanna and Stephen Goetzinger (pictured with their daughters Kayla, right, and Alice, left) lost their daughter during a stillbirth in 2012 and have spoken out against the coroner's report which blames their midwife . Coroner James McDougall said that the midwife failed to adequately prepare for the Rana's birth, allowed the delivery to take place in 'unsafe conditions', and that her failure to provide proper medical assistance may have caused the death of the Goeztinger's baby. Coroner McDougall found that Rana had died either 'during or shortly after birth' from meconium aspiration, a condition where a foetus inhales their faeces before birth, preventing them from breathing. The  report also found that the midwife, who handed in her resignation following the inquest, changed her statement about the events of the evening, including the time of the baby's birth and whether the baby had exhibited signs of life. Three years on, the couple, who live on a farm in Kanungra in south-east Queensland, have spoken about the night Rana was born, and what they claim was a tragic and unavoidable event. Alanna, 39, and Stephan, 57, are adamant that Rana was stillborn, and that it was very clear from the moment she was born that she had died before birth. 'We could see a problem as soon as she was born. It wasn't like I was holding her for a while and then we all of a sudden noticed. When she was lifted out of the water and put into my arms she was limp, there was no life in her little body,' Mrs Goetzinger, 39, told Daily Mail Australia. Alanna Goetzinger with her daughters Alice and Kayla while she was pregnant with Rana . Mrs Goetzinger said that her daughter Rana was stillborn, and that the coroner's report which claims she died 'during or shortly after birth' was fabricated . The report found that the midwife changed whether there were any signs of life, and also changed the time of Rana's birth from 11.40pm to 11.45pm to cover a seven minute delay in calling for emergency care at 11.47pm. 'On initial questioning, midwife M stated that she ""was very surprised as things were going well and the baby had a heart rate at birth"",' the report said. 'She then stated that ""there was no heart rate and no signs of life after birth"".' The report also concludes that the midwife allowed Mrs Goetzinger to give birth at home despite her being at greater risk for meconium aspiration, as a result of her age, the higher end weight of her previous pregnancies, and the fact that she had carried Rana for 41 weeks in utero. It states that the care the midwife provided 'fell significantly short' of what would be expected of someone of her experience, and that she had  failed to notice meconium in the water when Mrs Goetzinger's waters had broken as a result of the poor lighting provided by only having candles in the room. 'There were lights on in the other rooms, but I had chosen to have low lighting to calm me,' Mrs Goetzinger said. 'My midwife also did spot meconium when my waters broke but that was only moments before I actually gave birth. When she came out she was stained with it, which means she probably suffered from the asphyxia days before I gave birth.' Alanna and Stephan on their wedding day (left), and Alanna with two of the couple's daughters . Alanna and Stephan have defended their midwife against the findings of the coroner's inquest . 'We didn't sit around and make a cup of tea deciding whether to call the ambulance. As soon as Rana came out the midwife yelled to my husband to call them,' she said. The Goetzinger's travelled to the Gold Coast University Hospital in an ambulance, where Rana was pronounced dead and was taken away for an autopsy after doctors expressed concerns over the actions of the midwife and her sub-standard attempts at CPR. The couple said that their daughter was taken off them without their consent, and that they were both traumatised by the knowledge that she was being autopsied without permission. 'They just took her off us and chopped her up for autopsy. They never asked. It was horrific,' said Mr Goetzinger. 'The poor little thing didn't even get to breathe and they were cutting her open,' Mrs Goetzinger said. The couple said that Federal police officers showed up at their house in the hours following the birth and treated their home like a crime scene. They said were made to feel like criminals for choosing to have a home birth, and chastised for cleaning up the birthing room which had been wiped down following the birth. 'It was disgusting the way we were treated, like we'd intentionally murdered our baby,' Mrs Goetzinger said. When the results of the autopsy were returned to the family, Mrs Goetzinger said that she was appalled, and that neither she nor her husband were ever approached for questioning about the events of the night. Mrs Goetzinger said that she and her husband were made to feel like criminals for choosing a home birth . 'My only consolation is that I have my two beautiful daughters,' said Mrs Goetzinger . 'They didn’t once in three whole years contact us to ask for my opinion. They didn’t question me, they didn't tell me anything at all. You'd think if they really wanted the truth would they would have asked for my version of events,' Mrs Goetzinger said. 'Losing Rana was tragic and devastating and I was lost for weeks, and then for both us and our midwife to be treated like criminals was just too much,' she said. The midwife, who stepped down following the inquiry, was found to not have formal infant CPR training. She was cautioned by both the coroner and was reported to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, who launched an investigation into her conduct and concluded that the midwife failed to uphold healthcare standards of the profession. 'I feel like they needed to crucify someone, and they blamed the midwife. She is a beautiful person and did nothing wrong,' Mrs Goetzinger said. 'She lost her job over this which is just awful. She lost her livelihood for no good reason whatsoever, and apart from us losing our baby that is the most horrible thing that has come out of this,' she said. 'Nobody is to blame, it just happened. It was tragic and devastating but it just happened.' Mr Goetzinger said he wants an apology from the coroner for the claims in the report, and want to see their midwife's license reinstated without restriction. Mr Goetzinger said that people should have a free and informed choice about whether they choose to have home births . 'If I had millions of dollars I would sue them for fraudulent proceedings because the document is a fraud, it's full of contradictions,' Mrs Goetzinger said. 'They made my midwife out to be a complete villain. She is a registered nurse and has everything she needs to be a midwife and there is nothing more she could have done,' she said. 'My only consolation is that I have my two beautiful daughters, and I do feel Rana around me. She's the one who is pushing me to speak out and tell her story.' Mr Goetzinger said that people should have a free and informed choice about whether they choose to have home births. 'It is so nice to have child born at home, it’s so much better and familiar. People should make up their own mind without interference from the authorities,' he said. The couple are staunchly anti-vaccines, and believe in allowing parents to choose for themselves how their children's health should be managed.","Alanna and Stephen Goetzinger lost their daughter Rana when she was stillborn during a waterbirth at their home in 2012 .

"As inexperienced first-time parents we shower our baby with gifts and document their every milestone. But second children are left to rely on hand-me-downs, with around £500 less spent on them in their first year of life. More than a third of mothers clothed their second baby in one or more hand-me-downs, with 46 per cent giving them toys bought for their elder sibling. Second children are left with hand-me-downs, and around £500 less spent on them in their first year of life . And though 82 per cent have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair or a video of their first steps, only 23 per cent have a keepsake for their second, a report by Debenhams found. The new Royal baby may be about to force Prince George to share the Royal spotlight, but most second borns in the family have every reason to feel hard done by, the research shows. Doubtless the latest addition to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's family, due next week, won't have to put up with many hand-me-downs, but he, or she, will be a baby that bucks the trend, says the new study. The report for the high street retailer found on average the second born has over £500 less spent on them in the first 12 months, than the first sibling who is showered with attention and given the best of everything. Second children have to put up with having fewer new clothes bought for then as well as having a poorer record of their upbringing, with noticeably fewer photos and home movies taken of their young life. It happened with Prince William and Prince Harry as babies. The Duke of Cambridge has 124m images and mentions on social media of him as a toddler compared with 116m for the younger brother. Prince Willam and Prince Harry: The Duke of Cambridge has 124m images and mentions on social media of him as a toddler compared with 116m for the younger brother . Over eight out of ten mums (82%) say they have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair, a video of the first step, or the first drawing while less than one in four (23%) have a keepsake of their second. A third (32%) of second time mums admit to clothing their new baby in one or more hand-me-downs and almost half (46%) say they give them toys which had been brought originally for the elder brother or sister. Mums confess to wasting money on the first born due to, 'inexperience', and the, 'excitement' of a first baby, but also report a sharp decline in gifts for the second- born. They also say they are more knowledgeable about toddlers' demands when it comes to subsequent children and realise they don't need so much. The new Royal baby may be about to force Prince George to share the Royal spotlight, but most second borns in the family have every reason to feel hard done by, the research shows . Four of five mums say they bought, or were given, more expensive items than were required when their first child came along. Designer outfits promoted by fashion loving celebrities were rated as the biggest luxury with only 12% of second children being bought clothing with a designer label compared with 38% of first-borns. More than half of first-time mums also admitted to splashing out on clothes their children have never worn. First children have on average 14 cuddly toys by the age of six months, whereas the later child makes do with an average of eight. Mums said they asked friends and relatives for specific practical gifts for the second child rather than relying on chance, which cut down on presents that were never used. When asked about family albums of their children up to the age of two, three quarters admit that those photos almost always include the older sibling. It was only when a toddler started nursery school that the second child started having more photos taken. Debenhams head of childrenswear, Shani Delargy said: 'Having a baby at any time is a momentous experience but it's understandable that mums adopt a much more practical approach by the time the second child comes along. 'Whilst mothers want the best for all their children. It's all about being sensible and looking for good value products. At Debenhams we recognise this and offer a great choice of baby products and clothing for all budgets, including designer labels at high street prices.' According to the Office for National Statistics the average age to have a second child is 30.1 years, while the average age of first time mothers is 28.1 years old. The Duchess of Cambridge was 31 when Prince George was born and is now aged 33.

"Drive-by death: Cassandra Cassidy was fatally wounded as she tried to help two women 'afraid of men in a car' outside a rehab centre . A 24-year-old rehab worker killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas was an 'innocent bystander' who had been trying to aid two women who had approached her in the street. Cassandra Cassidy had been stopped outside the addiction recovery centre where she worked shortly after 10pm on Friday by two females 'afraid of males in a car', police have said. The fashion design student was shot as a car occupied by multiple people drove past while she was talking to the women, and died in hospital shortly afterwards. Ms Cassidy had just arrived for her late-night shift at a half-way house for people struggling with substance abuse, when the women approached her, Las Vegas police said in a statement. The women later told police they had been afraid of two men in a car down the street and asked to use Ms Cassidy's phone to call for help. A white, two door car with several occupants drove up to Ms Cassidy's car and fired several rounds, striking Cassidy but not the two women, before it sped off, Lt. Jeff Goodwin of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said. The aspiring designer, who had recently launched her own vegan clothing label, was mortally wounded and taken to University Medical Center where she died. The death of Ms Cassidy, who described herself as 'a 24-year-old fashion design student,  artist, geek, photography enthusiast, hiatus model, and many other things' on her Instagram page, has devastated family and friends. Her boyfriend of two years, Adam Loghides, 26, said working at the rehab centre was a perfect fit for her, as she 'always finds the best ways and finds the best qualities in people'. The International Academy of Design & Technology-Las Vegas's student, was 'an avid supporter of civil rights and LGBTQ issues and someone who represented fairness on all levels and equality,' Mr Loghides told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police are investigating the shooting but have yet to make any arrests.

"Father-of-two Tipu Sultan from Sunderland, who has been named locally as a takeaway boss who has shot dead outside his shop in South Shields . A manhunt has been launched after a father-of-two described as friendly and chatty was shot dead outside a takeaway in a professional-style hit. Tipu Sultan was gunned down shortly before 10pm last night at the back of the Herbs n Spice takeaway that he ran in South Shields. Emergency services found Mr Sultan, who lived in Sunderland, but was originally from Bangladesh with a gunshot wound and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Witnesses report seeing two men wearing crash helmets and dressed in dark clothing on a motorbike  driving away from the area in the direction of Lizard Lane immediately after the shooting. Today there is a heavy police presence on Lake Avenue in South Shields with the lane behind the takeaway completely taped off with officers believing Mr Sultan, 32, was targeted deliberately. South Tyneside Superintendent Sav Patsalos said: 'The investigation into the murder of Tipu Sultan is in its very early stages and we are appealing for anyone with any information that could help us with our inquiries to contact us as soon as possible. 'We are trying to establish the motive behind the incident and a full murder investigation is currently being carried out. 'We believe that this has been an isolated incident and not a random shooting, enquiries are ongoing to establish this. 'Those responsible may have planned the incident in advance of carrying it out and if anyone has seen anything or anyone suspicious in the area at anytime in the past few days then I'd ask them to come forward and speak to us. 'There is nothing to suggest there that is any risk to any other members of the public or any of the communities in South Tyneside and we understand this incident is extremely concerning for local people and that is why we have extra officers down in the Lake Avenue to reassure and speak to the public. 'We are doing everything we can to try and identify those responsible for this attack and I'd urge anyone with any information to contact police straight away.' It has also emerged that Mr Sultan's father saw the shooting and closed the door as the weapon was pointed at him. Police cordon off the area in South Shields around the Herbs n Spice takeaway where a man, named locally as Tipu Sultan, died from gunshot wounds . Mr Sultan's sister Jubli Begum told the Newcastle Evening Chronicle: 'My dad called last night to say to come quickly to the takeaway. The back door of the takeaway was open and two lads on motorbike came. 'My dad said one got off and had a gun, he pointed it towards my brother and said ‘you’ and shot the gun at his neck or side of head.' Meanwhile people living nearby to the takeaway have been paying tribute to Mr Sultan. Angela Charlton, 49, a carer from South Shields who lives around the corner from Herbs n Spice said: 'I feel awful. You don't expect something like this on your own doorstep. It's like a movie. 'I have heard that someone came in and ordered a can of coke while someone else came round the back and shot him in the head. It is understood that the victim worked in the takeaway and today there is a heavy police presence in the area . 'I have also heard that he was out smoking out the back when the two men arrived. There are rumours flying around at the moment. 'Apparently there were two men on a motorbike, one driver and one shooter. 'I live around the corner so I didn't hear anything apart from the commotion that followed of police cars and helicopters.' Meanwhile Ann Wilkinson, 57, who lives close to Lake Avenue and is studying to be a childminder, added: 'He was always in the takeaway, but I think his dad owned it. 'He spoke good English, and he was one of the best people. He was always friendly and chatty. He was concerned about the family and asking about the kids. 'He had a boy and a girl and was from Sunderland. I can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him. No-one had a bad word to say about him. 'I feel like I knew him well. He travelled through from Sunderland every night. I just feel gutted for his family and his little kid.' People living close to the area have paid tribute to the father-of-two, who they described as 'friendly and chatty' Victoria Chisholm, 37, landlady of the pub The Lake next door to the takeaway, also paid tribute to the victim. She said: 'I am just looking at the police tape and thinking it shouldn't have been happening here. 'I am really shocked. He was a big part of the community. He used to bring everyone's curry through to the pub. 'When it happened I was in the back bedroom. There were lads from the curry shop shouting for the police. 'I had my friend's four children staying with me so I couldn't go out.' Anyone who was in the area last night and might have information is asked to contact police on 101 ext 69191, quoting reference number 1255 07/04/15.","The shooting happened at the back of Herbs n Spice in South Shields .

"Sri Lanka, with its shimmering sandy beaches, enthralling wildlife and relics of ancient civilisations, is high on lists of places to visit in 2015. Gareth Huw Davies enjoys the new stability on the teardrop-shaped island in the Indian Ocean, where the holiday industry is recovering, and expanding with a crop of smart new hotels, after the dual torment of a tsunami and a bitter civil war. The modern Seema Malaka temple, Colombo, Sri Lanka. The temple floats on Colombo's Beira Lake . 1...Pure serendipity . This is the spiritual home of serendipity – lucky discoveries by accident – as Serendib is the island’s ancient name. It happens everywhere. On one of my early starts for an excursion, serendipity was seeing dozens of candles flickering in the dense dark outside a Buddhist temple. Then a schoolgirl in brilliant white uniform striding through the dawn mists along a levee between paddy fields, while an equally white egret paced daintily in the water. Or an old lady, knee-deep in a swamp picking blue water lilies, the national flower. And everywhere, games of impromptu cricket, with a stick for a bat and a plastic drum for a wicket, on bare mud patches, in gardens, on roads. Bath time! A frolicking elephant at the Uda Walawe nature reserve has around 200 of the giant creatures . 2...Jumbo jaunt . The island’s unique subspecies of elephants are a vestige of ancient Sri Lanka. You can’t miss them. My most memorable jumbo encounter was at the Uda Walawe nature reserve. We watched in awe as an extended family ambled across our track. One juvenile pushed over a tree, just for fun, it seemed. Last across was a harassed young mother, sheltering a three-week-old baby. In the right season you might see 200 elephants at the lake in Minneriya National Park. The distinguished star in Yala National Park is the ‘prince of the night’ – the leopard. Picture perfect! A tea Planatation near Hunas Falls near Kandy Sri Lanka . 3...Old England . The nearest thing to cool in Sri Lanka is its green and hilly heart, where tea plantations are a fascinating sight. Kandy, where the British beat the last king of Ceylon in 1815, still feels like a charming, antique outpost of empire. It is dotted with guesthouses that recall Tunbridge Wells. The colonial throwbacks include a bus station clock that chimes like Big Ben. There are red King George V post boxes and immaculate old Morris Minors, Hillman Minxes and Ford Anglias. I stayed at the Queen’s Hotel, all echoing wooden corridors and wide, polished staircases. In the Botanical Gardens, I found the tree that Queen Elizabeth planted. In the serenity of the Temple of the Tooth, what is said to be the Buddha’s tooth is kept safe within the innermost of seven caskets. Sigiriya is an ancient palace located in the central Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central Province. The name refers to a site that hosues a massive column of rock nearly 660 ft high . 4...Rock of ages . Sigiriya is a quarter the size of Ayers Rock, topped with the 1,500-year-old fortress of the playboy King Kasyapa. He killed his father and surrounded himself with a crocodile-filled moat to exclude his vengeful brother. I decided against the one-hour, 900ft climb to the top for the ancient frescoes and spicy graffiti. Instead I strolled into the jungle that smothers the massive defensive stones at the rock’s base. Huge, golden-green butterflies fluttered past. A strange symphony of birds burbled out of the trees – Sri Lanka has many wonderful avian species. In a gap in the canopy I caught a flash of orange at the top of the rock. It was a Buddhist monk in his vivid garb. Yet more serendipity. Not the usual black cab: Taxi rank of tuk-tuks line the streets in Negombo in Sri Lanka . 5...TAKE THE TUK-TUK . Most visitors stay on the west and south coasts where, as well as standard tourist hotels, there is a growing choice of chic, small places such as Tri, a ten-suite boutique hotel near the south coast that opens in June. Then you can book trips by coach or car (with your own private driver) to most parts of Sri Lanka. For short distances the ubiquitous motorised tuk-tuks are fun. Don’t even consider hiring a car. Roads are an all-day adrenaline rush. You need an expert at the wheel to dodge the massive Ashok Leyland Tusker lorries painted with idealised landscapes, jam-packed buses and wobbling bikes with impossible loads. Paradise! A golden beach with turquise waters at Unawatuna near Galle on the south coast of Sri Lanka . 6...JUST THE (TRAIN) TICKET . The little station on the Colombo to Galle line close by my hotel felt like a slumbering country halt from 1950s Britain. Behind the ticket office’s narrow arched window, a clerk consulted his tomes and solemnly outlined my choices – I opted for a 90-minute trip in second class for 50p. On the platform I joined goats and men there just for a chat. We lurched off down the tragic (it bore the brunt of the 2004 tsunami) and beautiful coast to Galle. Another epic rail journey is Colombo to Trincomalee, the east coast city closed to the world by civil war until recently and still to be discovered by tourism. It’s just £2 one way.

"Anyone with a heartbeat dreams of hopping around the world, from the bright lights of New York City to the idyllic islands in the South Pacific, but insurmountable costs keep us grounded most of the time. Travel doesn’t come cheap, but it is possible to see some of the most amazing places on the planet on a tight budget or even get paid to do it. All it takes is a few sacrifices, hard work, commitment and an outgoing personality. Here are some of the ways travellers can keep their costs down while satisfying their wanderlust. While travelling the world can cost a lot of money, there are some ways to do it for free, or at leas ton a very tight budget . Stay in a stranger’s house . House-sitting is one of the easiest ways to trim costs on a trip abroad because it eliminates the need to spend a huge amount of money on accommodation. Depending on the arrangement with the property owner, food and transport may be included in exchange for taking care of the person’s home and, in some cases, pets. Properties are advertised on a number of websites, including TrustedHousesitters.com, which charges a membership fee of £5.99 a month. Laura Cody and Tanbay Theune (pictured) are seeing the world while house-sitting for strangers . Laura Cody, 23, and Tanbay Theune, 26, have been criss-crossing the globe after leaving Birmingham in July 2013. They embarked on the adventure after they discussed their desire to travel and became fed up with paying rent every month. Since then they have been staying in strangers’ homes – without having to pay rent or bills – all over Australia, the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy, and have been blogging about the experience. Canadian bloggers Dalene and Peter Heck were recognised with an award from National Geographic after they sold almost all of their possessions and set off on a quest to house-sit around the world. In almost six years they have visited about 30 countries – from Ecuador and Mexico to Turkey and Thailand. House swapping and couch surfing are two other options. Cruise ship workers can see the world, but should be prepared for long periods at sea and long work hours . Work on a cruise ship or superyacht . If motion sickness isn’t a problem, a job with a cruise line is an ideal way to see different parts of the world between shifts. It’s the kind of job for a ‘people person’, as employees live together on the ship and aren’t afforded much privacy. They must also be able to endure long periods at sea and long hours of work. There are jobs for various skill sets – from photographers and musicians to nurses and electrical engineers. But people should do plenty of research into pay, benefits and working conditions before applying. Working on a superyacht is another way to sail around the world while making a salary and tips. Those who commit to this kind of career should expect to work long hours every day and spend a lot of time at sea or port. Again, employees are afforded very little privacy when they’re on board, as they sleep in close quarters with their colleagues. Some owners will even hire private teachers for their children for months at a time. A teacher who goes on an around-the-world trip is usually paid approximately £50,000, said Henry Smith, a sales broker with Cecil Wright, a boutique yacht brokerage with offices in Monaco and London. Volunteering with an organic farm offers a chance to travel and learn while helping others . Make a difference . There are plenty of organisations that allow people to volunteer in impoverished countries where help is desperately needed. They allow people to travel to places they normally wouldn’t visit as a regular tourist and make a positive contribution to the world. World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF), for example, connects farmers and those who are looking to learn more about the industry. Hosts provide accommodation, food and opportunities to learn about organic lifestyles in exchange four to six hours of volunteer work per day. The organisation has a presence in more than 50 countries around the world, including Sierra Leone, Ecuador, Bangladesh, Estonia and Israel. Other examples include working at summer camps or planting trees. Teaching English in a foreign country will bring a regular paycheque and an opportunity to explore . Teach English abroad . It’s not uncommon for those who live in England, the US, Canada or Australia to hear about a friend or a friend of a friend travelling abroad to teach English. The usual destinations where English-language teachers are in demand include South Korea, China, Japan and Jordan. It will bring a regular pay cheque, but it’s not a holiday – with many expected to work full-time hours. But it will leave time to explore the city or country you are teaching in, and neighbouring nations. Successful applicants will need the appropriate credentials and they may have to sign a contract. Before applying they should do their research to make sure they are getting a job with a reputable school. One way to find teach jobs abroad is through the British Council, which runs a language assistant programme for those who have completed at least two years of university education. There are 10 different locations around the world where you can teach for between 12 and 20 hours a week and earn enough money to live. There is an application process and you must commit to a full year, but it is the perfect way to live in another country and still have plenty of time to explore your surroundings, while gaining some valuable life skills. Alternatively, there are many TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) courses that can be taken in the UK ahead of applying to teach abroad through different programmes. Ski resorts in breathtaking locations are always looking for instructors, servers and other employees . Get paid to hit the slopes . Ski resorts in breathtaking locations all over Europe and North America offer seasonal work for a variety of positions, including instructors, bartenders and cooks. Knowing how to ski isn’t a prerequisite, but it’s the perfect opportunity for those who are passionate about skiing or snowboarding, or keen to learn. Perks can include free ski passes, and some resorts are notorious for their parties. One way to stay in a foreign city for free is to arrange a work-to-stay arrangement with a hostel . Work in a hostel . One way to bag free accommodation while travelling around the world is working where you sleep. Travellers can find a work-to-stay arrangement at many hostels, which allows them to stay for free while meeting people from around the world, and may even include some pay. Hostels may require its work-to-stay employees to stay for a minimum amount of time before they move on. Adverts can easily be found online, with one for a hostel in Las Vegas requiring an employee who can work for two to three months over the summer. In addition to a bed the employee is provided breakfast, wifi, parking, coffee and tea, lockers, laundry and nightly activities, plus opportunities to explore the region. The tasks would include one or a mix of housekeeping, maintenance, IT, tour leading and front desk, according to the advert.","High costs are one of the reasons which keep travel plans grounded .

"Just days before she is due to wear a big white dress, Kim Sears has been making black her colour of choice. The bride-to-be was spotted cheering on her fiancé Andy Murray yesterday as he battled Novak Djokovic in the men's final at the Miami Open, in an outfit almost identical to two others she wore during the tournament. The 27-year-old wore a short black silk dress with a zip front and a large straw hat to keep her glowing complexion intact for her wedding on April 11. Scroll down for video . Kim Sears wore a somber expression as she saw her husband-to-be Andy Murray lose to Novak Djokovic in yesterday's Men's Final at the Miami Open Crandon Park Tennis Center in Key Biscayne, Florida . High-street loving Kim opted for one of her go-to brands, Whistles for the V-neck, short-sleeved dress, which comes in at £110. Kim accompanied her sophisticated dress with a sombre expression as she witnessed Djokovic beat Andy again, taking home his fifth Miami Open title in Key Biscayne, making her black outfit a fitting choice. However this was not the first time Kim had opted for the dark colour while topping up her wedding tan. On April 3 Kim watched Murray, 27, beat Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic in their semi-final match in a high necked black mini dress accompanied with her trusty Ray-ban glasses and straw hat. And on 31 March Kim showcased her golden glow and a glowing smile in an ASOS off-the-shoulder dress as she witnessed Andy Murray play against South African Kevin Anderson in their fourth round match. Despite yesterday's defeat Andy and Kim are sure to have their smiles back soon as the will tie the knot at Dunblane Cathedral on April 11 and not, as anticipated, in the tiny chapel at his Cromlix House Hotel, near the Perthshire town where he grew up. The 27-year-old opted for a black mini dress for the third time during the Men's Final of the Miami Open . Kim chose a zip front dress costing £110 from one of her high street favourites Whistles on April 5 . For the 27-year-old’s many fans and friends in the town, it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray’s uncle Niall Erskine said: ‘I’m sure it will be a popular decision, as he’s had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Hopefully Kim will cheer up soon as she is due to marry Andy Murray next week on April 11 . Andy Murray was defeated by long-term rival Novak Djokovic who took home his fifth Miami Open title . ‘Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane. I’m sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day.’ The cathedral’s minister, the Rev Colin Renwick, said: ‘I can’t confirm anything as we have a strict rule that we cannot discuss anyone’s wedding. ‘Wherever the wedding will be, there is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for Andy in Dunblane and a great deal of pride in him. I think people are genuinely very pleased for him.’ The couple announced their engagement in November after nine years together. Murray has said he may have three best men; his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. It is believed Miss Sears will have four bridesmaids. Kim opted for a very similar outfit on day nine of the Miami open pairing her favourite straw hat and sunglasses with an ASOS off-the-shoulder mini dress . And on April 3 Kim was seen in her favourite ensemble once more as she watched her husband-to-be defeat Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic in the semi-finals .","Kim Sears  watched Novak Djokovic defeat Andy Murray at the Miami Open .

"The remaining family members allegedly caught trying to sneak into Syria with the son of a Labour councillor have been arrested after being brought back to the UK from Turkey. Two women aged 47 and 22, and two men aged 24 and 22, were held at Manchester Airport in the early hours of this morning. They were among eight relatives stopped at the Turkish border with Syria on April 1 with university student Waheed Ahmed, the 21-year-old son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed. Arrested: Waheed Ahmed, the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor, has been held at Birmingham Airport after returning for allegedly trying to sneak into Syria with eight members of his family (pictured in Turkey) Held: The group arrested is understood to include Waheed's aunt, two of his male cousins, his cousin's wife and their children . Legal action: The four children on the trip aged one, three, eight and 11, have also been flown back to the UK . The group is understood to include Waheed's aunt, two of his male cousins, his cousin's wife and two of their children. The four children on the trip aged one, three, eight and 11, have also been flown back to the UK. Pictures emerged yesterday of Waheed Ahmed smirking on his way to the airport just hours before he was arrested by anti-terrorism police upon landing back in Britain. After being escorted off a Monarch Airlines flight which landed at 12.14am yesterday, Ahmed was held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism . Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed arriving back at his home yesterday but he refused to comment on his son's arrest . Late on Monday, a 30-year-old man from Rochdale – where Ahmed and the other eight detatined in Turkey all live – was arrested on suspicion of the same offence. One man who was on Ahmed’s flight said: ‘We landed and taxied to the terminal and then there was an announcement. ‘It said someone needed special assistance and we had to remain in our seats. ‘Then a plain-clothed policeman got on the plane and escorted someone off. ‘There were other police officers on the tarmac and they got into a car and drove off. It all happened very quickly. Other travellers said they saw a police van and car leaving the airport by a side exit shortly after the plane landed. Ahmed was filmed smiling through the window of a coach a fortnight ago after being detained by Turkish security forces near the Syrian border. Yesterday he again appeared relaxed as he was transported to Dalaman airport. His father Shakil Ahmed, a bakery delivery driver, is a councillor in Rochdale. Karen Danczuk, wife of Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, also represented the ward until her resignation in January. Earlier this month, Mr Ahmed told the Daily Mail he believed his son had been on holiday with other relatives when they were stopped. The territory on the Syrian side of the stretch of border that they were attempting to cross is controlled by the Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda. Greater Manchester Police and the North West Counter Terrorism Unit began an investigation after news of the arrests emerged. Five houses, including that of Ahmed’s father, have been searched as part of attempts to establish why the group apparently tried to enter Syria. Greater Manchester Police confirmed a 21-year-old man was arrested at Birmingham Airport early yesterday under the Terrorism Act. ‘A few hours earlier on Monday April 13, a 30-year-old man was arrested for the same offence in the Rochdale area. ‘Officers are working to ensure the safe return of eight other people to the UK.’ On the way home: The 21-year-old, sporting a shaved head, was filmed being escorted from a vehicle . Convoy: Ahmed was seen being moved by Turkish police on Sunday and then put on a Monarch-operated Flight from Dalaman which landed at Birmingham Airport at 12.14am today . The force has previously stated that all nine of those held in Turkey would be sent back to the UK ‘in due course’. Assistant Chief Constable Ian Wiggett has said that the primary concern was the ‘safety and welfare’ of the children, and efforts were being made to ensure a ‘full safeguarding strategy’ was in place upon their return.

Now, its Wisconsin heading to Monday's final to play Duke - their first final since 1941. But while the Badgers were still celebrating on the court Saturday night, violence broke out on the streets of UK's campus in Lexington where a huge crowd gathered to vent the loss. Scroll down for video . Upset: More than a thousand disappointed University of Kentucky fans gathered near the school's Lexington campus Saturday night, following the team's ousting from the NCAA tournament .

Please no: A Kentucky Wildcats fan reacts in the stands after being defeated by the Wisconsin Badgers during the NCAA Men's Final Four Semifinal in Indianapolis . The Wildcats close the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trending on Twitter: '38-and-Done.' And '38-and-1.' All easy pickins for the many detractors of John Calipari's group of 'One and Done' players, All-Americans and other future first-round and lottery picks. There are other programs with talent, though. Wisconsin has some future pros, and they came up big in the biggest game of their lives - a rematch of last year's semifinals where the Wildcats won 74-73. The Wildcats had the reputation as the team that never quits when things don't look so good - a la last week's win over Notre Dame - but Wisconsin came up clutch this time. Slam: Sam Dekker of the Wisconsin Badgers (left) drives to the basket in the second half against Aaron Harrison of the Kentucky Wildcats . Wisconsin Badgers forward Sam Dekker (left) and guard Traevon Jackson (right) jump in the air after the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Championship semi-final game against the Kentucky Wildcats at Lucas Oil Stadium . 'They did to us what we've been doing to other teams all season,' Calipari said. 'They executed down the stretch and we didn't.' Trailing by four and gasping for breath with their hands on their knees after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome. It started with a tough, twisting shot by a future NBAer, Sam Dekker (16 points), and kept going when Nigel Hayes tipped in an air ball after the shot clock had clearly turned to '0.' No violation was called, and in a game full of shaky officiating that left both coaches screaming, it generated momentum for the Badgers and left Kentucky flat. Aaron Harrisonof the Kentucky Wildcats (right) drives to the basket against Josh Gasser(left) of the Wisconsin Badgers in the second half during the NCAA Men's Final Four Semifinal . Tied at 60, Andrew Harrison missed on Kentucky's next possession. Then Dekker spotted up for a 3-pointer that gave Wisconsin the lead for good with 1:42 left.

'Best birthday present I've ever had,' Kaminsky said. Kentucky's last, best chance came while trailing by three with 12 seconds left. But Karl-Anthony Towns received the ball in the post and got fouled.

"A 'monster' pedophile, 70, who molested at least seven girls was sentenced to up to 50 years in prison on Thursday. Jackson County Chief Circuit Judge Thomas Wilson told 'monster' James Tingley of Michigan 'the only money we should waste on you is the cost of a bullet.' Wilson continued by saying he thinks locking Tingley up for the next 25 to 50 years in prison 'is worth every penny.' Scroll down for video . Molested seven chuldren: James Tingley watches during his sentencing of 25 to 50 years in prison on criminal sexual conduct charges on Thui . 'Children will be a lot safer. They won't have to go through the victimization that the victims went through here,' Wilson told Tingley. 'Mr. Tingley, basically you are a monster who has destroyed the innocence of numerous children.' Mlive reports that James Tingley was convicted on March 3 of heinous sex crimes against two girls over a six year period. His crimes span a period of 50 years. During Tingley's hearing, Assistant Prosecutor Jennifer Walker told the court that police know of at least five other girls Tingley abused but they believe there may be more. 'The defendant, he has called himself ""Jim"", He has called himself ""Uncle Jim"" but I would call him a monster and a pedophile,' Walker said. Repeat offender: James Tingley, pictured on Thursday in court,  sexually abused at least seven girls, investigators said . 'The defendant has stolen the souls, or parts of the souls, of these children. He's used them to meet all of his sexual needs. ... He's been violent with them, with others he's treated them as a girlfriend and he's wanted them to be his wife. ... It's disgusting,' walker added. Timgley's attorney Eric White told the court that Tingley still claims he is innocent. White added that Tingley's health is declining and that it's unlikely he'll live past his first parole date which is when he turns 96. Tingley did not wish to say anything to the court. Prosecutor Jerry Jarzynka said he thought Tingley received a fair sentence for his cruel actions. 'Certainly when it comes to cases of criminal sexual conduct with minors we appreciate the judge handing out a stiff sentence and ultimately we want to protect our kids,' Jarzynka said. Mlive reports that Tingley's perverted accomplice Randy Stevens, 45, was also convicted of sexual misconduct by a separate jury for 'allowing Tingley to carry out a number of sexual assaults.' This is not the first time Stevens has been accused of aiding in child abuse. Stevens, a father of 14,  pleaded guilty to second-degree child abuse and a judge sentenced him six to 10 years in prison last year. Mlive reports that last year's conviction was related to Stevens letting his children visit another sex offender, Geoffrey Friant, who is now serving 30 to 80 years behind bars. Stevens will be sentenced on April 16.

"The collapse of yesterday's Old Bailey trial will raise question marks about the judgment of the Labour darling who took a central role in the disastrous and misguided prosecutions of journalists. Keir Starmer, who ran the Crown Prosecution Service for five years, was in charge when Operation Elveden began its tainted 'witch hunt' into tabloid journalists. Starting with dawn raids on suspects' homes, mass arrests and long periods of bail, it ended in not guilty verdicts – and will now prompt a fresh examination of the tenure of the most controversial DPP of modern times. Central role: Former Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer was in charge of Operation Elveden . Most controversially, he pushed the use of an almost unheard of 13th century law – misconduct in public office – to go after journalists for what amounted to them simply doing their jobs of informing the public. Despite the best efforts of prosecutors and millions of pounds of public money, juries have almost universally refused to convict, and after four more reporters were cleared yesterday and all but a handful of cases withdrawn, Elveden was left in ruins. Already a KCB and a QC, in a few weeks' time Sir Keir Starmer is likely to add MP to his lengthy list of titles and be returned for the safe Labour seat of Holborn and St Pancras in north London. It will feel like a natural step for the son of 'Guardian-reading' parents who named him after the founder of the Labour Party, Keir Hardie. Current Director of Public Prosecutions boss Alison Saunders (pictured) The 2001 'human rights lawyer of the year' is so admired by Labour it reportedly delayed candidate selection in the north London seat so he could rack up enough time as a party member to get on the list. With previous DPPs, it was a largely behind closed doors role. But under Starmer it was far more public. Rather than shunning the limelight, he relished it. Some weeks it even appeared he was holding court with the media more often than Cabinet ministers. All pretence of political impartiality went out the window, and he repeatedly picked fights with the Tories, most notably on human rights and the law allowing homeowners to defend their property against intruders. In one clash in 2009 a BBC interviewer questioned his impartiality, pointing out his political background and role in a 'Socialist Alternatives' magazine. He also angered the Tories when he said plans to scrap the Human Rights Act would 'shame' Britain. He also re-wrote the law on assisted suicide – quickly dubbed 'Starmer's Law' – setting out circumstances in which those who help others kill themselves can expect to escape prosecution.

"Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme . The controller of BBC Radio 3 has branded audiences ignorant and claims broadcasting classical music has become more challenging as a result. Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago – not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.' The station has been accused of 'dumbing down' in the past, especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more 'accessible' to a broader audience. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright (above) dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down . With just two million listeners, Radio 3 is the least listened-to of the BBC's main stations. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down and said there were distinct differences between the stations. He said: 'I just don't recognise it at all. Apparently we do phone-ins? We don't. 'We haven't had a request show for a long, long time. You do hear one listener voice on the breakfast show suggesting a piece of music — that's not exactly a phone-in. So it's complete nonsense.'","Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job .

"Shocking police dashcam footage has emerged showing an Arizona cop speeding down a road, mounting a sidewalk and smashing into an  alleged armed robber in a supposed bid to capture him. In the two videos, Mario Valencia is captured walking along a street in Marana,  northwest of Tucson, carrying what appears to be a rifle. He points the loaded weapon into the air and a shot rings out. A police officer in one of the patrol cars says: 'One round just went out. He's definitely loaded.' He then tells his colleague, Officer Michael Rapiejko, in the other vehicle: 'Stand off, the gun is loaded.' But apparently ignoring his advice, Rapiejko overtakes the officer's car, before speeding straight toward Valencia. Seconds later, his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect's body. WARNING: GRAPHIC FOOTAGE . Scroll down for videos . Overtaking: This police dashcam video shows Arizona officer Michael Rapiejko overtaking his colleague's vehicle as they chase alleged thief Mario Valencia (hidden by the other car) in Marana, northwest of Tucson . Target: The police officer in the other vehicle warns  Rapiejko that the suspect is loaded and tells him to 'stand off'. But in apparent defiance of his advice, Rapiejo drives straight toward unsuspecting Valencia (pictured) Horrific: Seconds later, Rapiejo's vehicle mounts the curb (pictured) and smashes into the suspect's body . Hit: In this screen grab, from the dashcam video, Valenica appears to turn toward the car as it strikes him . Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris. The other officer can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down.' At the end of the footage, obtained by CBS affiliate KOLD-TV,  Rapiejko is captured emerging from his vehicle and approaching Valencia, while other cops exit their own cars with their guns raised. Valencia was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility on February 19. He was eventually booked into jail two days later. The release of the dashcam videos comes as police across America remain under scrutiny for allegedly racially profiling African-American suspects and using excessive violence against them. Only a week and a half ago, South Carolina police officer Michael Slager was charged with murder after he allegedly fatally shot Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away . Despite Valencia's injuries and the harrowing footage of the crash, Marana Police Chief Terry Rozema has defended Rapiejko's actions, declaring they likely saved the armed suspect's life. Smash: Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall (pictured) before coming to a halt amid debris. The other cop can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down' High-speed: Bits of concrete can be seen sailing through the sky as Rapiejko's patrol car continues traveling . Cracked: Valencia, was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in a serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility on February 19. Above, Rapiejko's car window appears to be cracked . Deliberate act: Valencia (pictured, left, in his mug shot) remained in hospital for two days before being booked into jail. Police have since spoken out in defense of Rapiejko's actions in the town of Marana, Arizona . In February, Sergeant Chris Warren also appeared to support the deliberate crash, telling KOLD-TV that Valencia 'was a dangerous felon who'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning'. This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at Columbus Avenue and 29th Street, vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple, a home invasion and theft of a car. It culminated in the alleged theft of a rifle from Walmart at 8280 North Cortaro Road. From there, the suspect fled to 5650 West Coca Cola Place, where he was struck and injured by Rapiejko's vehicle. 'He'd just stolen a weapon, loaded it, was not obeying commands from officers and walking toward occupied businesses .It's a busy time of morning, a lot of employees at work,' said Sgt Warren. Another view: Despite the shocking footage of the crash, Marana Police Chief Terry Rozema has defended Officer Rapiejko's actions. Above, this dashcam video was taken from inside the other officer's car . Swerving: The second video shows Rapiejko's car swerving across the road and heading toward Valencia . Life-saving? The vehicle smashes into the suspect (the black shape in the air, between the tree and the car) Apprehended: At the end of the footage, obtained by CBS affiliate KOLD-TV, Rapiejko can be seen emerging from his vehicle and approaching Valencia (under the tree), while other cops emerge with their guns raised . 'We had to take immediate action and make sure he didn't get inside those businesses.' Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash, because it was considered use of force. However, the Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing and he is back on the force, Sgt Warren said. Valencia, meanwhile, is facing several felony charges for his 'spree'. Valencia had already been approached by police near a post office following the alleged Walmart theft, it is reported. There, he had apparently threatened suicide, before firing the gun and fleeing. No one was injured in the post office incident. Also on Tuesday, dozens of protesters were taking to the streets of New York to continue demonstrations over alleged police brutality against minorities. Controversy: The release of the dashcam videos comes as police across America remain under scrutiny for allegedly racially profiling African-American suspects.

"Authorities in Texas have banned a seemingly-innocent personalized number plate after three years attached to a swish Lamborghini.

"A polo club in Berkshire that launched with Prince Charles as its first member has lost a legal battle with a Hollywood fashion firm in a bid to launch its own range of accessories. The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club has quickly become one of Britain's most elite sporting venues since The Prince of Wales joined when it was founded in 1982. It's attracted royals and celebrities including Prince William and Harry, actress Stephanie Powers and Rolling Stone Bill Wyman. But attempts to cash in on this elite status by launching a brand of fashion and polo-related goods have been scuppered by the European Court after objections fromthe Beverly Hills Polo Club. Prince Charles, right and Actress Stefanie Powers are among those to have frequented the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club since it was founded in 1982. Charles was the first member of the club . Bill Wyman, bass guitarist for The Rolling Stones at the club with a friend in 1987 . The ruling will be all the more frustrating for bosses at the Berkshire club, given that its rival isn't even a real polo club and openly admits to using the sport to create the perception of eliteness. The Berkshire club had applied to register its polo player logo on four classes of item including glasses, watches, jewellery and leather goods including travel bags, whips, harnesses and saddlery. But it was opposed by the Beverly Hills brand on the grounds that people could confuse the logo with their own and the case was eventually taken to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. While it allowed the logo on whips, harnesses and saddlery, which discerning customers were unlikely to get confused, it ruled against the Berkshire club on applications for the other items. It said: 'It is true that the polo player is facing left and holding his mallet upright, while the earlier marks the polo player is facing right and holding his mallet ready to strike the ball. 'However, those slight differences are not sufficient enough to reduce significantly the similarity deriving from the fact that both the signs at issue display the figure of a polo player astride a galloping horse,' The Times reports. In 2006, the club was also blocked from using its logo on perfume and soap after a challenge from Ralph Lauren, famous for its Polo brand, also featuring a polo player, swinging a mallet. Too similar: Logo for the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club . The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club was founded in 1985 by music mogul Bryan Morrison, who made a fortune working with stars including Wham, Pink Ffloyd, Elton John and Robin Gibb from The Beegees. After Prince Charles became its first member, it quickly gained an international reputation and attracted stars from the music, fashion and film industries. It also became a favourite with the royals, with the late Major Ronald Furguson, father of Sarah, Duchess of York, being employed as the sponsorship manager. Founder Morrison died in 2008, having spent two years in a coma after being thrown from his pony at the club. His son, Jamie, is an England polo player and is now involved in the commercial side of the club. The Beverly Hill Polo Club was also founded in 1982 and claims that seventy percent of potential customers surveyed in the US believe that the label's name is a real polo club.

Now internationally known, it boasts: 'The brand captures the excitement of the sport of polo along with the exclusivity of membership in a private club. 'With its highly aspirational iconic logo, the brand was immediately successful in the USA and rapidly emerged as a global brand.' Founded in 1982, it was originally the site of the Windsor Forest Stud, a racing yard that fielded horses for Royal Ascot throughout the 20th century. It’s signature race rail and gallops can still be seen today . Bryan Morrison bought it as a rundown estate in 1985, vowing to convert it into a premier polo club, but it was a monumental task for him and his team to undertake . After a rapid and total transformation, Prince Charles became the first member, attracting international interest. The first chukkas were played in 1986 . Since then, Hollywood stars and rock'n'roll legends have frequented the club. Bill Wyman from the Rolling Stones, Sarah Furguson, Duchess of York, and Jodie Kidd .

"Nigel Farage caused controversy at the televised leaders’ debate by attacking the high cost of giving anti-retroviral drugs to sufferers not born in Britain . Half of voters agree with Ukip that immigrants should not immediately receive free HIV treatment, a poll suggests. Nigel Farage caused controversy at the televised leaders’ debate last week by attacking the high cost of giving anti-retroviral drugs to sufferers not born in Britain. Ed Miliband said his comments were ‘disgusting’, Nick Clegg said they were ‘politics of the lowest form’ and chancellor George Osborne, when asked, said he was ‘not going to dignify that with a response.’ The Ukip leader insisted afterwards that he had the ‘overwhelming support’ of the British public for saying that foreign nationals with HIV – whom he said accounted for 60 per cent of the 7,000 cases a year – ‘can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per patient’. He added: ‘I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.’ A YouGov poll of 1,906 adults found that 50 per cent would support ‘people coming to live in the UK being banned from receiving treatment on the NHS for a period of five years’. Another 34 per cent opposed such a ban. A second question saw voters asked which statement best reflected their view. In this, 52 per cent thought Mr Farage was ‘right to raise this issue - immigrants with serious conditions like HIV are costing the health service a large amount of money’. This compared with 37 per cent who picked: ‘Nigel Farage was just scaremongering - compared to the total cost of the NHS this is a drop in the ocean’, and 11 per cent did not know. Interestingly, the respondents did not appear to particularly favour Ukip, saying on average that Mr Farage was only the fourth best-performing leader last Thursday, with Nicola Sturgeon in the lead, followed by David Cameron and Ed Miliband. It later emerged that Mr Farage’s figures were a bit out – there are 6,000 diagnoses of HIV every year according to Public Health England. Diane James, an MEP and the party’s justice and home affairs spokesman, insisted yesterday that Ukip would go on if Farage lost . Just over half (54 per cent) are foreign born, but most of them are thought to have been infected whilst living in the UK. The cost of anti-retroviral drugs per year gas been put at up to £16,000 depending on the stage of infection. The Ukip leader, speaking on the campaign trail yesterday defended his remarks saying he wanted people to ‘think and understand why their grandmother who is 85 finds it very difficult to get drugs for breast cancer but anybody can get on a plane from anywhere in the world, be HIV tested in London and receive antiretroviral drugs. Something, it seems to me, isn’t right here.’ Any foreign national - even a failed asylum seeker – who is diagnosed, has been entitled to free treatment since 2012 due to what experts say are the risks of allowing the virus to spread. A Ukip spokesman said: ‘This poll finding shows yet again the disconnect that exists between the Westminster bubble and much of the population. 'Nigel Farage is the one leader who has the political courage to raise difficult issues and clearly millions of voters agree with that stance.’ It later emerged that Mr Farage’s figures were a bit out – there are 6,000 diagnoses of HIV every year according to Public Health England . Mr Farage took a blow yesterday as another poll showed he would fail to secure a Parliamentary seat. He has vowed to stand down as leader if he fails to become the MP for Thanet South, which he is fighting hard to win at the General Election. A private ComRes poll paid for by a Ukip donor put the Conservatives on course to retain the seat by a small margin. But Diane James, an MEP and the party’s justice and home affairs spokesman, insisted yesterday that Ukip would go on if he lost, and that future leaders of the Eurosceptic party were waiting to ‘put their hats in the ring’. Patrick O’Flynn, Ukip’s economics spokesman, said in an interview on Sky News yesterday that Ukip were not seeking to withdraw treatment from HIV positive foreign nationals already receiving drugs from the NHS.","Nigel Farage caused controversy at the televised leaders' debate last week .

"Ever decided against an outfit because you've already been tagged in it on Facebook? You're not alone. Britons apparently spend £815million a year to ‘social media proof’ their wardrobe, with men forking out more than women, according to a new study. The research into the rise of the 'insta-wardrobe', which polled 2,000 adults, revealed  nearly one third buy new clothes just to avoid being multi-tagged in the same outfit. Brits spend £815m a year to 'social media proof' their wardrobe, according to a new survey . Almost a fifth said that they would refuse to wear an outfit again if they knew there was a chance of appearing wearing the same thing online, the study showed. And, in a surprising result, men appeared to be the most social-conscious gender, spending an average of £61 to safe-guard against this modern day anxiety, as opposed to women’s £53.50. As social media has made fashion and style more accessible than ever, it drives how we shop and what we wear. Facebook recorded 1.39 billion users at the end of 2014, with Instagram growing to over 300 million users with over 70 million photos and videos being shared every day. Almost a fifth of those polled said that they would refuse to wear an outfit again if they knew there was a chance of appearing in the same outfit online (stock image) Fashion industry commentator Lily Melrose says she is constantly inspired to try new styles by other bloggers on social media . The average adult has 338 Facebook friends, meaning their style selfies are being reviewed and commented on by hundreds of people with each upload. Indeed, one in four of those surveyed by TK Maxx said that gaining comments and likes on their outfits on social media inspires them to try new styles. And sources of style inspiration are also changing; 11 per cent of those polled credited bloggers as more inspirational than fashion designers, with fashion news often breaking exclusively via Facebook and Twitter. Bloggers are now gracing the cover of Vogue and fashion designers are live streaming their shows. Lily Melrose, fashion blogger and industry commentator, commented: 'Instagrammers and bloggers are undoubtedly the new tastemakers of obtainable and relatable style. 'Social media has totally changed the face of fashion today and the way we shop. 'The beauty of social sharing sites is that you can be inspired by such a wide range of people, from your friends, bloggers, celebrities and family. 'On social media there is something for everyone as unique and individual looks are celebrated and shared. 'I can’t count the times I’ve been inspired by another blogger or someone on my Instagram page to try something new and I love sharing my looks with my readers.' Deborah Dolce, Group Brand & Marketing Director at TK Maxx said: 'Social media is moving people toward a wide range of fashion ideals and style icons. 'While celebrity culture is still strong, we now look to a much broader base of people for inspiration from our friends to bloggers to online style trailblazers. Social media platforms enable us to express ourselves freely and showcase our personal style.'","Brits spend £815 million a year to 'social media proof' their wardrobe .

According to local TV station WPVI, Collins went to visit McNamee in hospital the day after the rescue. Heave: Other commuters can be seen to the left pulling McNamee to safety . Hero's return: Collins was pulled from the dangerous tracks - which have an electrified third rail - just after McNamee . The incident took place around 6:30pm on Wednesday - at which time schedules for the Market-Frankford line say a train arrives around every eight minutes. Speaking to WPVI, Collins said: 'I just saw him and jumped down... just instincts'. He also insisted that he's 'not a hero'. Collins hurt his leg during the rescue, but it was only a minor wound. Septa officials commended Collins's bravery, but said that others shouldn't copy him. The best thing to do instead, a rail service spokesman said, is to alert the station's cashier, who will be able to stop any incoming trains and dispatch a rescuer.","Charles Collins, 28, saved elderly Alfred McNamee after he fell onto tracks .

"A runner up of Brazil's Miss BumBum competition has branded the contest's winner 'an attention-seeking sl*t' after she posted a photograph of her naked body painted with an image of the Virgin Mary for Easter. Claudia Alende, 21, who came second in last year's beauty pageant, launched a scathing attack on current title-holder Indianara Carvalho, claiming the model had 'revealed  who she truly is'. Miss Carvalho, 23, posted the racy picture to her Instagram account on Good Friday - the day the country's 130million Catholics solemnly remembered the crucifixion and death of Christ. Scroll down for video . Racy: Indianara Carvalho posted the picture of her naked body painted with an image of the Virgin Mary on Good Friday . Slammed: Claudia Alende, who came second in the competition, launched a scathing attack on Miss Carvalho . The image, one of a series of nude shots she shared over the Easter weekend, was accompanied with a prayer which including the words: 'Good Friday. Lord, on this day I ask for peace, love, wisdom and strength'. But the paintings - created by Brazilian spray-paint artist Binho over 10 hours - prompted a tirade of disapproval from her followers, many of whom accused the Miss BumBum winner of disrespect and religious sacrilege. Ms Alende, the competition's vice champion,  better known as the Brazilian 'Megan Fox', today waded into the furore, claiming she had been left 'shocked and ashamed' by her rival's risqué Easter stunt. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Ms Alende, a Catholic, claimed she had also been asked to do the photoshoot but refused 'out of respect for God and for my family'. She said: 'It was a ridiculous thing to do, I actually feel ashamed for her.' Claudia Alende, 21, who came second in last year's beauty pageant, is known as the Brazilian Megan Fox . Ms Alende, better known as the Brazilian 'Megan Fox', claims she had been left 'shocked and ashamed' by her rival's risqué Easter stunt . Ms Alende said: 'I've always known that the woman is an attention-seeking sl*t, and now she's revealing to everyone else who she truly is' 'Our Lady is a holy figure, and for many the most important figure in their lives,' she added. 'To paint her across your naked body, especially on Good Friday, shows a breathtaking lack of respect and judgement. 'Like most other people, I was shocked when I saw the photos. I was actually embarrassed for her, even though she has no shame herself. 'I think in her head she doesn't care if it makes people talk well or talk badly of her. She just wants people to talk about her. She thinks that any kind of publicity is a good thing. 'I've always known that the woman is an attention-seeking sl*t, and now she's revealing to everyone else who she truly is.' Brazilian beauty: Ms Alende claims Miss Carvalho has 'revealed who she truly is' by posting the naked shots . Ms Alende believes the publicity stunt is already backfiring - and called on Brazilians to boycott her rival . The Miss BumBum runner-up told MailOnline 'It was a ridiculous thing to do, I actually feel ashamed for her' Ms Alende said the current Miss BumBum - who had hymen surgery last year to 'restore' her virginity so she could enjoy her first time again with 'someone special' - never deserved to win the coveted title last November. She said: 'I honestly have no idea how she won. She is too muscly, it means her body is ugly, she certainly doesn't represent the Brazilian woman.' And she believes the publicity stunt is already backfiring - and called on Brazilians to boycott her. 'She has made people see her in a negative way, so many are losing respect for her and interest in her too,' Ms Alende added. 'She is losing her credibility, and will lose work too. 'I think anyone who was shocked by her lack of respect for Christianity and the Virgin Mary should boycott her, including magazines and companies that might have used her image on their pages or to sell their products.'

Following the publication of the photos at the weekend, many of Miss Carvalho's Instagram followers expressed their outrage. 'Don’t mix God with your ridiculous shame and profanity,' wrote one Instagram user, Eliane Paz Salinas. Another, Cadmo Barrera Lerma ranted: 'You have lost my total respect, at least one in your list of followers.' Janvier Veliz Angulo added: 'This proves that beauty is not everything… you have lost me as one of your fans.' Referring to Miss Carvalho's accompanying prayer, another user fumed: 'I think that to ask for peace and love and protection there is no need to be naked!!!! Please respect things related to God!' Happy Easter: This was another of the raunchy photographs posted on social media by the Miss BumBum winner . Miss Carvalho's lengthy prayer also stated: 'Father, protect my ears from all evils and watch my steps on the path to truth'' The 2014 contest was marred by scandal after it was alleged that Miss Carvalho had bribed the judges with over £70,000 in cash to make sure she won . Christianity is the dominant religion in Brazil, with Roman Catholics accounting for 64 per cent of the population and Protestants making up 22 per cent, according to the latest Census.

"It could be a scene from Crocodile Dundee - although in lieu of the iconic croc-tooth cowboy hat there's a baseball cap instead. Gary Saurage, 45, who runs the Gator Country wildlife park in Beaumont, Texas, was called out on Monday morning to catch a giant 400lb, 11ft-long alligator from a family's backyard pond. A photograph of the capture - later posted to Facebook - shows Saurage approaching the giant reptile with his bare hands stretched forwards.

Action shot: Gary Saurage, 45, who runs the Gator Country wildlife park in Beaumont, Texas, was called out on Monday morning to catch a giant 400lb, 11ft-long alligator from a family's backyard pond . Saurage later reported that the gator was safely hauled out of the pond, although it took a bit of work as it was being particularly 'aggressive'. Art Williams, of Groves, was the one who spotted the gator in his garden over Easter weekend. 'My wife and I are just going for a walk, with our new dog, and there's that 11 foot alligator just about 12 feet from us,' Williams told KBMT News. Williams said he's used to alligators being in the area, which is why he built a fence to keep them away from the pond where his grandchildren canoe. But he said this gator was no match for him or his DIY barrier. All hands on deck: Saurage later reported that the gator was safely hauled out of the pond, although it took a bit of work as it was being particularly 'aggressive' Williams called on the help of Saurage  to remove the massive animal, for everyone's safety. The beast was later confirmed as a male, around 35 to 40 years old. Saurage took the reptile back to his park to join more than 400 other alligators. He says there's no reason for people to fear the toothy lizards, as long as they keep a safe distance and never attempt to feed them. He points out that alligators can run 22 miles per hour on land and 'you can't run that fast.' Although it was big, Monday's catch wasn't Saurage's biggest. The largest creature at Gator Country, nicknamed Kong, measures 12 foot and six inches.","Gary Saurage, 45, who runs the Gator Country wildlife park in Beaumont, Texas, was called out on Monday morning to catch a giant 400lb, 11ft-long alligator from a family's backyard pond .

"A New York dental clinic manager has been arrested on charges she posed as an actual dentist and even pulled patients' teeth. Valbona Yzeiraj was arrested on Thursday and pleaded not guilty to charges of assault, unauthorized practice of a profession and reckless endangerment. Authorities said the 45-year-old woman, from White Plains, did injections in people's mouths, performed root canals and on several occasions pulled patients' teeth. Valbona Yzeiraj was arrested on Thursday (pictured right) and pleaded not guilty to charges of assault after she illegally posed as dentist 'Dr Val' and pulled patients' teeth out at a practice in Riverdale, New York . According to CBS, she called herself 'Dr Val', putting on a lab coat when her boss, Dr Jeffrey Schoengold, wasn't present and doing dental work on unsuspecting patients. Dr Schoengold became suspicious when at least four people complained over work he had not done. One patient suffered an infection from a botched root canal and another patient was left with pain two years on from a procedure, CBS reported. Prosecutors said she was fired from Ultimate Dental Care of Riverdale after the company found out she was performing as a dentist from late 2012 to summer 2013. It is then alleged that she tried to steal from the practice. The company hasn't returned a message left seeking comment. Yzeiraj's attorney didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Bail has been set at $20,000 bond and the 45-year-old was due back in court on May 28. She claimed to have dental training in her native Albania but authorities said she had no license in the U.S. Yzeiraj was fired from Ultimate Dental Care of Riverdale, New York (pictured) after the company found out she was illegally performing as a dentist from late 2012 to summer 2013 .","Valbona Yzeiraj, of White Plains, New York, was arrested on Thursday and pleaded not guilty to charges of assault .

"Two Delaware boys are in a coma and their father remains unable to move or talk two weeks after the family became sick from possible pesticide exposure during a vacation on the US Virgin Islands, officials say. Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay at the Sirenusa Condominium Resort on the  island of St. John. The family were airlifted to separate hospitals in Philadelphia suffering major respiratory trauma. Sean, 16, and Ryan, 14, were  in critical condition. Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay at the Sirenusa Condominium Resort on the island of St. John . James Maron, the family's lawyer, said the boys were in 'rough shape'. 'The family are all fighters,' he told WPBF News. 'They're fighting for everything right now. I understand it's a long recovery.' Maron said Esmond, who is an administrator of the private Tatnall School in Wilmington, is conscious but unable to move. Devine, a dentist, was treated and released from the hospital and is currently in occupational therapy. The Tatnall school, where Sean was a star lacrosse player, posted on their Facebook page that they had the Middle School students write get wall cards for Esmond and his family. 'The entire Tatnall community continues to direct its supportive energy toward the Esmonds and asks that everyone keep the family in their thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.' Tuition at the Tatnall school can range from $20,000 to $25,000 a year. Sean, 16, (pictured) and his 14-year-old brother Ryan remain in comas two weeks after being hospitalized . On Friday a spokesman from the US Environmental Protection agency said that the family may have fallen ill because of the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa. Elias Rodriguez said preliminary tests showed there was 'a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying'. Methyl Bromide, which is odorless, can be fatal or cause serious damage to the central nervous system and respiratory system, according to the EPA. It is acutely toxic, and only permitted to be used outdoors by certified professionals in the US. Rodriguez said the investigation is 'ongoing' and the agency is still on the island for testing. The family was staying at the $875-a-night  Sirenusa Condominium Resort on St. John in the US Virgin Islands . 'We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling,' he said. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa Condominium Resort, said the unit where the family was staying was not treated with a pesticide, but rather the unit immediately below their suite. Maron said when paramedics arrived at the villa Esmond was found unconscious. His sons and wife were having seizures. The US Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter .

"It's well known that exercise can make your muscles bigger. Now, a study has found it may make your brain larger, too. Physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain, increasing the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination, according to Health Day news. The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video . Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found . It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes . The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria - structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's.","Study: Exercising increases the amount of grey matter in the brain .

"Wedding season is fast upon us, but with the average cost of the big day hitting £25,000, thrifty brides are on the hunt for ways to budget. But how do you create a stunning wedding venue without breaking the bank, or wow your guests with a gourmet meal sans the staggering price tag? From scrimping on bar costs to avoiding hefty food bills, FEMAIL has compiled the best budgeting tips for brides-to-be. Scroll down for video . Wedding season is upon us and for brides on a budget, there's plenty of ways to save thousands of pounds on your special day . 1. GO BIG: Rather than having lots of smaller tables, seat your guests on larger tables. Not only will they get to know more people, you'll save money by having to purchases fewer centerpieces and tablecloths. 2. SAVVY SHOPPING: When seeking decor, shop out of season. Black vases will be on sale after Halloween, red and gold after Christmas and pink after Valentine's Day. Also, money saving sites such as Groupon actually offer entire wedding day packages occasionally. 3. CUT ON BAR COSTS: Not only will an open bar end up in a rather messy evening, it will also leave a dent in your bank account. Instead of letting guests order expensive shots and spirits, offer beer, wine and a signature cocktail - that way, there's something for everyone without unnecessary drinking and spending. 4. CALL ON YOUR FRIENDS: Rather than source expensive florists and stationery experts, reach out to your most talented friends. Among your and your groom's wider circle of friends, there is bound to be someone who has beautiful handwriting and someone who is green-fingered. When seeking decor, shop out of season. Black vases will be on sale after Halloween, red and gold after Christmas and pink after Valentine's Day and don't be afraid to search sites like Etsy and even eBay . 5. DO HIRE A PLANNER: Most people steer clear of wedding planners to save on extra costs but, whilst it may seem counter-intuitive to pay for help, wedding planners have a good network of suppliers, know how much they should be paying for something and aren't afraid of bargaining. 6. SHOP THE SUPERMARKET: You may have your heart set on those iconic Vera Wang bridesmaid dresses but George at Asda is hoping to help brides on a budget - by launching a wedding collection for bridesmaids and pageboys starting from just £7. Dubbed 'the most affordable range anywhere on the high street', the supermarket claim that it's half the price of rivals such as Debenhams and Next and is a 'saviour for cash-strapped brides-to-be'.

Sure to get your guests in the party spirit, all you need to get the party started is a computer, microphone and a projector with a screen. 8. GO ONLINE: If the costs of invitations and postage are something you aren't willing to splurge on, create your own website and share all the details of your big day online. Rather than hiring an expensive make-up artist, call on the students at your local college to do your bridal beauty . 9. GO TO THE GROWER: When sourcing beautiful flowers, cut out the middleman by calling on a grower. Farmers and the Soil Association may well be able to help you source your foliage for dirt cheap. 10. USE A TRAINEE: If you have your heart set on having your make-up done professionally, rather than hiring an artist, call on the students at your local college. 11. SAMPLE SIZE: If you're doing your make-up yourself, visit a make-up counter for tips and only buy only the items you'll definitely use again. For the things you'll only use on the day, scoop up the samples. 12. SOMETHING BORROWED: Rather than splashing the cash on expensive accessories and jewellery, borrow a few items from the women you love. Grandmother's bracelet, your mother's ring and your best friend's earrings will imbue the big day with even greater meaning. 13. GO SUPERSIZE: If you're not keen on the idea of a three-course meal, serve a family-style buffet on each table. Huge pasta dishes, massive salads and big rice bowls will not only cut costs but also serve as an icebreaker and act as a centerpiece. 14. ASK YOUR GUESTS TO STAND: Consider a standing ceremony if you're tying the knot outside to save on renting chairs. Plus, it will cut down the time of the wedding and thus cost. 15.  SKIP THE BREAD BASKET: What sounds like such a simple tip will actually bring the cost down a lot. No bread means less cutlery, butter and expenditure.","FEMAIL has compiled the best budgeting tips for brides-to-be .

"A comfy chalet and snow-covered pistes make for a good skiing holiday for most people. But some like to add a few extra luxury touches to their trips to perfect them - such as a live-in tailor to make the ski gear, two grand pianos flown in for entertainment and a horse and carriage on stand-by 24 hours a day. These are just some of the requests made by guests staying with high-end ski-tour company Haute Montagne. And they were all fulfilled, the firm told MailOnline. Luxury ski company Bramble Ski created a private ice bar for guests at one of its chalets in Verbier (stock image) The live-in tailor was demanded to make all the ski and apres ski outfits to a group of guests’ personal tastes and cost £1,700 to hire. It cost £3,700 for the grand pianos to be delivered - but the guests were keen on their trip being noteworthy so didn't mind splashing out. The horse and carriage wasn’t cheap either – that drained the customer’s account of £20,000. It was on standby for two weeks at a cost of £1400 per day. Another Haute Montagne guest asked for six helicopters to be requisitioned so that a long taxi transfer could be avoided. A Chinook - normally used by the military - was specifically asked for, but the guest was informed that they aren't available for hire. The type eventually delivered cost £85,000. Haute Montagne’s slightly less luxurious sister company Bramble Ski has also met some pricey – and very exacting - guest requirements. It created a private ice bar for après cocktails in the grounds of one of its chalets in Verbier, Switzerland, sourced bigger blueberries for someone who wasn’t happy about the size of the blueberries being served and created a £2,450 lily-of-the-valley bouquet for a romantic guest. Bloomin' expensive: One Bramble Ski customer requested a bouquet of lily of the valley flowers that had to be larger than the one Kate Middleton held on her wedding day. It cost over £2000 . The guest specifically asked that it was to be larger than the one Kate Middleton held on her wedding day. A romantic Russian guest, meanwhile, wanted Bramble Ski to create a Valentine’s gesture for his wife, so the company, at a cost of £7,000, distributed a trail of rose petals from his master suite to the pool, which was decorated with floating lilies and roses. And their guests like to dress to impress. One set of male guests requested larger versions of Bramble Ski’s Heidi-style pinafore uniforms for a party – at a cost of £700 each.","Horse and carriage drained the customer’s account of £20,000 .

"Jeremy Clarkson is set to appear on the BBC again just weeks after he was sacked from Top Gear for punching a producer. The TV host will appear as a guest presenter on satirical panel show Have I Got News For You later this month. It is believed he was booked to appear on the comedy programme before he was dropped from Top Gear after a 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon, one of the show's producers, over a steak dinner. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson hosting a previous edition of Have I Got News For You. He is set to appear on the BBC show on April 25, just one month after being sacked from Top Gear . Clarkson was dropped from the motoring show by the BBC on March 25, but will be the guest presenter on Have I Got News For You on April 25, with filming taking place the day before. It is understood that bosses at the corporation took weeks to consider if he should be allowed to host the show before deciding saying although his Top Gear contract was not renewed, he isn't banned from appearing on the BBC. Clarkson is one of the quiz show's most frequent guest hosts, having fronted it on 11 occasions and also appearing as a panellist once alongside quiz captains Paul Merton and Ian Hislop. Last month, Jimmy Mulville from production company Hat Trick, which makes Have I Got News For You, confirmed that the former Top Gear host would appear on the show, calling him a 'fantastic broadcaster'. Clarkson was sacked from Top Gear after punching producer Oisin Tymon, pictured, after a row over a steak dinner . He told a meeting of the Broadcasting Press Guild: 'As far as I'm concerned he is hosting Have I Got News For You, the BBC has not told me what to do yet and it will be an interesting conversation. He also joked: 'Maybe we will get the producer on so he can hit Jeremy Clarkson live on television.' The show will also mark the first time that Clarkson has appeared on the BBC since the last edition of Top Gear was screened on March 8. Yesterday, it was revealed that the 54-year-old would not face prosecution over the attack, which led to his sacking from the show. Police had opened an investigation into the incident, which took place at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire last month after Clarkson had been filming Top Gear in the area. However, after the victim Mr Tymon said that he did not want to press charges, North Yorkshire Police has now decided to drop the probe without taking action against Clarkson. The incident, described as a 'fracas' by BBC officials, occurred when Clarkson discovered that the hotel where he was staying could not serve him a hot meal following a day's filming. An official report found that the 54-year-old presenter punched Mr Tymon in the mouth before being dragged away by a witness, causing the producer to go to A&E for emergency treatment. He also verbally abused him for 20 minutes, blaming Mr Tymon for failing to ensure that he could get a steak at the hotel. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to return and continue in some form, but co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond are not expected to return . It is not yet known what Mr Clarkson's next move will be although he has been linked with a switch to another channel. With the decision not to press charges against him, the TV presenter is now free to chase new deals, which could possibly see him travel abroad to the US, where he would have faced difficulty gaining a visa if he had been convicted. However, he is set to take part in a series of Top Gear Live shows alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, although the performances will be rebranded. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to continue in some form, but Mr Hammond and Mr May are not expected to return. The star had received widespread public support - including from his friend Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the fracas, and one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him. But BBC director-general Tony Hall said 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Police are still investigating threats to kill Mr Hall, reportedly linked to his decision to axe Clarkson. Mr Hall, former chief executive of the Royal Opera House, took over the £450,000 BBC post in April 2013 to replace George Entwistle, who left the corporation in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.","Presenter will be a guest host satirical quiz show Have I Got News For You .

"The youngest designer to ever show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia is also committed to improving working conditions in Cambodia, where his heritage lies. Khim Hang, 22, displayed his bold collection HAN with brooding models donning stocking caps and attire that could be likened to that of war soldiers. And that's exactly where he takes his inspiration from, citing his parents' escape from the Khmer Rouge as the key reason for his commitment to looking after workers in his family's home country, and ethically producing his products.

'I've been really inspired by my culture and my heritage,' Hang, who is based in Brisbane, told SBS backstage. 'I've been doing a lot of research about Cambodia in the 1960s… and for me it's a reinterpretation of what this culture once was, and what it is now,' he added. Hang has also spoken about his hesitance to visit Cambodia after the horror his parents went through trying to flee Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge. 'I've recently been doing a lot of travel back to where my family's from in Cambodia and I just recently opened up a factory over there,' he told News Corp ahead of his show. 'I've been really inspired by my culture and my heritage,' the Brisbane-based designer said . The HAN collection, which adopted its own punk-look, showed a strong oriental influence .

He also spoke to the publication about trying to improve working conditions in the country that has been through so much. Hang said his father has vivid memories of daring escapes to try and reach the Thai border, once falling into a pit of rotting bodies. The designer revealed that many people from Cambodia don't know what it's like to be involved in the fashion industry at any level higher than working in a factory, and he wanted to change that with HAN.

"Video footage has emerged which appears to show Manchester City supporters singing a vile song about the Munich Air Disaster outside Old Trafford. The clip, uploaded to YouTube, looks to have been taken after Sunday's Manchester derby which United won 4-2. It shows police on horseback on the forecourt behind the away section struggling to keep the two sets of rival fans apart. Manchester City fans were filmed singing a vile song about the Munich Disaster outside Old Trafford . Apparently taken by a City fan, it then appears to capture City supporters singing the song which mocks the 1958 tragedy in which 23 people died including Manchester United players. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said that they would examine video evidence with both clubs to determine whether further action was necessary. He added: 'GMP would like to again stress that the overwhelming majority of fans in attendance behaved impeccably but any reports of offensive chanting, gestures or remarks will be investigated by officers to establish whether any criminal offences have taken place.' Inside the ground, as revealed by Sportsmail, a handful of fans of Manuel Pellegrini's side were thrown out by stewards after being accused of making aeroplane gestures mocking the crash. A host of United greats, including Duncan Edwards, Tommy Taylor and Roger Byrne, died following the disaster which saw their plane crash during a third attempt at a take-off in  wintry conditions.

The plane had just made a refuelling stop on its way back from the former Yugoslavia, where United had played Red Star Belgrade in the European Cup. Among the dead was former City goalkeeper Frank Swift, who was working as a journalist. Police made eight arrests at the derby and praised the behaviour of the overwhelming majority of the 76,000 sell-out crowd. City have worked long and hard to cut out such chants and references. Club representatives laid a wreath at the memorial to the disaster in Munich prior to their match against Bayern in 2011 and urged fans to honour the minute's silence held at Old Trafford on the 50th anniversary in 2008 when they were the visitors.

"A woman left heartbroken following the end of a relationship asked her friends to pose 'as she was feeling' for a therapeutic photography project. Laura Stevens' photo series 'Another November' captures the stages grief following the breakdown of a relationship. The British photographer, 38, who lives in Paris, found inspiration for the series after her own painful break up. Scroll down for video . 'Jessica' from the series Another November by Laura Stevens shows a woman sitting in a foetal position next to crumpled bed covers . 'Following the ending of a significant relationship in my life, an undoing began,' she writes in an 'artist statement' on her website. 'Whilst adjusting to being a single woman, I started to create a photographic narrative based on the experience of losing love; directing other women to portray the gradual emotional and circumstantial stages, along the well-trodden track of the broken-hearted.' The title of the series refers not only to the month in which she and her partner separated, but also the idea of looking forwards a bleak and lonely winter following a lost summer of love. The talented photographer directed other women to portray the emotional stages often experienced following a break-up from loneliness to loss of appetite and concerns over attractiveness. The photographer said the project helped her deal with her own emotions. She writes: 'By constructing images of the evolving chapters, I was allowed a vantage point from which to view the changes occurring in me, from feelings of pain, confusion and loneliness towards the reconstruction of my identity as an individual.' The photographer, 38, asked friends and women she met to pose based on the experience of losing love, like the one above called 'Amy' 'Lily' shows a nude woman in the bath, staring into the distance in a moment of melancholy . The series of staged performances by different women, who are friends of Laura's or people she was drawn to from the street, are enacted to show an intimate moment of adjustment. 'They are seen isolated, surrounded by textures, colour and empty spaces in a room of their home in Paris,' the artists explains. 'Another November is situated in a deliberately nostalgic present where memories are constructed and irrevocably discolour, looking back to a past not yet acquainted with loss. 'Yet, it is a reminder that time, the arranger of all things, moves only in one direction.' 'Katherine' demonstrates a woman sitting down for dinner alone, appearing to have lost her appetite, her dress mirroring the wilting flowers . Despite the bright coloured lights above the bed, a sombre  'Julie' appears to struggle to get up in the morning . 'Sofia' studies her reflection showing how the end of a relationship can often make women question their attractiveness . Although she was directing the women, Laura says they each came into the project with their own stories of loss and heartbreak they were able to process during shooting. She titled each image after the first name of the woman posing to help create greater intimacy. Some of Laura's photos - all of women - are both erotically charged and melancholy - like this once called 'Sibylla' Laura directed the women getting them to pose in dark and empty spaces as illustrated in this photo called Airelle . Her series of narrative portraits often represent and fictionalise personal situations. The domestic landscape serves as a backdrop, using cinematic drama and painterly aesthetics along themes of intimacy, relationships and loss. Alongside her dedication to long-term personal projects, she is a regular contributor to the press, for publications such as The Times Magazine, Le Monde, Forbes and The Washington Post. She has participated in group exhibitions at institutions including The National Portrait Gallery, The Centre for Fine Art Photography and many more. For more information visit Laura's website . Laura says that by constructing images of the evolving chapters, she was allowed a different perspective on the changes occurring in herself . The photos show feelings of pain, confusion and loneliness as in this pictures of 'Pauline' Laura says: 'It is a reminder that time, the arranger of all things, moves only in one direction' as model Carole has a solo morning coffee . The images are powerfully evocative like this one called 'Gabriela' suggesting how a break-up can represent a lost chance to become a mother . Many feature women lying on beds partially dressed and deep in thought like this one called 'Christiana' This photo, called 'Arianna', shows a woman who has cut her hair, something which often happens after a break-up . Laura said they each came into the project with their own stories of loss and heartbreak . She titled each image after the first name of the woman posing to help create greater intimacy; this one is called 'Kate' The women are seen isolated, surrounded by textures, colour and empty spaces in a room of their own homes in Paris . Laura wanted to create a feeling of nostalgia; looking back at the past and yearning for things to be as they once were . Her series of narrative portraits often represent and fictionalise personal situations . The portrait of 'Emma' shows how a break-up may involve moving out of what was once your home .

"Politicians who begged Scotland to stay in the Union should not complain if the SNP calls the shots at Westminster after the election, Nicola Sturgeon said last night. Polling last night showed that the nationalists are extending their lead – threatening to all but wipe out Labour north of the border. But Ed Miliband yesterday refused four times to rule out going into a power-sharing agreement with the SNP if its MPs hold the balance of power for the first time. Scroll down for video . Boy, are we doing well: SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon campaigning in Irvine, Ayshire yesterday . During a visit to Lincoln, the Labour leader was asked repeatedly whether he was prepared to dismiss the idea of any pact. While he has rejected a formal coalition he did not address questions as to whether he was prepared to go into Downing Street propped up by Miss Sturgeon on a ‘vote-by-vote basis’. The SNP leader used a BBC TV debate on Thursday night to offer to ‘lock David Cameron out of Downing Street’ – even if Labour has fewer seats than the Tories in a hung parliament. She dominated the so-called ‘challengers’ debate’, and was deemed the best performer by 35 per cent of viewers to the Labour leader’s 29 per cent. Yesterday she said: ‘During the referendum campaign last year, we were told repeatedly by politicians who were trying to persuade Scotland to vote no – and they succeeded – that Scotland was an integral part of the UK, that our view mattered,’ Miss Sturgeon said. Sturgeon dominated the so-called ‘challengers’ debate’ on Thursday and her party is threatening to all but wipe out Labour north of the border . ‘It’s completely unacceptable now for those politicians to say, when Scotland is perhaps going to make its view heard by voting SNP, to say your voice can’t be heard in the UK.’ She said her MPs – who could number as many as 50 after May 7 – would vote to roll back reform of the NHS in England. Traditionally, Scottish nationalists have not voted on health and matters that do not affect their constituents, since they are controlled in Scotland by the Holyrood parliament. ‘Ed Miliband knows as well as I know that if there is an anti-Tory majority after the election, then the only way David Cameron gets back into Downing Street is if Ed Miliband is prepared to stand back and let him back in Downing Street,’ Miss Sturgeon told Sky News. ‘If Ed does that, then Labour voters in Scotland will never ever forgive him and I suspect Labour voters across the UK will never forgive him. Is he really saying that he’d rather watch David Cameron back into Number 10 than work with the SNP to keep him out of Number 10? That’s for him to answer. ‘I’m fighting for more progressive politics across the UK and I’m fighting to get rid of the Tories but crucially to see the Tories replaced with something better, something bolder something that’s going to deliver progressive policies for ordinary people not just in Scotland but all of the UK. ‘Our MPs will vote for a bill to restore England’s NHS to its founding principles, ensuring it remains the accountable public service it was always meant to be – and protecting Scotland’s health budget in the process.’ SNP activists insist Scotland has long had to put up with Tory governments, even though the party currently has only one MP north of the border. David Cameron warned last night that voters across the UK would face higher taxes to fund profligate public spending if Labour does a deal with the SNP. The Prime Minister said Mr Miliband must ‘level with the British people’ and admit that his ‘only route into Number 10’ is with the support of the SNP. Speaking on a campaign visit to the West Midlands, Mr Cameron said: ‘The fact is that Labour cannot win a majority on their own. They can only get into Downing Street with the support of the SNP. ‘What is it that the SNP want? They want more borrowing, they want more taxes, they want more unlimited borrowing – they want all the things that got us into this mess in the first place.’ Miss Sturgeon’s predecessor as Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, who is bidding to return to the Commons, suggested that an SNP deal with a minority Labour government was ‘probable’. He told ITV News a vote-by-vote arrangement with Mr Miliband would be much more likely than any other agreement. ‘What I’ve said and what Nicola has said, more importantly, confidence and supply is possible, but vote by vote is probable. ‘The fact that on a case-by-case basis we’d be able to vote for progressive ideas, progressive politics, I think is a very powerful position.’","Polling last night showed that the nationalists are extending their lead .

"Jerusalem is a city that conjures up a sense of the holy, the historical and heavenly. The biblical city has been a magnet for pilgrims devoted to several of the world's faiths and religions, notably Jews, Christians and Muslims. Millions flock to the ancient, religious city every year. But for a small percentage, their excitement induced by their close proximity to  holy landmarks invokes a rare condition known as Jerusalem syndrome. First identified in 2000,  psychologists noted religious pilgrims overcome with excitement at being in close proximity to the city's holy places believed they were Biblical characters. It is characterised by anxiety, agitation and nervousness. And sufferers are often consumed by a need to be clean, before donning a toga-like gown often made from hotel bed linen. Jerusalem syndrome affects people visiting the holy city. It is characterised by seven stages, including anxiety, the need to be clean and performing sermons . The next stage sees sufferers overcome by the need to scream, or sing out loud psalms, verses from the Bible, religious hymns or spirituals. A procession or march to one of the city's holy places, is then finally followed by the delivery of a 'sermon'. The condition, which was first reported in 2000, often affects people with no history of mental health problems, LiveScience reports. However, in many other cases, experts believe the condition is likely part of a broader psychosis, that is not unique to Jerusalem. Simon Rego, director of psychology training at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Centre in New York, told LiveScience: 'You see things like this emerge periodically in the literature, where people think they have found a unique syndrome.' But, he said, it may simply be the result of an underlying mental illness. A study, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, noted that since 1980, Jerusalem's psychiatrists had encountered an ever-increasing number of tourists who, upon arriving in the city 'suffer psychotic decompensation'. A study published in the British Journal of Psychology identified seven sequential stages of Jerusalem syndrome: . 1. Anxiety, agitation, nervousness and tension, and other unspecified reactions. 2. Declaration of the desire to split away from the group or the family and to tour Jerusalem alone. Tourist guides aware of the Jerusalem syndrome and of the significance of such declarations may at this point refer the tourist to our institution for psychiatric evaluation in an attempt to pre-empt the subsequent stages of the syndrome. 3. A need to be clean and pure, an obsession with taking baths and showers and compulsive fingernail and toenail cutting. 4. Preparation, often with the aid of hotel bed linen, of a long, ankle-length, togalike gown, which is always white. 5. The need to scream, shout, or sing out loud psalms, verses from the Bible, religious hymns or spirituals. Manifestations of this type serve as a warning to hotel personnel and tourist guides, who should then attempt to have the tourist taken for professional treatment. Failing this, the two last stages will develop. 6. A procession or march to one of Jerusalem's holy places. 7. Delivery of a ‘sermon’ in a holy place. The sermon is usually very confused and based on an unrealistic plea to humankind to adopt a more wholesome, moral, simple way of life. As a result of noting 'the consistently high incidence of this phenomenon', a decision was taken to channel all cases to one central facility - the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre. There patients received psychological counselling, psychiatric intervention and, if deemed necessary, admission to hospital. Over a 13-year period, from 1980 to 1993, 1,200 tourists with severe mental illness invoked by Jerusalem, were referred to the facility. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, the study found 100 such tourists were seen by experts annually, with 40 a year requiring admission to hospital. Through the course of their study, the researchers identified three types of people affected by Jerusalem syndrome. The first included individuals already diagnosed as having a mental health illness before visiting Israel. Those patients were found to strongly identify with characters from the Old and New Testament. The study referenced one example of an American tourist suffering paranoid schizophrenia, who believed he was the biblical character Samson. He visited Israel because he was compelled to move one of the giant stone blocks forming the Western (Wailing) Wall which, in his opinion, was not in the right place. On arriving at the Western Wall, he attempted to move one of the stones. But his actions instigated a commotion, which resulted in his being admitted to the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre. The second group includes those people with personality disorders and obsessions with fixed ideas, but who do not have a clear mental illness. Researchers cited the case of a healthy German man who was obsessed with finding the 'true' religion, and travelled to Jerusalem to study Judaism. He ended up suffering a psychotic episode in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built on the site where Jesus is believed to have been crucified and buried. Three types of patient were identified, the first group being those with already underlying mental illness. One example was of an American tourist suffering paranoid schizophrenia, who believed he was the biblical character Samson. He visited Israel because he was compelled to move one of the giant stone blocks forming the Western (Wailing) Wall, pictured, which, in his opinion, was not in the right place . And the third type of patient, identified in the study, were those with no history of mental illness, but who experienced a psychotic episode while in the city. This group recovered spontaneously after leaving Israel. of the 1,200 patients examined, just 42 fell into the third category. Despite the study, the notion of Jerusalem has been condemned by a number of experts. Dr Alan Manevitz, of New York's Lenox Hill Hospital, told LiveScience he believes the condition may happen when a person who is at risk of psychosis experiences the stress of travelling to another country. 'I think what happens is, vulnerable people can be inspired by the circumstances around them,' he said. Dr Rego, agreed the condition may not be unique to Jerusalem. 'If it was purely causal, you would expect everybody who visits Jerusalem to get it,' he said.","Experts first identified the rare condition in 2000, noting seven symptoms .

"A man has spent a year losing 70lbs so he could donate his kidney to his wife. PJ Spraggins was delighted when he discovered he was a perfect match for wife Tracy, who was told her life-long battle with Lupus would kill her if she didn't get a transplant. The waiting list is seven years long. But the next day the couple from Birmingham, Alabama, were dealt a blow: his blood pressure was too high to perform the operation. Refusing to accept the diagnosis, PJ embarked on a relentless fitness regime. Finally, in December 2014, they got the green light. In February, they went under the knife together. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Transformation: PJ and Tracy Spraggins (pictured, left, in 2006, and right in 2015) together lost 145lbs in one year so he could donate his kidney to her. On the transplant list, she would have had to wait seven years . Made it! After a year of grueling dieting and exercise, PJ was given the green light to undergo surgery . 'We both just feel amazing. I'm slowly getting back to work making music, Tracy is making sure she fully recovers. But the entire process has been amazing.' Now 39, Tracy was six when she was first diagnosed with the chronic inflammatory disease which affects her kidney functions. She was placed on the transplant list in 2013 - just a few months after her 34-year-old sister, who also had Lupus, died following complications from a kidney transplant. Knowing that the seven-year wait might be too long, PJ, a self-employed musician, submitted himself for the weeks-long evaluation to assess whether he could donate his kidney. Journey: For a year, he kept losing weight and going in for tests, only to be told he needed to lose more . Finally, he visited Nashville's Vanderbilt hospital in December 2014, and the numbers all matched up . However, the good news was tinged with disappointment as doctors said his size meant the operation couldn't go ahead. 'They said I was a perfect match but they wanted to check I was healthy and met their requirements. They sent me a blood pressure monitor, but they didn't like the numbers. 'That was a real kick in the gut.' The doctors advised PJ, who weighed 265lbs, to lose 30lbs before returning for an evaluation. He did - but on the day of the test he changed a flat tire. 'My blood pressure was all over the place. The results came back and they said no again.' It didn't stop there. Next try was a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was told to another 60lbs. Eventually, they made it to Nashville's Vanderbilt Hospital in December 2014. PJ made sure he did everything he could to ensure the readings were perfect. 'I put that blood pressure monitor on and lay in bed all day. And thankfully, it all came back good!' Undergoing the four-hour surgery together on February 24, the couple took a beaming photograph in matching hospital gowns. Life saver: Special needs teacher Tracy, 39, has suffered from Lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease, since she was six. In 2013, doctors in Birmingham, Alabama, said she would need a kidney transplant to survive . Happy: Spraggins (pictured in hospital) described the feeling of dejection at every hurdle until they made it . Perfect match: The chances of being a perfect match for one's spouse is rare . The couple, who married in 2003, are now back home and recovering in Birmingham . GIft! This was the festive Easter gift given to Tracy and PJ by Vanderbilt hospital . 'The way my kidney function is now, it's at 100 percent. And it's at the best it's ever been,' Tracy, a special needs teacher, told Fox. PJ told DailyMail.com: 'It has just been amazing. To know that I did everything I could to give my wife a better quality of life is just the best feeling. I am so happy.' The couple's friends have now set up a fund to financially support them during the two-month recovery period when they will be unable to work. It reads: 'While the actual cost of the kidney transplant itself would be covered, they would need at least two months of financial assistance to cover regular household expenses as neither of them will be able to work during their recovery. Your donations would be emensely appreciated.'","PJ Spraggins was perfect match for wife Tracy, who suffers from Lupus .

"The party-loving girlfriend of footballer Johnny Manziel has come under fire on social media for refusing to give up on going out and enjoying herself now her boyfriend is out of rehab. Manziel and Colleen Crowley were spotted together in public for the first time since he entered rehab when they attended Tuesday night's Texas Rangers game. The pair appear to remain very much an item, but Crowley has been taking heat on Instagram for refusing to give up her wild ways while Manziel was being treated for his unspecified problems. Scroll down for video . Johnny Manziel was spotted at a Texas Rangers game Tuesday night days after leaving rehab . On Tuesday, Crowley posted a video on her Instagram page of the Texan socialite enjoying a drunken night out with friends . Manziel finally re-emerged on the weekend after checking into a  facility on January 28 stating that he wanted to 'be a better family member, friend and teammates.' On Tuesday, Crowley - who has amassed more than 130,000 followers since becoming Johnny Football’s girlfriend - posted a video on her Instagram page of the Texan socialite enjoying a drunken night out with friends. The video seemed to enrage a number of followers who voiced their unhappiness that the undergrad at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas may not be setting the best example to someone straight out of rehab. 'F*** you for putting this up after the money man (Manziel) got out of rehab,' commented one follower. Another concerned commenter added some words of warning. 'Significant others are the #1 reason that people fail outside rehab. If you are in rehab, then you have an addictive personality and the drug councilors will atest that one addiction is as good as another for triggering an addict into relapsing.' Crowley has been taking heat on Instagram for refusing to give up her wild ways while Manziel was being treated for his unspecified problems . The party-loving girlfriend of footballer Johnny Manziel has come under fire on social media for refusing to give up on going out and enjoying herself now her boyfriend is out of rehab . Some other commenters on Crowley’s Instagram page are more forgiving. 'It's your life, keep doin you and forget the haters,' writers one supporter. The Cleveland Browns quarterback stayed away from the booze on Tuesday night and was seen sipping nothing stronger than water throughout the game. Manziel's partying had been a topic of conversation since his rookie season began last July, with some worried his drinking was a priority . According to ESPN, Manziel was 'doing great' in rehab, and had the full support of his team. Now comes the real test as offseason workouts with the team will begin next Monday, April 20. Manziel will be forced to compete with Josh McCown for the starting quarterback position, who just signed a $14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons. Manziel was joined by his girlfriend Colleen Crowley and sipped water throughout Tuesday night . This after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts. Manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the Cleveland Browns season last December, but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem. Especially after one incident last year when, after partying until well past midnight, Manziel, who is suffering from an injured hamstring, skipped out on a Saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept, and in turn was fined by the Browns. Manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior, saying; 'It’s about being accountable... instead of looking like a jackass.' And while his season may have been over at that time, many believed Manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy. The athlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released on Saturday . It was all the more shocking then when he was spotted partying at FDR Lounge at the Delano in Miami over the New Year holiday, alongside the likes of LeBron James and Ryan Phillippe, and then he was seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend Crowley and some buddies poolside at the Delano. At this point, some in the sports world, chief among them columnist Skip Bayless, began to suggest that the Heisman Trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking. Appearing on ESPN’s First Take, Bayless, a noted supporter of Manziel, did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking. 'My concern, I repeatedly said, was if Johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol, and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails, then I’m going to be out,' said Bayless. 'In talking to people in and around the Cleveland Browns, I believe Johnny Manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol. And I believe ... that it is time for Johnny to get some help.

Mr Yin is stationed in a regiment in Tibet and only gets to go home - which is some 2,700 kilometres away in southern China - once a year. 'Although I mentally prepared myself for this life when I married him, I had no idea it would be so tough,' sais Ms Zhao. 'At the end of every holiday I would be devastated and would cry all day but I will continue to support him in his career and look after this family.'

"Hundreds of thousands of people who bought British Gas shares in the 1980s are in line for a windfall after their investment soared in value last night. The shares are one of the most popular in the UK due to the hugely successful ‘Tell Sid’ advertising campaign when British Gas was privatised. Last night shares in what is now called the BG Group rose by nearly 30 per cent to 1,153p. The shares are one of the most popular in the UK due to the hugely successful ‘Tell Sid’ advertising campaign when British Gas was privatised . The rise came after the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell announced plans to buy BG Group in a £47billion deal. It is one of the biggest takeovers ever. News of the deal has driven up the price of shares in BG now owned by people who originally bought British Gas shares in 1986. British Gas was privatised by Margaret Thatcher’s government after the widely publicised ‘Tell Sid’ campaign. The share sell-off, which encouraged people to spread news of the offer with the slogan ‘If you see Sid, tell him’, saw more than 1.5million people pay 135p a share when the company was listed on the Stock Exchange. In 1997 British Gas was split in two to form the oil explorer BG Group and the British Gas owner Centrica. Shareholders received shares in both companies. Those investors who retained these shares have since received hundreds of pounds in dividends. Anyone who bought 100 shares at the time of privatisation would have paid £135 (£366 today, after taken inflation into account). The holding across the now separate companies of Centrica, National Grid and BG Group, is currently worth more than £1,604. The proposed Shell takeover will mean investors are now due 383p for every BG share they own. Investors will also be in line for higher dividends. But the windfall pales in comparison to the rewards for BG Group’s newly arrived chief executive Helge Lund who could be in line for more than £30million in pay and perks if the deal completes next year. Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, (left) shakes hands with the Chairman GB group Andrew Gould (right)  during a press conference to announce Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to buy British Gas, in London . Mr Lund was poached by BG to help turn around the group and started in February, just weeks before talks to sell the business began. The takeover, which will create a company valued at £200billion, could be the first of many in the oil sector as the falling oil price, means firms are vulnerable to predators. The bid has been months in the planning. Shell ‘ran the numbers’ on BG, Britain’s third largest energy company, last year as its share price has fallen by a fifth since the oil price crash. His signing-on bonus was cut from £12 million to £10.8 million in December amid outrage from investors . Shell’s chief executive Ben van Beurden made a call to BG’s chairman Andrew Gould on Sunday March 15 and a ‘cloak and dagger’ meeting took place at the Dorchester Hotel last month. He described the deal as a ‘fantastic fit’ and said the ‘logic’ to buy BG has always been there but that the falling oil price made it a ‘whole lot more compelling’. The deal will have to be approved by a series of regulatory bodies worldwide including the European Commission. Shell employs more than 94,000 people across 70 countries. BG has 5,200 staff across 24 countries. News of the merger led to job fears. In the UK Shell has around 6,500 staff while BG employs around 1,600. Shell is in the process of laying off 500 people at its North Sea operations where old oil fields are becoming too expensive to operate.

"A massive, fast-moving wildfire in Southern California has forced residents of 300 homes to flee their homes in the middle of the night. The raging blaze, reported shortly after 6pm Saturday, was sparked by a cooking stove. The fire along the border of cities Norco and Corona, 35 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, resulted in hundreds of people to being told to evacuate the are area over the weekend. By midday, Sunday, fire officials said they had contained 35 percent of the fire, which had ravaged the area and grown to 1.6 square miles. Scroll down for video . Engulfed: Smoke and flames loom over the Prado Dam Flood Control Basin behind homes on Cheyenne Road in Corona, California . Damage: The fire threatened hundreds of homes near the Southern California dam . Rescue efforts were helped by cooperative weather combined with hundreds of firefighters who beat back the flames Sunday. Captain Mike Mohler of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire burned in the Prado Dam Flood Control Basin, where vegetation has not burned in decades. As a result, the area that is burning has up to 3 feet of 'duff' — needles, leaves and other combustible plant debris. At the same time, California's drought means the basin has not held much water recently, Mohler said. Because the smoke was not blowing away, area residents were urged to stay indoors. But the evacuation orders were lifted just before dawn Sunday. CalFire Captain Liz Brown confirmed that about 500 firefighters worked on the front lines. They were backed up by two helicopters, though fixed-wing aircraft were not being used. And despite the ferocity of the fire, no property damage or injuries were reported. Fire: The brush fire that broke out on Saturday evening, April 18, 2015 is seen here as it burns in the Dam Prado Dam Flood Control Basin north of the city of Corona, California. Fire officials said some trees caught fire in the forested basin and grew to at least 75 acres.

"Former Kayak world champion and two-time Olympic medalist Nathan Baggaley has been taken back into custody for allegedly assaulting a police officer at Byron Bay Blues Festival. The 39-year-old, who was already facing serious drug charges, was allegedly caught along with two other men in a toilet cubicle with white powder at around 4pm on Easter Friday. Newscorp reported the powder was found on a phone owned by Mr Baggaley. Nathan Baggaley has been taken back into custody after allegedly assaulting an officer that found him in a toilet cubicle with white powder . The kayker was reportedly disgruntled and allegedly slapped the hand of an officer before walking away. Mr Baggaley was apprehended when he reported for bail earlier this week at Tweed Heads police station. He was taken into custody and charged with assaulting a police officer, resisting police and escaping custody. Mr Baggaley's barrister, Nikolaos Siafakas, disputed that his client assaulted an officer, also calling into question the circumstances surrounding the incident on Good Friday. Denied bail: Mr Baggaley was charged with assaulting a police officer, resisting police and escaping custody . The Olympian will remain in custody after his bail application was rejected by Byron Bay Local Court on Thursday afternoon. Mr Baggaley has pleaded not guilty to the Bluesfest offence and his case will be heard at Tweed Heads Local Court on May 7. The fallen athlete was already on strict bail conditions, including a 9pm curfew, while he was awaiting sentencing for two serious drug manufacturing charges. The fallen athlete has pleaded guilty to drug manufacturing linked with a Tweed Heads drug ring . Earlier this week, charges were also laid  for a separate instance where Mr Baggaley allegedly supplied 10 Buprenophine patches, an opiate based pain medication, to a prisoner inside the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre. In February the disgraced athlete pleaded guilty to manufacturing a border-controlled drug and manufacturing a marketable quantity of methamphetamine that was linked to a Tweed Heads drug ring. The Australian Federal Police allege the ring had established two secret drug labs located in the Tweed Heads and on the Gold Coast. The drug supply charge will be heard at Lismore Local Court on June 2. Mr Baggaley was also charged with supplying a prohibited substance to a prisoner at the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre .","Nathan Baggaley has been charged and detained after assaulting police .

"The house where Tia Sharp was sexually assaulted and then brutally murdered before her body was hidden in the loft has finally been erased from a community. Pictures show the aerial view of the new buildings which have been built following the discovery of the 12-year-old's body in the in 2013. The two-bedroomed terraced house - Number 20 The Lindens in New Addington, near Croydon south London - was bulldozed in June 2013 along with the two neighbouring properties. 19a and 19b The Lindens in New Addington, near Croydon - the previous address, where Tia Sharp was sexually assaulted and then brutally murdered has been completely wiped off the map . 20 The Lindens as it was before: Neighbours say the old house was a constant reminder of the evil that happened there . In its place, two new houses have been built, which will be numbered 19a and 19b, completely wiping number 20 from the map. The two identical houses come with a garden, shed and new solar panels on the roof. The properties are clearly noticeable next to the old houses in the street. One local resident who did not want to be named said: 'We are so relieved that it has gone. It was a constant reminder of the evil that took place there. 'It has been raised to the ground and erased from our memories. 'The new homes are lovely.' The former home was where evil killer Stuart Hazell, 39, murdered the schoolgirl and dumped her body in the loft. Twelve-year-old Tia Sharp (left) was sexually assaulted and then brutally murdered by Hazell (right) before her body was hidden in the loft . He was living there with his partner, 49-year-old Christine Bicknell, Tia's grandmother. Twisted Hazell was one of the 'heartbroken' family members who 'searched' for Tia during a national manhunt in August 2012 after she disappeared. As the distraught and desperate family members comforted each other in the house, they were unaware that missing Tia was just feet away from them, wrapped in bin-liners in the loft. Father-of-one Hazell suffocated Tia during a sex attack after months of trawling vile internet pornography sites and filming her as she slept. Hazell was living there with his partner, 49-year-old Christine Bicknell, (pictured) Tia's grandmother . Her body was not found for over a week by police - even though it just feet away from where they had been searching. The property, which is owned by Croydon Council, was demolished to avoid it becoming a sick tourist attraction. Two adjoining houses were also demolished by the council and now building work has been going to replace the three bulldozed properties with two new ones. A Croydon Council spokesman confirmed the homes are near completion and the number 20 will not be used. Hazell, who lied that Tia spent the night at home before heading to a shopping centre in nearby Croydon, was jailed for life in May last year. He pleaded not guilty before changing his plea to guilty on the fifth day of his trial at the Old Bailey. A Croydon Council spokesman confirmed the homes are near completion and the number 20 will not be used .","Two houses built over the site of former home so address no longer exists .

'It was an imposing assignment full of history and it'll be . around a lot longer than I am,' he told Reuters after putting . the final touches to the gate ahead of a May 3 ceremony to mark . the 70th anniversary of the camp's liberation by U.S. troops.

German leader to visit Dachau, will join some 100 survivors at . the ceremony. She visited the Buchenwald death camp with U.S. President Barack Obama in 2009.

Initially designed to . detain political rivals, it became the prototype for a network . of death camps where 6 million Jews were murdered. More than . 41,000 died at Dachau. 'A lot of thought went into how to make this cynical Nazi . slogan close to the original - which is important as some . 800,000 people visit the Dachau memorial each year,' said . Poitner, 36, who was born in town of Dachau. 'You can feel all . that cynicism with this gate.' He studied pictures and documents about the original gate, . which was installed in 1936, and used techniques like . high-temperature brazing, which was more common than soldering . in the 1930s. More than 200,000 people had been detained in the camp by . the time U.S. troops liberated it in 1945.

"A baby girl has been badly disfigured in a dog attack at home after her parents left her by herself while they worked in nearby fields. Ten-week-old Qingqing is currently in a critical condition in hospital in eastern China, following emergency surgery to repair her mauled face. Her mother told the People's Daily Online: ‘We left after our baby girl fell asleep. Who knew this would happen?' Recovering from surgery: Little Qingqing, who is just ten weeks old, has bandages around her damaged face . The woman, named only as Ms Li, said that on the day of the attack, she and her husband fed their daughter then went to work near their house in Haimen City, eastern China. But Ms Li could not stop thinking about her daughter so returned home after just ten minutes. When she arrived, a white dog with blood around its mouth came running towards her, she said. She dashed to the bedroom where she had left Qingqing - and discovered that the little girl had been dragged from her bed by the dog, which is believed to be a stray. Ms Li said: ‘I nearly fainted. My baby girl was lying face flat on the floor, with blood all over.' Distraught: Qingqing's mother, identified only as Ms Li, at her daughter's bedside in hospital . The right side of Qingqing's face had been shredded and her eyelid torn off. She was carried to a local clinic by her mother but her injuries were too severe to be treated there. She was then transferred to the larger Nantong City No.3 People’s Hospital, where she was operated on. She is recovering from the surgery but is suffering from a fever that is concerning her doctors. Her plastic surgeon, Dr Sun Jiyie, said: ‘This is the youngest child with the most severe injuries we have seen from a dog bite. ‘If she could safely power through the critical period, we will be planning more plastic surgery. But she is so young and the injuries are so severe, the operations will no doubt be very difficult.’ Mrs Li, who is keeping a vigil at her daughter's bedside, said she and her husband only recently moved to Haimen after working at a greenhouse farm in another province for three years. Disfigured: A pixellated photo of Qingqing's face before her surgical dressings were applied (right) Last night Dr Zhao Xianzhong, the director of the hospital's burns and plastic surgery department, reminded all parents never to leave their babies and children alone. He also issued a general warning about dogs - saying attacks in China are more common in spring and summer. The hospital currently treats around 20 people a day for dog bites but the figure is expected to increase in the coming weeks as temperatures rise. ‘When summer arrives, people wear less fabric, and dogs are only interested in exposed skin,' explained Dr Zhao. 'Girls should be more aware when they are wearing short skirts and shorts.’","Ten-week-old Qingqing is in a critical condition following surgery .

"Aubrey de Grey (pictured) says ageing is a 'disease that can and should be cured' With his Rasputin beard and lines etched deep into his forehead, Aubrey de Grey looks like a man a lot older than his 51 years. A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing. But you would be wrong. For de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age. It sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet. PayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth £1.5 billion) donated £2.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing. While many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing. Google's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.' One source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.' De Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him £11 million when she died in 2011 – £9 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow. Scroll down for video . 'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, ""We were with you all along"".' De Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car – 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'. His argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body parts at a cellular level – leading to virtual immortality. People will still die in accidents and from suicide, 'but there is no reason that someone living today shouldn't live to 500, 1,000 years. As the technologies improve, lifespans will increase', says de Grey. He believes the first person who will live to be 1,000 has already been born, and cites research that has dramatically extended the lives of mice, worms and fruit flies as proof science is 'catching up' with his theories that therapies which will genetically alter, replace and repair the cells in our bodies will be the key to eternal life. He accuses the majority of us of being in a 'pro-ageing trance', content to accept ageing and death as inevitable, while the reality is that technology will, within two decades, he says, have advanced far enough that we can replace and repair faulty genes, 'clear out the gunk around cells' and rejuvenate our bodies. It sounds fanciful but as he talks, it is clear that de Grey is empowered by the support of the Silicon Valley billionaires. 'It is a good feeling to finally be getting validation,' he admits. Many academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky. It should be noted that much of what he says is theoretical and, critics point out, de Grey has never actually done any practical lab work. De Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide (pictured) have an unconventional marriage and he admits to having 'two younger girlfriends' Nir Barsilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said: 'Based on the biology that we know today, somewhere between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and I challenge if we can get beyond it.' The oldest human to date was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days. De Grey has been mockingly compared to a 'Messiah' figure because of his flowing facial hair, and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the table and loudly pronounces that '150,000 people die every day worldwide and of those people, two-thirds die of ageing one way or another. That's 30 World Trade Centers every day. If I bring forward the cure for ageing by one day I've saved 100,000 lives'. De Grey is notoriously eccentric. He refuses to carry a mobile phone ('anti-social, nasty things') and has never learned to drive due to a 'mental block'. 'Cars can kill people without it being the driver's fault,' he says. He gives interviews to 'spread the word' and has written several anti-ageing books. Last year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie, The Immortalists. De Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide, 19 years his senior, have an unconventional marriage and he cheerfully admits to having 'two younger girlfriends', aged 45 and 24. Isn't juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely? He laughs: 'It keeps me busy.' Critics argue that if he is right and we all live longer, the world's resources will be stretched by overpopulation, but he hits back by saying: 'Society will adapt. People will have fewer children.' What about the cost of keeping so many people alive? 'People will continue to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive. 'When people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they start to think this whole thing is morally questionable. It might be technologically fanciful but all we do is medical research. I work on stopping people from getting sicker as they get older. The by-product of that is longevity. 'I have no idea if I will live to 100. I do know I'd like to have the chance to live to 100 when I am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by declining health.'","Aubrey de Grey, 51, believes he will unlock secrets to huge advances in life .

"A New York judge has granted two chimpanzees held at a research lab the same rights as human prisoners, after a two year legal battle by an animal rights organization. The two primates, currently living in a lab at Stony Brook University, are the first animals in history to be covered by a writ of habeas corpus, allowing their detention to be challenged. A representative of the Long Island university have been ordered to appear in court to respond to a petition by the Nonhuman Rights Project that chimps Hercules and Leo are 'unlawfully detained.' Making history: The two chimpanzees, living in a lab at Stony Brook University, Long Island, (not pictured) are the first animals to be granted the same rights as human prisoners . The decision by New York Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe effectively recognises the chimpanzees as legal humans, the American Association for the Advancement of Science reports. The lawsuits were originally filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project in December 2013, in an attempt to free Hercules and Leo and two other chimpanzees living on private property. Although the courts threw out the suits, the animal rights' group has been appealing ever since, and have now been granted the writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the Stony Brook chimpanzees. A Stony Brook representative have been ordered to appear in court next month to respond the petition which argues that the chimps  should be set free and moved to a sanctuary in Florida. 'We are claiming that chimpanzees are autonomous,' The Nonhuman Rights Project's founder Massachusetts lawyer Steven Wise said in an interview last year. A representative of the university have been ordered to appear in a New York court next month to respond the petition which argues that Leo and Hercules should be set free and moved to a sanctuary (stock image) 'That is, being able to self-determine, be self-aware, and be able to choose how to live their own lives.' The 2013 lawsuits include affidavits from scientists who say chimpanzees have complex cognitive abilities, such as awareness of the past and the ability to make choices, and display complex emotions such as empathy. Although Judge Jaffe's ruling only requires a Stony Brook University representative to attend a hearing regarding Hercules and Leo next month, it can be used to set precedent for further legal action. 'This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,' Natalie Prosin, the Executive Director of the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) told the AAAS. 'We got our foot in the door. And no matter what happens, that door can never be completely shut again.'","Chimpanzees at NY university to be covered by habeas corpus writ .

"A former Premier League footballer 'cast his net around' for players willing to take part in a plot to fix lower league matches, a court has heard. Ex-Bolton Wanderers striker Delroy Facey, 34, is alleged to have become involved in the 'ugly side' of his sport by acting as a middleman for two men who have already been convicted of match-fixing. Facey, who also played for West Bromwich Albion and Hull City, denies conspiracy to commit bribery and is standing trial at Birmingham Crown Court alongside former non-league player Moses Swaibu, who also denies the charges. Delroy Facey (right) arrives at Birmingham Crown Court for the start of his trial on Monday. He is accused of being involved in a plot to fix lower league football matches . Facey (right) celebrates after scoring for Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League in 2003 . Opening the Crown's case against both Facey and Swaibu at the start of a three-week trial, prosecutor Nick Mather told jurors they would not need to know anything about football to try the defendants. Mr Mather told the jury panel: 'Football in this case is really nothing more than a means to an end - it's an opportunity to make money. 'It's described sometimes as the beautiful game but football has an ugly side to it as well, and it's that ugly side we are going to be looking at.' After explaining to jurors that match-fixers Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan were found guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery at a previous trial, Mr Mather alleged that Swaibu was one of the players they had tried to corrupt. Sankaran and Ganeshan, both from the Far East, were at the centre of the conspiracy, the court heard, having travelled to Britain with the specific purpose of fixing matches. Defendant Moses Swaibu (right) on the ball during an FA Cup match between Lincoln and Bolton in 2010 . The Crown alleges that the plot - which aimed to profit from rigged bets - targeted the lower leagues because of the high level of scrutiny surrounding the Premier League. Swaibu played at a semi-professional level between 2009 and 2014, including stints with London-based Sutton FC and Brighton club Whitehawk. Jurors were also given details of Facey's career, which included a spell at Lincoln City in which he earned around £65,000 during the 2010/11 season. Describing Facey's alleged role in the conspiracy, Mr Mather added: 'He was a middleman, a fixer. He was somebody who cast his net around to find players who might be willing to take part in match-fixing.' By the time of the alleged conspiracy in November 2013, Mr Mather told the court, Facey was earning considerably less than previously. 'That may well have been his motivation, the prosecution say, for what took place,' Mr Mather said of Facey's reduced income. Facey (top) in action for West Brom during a match against Norwich City in March 2004 . Informing jurors that another footballer, former Whitehawk FC defender Michael Boateng, was also found guilty at a previous trial, Mr Mather said there was no doubt that an agreement to fix lower league matches occurred. 'This case is not about whether this scheme existed,' the prosecutor told the jury. 'The issue for you to decide is whether you are sure that firstly, Delroy Facey, and secondly Moses Swaibu, was a part of that agreement. 'This case is focused on them and what they did, and why they did it.' Facey, from Woodhouse Hill, Huddersfield, and 25-year-old Swaibu, of Tooley Street, Bermondsey, south London, deny conspiring together with others to commit bribery between November 1 and 27, 2013. Mr Mather said betting on football was not confined to the Premier League and extended from the very top of the sport down to semi-professional leagues. Lower league games in the Football Conference had been targeted, Mr Mather claimed, partly because highly-paid professionals would have to be offered 'astronomical' sums to even think about becoming involved in corruption. Huddersfield's Facey (left) vies with Brentford's Michael Dobson during an old Second Division match in 2002 . The conspiracy came to the attention of the National Crime Agency after initial inquiries by a private investigator who wanted to expose match-fixing led to the identification of Sankaran. A national newspaper then became involved, the court was told, and Sankaran arrived in the UK in November 2013. During a meeting with an undercover investigator on November 16, Sankaran is alleged to have made unsuccessful attempts to contact footballers and made reference to an agent named Delroy who used to play for Bolton. At that point, the court heard, the National Crime Agency took over the investigation, deploying a covert officer to gather evidence. The officer met Sankaran five days later and mobile phones belonging to the defendants, including Facey, were subsequently seized. Mr Mather will continue his opening speech to the jury on Tuesday.

"This is the scarred face of a nursing student who was hit in the face by a flying pint glass which was thrown across a crowded pub during a heavy metal gig. Charnelle Hughes, 20, was stood near the bar at the Adelphi Pub in Preston reading a text message, when she was struck on the side of the head by the empty glass after it was hurled into a group of 40 people during a live gig. The culprit Jordan Goode, also aged 20, had been dancing aggressively to heavy rock music and had suddenly picked up the glass and threw it randomly. Charnelle Hughes, who was left scarred, swollen and fearing she might lose her right eye after being struck in the face by a pint glass, which was thrown across a crowded pub . Witnesses said Goode picked up the glass before spinning 180 degrees on his feet before launching it across the room, as if throwing a cricket ball. Miss Hughes had to be rushed to hospital after she started bleeding profusely and was suffering concussion, and at one stage it was feared she would lose her right eye. She now has to see a facial specialist and has been warned that her facial features may drop. At Preston Crown Court, Goode, from Tipton in the West Midlands, sobbed as he admitted wounding and escaped with a suspended jail term. But after the case teetotal Miss Hughes, from Preston, said: “I’m really annoyed with what he got - it seems like he has got a slap on the wrist. 'At the time I was injured he was raging around like some kind of lunatic and was jumping around and stamping his feet. Miss Hughes, pictured left before the attack and right afterwards, is still having to see a facial specialist and has been warned her facial features might drop . The 20-year-old student nurse says that she was left feeling she looked like the Elephant Man after being hit and adds that she has no feeling in the side of her face . 'When my mother saw me afterwards she said I looked like the Elephant Man. I still can’t feel any of my cheek, no feeling has come back. I couldn’t sleep on that side of my face and they didn’t know if I’d lose my eye. I have double vision as a result and a facial wound. 'It has got me down. I was hiding my face when I went out and don’t like pictures so I always turn to my left. I felt like I looked horrible and was walking around with a scarf pulled up. People were saying, ""look at her eye, look at her face"" and were pointing at me on the bus. 'I’ve been told my eye could drop and there could still be long term damage. 'I just remember pulling my phone out of my pocket to look at a text and the next thing I felt a blow to my face and stumbling back. I thought someone had punched me but my head was pulsing that much. Miss Hughes, who doesn’t drink because of acid reflux condition had blood pouring down her face before she was taken by ambulance to hospital . 'I felt like I’d lost half of my face. There was instant swelling and blood was coming down my face. There was just no rhyme or reason to it.' The incident occurred last December whilst Goode had been 'hard-core dancing' at the venue, where the bands Sentence and Desolated had been playing. Prosecutor Karen Brooks told the court: 'It involves jumping around and punching towards each other. Miss Hughes had been to such venues before and knew what to expect and her and her friends stood back. 'Whilst she was sending a text message the defendant picked up a pint glass from the floor, placed it on a table then picked it up and threw it across the dance floor. It hit the complainant on the side of her head which she wasn’t expecting, her face was bleeding and swelling.' The court was told that there had been a crowd of around 30 to 40 people and that Goode had been drinking. Jordan Goode, pictured, who had been dancing aggressively to heavy rock music and suddenly picked up the glass and threw it randomly. He sobbed after admitting wounding at Preston Crown Court . Miss Hughes, who doesn’t drink because of acid reflux condition had blood pouring down her face before she was taken by ambulance to hospital. She was treated for a haemotoma in the eye and a 1 inch cut below the eye and her face remains bruised and swollen four months on. She was also diagnosed with nerve damage and has difficulty with her vision and hearing and has fallen behind with her studies at Preston College where she was in her first year. Miss Brooks added: 'Her lips and jaw are still numb and she has difficulty attending college because she couldn’t see out of her right eye and she will have a scar.' Goode was located after CCTV obtained from the pub linked him to the band’s Facebook page. In interview he accepted he had got 'carried away with the night with hard-core dancing' and threw the glass. Miss Brooks added: 'He said he didn’t mean to hit anyone and if he had known he would have apologised. She will have a scar.' Goode was sentenced to 14 months in a young offenders institution suspended for 12 months and must complete 120 hours unpaid work. The Adelphi pub in Preston, where Goode randomly threw the glass, which struck Miss Hughes on the head . He must also comply with a three month electronic curfew between the hours of 10 pm and 6 am and pay £500 compensation. Passing sentence Judge Pamela Badley told him: 'The idea that for fun that you can pick up a glass and throw it randomly into a group of people on a crowded dance floor - it was a matter of pure chance, you could have taken this young woman’s eye. 'You could have caused a very significant amount of injury to more than one person and at the time you had taken some cannabis and alcohol which is an aggravated fact. 'Unfortunately in the courts we deal with people who don’t look at the consequences of their actions. The fact that you have got to the age of 20, have held down a job and on the face of it, a responsible young man, yet can can act in this way is extremely worrying. 'It has affected her confidence, she is going to have a scar on the face. She wasn’t even taking part in the hard-core dancing because she knew it would allow idiots to have free reign. 'The affect upon her has been significant, the scar to her right eye and swelling meant she had a great deal of anxiety.'","Charnelle Hughes was at the Adelphi pub in Preston for a heavy metal gig .

Ms Knapton was driving with her friend, who was in a separate car, when she came across a bike lying across the middle of the road. Her friend stopped to get out of her vehicle to move the bike out of the way of traffic. But as she left the car, a man waiting at a nearby bus shelter came hurtling towards her with a glass bottle. The man then hurled abuse at the girl, before walking up to the Ms Knapton's car and smashing the bottle against her window.

Yesterday, it was alleged that a trafficker on one boat threw a migrant overboard after he died from asphyxiation in the hold of the vessel. Witnesses said his body was attacked by sharks who had been following the boat. The suspected people smuggler, from Guinea, was arrested in Sicily after being rescued along with his 110 passengers, and it is thought he will also face manslaughter charges.

The total rescued since Friday has now reached 8,480, from more than 40 boats. The Italian coast guard, navy ships and merchant vessels delivered migrants rescued from the boats to Italian ports throughout yesterday. A pregnant woman on board one Italian navy ship died during the journey to shore, and another pregnant migrant from Eritrea gave birth. Meanwhile, the EU’s Frontex border agency said traffickers trying to recover a boat had fired shots into the air to warn away the coastguard – sparking concerns for the safety of rescue workers and migrants. Save the Children and other humanitarian groups have called for the EU to bolster its rescue operations before the number of boats soars in summer, as it usually does. The Italian coast guard said Monday it recovered nine bodies after a boat carrying more than 150 migrants sank off the coast Libya .

Italy, which handles the largest number of migrant arrivals in the EU, has become increasingly alarmed about the breakdown of law and order in Libya, which is home to two rival governments, loosely aligned militia forces and a growing militant Islamist movement. Giovanna Di Benedetto, a Save the Children official who assisted the new arrivals, told The Times: ‘A 17-year-old Nigerian whose brother was killed by Muslim fundamentalists told me he was tortured with electric shocks by traffickers because he didn’t have money to travel. Many are now talking about fleeing fundamentalists.’ Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU’s commissioner for migration, said Europe must adapt to deal with the rising numbers of migrants. ‘The unprecedented influx of migrants at our borders, and in particular refugees, is unfortunately the new norm,’ he said in Brussels. More than 280,000 people entered the EU illegally last year. Many travelled from Syria, Eritrea and Somalia to Libya, and then made the perilous journey across the sea to Italy.","Around 400 migrants trying to reach Europe died when their boat capsized .

"A mother whose twins were born so early they spent their first two months in intensive care has revealed she almost lost her son Mason a second time after he contracted an extremely rare virus. Lauren Perry, 25, had her waters break just 23 weeks into her pregnancy, and doctors feared the worst. Her twins Mason and Chloe were delivered early via an emergency caesarean at 30 weeks. Lauren Perry's (right) son, Mason (pictured with sister Chloe and dad Mitch Window), contracted a flesh-eating disease . But the parents' fears for the lives of their newborns did not end there. Eight months later when Mason was admitted to hospital to have his colostomy removed he nearly lost his life to a dangerous flesh-eating virus. It perforated his bowel and ate tissue from his chest cavity. 'He had his colostomy when he was one-day-old so we had to wait until he was much older and bigger to have it removed,' Ms Perry told Daily Mail Australia. She was forced to deliver her twins via caesarean 10 weeks early after he water broke at 30 weeks . Eight months later when Mason was admitted to hospital to have his colostomy removed he nearly lost his life to a dangerous flesh-eating virus . After the surgery, Mason (pictured with his parents) - who was eight months at the time - started going down hill pretty quickly . About a month ago, Mason - who was eight months old - was admitted to Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane to have his colostomy removed, in what his mother described as a 'pretty routine operation'. After the surgery, the young boy went into recovery, but started to go downhill quickly. 'We were holding him and over a few hours he became really hot and had a fever,' Ms Perry revealed. 'His vital signs were dropping and he was having trouble breathing.' 'His stomach just tripled in size and had this red purple rash all over him, and as a mum you just know when something's not right.' Fortunately, Mason recovered from the virus. Here he is seen with his scar after having his colostomy removed . Ms Perry said her son's vital signs started dropping and he was having trouble breathing after the surgery . The infection had eaten all the tissue in Mason's chest and abdomen, leaving him fighting for his life . When the doctor who performed Mason's initial surgery came to check on the infant, he immediately rushed the baby back into theatre for an emergency procedure. 'It was a bug that pretty much just ate all the tissue in his chest and abdomen,' the twins' mother said. 'They said if we'd waited another hour or two he would have definitely died, it attacks so quickly,' Ms Perry added. Mason had contracted necrotising fasciitis, a serious rapidly spreading infection that results in death of tissue. 'It can be fatal if symptoms go undetected - approximately 25 per cent of patients with necrotising fasciitis and more than 30 per cent with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome die,' Fionnagh Dougan, Chief Executive of Children's Health Queensland, told Daily Mail Australia. 'A combination of bacteria caused Mason's case of necrotising fasciitis.' Ms Perry revealed after such a tough few months early on in Chloe and Mason's life, she did not know what to expect when he fell ill again . Thankfully Mason is now doing better but his mum says he is not quite back to normal just yet . Ms Perry said her and her partner were simply grateful for all the moments they got to share with their twins . Ms Perry praised the work of doctors at Lady Cilento where her son was treated, describing their work as 'amazing'. Ms Doughan echoed this. 'The speed at which Lady Cilento Children's Hospital clinicians identified Mason's symptoms was paramount to his recover,' Ms Doughan said. 'Mason’s treatment included the rapid administration of intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics and surgical removal of dying tissue as required. 'We were delighted that Mason responded quickly to the range of antibiotics prescribed to combat the bacteria.' Ms Perry revealed after such a tough few months early on in Chloe and Mason's life, she did not know what to expect when he fell ill again. When her waters broke at 23 weeks, the doctor's prognosis was nothing short of grim. 'They said that normally when your waters break you go into labour within 24 hours and they said that would probably happen,' Ms Perry said. 'They said they couldn't resuscitate a baby that small... so they said it would probably be best to wrap them up and keep them warm and cuddle them for as long as we can.' Luckily after a few hurdles, the twins were able to go home after eight weeks, but when Mason got sick again she thought she may never get to take her little boy home for good. 'I honestly thought I would never get to take him home. I remember just collapsing on the floor with my dad and saying ""That's my baby. What am I going to do if he dies?""' Ms Perry said. Thankfully Mason is now doing better but his mum says he is not quite back to normal. 'I think the professor that operated that said he's never seen something like what happened to Mason and he's lucky to be alive,' Ms Perry said. 'He's not himself, he doesn't want to be put down, and he was starting to crawl and sit up but he can't do that. 'I think he still feels very vulnerable.' But Ms Perry said her and her partner, Mitch Window, were simply grateful for all the moments they got to share with their twins. 'We don't take anything for granted,' she said.","Lauren Perry, 25, gave birth to her twins 10 weeks early at just 30 weeks .

"A Texas father is accused of shooting dead his 22-year-old son for coming to the defense of his mother during a heated domestic argument. Harris County Sheriff's officials say Ulysses Beaudoin, 39, gunned down Ulysses Nelson Tuesday night after showing up at the family's home in Katy with his mistress in tow. Deputies say the deadly confrontation took place at around 9amm at 6622 Gordon Drive in the Bear Creek Meadows subdivision. Scroll down for video .

"A South American president appears to have fallen for the oldest trick in the book after unwittingly posing for a photo next to a child wearing an 'I'm With Stupid' T-shirt. Ecuador's leader Rafael Correa was pictured with his arm around the boy - seemingly oblivious to the message on the shirt and the large arrow that was pointing in his direction. The casually-dressed 52-year-old is said to be able to speak fluent English - but seemingly failed to pick up the meaning of the T-shirt. Ecuador's leader Rafael Correa (right) posed for a picture next to a boy wearing an 'I'm With Stupid' T-shirt . The picture was shared thousands of times on social media networks in the country. It is now trending with the hashtag #IAmWithStupidMashi, referring to the official Twitter account of the president @MashiRafael. It also prompted thousands of comments including the suggestion that the child was a CIA agent brought in to damage the president's reputation. The phjoto was shared thousands of times and prompted a series of fake pictures, including the one above . However, his supporters quickly rallied behind him and used the hashtag #WeAreWithYouMashi to fight back. According to the BBC, the boy's mother said that her son had not known the meaning of the T-shirt himself and she is quoted as saying: 'We don't want to shame the president'. Correa, who was first elected in 2006, is popular among Ecuadorians for his government's social spending but has also faced criticism for intolerance of dissent.","Rafael Correa, who claims to speak English, pictured with arm around boy .

"His turn as Doctor Who was among the shortest incarnations of the Time Lord in the programme’s 52-year-history. But Christopher Eccleston has now suggested he quit the show after falling out with bosses over his decision to play the character with a strong northern accent. The 51-year-old actor, who grew up in Manchester, played the Doctor for just 13 episodes during the first series of the show’s revival in 2005. Scroll down for video . Too northern? Christopher Eccleston (pictured with Billie Piper on Doctor Who) has suggested he quit the show after falling out with show bosses over his decision to play the character with a strong northern accent . He proved a huge hit with fans, but only stayed for one run after falling out with then show boss Russell T Davies. Asked about his controversial departure from the programme, he told Radio Times: ‘I wanted to move him away from RP [received pronunciation] for the first time because we shouldn’t make a correlation between intellect and accent, although that still needs addressing. ‘I hope I’ll be remembered as one of the Doctors. I have no ill feeling towards the character or the series.’ He has previously hinted about a row with the show’s bosses, saying of his tenure in the role: ‘I didn’t agree with the way things were being run, or like the culture that grew up around the series.’ A total of twelve actors have played the Time Lord since the show first began in 1963. They include William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee, and more recently the likes of Paul McGann and Matt Smith. The 51-year-old actor played the Doctor for just 13 episodes in 2005 . The most recent incarnation is played by Scottish actor Peter Capaldi. The first Doctor Who episode was broadcast in November 1963 and the programme now attracts audiences of up to 16 million. The series has been sold to over 200 countries. The third son of working-class parents, Eccleston was brought up in Salford before going on to star in BBC drama series Our Friends in the North in 1996. He has also delivered a withering verdict on privileged actors such as Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch, claiming an increase in privately-educated stars is leading to ‘a milky, anodyne culture’. He added: ‘I still feel insecure, like a lot of my working-class contemporaries. I had a sense acting wasn’t for me because I’m not educated. I was a skinny, awkward-looking bugger with an accent, as I still am. ‘British society has always been based on inequality, particularly culturally. I’ve lived with it, but it’s much more pronounced now, and it would be difficult for someone like me to come through. ‘You can’t blame Eddie Redmayne [Eton], Benedict Cumberbatch [Harrow] and others taking their opportunities but it will lead to a milky, anodyne culture. To an extent that’s already happened. ‘I confess I don’t watch much film or television drama but I’m aware of the predominance of white, male roles. It’s not just about the working class. There’ s not enough writing for women or people of colour. ‘It frustrates me when they insist on doing all-male Shakespearean productions – a wonderful intellectual exercise, maybe, but it’s outrageous because it’s putting a lot of women out of work.’","Christopher Eccleston's turn was among shortest incarnations of Dr Who .

"A dramatic confrontation between an alleged Army impostor and a bystander in Florida has been caught on video. Eric Coins, who was drinking in the city of Sunrise posted the video to YouTube accusing the man of wearing the uniform to get free drinks and meet women. The stand-off between the two men almost comes to blows as Coins tells the man: 'There are people who f****** die in that uniform.' In the footage, a young man is seen on camera asking the alleged fake service member, a series of questions including where he did his basic and boot camp training. The man apparently says he did his basic training in North Carolina. The young man is then heard saying basic training is conducted in Fort Benning, Georgia and not Miami. Scroll down for video . A man (above) believed to be impersonating as an Army Infantry is captured in an emotionally-charged video with two men angry that he appears to be a phony in uniform without a name tape . The man wearing the uniform makes a comment that the guy confronting him is asking a lot of questions and then asks if he is in the army - to which the young man responds 'no.' As the confrontation continues, the young man asks the 'fake army infantryman' where his name badge is as he replies he 'took it out' because he 'does not want nobody knowing his name', before asking the young man if he is a cop. The young man is then seen on camera saying, 'you know it's a federal offense what you're doing right now. Do you know where infantry camp is? It's in Fort Benning, Georgia.' Following a commotion, the encounter gets increasingly tense as they begin raising their voices and shouting expletives at each other. The encounter begins with the young man approaches the 'fake service member' asking him a series of questions including where he did his basic and boot camp training . As the confrontation became tense, bar staff came over to tend to the shouting men (above one member of staff tries to stop the 'fake service member') after the young man asked for his Geneva Conventions Identification Card . The young man says: 'Do you realize what you are doing is a federal offense...where is your Geneva Conventions Identification Card?' The man responds 'Don't f****** try me n*****. What's wrong with this mother f*****? as he starts to instigate a fight. The young man then says angrily 'do you realize what you're doing is a federal offense' as the man walks over to him unbuttoning his shirt. The young man adds: 'There are people who f****** die in that uniform.' The man shouts back 'I'm in the f***** army mother f******.' In a second video posted by Coins, the bar's staff is seen holding back the man claiming to be an infantryman as his shirt is open. The young man is then heard shouting: 'Infantry boot camp is in f****** Fort Benning not Miami dumb a**.' The man shouts back 'f*** you mother f******' as staff try to stop a physical confrontation from occurring between the pair. The young man (pictured far right) shouted at the man: 'There are people who f****** die in that uniform' The incident captured in Sunrise, Florida comes after a panhandler in Tampa was called out for faking military connection by wearing a camouflage uniform . On YouTube Coins describes the incident writing: 'This guy was trying to pick up girls and get sympathy drinks in a battle ready uniform which wasn't even on properly let alone, wearing it at a bar. 'So we asked a few basic questions which threw him off and couldn't answer even where he got his infantry training or even boot camp for that matter... he's a scum to America and we couldn't let that fly.' The incident comes after an angry Army veteran called out a panhandler in Tampa, Florida last month for faking a military connection by wearing a camouflage uniform. Garrett Goodwin, who spent nearly 10 years in the Army as a combat medic, spotted the allegedly phony veteran while driving down the main road to MacDill Air Force Base on Sunday. When he first spoke with the beggar, Goodwin started to get suspicious since he claimed to be special forces but was wearing a Junior ROTC patch on his uniform. He then had a friend record him as he went back up to the panhandler and demanded to see his veterans ID card, which the unidentified panhandler said he didn't have. The clip then shows Goodwin pursuing the beggar across a busy intersection as he berates the man for wearing a uniform that 'my brothers died in'. The panhandler eventually discards of the uniform and Goodwin tells him to not put it back on. While he can't be 100 per cent certain that the man he confronted isn't a veteran, he says he's positive based on the panhandler's shamed reaction, riding off on his bike after the incident.","Unidentified man is captured in video claiming to be Army infantryman .

"Looking after someone with dementia can stretch people to their limits, and there are many in this situation. In England alone, there are more than 670,000 unpaid carers helping someone with dementia. Here, in the final week of our major Good Health series on dementia, we turn our attention to the carers and what can be done to make life easier for them and their loved ones... Scroll down for video . Looking after someone with dementia can stretch people to their limits. Here's how to make life easier . WHAT TO EXPECT . The early stages of the disease bring changes that may be so subtle that some friends and acquaintances are unaware that there is anything wrong - and this stage can continue for many years. But as the disease progresses and more damage is done to the brain, symptoms become more pronounced: difficulties with communication become more intense and issues such as getting dressed or managing day-to-day affairs become more problematic. This marks the beginning of the middle stage, the longest stage, which can last for several years. It's when the condition becomes more challenging and extra help may be needed. However, there will be good days as well as bad. The following can help . . . ESTABLISH ROUTINES . In the early stages of dementia, it's the short-term memory that's most affected, making it harder for patients to keep track of the day, or even what time of day it is. I've found that sticking to a routine helps keep someone with dementia better orientated, and gets their body clock into a rhythm. In the early stages, aim to establish fixed times of day for the following - it may help to write this on a board that's kept next to a calendar (cross it off to show what day it is) and a clock, so that they know what to expect when. In the middle stages of dementia, routines may still be useful but patients can be more prone to mood changes, so be flexible. Encourage but don't coerce. Often people with dementia may display more symptoms and anxiety as the light starts to fade . WHEN BEHAVIOUR CHANGES . The middle stage of dementia inevitably heralds changes in behaviour. This can be one of the toughest things to cope with, for at times it may seem as if the person you know and love has gone. The following are common: . Clinginess . This can be very draining as some people with dementia do not like to let their carer out of their sight. Clinginess is the return of a psychological reflex from our toddler years - a toddler will cry when their mother moves away or when a stranger approaches. As the dementia progresses, the loss of nerve cells in the brain allows old reflexes that were replaced in adulthood by more complex brain pathways to resurface. What to do: The best way to deal with it is by diluting contact - try introducing other regular carers as soon as the person being cared for starts to display any clingy behaviour. The clinging behaviour may now apply to many people, not just one. Wandering . Around 60 per cent of those with dementia wander - pacing around the house or outside of the home - and the problem is they can get lost, as the damage to the hippocampus part of the brain means they lose their sense of orientation. What to do: If they tell you they're going out don't argue but speak calmly and tell them they don't need to as they are 'staying here' tonight. Avoid busy places such as shopping centres. People with dementia may find these disorientating and when they get home this disorientation can continue and induce wandering so they may feel the urge to leave the house. Wandering about the house at night can arise from a need to go to the loo. Ensure they don't have too much fluid before bed and install night-lights to help prevent falls. Painting the walls and doors a matching colour makes it less likely that the person with dementia will find their way out. You could also consider moving the lock higher up the door to a less familiar place. You may want to consider installing movement sensors to alert you to potential problems. Anxiety . Worrying for no reason or displaying physical symptoms such as palpitations are signs that the dementia patient may be suffering with anxiety. What to do: Try to identify what's causing it - have there been more people round than normal, or have they had too much caffeine? Many of the triggers may be unavoidable, but it can help to keep their surroundings as comfortable and relaxing as possible. Put pictures and familiar possessions around them. Pleasant smells such as flowers, baking aromas and soap may trigger memories that help distract them from their anxious feelings. Playing music can also be calming. Talking to them can distract them, too. But never talk down to them or use childish language as this could make them angry. Anger and aggression . It can be confusing when someone who was once so patient and tolerant becomes prone to temper tantrums. What to do: It's important to consider any physical reasons that might be making them this way. Pain is a common cause of anger in those with dementia, as are urinary or chest infections, a stroke, or even something as simple as not having had enough sleep. If you suspect any of these is possible, then speak to a doctor. Speak to the person with dementia reassuringly, in a calm manner. Use music or a calming activity such as massaging or stroking their hand or brushing their hair to distract them. If, however, they seem aggressive do not put yourself in danger. If necessary, move back and wait for them to calm down. Keep the person busy at sundown and in the early evening . Sundowning . Often people with dementia have good and bad days but also good and bad times during a given day - and often they may display more symptoms and anxiety as the light starts to fade, becoming confused, agitated, restless or showing repetitive behaviours. This pattern is referred to as 'sundowning'. It's not clear why this happens - it's possible it's to do with a disruption to brain chemicals affecting the body clock. Two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's disease experience sundowning. It can occur at any stage of the condition, but tends to peak at the middle stage and lessen as the disease progresses. What to do: Keep the person busy at sundown and in the early evening. Avoid stimulants such as coffee or alcohol at this time of day as this may make them more excitable. A rocking chair can help as it is soothing and relaxing. It may also help to introduce more light into the room. LOOK THEM IN THE EYE WHEN YOU TALK . With dementia, the parts of the brain that normally deal with understanding, thought processing and language deteriorate. The patient may struggle with nuances and may lose their sense of humour; they may also get frustrated and cross when they can't quickly bring to mind the words they need. Furthermore, they may seem to get stuck in a loop and repeat the same question again and again. The following strategies can help tackle these issues: . Better to say: 'You seem to have put the crockery in the washing machine. Did you mean to put them in the dishwasher?' ■ Dr Souter is a retired GP and fellow of the Royal College of General Practitioners.

Before you start talking always engage eye contact to help get the person with dementia to focus on you. There can be a tendency for them to look away and this makes it harder for them to concentrate on the conversation.
Be careful about asking questions they may be unable to process. For example, if they're upset don't ask what's wrong as they may not know, or are unable to put it into words. Instead, tell them: 'You seem to be upset; let's think how we can make you feel better.'
Finishing sentences for them can increase frustration. It's better to ask if they'd like you to find words for them if they're having difficulty.
Watch their body language as this can give you clues about how they are feeling. For example, repetitive movements can mean they are anxious or scared, while withdrawing may mean they feel overwhelmed.
If they're doing something obviously wrong, for example putting dishes in the washing machine or clothes in a food cupboard, don't ask them why or castigate them - the reasoning side of their brain has been affected and pointing out their mistakes will only cause them embarrassment and frustration."
"The culprits behind the Hatton Garden raid may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin, it has emerged. In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the £60m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The gang, who fled the bank with diamonds, gold and silver worth more than £8.3m, have never been found. Scroll down for video . The culprits behind the Hatton Garden raid (pictured) may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin, it has emerged . In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the £60m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013 . It now appears that the Berlin heist bore all the hallmarks of the Easter weekend raid in London. During that near-identical raid - one of the biggest in London's jewellery quarter - 71 security boxes were raided before the gang made off with wheelie bins full of precious stones. The incidents - both of which involved the use of heavy duty drills - enthralled the nation, capturing the public's imagination with each new detail that emerged. During the Berlin theft, robbers are believed to have spent several weeks tunnelling 100ft underground, before drilling through 3ft of concrete walls to break into a bank's strongroom. Police were stumped when they discovered a giant hole cut through the wall with what appeared to be four cylindrical devices. Likewise, robbers in London used a heavy duty drill to bore holes into a reinforced, two-metre-thick wall so they could gain access to the safety deposit boxes. It came after the raiders broke into the building on the second floor, disabling the lift before lowering themselves down the shaft and breaking into the basement. Suspects caught on CCTV during the London heist were also dressed as construction workers - a tactic used in the Berlin raid . In a similar fashion to the German heist, the burglars timed their raid over the Easter bank holiday, entering after the premises emptied on Thursday night and leaving on Easter Sunday . The men then climbed back up to the ground floor to let other gang members in through a side entrance, before all making their way to the vaults where they drilled their way inside. In both cases, police are investigating the possibility of an insider helping the thieves. In London, there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company's premises, indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside. And in Berlin, police said the thieves had expert knowledge of the layout of the vaults, reiterated by the time they were afforded to create their all-important tunnel. Police later released this photo which they say is one of the suspects in the Berlin tunnel bank robbery . They also released these sketches showing who they believed had carried out the £8.3m raid. No-one has ever been convicted over the crime . Another similarity is the way the burglars disguised themselves before entering the building. The German thieves dressed as workmen and and waited until staff went home for the weekend to enter the bank. The tunnel was not discovered until 6am on the Monday morning when the robbers set fire to the impressive tunnel which breached one of the bank's walls. The robbers then simply used crowbars to smash open the safety deposit boxes. CCTV from the London heist also shows how the suspects dressed as construction workers and gasmen. Similarly, they timed their raid over the Easter bank holiday, entering after the premises emptied on Thursday night and leaving on Easter Sunday. Police investigating the Berlin theft were stumped when they discovered a giant hole cut through the wall with what appeared to be four cylindrical devices . The tunnel was not discovered until 6am on Monday morning when the robbers set fire to the impressive tunnel which breached one of the bank's walls . Meanwhile, in Berlin, police believe the robbers may have spent weeks digging the tunnel after renting a nearby lock-up garage under a false name, which they used to gain access to the strongroom. One of the theories behind the London jewel heist is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises. The Hatton Garden Safe Deposit company is housed in a seven-storey building, which accommodates 60 other businesses, including watch traders and diamond wholesalers. In another similarity, the Metropolitan Police were slammed as 'utterly incompetent' following the Hatton Garden raid as it emerged that an alarm going off on Good Friday was ignored. In Germany, private security guards were also blamed for ignoring an alarm which went off in the Volksbank's vaults two days before the crime was discovered. Robbers are believed to have spent several weeks tunnelling 100ft underground and through 3ft of concrete walls to break into a bank's strong room . Safety boxes remain open after the raid at Volksbank. Police believe the robbers may have spent weeks digging the tunnel after renting a nearby lock-up garage under a false name, which they used to gain access . Meanwhile criminologist Richard Hoskins said he has identified 'startling similarities' between the Hatton Garden raid and novel Black Echo, by Michael Connelly. The novel was based on real-life bank robbers dubbed 'The Hole In The Ground Gang' who struck three vaults in LA in 1986 and 1987, and were never caught. In the 1986 robbery, the gang tunneled into a bank vault over a long weekend, triggering alarms on the Friday that were not investigated, before raiding safety deposit boxes stored inside the vaults. It was not until the week following the raids that police were called and discovered the robbers had dug into the vault using heavy machinery, in very similar circumstances to the Hatton Garden raid. In both cases, heavy duty drills were used to break through concrete to gain access to the stolen goods . Value of items taken, including jewels, said to be between £60m and £200m. Raid took place over three-day Easter weekend when workers had left building. 71 safety deposit boxes raided. Burglars used heavy duty drill to bore holes into a reinforced, two-metre-thick wall so they could gain access to boxes. Thieves dressed as workmen and gasmen. Police criticised after alarm ignored on Good Friday. Value of items taken, including diamonds, gold and silver, said to be £8.3m. Raid took place after thieves accessed the building while it was closed for the weekend. 294 security vaults broken into. Burglars also used drill to break through 3ft of concrete walls to break into the bank's strong room. The thieves disguised themselves as workmen. Security guards criticised after alarm went off two days before tunnel found.","71 security boxes were raided over Easter weekend in £60m London heist .

"A two-year-old boy is recovering after falling into a cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo after his parents dangled him over the edge, officials said. The toddler's mother was holding him and another child when he slipped and fell between 10 to 12ft and into the pit on Saturday around 3pm. The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. Scroll down for video . A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

"Charged: Rejean Hermel Perron (pictured) has been accused of holding a woman captive for five days and subjecting her to multiple sexual assaults . A dog walker used nail clippers to free a kidnapped woman who police say was held prisoner and sexually assaulted by a Canadian man for five days. The 27-year-old sex trade worker emerged from a home in Toronto, Canada, bound by handcuffs, badly bruised and naked from the waist down begging for help. Peter Hamilton heard her cries as he was passing by and desperately tried to free her from her restraints. She told him that her kidnapper was still inside, but had fallen asleep. Mr Hamilton wanted to call the police, but had left his cell phone at home, forcing him to take out the only item he had on him - the nail clippers. Police claim Rejean Hermel Perron held the alleged victim at gunpoint on March 31 when she refused to go inside. He is then said to have held the woman for five days, subjecting her to sexual assaults including 'ritualistic actions' that officers said they were 'unfamiliar with'. Detectives believe there could be more victims who have yet to come forward. The 43-year-old is alleged to have met the woman, in the Sherbourne and Shuter Street area of the city before the pair returned to his home. The National Post reports that she became 'uncomfortable' and made it clear she wanted to leave. But he then allegedly produced the weapon and restrained her with duct tape and handcuffs. Police say she was subjected to multiple sexual assaults. Perron was arrested on Monday and later charged with sexual assault with a weapon, kidnapping, forcible confinement and assault. Describing the dramatic escape, Mr Hamilton told the CBC how he was walking his dog in the Dundas Street East and Jones Street area when he heard desperate pleas for help. Hero: Dog walker Peter Hamilton heard the woman's cries for help before he saw her come out of the house bound by restraints and naked from the waist down . Quick thinking: He wanted to call the police but left his cell phone at home, so had to use the only implement he had on him to free the woman - his nail clippers . He said a woman appeared on a veranda of a home but could not move further because of the restraints on her hands and feet. She warned him her kidnapper was still armed and inside the home. Mr Hamilton told CBC: 'My first thought was 'how do I get her out of here?' 'I knew this was a dangerous situation. I couldn't leave her, but I could not go back to my house to get my phone.' When a man emerged from the home, Mr Hamilton stood up ready for a confrontation. But the man then turned and fled, it is reported. Mr Hamilton added: 'This is where it could have taken a turn for the worse,' said Hamilton. 'He came out and he ran. He saw us and he just ran and that was a very good thing.' 'She was very emotionally distressed and she said, ""I'm sorry I have to put you through this."" There was nothing to apologize for. 'It's just the right thing to do. We live in a society where sometimes people turn a blind eye to what's going on around them.' In part, he has thankful for having his dog, as he wouldn't have been walking through the neighborhood for any reason. He told the Toronto Star: Without having that dog, I wouldn't have taken a walk through the neighbourhood, and if he hadn't taken a walk, he wouldn't have encountered a shocking crime in progress, and wouldn't have had the opportunity to intervene and possibly save a woman's life. 'Whatever fate or destiny comes into it, the dog has as much of a part. 'The horror of what happened to her, of what she had gone through, hadn't really sunk into me yet. 'What sinks into you is the horror you're seeing right now, which is that there's a naked woman on the floor in handcuffs who needs help.' After he contacted police, Mr Hamilton said he spent the day with his wife and went for a hike out of town. 'That was good. It calmed everybody down,' he said. The woman was rushed to hospital after passers-by called emergency services and is said to be recovering. Crime scene: After Mr Hamilton helped free the woman, a man emerged from the house, so they ran.

"Claim: Murder suspect Dmitri Kovtun says that Alexander Litvinenko killed himself by mistake . One of the men accused of killing Alexander Litvinenko claimed today that the Russian spy's death may have been an 'accidental suicide' after he inadvertently handled polonium. Dmitri Kovtun, who is wanted for the dissident's murder, insisted that he was not involved in Mr Litvinenko's death and suggested that he had poisoned himself without knowing it. The suspect, a former KGB agent, has agreed to give evidence at the inquiry into Litvinenko's death as long as he is given the right to examine secret evidence put forward by the police. If Kovtun testifies, he will have to do so by video link, because he will be arrested on suspicion of murder if he tries to travel to Britain. Mr Litvinenko met with Kovtun and Alexander Lugovoi, another former spy, in London shortly before he fell ill with radiation poisoning in November 2006 and died at the age of 43. At a press conference in Russia today, Kovtun asserted his innocence and blamed Mr Litvinenko for his own death - saying he was carrying around polonium rather than being given it by Kovtun and Lugovoi, as has been previously claimed. He described the death as an 'accidental suicide', adding: 'I am more than sure that he was dealing with polonium without knowing it. 'Maybe there was some kind of polonium leak and it was gradually accumulating in his body. 'I don't know if he had it with him or if somebody gave him something that he carried with him. Where he got the polonium from, that is the question.' Scroll down for video . Killed: Litvinenko died of radiation poisoning in November 2006 after meeting Kovtun and Alexander Lugovoi . Denial: Kovtun told a press conference today that he had no involvement in Litvinenko's death . The inquiry has previously heard that Mr Litvinenko ingested polonium-210 when he drank a cup of tea during a meeting with the two ex-KGB men at the Millennium Hotel in central London. But Kovtun said this was impossible, adding: 'Litvinenko told me that he would not eat anything because the night before he got terrible poisoning, was throwing up all night, and called an ambulance. 'That proves our total innocence, that he had already come into contact with polonium, perhaps several days before our meeting.' He insisted that the reason he and Lugovoi left a trail of polonium around London during their visit to the city was because they had been contaminated by their meeting with Mr Litvinenko. Polonium is exceptionally rare, and experts have previously said that the amount ingested by the victim could only have been produced in a government-run facility. Suspects: Kovtun, left, and Lugovoi, right, have previously refused to co-operate with the public inquiry into Litvinenko's death . Meeting: Litvinenko fell ill after going to see Kovtun and Lugovoi at the Millennium Hotel in London, pictured . The two suspects had refused to co-operate with the public inquiry currently under way into Mr Litvinenko's death, saying that it would be biased against them. But last month, Kovtun dramatically changed his mind, and said that he would give evidence only if he is given 'core participant' status. At today's press conference, he told reporters: 'If I don't get this status, I will not participate.' Chairman Sir Robert Owen has issued Kovtun with a list of conditions which he must fulfil in order to be given the status, including issuing a full witness statement and disclosing all relevant documents. However, even if he is allowed to become a core participant he will not be given access to restricted material. Family: Litvinenko's son Anatoly and wife Marina outside the inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice . The inquiry has set aside three days in late July for Kovtun to give evidence over video link. Mr Litvinenko accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of being responsible for his killing in a statement issued from his deathbed. The spy fled Russia and sought refuge in Britain in 2000, after he spoke against Putin, who he claimed had ordered him to kill tycoon Boris Berezovsky. The inquiry was shown video footage of Russian special forces using a photograph of Mr Litvinenko as target practice, as well as a picture of him looking gaunt and weak hours before he died.","Dmitri Kovtun claims Alexander Litvinenko was carrying around polonium without knowing it .

"These extraordinary pictures show more than 1,700 Chinese students taking an exam in their high school's playground - because they could not all fit inside. The freshmen students from Yichuan, Shaanxi province took the exam on Saturday in the first attempt by the school to allow pupils to sit exams in the open. The school said the reason behind the unusual move was the lack of sufficient indoor space - and added that it could be a test of the students' organizing capacity, the People's Daily Online reported. The paper reported that the Grade One students at Yichuan Senior High School suggested and organised the outdoor exam themselves. The students thought of everything and in order to avoid being dazzled by the sunshine, which may have caused them to feel dizzy, a regular radio announcement ordered pupils to turn their chairs and desks collectively from time to time. The newspaper reported that many of the students believe sitting the exam outside is a novel way to broaden their horizons and encourage them to feel more relaxed. Some of the students also suggested it could help to prevent cheating. 'Grade One students suggested they organise the exam in such a way,' said one unnamed teacher.

"When journalist Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's rapidly growing, yet unregulated, gestational surrogacy industry for HBO documentary series Vice, she didn't anticipate 'how dark' the story would get. For nearly two years, the producer and host has been reporting on current issues across the globe and has covered everything from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay to the effect of climate change on polar bears - but nothing could have prepared her for the moment when someone offered to sell her a baby over dinner while she was working undercover in India. 'It was the most heartbreaking experience that I ever had,' Gianna told Daily Mail Online. Baby business: Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni (pictured) traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry . Shady deal: The journalist from Brooklyn, New York, went undercover to meet with an agent in India who offered to get her a baby in two to three months . But the heartbreak did not end there. As Gianna quickly learned during her time working on the Outsourcing Embryos documentary, surrogacy in India is a multi-million dollar business, and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of American couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the ‘embryo outsourcing’ agencies featured in the Vice documentary. During her time spent undercover posing as one of these people, Gianna was informed that, in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product, doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates, which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies. And if an 'extra' baby is born, it isn't necessarily going home with its genetic parents. There are also issues with couples never making it to India to claim their children for whatever reasons, meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent. For the most recent episode in the Vice series, Gianna went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a Caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact ‘extra’ babies being sold on the black market. The agent then tried to convince Gianna and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant. Shocking offer: One of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them . No morals: The agent eventually offered to sell Gianna and her team the baby over dinner . Gianna noted that the agent spoke with a 'shocking amount of ease' and 'talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner. 'It made me think it wasn't a one-off thing,' she explained to Daily Mail Online. Gianna never once considered buying the baby, but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother, she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer, knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise, particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody. 'When I go on these stories, I am a human being first and a journalist second,' she said of her initial reaction to the offer. The sale of 'extra' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by Gianna and her team. In the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000, and Gianna explained that 'the reoccurring theme' when speaking with American agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money. Commercial surrogacy in India costs nearly one-sixth the amount it would in the Western World. 'That seems to be the main driver,' she explained, before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element. No options: Many of the surrogates who spoke with Gianna said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money . Dormitory: The women who agree to be surrogates at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth . Tight quarters: Two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room . And while American parents see the surrogacy business in India as being a ‘cheap’ alternative to the services offered at home, the amount of money made by a surrogate in India can vastly change her life, as well as the life of her family. Women can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school, and Gianna explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives. But there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they can't read, only to be duped out of the money they were promised. When I go on these stories I am a human being first and a journalist second . Surrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day. Gianna, who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic, in the town of Gujarat, in the west of India, was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate's C-section. Dr Patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in any other profession. And while Gianna explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate, the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they didn't have any other options. During the episode, a surrogate named Vasanti told Gianna: 'Nobody likes doing this.' Dishonest: Although Dr Patel maintained that she didn't search for surrogates from the slums, Gianna met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area . No choice: A doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates. Surrogates have to undergo C-sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day . Too quick: Almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate, the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country . She continued: 'I didn't have a home, so I thought I could build one by being a surrogate.’ Another surrogate named Nisha explained that she was 'helpless' and had 'no alternatives'. Gianna was overcome by many of the surrogates' desperation. 'It is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body, that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive,' she said. Gianna recalled speaking with one surrogate's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate. He made clear that he didn't force her into the role, but explained that it was necessary for their family's survival. 'It all went back to money,' Gianna noted. As a whole, Gianna said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the 'shadier side' of commercialized surrogacy, but a 'vast majority’ have no idea this dark underbelly exits. Gianna recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent, the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with.","Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry for the HBO series .

"These eerie photographs show the inside of an abandoned 19th century Victorian  asylum which has lay dormant for 20 years. Opened in 1818, the asylum once housed nearly 1,000 patients and expands over 350 metres in length overlooking the town of Stafford in the West Midlands. It closed in 1995 but is now set to have new life breathed into it after planning permission was granted to build 102 apartments in its place. Shattered doors, overturned bathtubs and crumbling floors dominate the Grade II listed St George's County Asylum where patients were restrained by means of 'the leather muff,' 'iron handcuffs' and 'restraint chair'. There are also reports of prevalent dysentery and syphilis. Scroll down for video . A mysterious past: The history of this 19th century asylum in the West Midlands saw patients being restrained by means of 'the leather muff,' 'iron handcuffs' and 'restraint chair'. St George's County Asylum first opened in 1818 and once housed nearly 1,000 patients . Run down: Shattered doors, overturned bathtubs and crumbling floors dominate the Grade II listed St George's County Asylum in Stafford . Empty room: The asylum was initially large enough for 120 patients but between 1879 and 1884 two extra wings were added. This included workshops and bakeries bringing capacity to just under 1,000. The hospital shut its doors in 1995 and 145 long-term patients were re-located . Derelict: An overturned bath tub as it was abandoned (left). Dysentery and syphilis were said to have been commonplace at the now run down asylum (as pictured in 1940 right) where suicide cages were erected in the stairwells after a female patient threw herself off the fourth floor . Suicide cages were erected in the stairwells after a female patient threw herself off the fourth floor and landed near the reception. It now lies in a terrible state, but building work is under way to transform the site into new homes. Property developer Shropshire Homes is beginning work on demolishing parts of the asylum beyond repair as part of a project to revamp the structure into 102 apartments. The apartments, the first of which are due to be occupied by early next year, will be priced between just under £100,000 and up to £300,000 for what company director Howard Thorne described as the 'penthouse apartments'. He said the parts of the asylum being demolished were 'structurally unsound' and that it was impossible for them to be preserved. St George's County Asylum, which was renamed St George’s Hospital in 1937, was built at a time when Pauper Asylums were being constructed nationwide. It was designed by Joseph Potter in the style of a Georgian mansion at a cost of £35,000. It was initially large enough to hold 120 patients but between 1879 and 1884 two extra wings were added. This included workshops and bakeries bringing capacity to just under 1,000. The lauded James Wilkes who was medical superintendent of the asylum from 1841 - 1855 said this about conditions before he arrived at his post. 'Previous to the year 1841, mechanical restraints were part of the system of treatment habitually employed. In need of a makeover: The asylum is now set to be transformed into 102 apartments. Parts of the building will have to be demolished as they are beyond repair but the main structure is to be converted into the apartments. The project is planned for completion by early 2017 .

Back in the day: Taken in 1992, this picture show what the asylum looked like before falling into disrepair. It closed three years later in 1995 . 'The means of restraint employed were the leather muff and wrist straps, iron handcuffs, long leather sleeves, hobbles for the legs, the restraint chair and various other devices. 'Many of them were employed day and night. In addition many of the patients were confined to their beds by means of straps passing through iron loops. 'The evil of this system was perpetuated by high windows protected by iron guards and strongly guarded fireplaces which gave a gloomy prison like aspect to the interior of the building. 'Above all it was evident that the system adopted had a natural and inevitable tendency to demoralise if not to brutalize the attendants.' The hospital shut its doors in 1995 and 145 long-term patients who still lived at the asylum were re-located into the surrounding community. The means of restraint employed were the leather muff and wrist straps, iron handcuffs, long leather sleeves, hobbles for the legs, the restraint chair and various other devices, according to James Wilkes who was medical superintendent of the asylum from 1841-1855 .

"A married dentist forced his practice nurse to resign after she rejected his attempts to kiss her, a tribunal heard. Colin Cromie told Xara Grogan, 29, they should jet to Barcelona for a break and claimed they were both stuck with the wrong partner. But when she turned down his advances their working relationship soured and Mr Cromie, 49, became increasingly hostile and unfriendly. He would also snatch instruments from her in the surgery and be ‘abrupt and rude’ and blamed her for a fall-out with another dental practice. Married dentist Colin Cromie (left), 49, forced practice nurse Xara Grogan (right), 29, to resign after she rejected his attempts to kiss her, a tribunal heard . When Miss Grogan complained about having to wear a uniform, including culottes, Mr Cromie, a former major in the Royal Army Dental Corps, told her she would be ‘out on her ear’ if she joined a union, it was alleged. On another occasion as she was helping a dental technician to organise a quote for dentures, Mr Cromie shouted at her and told her she should ‘know her place’. And on a separate occasion Mr Cromie gave Miss Grogan a dressing-down for failing to set up the practice’s reception, when a colleague who arrived late went unpunished. Mr Cromie made life so unpleasant the nurse was later forced to quit the job she had held for more than five years. The tribunal found Miss Grogan was constructively dismissed by Mr Cromie and his conduct towards the nurse did amount to sex discrimination. But she failed in her bid to prove further allegations of harassment and victimisation against the dentist. She was awarded £16,500 compensation for the dismissal and ‘hurt feelings’ as well as back pay that she was owed. Workplace: Mr Cromie hired Miss Grogan to work at Petre Dental, pictured, in Lancashire . The hearing was told Miss Grogan had worked for Mr Cromie in two spells from 2008 in two separate practices he had set up. She had been in a relationship with Mr Cromie’s stepson, Paul Talbot, and the pair had lived with the dentist and his wife. But relations between the dentist and his nurse began to change when Mr Cromie began sharing ‘sexist’ jokes with her via text message and then offered to take her to Barcelona. He told Miss Grogan, who had been arguing with her partner, that they were each with the wrong partners and attempted to hug and kiss her. Miss Grogan (above) initially complained to the practice manager, Diane Talbot – Mr Cromie’s wife – and became frustrated when no action was taken . When she turned him down he became ‘increasingly hostile’, treating her to ‘extended silences and outbursts’, according to the tribunal’s official ruling. Miss Grogan complained to the practice manager, Diane Talbot – Mr Cromie’s wife – and became frustrated when no action was taken. She eventually resigned from her job as a nurse at the Petre Dental practice in Clay-le-Moors, Lancashire, and claimed unfair dismissal and sexual discrimination against the dentist. Mr Cromie denied trying to kiss the nurse but employment judge Katherine Ross said: ‘Mr Cromie absolutely denied the allegation. The claimant said it occurred. The tribunal finds that the incident occurred.’ The tribunal was told that shortly after the incident Miss Grogan was so shocked she told a fellow dental nurse, Louise Clail. In her ruling Judge Ross added: ‘Although there had been a high degree of familiarity between Mr Cromie and the claimant, based on her position in the extended family, their close working relationship and the sexual language which passed between them, attempting to kiss the claimant was an action which was physical and sexual.’ After the case Miss Grogan said on Facebook that the case had represented ‘a tough couple of years’ and she was looking forward to moving on. She added: ‘He will do it again I don’t doubt it. I would hope he treats the girls he works with now with a little more respect.’ Mr Cromie said Miss Grogan had only succeeded in ‘two out of six’ claims and this was reflected in her ‘modest’ pay-out.","Colin Cromie hired his stepson's girlfriend Xara Grogan as a dental nurse .

"Todd Kincannon, 33, has been arrested and charged with criminal domestic violence following an incident involving his wife last month . A Columbia attorney and former executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party has been arrested and charged with criminal domestic violence following an incident involving his wife last month. Todd Kincannon, 33, was arrested and booked into the Lexington County Detention Center on Monday evening. A bond hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. An arrest warrant alleges that Kincannon's wife, Ashely Griffith, told deputies that he grabbed her arm during a March 26 argument in their car, 'squeezing it tightly, thus preventing her from exiting the vehicle.' Griffith told police Kincannon threatened to kill her, himself and her family during the incident – threats he is accused of having made previously. 'It should be noted Ashely was trembling as she wrote her statement,' the report said. According to Kincannon, he 'accidentally overdosed' on the prescription drug Benzonatate – which he says he was taking to deal with an upper respiratory infection. An arrest warrant alleges that Kincannon's wife, Ashely Griffith, told deputies that he threatened to kill her, himself and her family during the incident – threats the lawyer is accused of having made previously also . 'Basically, I went completely crazy after taking it,' Kincannon told The  City Paper two days after the incident. 'I don't even remember all of it. My wife called 911 because she was worried about me and my behavior was way out of character and erratic, and she was afraid for her safety and mine.' In the aftermath of that statement, it emerged that Griffith has more than forty-eight hours of audio recordings of her husband verbally abusing her as well as photographic evidence of possible domestic abuse, reports FITS. In one clip Kincannon tells Griffith he will have his 'revenge' if she leaves him, and that he will make her 'very f*cking sorry' if she fails to follow his instructions for improving their marriage. 'Now I’m going to tell you right now – I can’t survive in this f*cking environment that you create with your bad attitude and your unhappy spirit,' Kincannon said. 'I’m – I’m sick of it and I’m done with it. And I want to make very clear to you – I don’t give a sh*t about you, or about any of the sh*t in your life. I don’t give a sh*t about all your f*cking divorce threats. You have pushed me so far down the hole that I don’t care any more.' Kincannon, who refers to himself as the 'honey badger of American politics', has gained a reputation on Twitter for sending inflammatory tweets that have regularly left him open to accusations of racism and sexism . Kincannon, who refers to himself as the 'honey badger of American politics', has gained a reputation on Twitter for sending inflammatory tweets that have regularly left him open to accusations of racism and sexism. Last September in the wake of the NFL scandal about Ray Rice brutally knocking out Janay Palmer, Kincannon tweeted that she deserved it. 'I hope the dumb *itch who initiated physical violence with her NFL player fiance leanred a good lesson when he justifably beat her ass,' he tweeted. Kincannon, who has always refused to apologise for his provocative tweets, appears to have deleted his Twitter account in the wake of his recent arrest.","Todd Kincannon, 33, has been arrested and charged with criminal domestic violence following an incident involving his wife last month .

"In the dock: Victorino Chua, 49, has given evidence for the first time and denied he murdered three and poisoned 18 more at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport . A nurse today told a jury he did not murder three hospital patients and poison almost 20 others on his ward by contaminating their medicine with insulin. Victorino Chua, 49, has given evidence for the first time  and denied he tampered with saline bags and ampoules  at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport in order to kill and injure people he was caring for. Chua denies murdering patients Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71 and Derek Weaver, 83, and deliberately poisoning 18 others between 2011 and 2012. The prosecution claim the defendant changed tack in January 2012 amid an ongoing police investigation and increased security when he deliberately altered drug dosages on prescription charts. His barrister, Peter Griffiths QC, today told the defendant that he would ask him some questions about his family and personal life but first would ask specific questions about the charges he faces. Focusing first on the events of summer 2011 at the Stockport hospital, Mr Griffiths said to Chua:'My first question to you is did you ever at any time contaminate any medical product with any insulin?' Chua replied: 'No sir.' Turning to the charges he murdered patients Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83, Mr Griffiths asked: 'As far as those three patients, deceased now of course, it is not suggested in this case that they were in your care at material times but I must ask ask this question, did you ever intend to kill those patients?' Chua said again: 'No sir.' Mr Griffiths said: 'Did you ever intend to cause those patients, or any patient, serious harm - that is grievous bodily harm?' Chua replied: 'No sir.' Chua has pleaded not guilty to 36 charges in all, including three alleged murders, one count of grievous bodily harm with intent, 23 counts of attempted grievous bodily harm, eight counts of attempting to cause a poison to be administered and one count of administering a poison. Deaths on the ward: (Left to right) Patients Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71 and Derek Weaver, 83, were all allegedly murdered by their nurse . Allegations: Chua is accused of killing three patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, pictured, by injecting medical products with insulin . He also told Mr Griffiths in relation to two counts that he had not contaminated a bottle of antibiotics with insulin or contaminated a saline bag with a drug named Lidocaine. Addressing the January 2012 charges, Mr Griffiths said to the witness: 'The underlying and fundamental allegations laid against you by the prosecution is that you altered the prescription charts of patients. My question is this, did you alter any of those prescription charts?' Chua replied: 'No sir.' Mr Griffiths said: 'In each of these counts, there is an added ingredient that you had an intention to injure, aggrieve or annoy. Did you ever intend to injure, aggrieve or annoy any patient?' 'No sir,' said Chua. Then he was asked about a specific alleged victim, Gillian Millar, who he is said to have attempted to administer poison to in January 2012. Mr Griffiths said: 'Gillian Millar, her prescription chart was not altered but it is alleged by the prosecution that you offered some sort of unprescribed medicine to that lady after she arrived on the ward. Did you do so?' The Filipino father-of-two replied: 'No sir.' Yesterday his trial heard he had warned there was ‘a devil’ in him in a letter, a jury heard yesterday. Document: Extracts from the 13-page note show that Chua wrote about 'a devil in me', going 'straight to hell' and being 'an evil person' making a 'bitter nurse confession' Victorino Chua penned what he called a ‘bitter nurse confession’ in which he spelled out ‘how an angel can turn to an evil person’. In 13 pages of rambling, broken handwritten English, the Filipino nurse said he might ‘explode’ at any time, adding: ‘If I will be pushed, they gonna be sorry.’ His lawyers say the document – found in his home following his arrest – is not a criminal confession but an ‘outlet for his anger and frustration’ written at the suggestion of a counsellor 12 months before the first alleged poisoning. But questioned by detectives after his arrest for changing patients’ prescriptions on the wards, the 49-year-old said: ‘Sometimes I snap’. Dependant on painkillers, sleeping tablets and antidepressants, Chua also wrote that he sometimes felt like killing himself, but feared he would ‘go straight to hell no questions asked’. Chua denies murder as well as 24 counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, eight of attempting to administer poison, one of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and one of administering poison. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Victorino Chua, 49, denies murdering patients at Stockport hospital in 2011 .

"The Great British Bake Off presenter Sue Perkins is taking a break from Twitter after men began sending her death threats in response to her becoming the bookmakers' favourite to replace Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear. Last week, a flurry of bets placed on Perkins, 45, propelled her to the top spot for the now-vacant position, according to bookmakers Coral. But announcing her departure from the social media site this morning, the popular TV personality tweeted: 'My timeline has been full of blokes wishing me dead...

"Ed Balls has been accused of treating the public with 'contempt' after dismissing as a 'joke' the infamous Labour note admitting the party had blown the nation's finances. The shadow chancellor said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note'. Mr Byrne's glib note to his successor as Treasury Secretary stated: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money. Kind regards – and good luck! Liam.' Scroll down for video . Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 . The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by David Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Ed Balls, pictured in Birmingham today, said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' Former Treasury Secretary Liam Byrne left the note to his successor David Laws in 2010 . The Tories this morning slammed Mr Balls's remarks – claiming they showed that he had not learnt the lessons from the great economic crash. Treasury minister David Gauke said: 'The fact that Ed Balls thinks the debt they left the country was a 'joke' goes to show the contempt they hold the public in. 'It is clear Labour has not learnt the lessons of the past and would do the same all over again - more taxes, more borrowing and more debt.' The letter has haunted Labour for years, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation's coffers were empty. The letter consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation's finances, only a glib 'good luck' to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess. Written in blue ink on government note paper, it was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed. Lib Dem Mr Laws said: 'He left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it. I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.' Mr Byrne has admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life. He said: 'It was a very foolish thing to do. 'I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private. 'There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.'","Letter was left in the Treasury by the former minister Liam Byrne in 2010 .

"A 1-year-old girl was shot in the head and left clinging to life as she sat in a car with her parents in what suburban Seattle police initially described as an apparent case of road rage. The baby was in 'very critical condition' Friday, a day after the shooting, said Susan Gregg, a spokeswoman for Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Baby Malaja was in a car seat in the back of a silver Chevrolet Impala and her parents were in the front seat when a black car pulled alongside around at 4.30pm Thursday, Kent police spokeswoman Melanie Robinson said. Scroll down for video . Innocent victim: One-year-old Malaja (left and right) was shot in the head as she sat in a car with her parents in suburban Seattle Thursday afternoon. She remains in critical condition . Target: Police say a black car pulled alongside this silver Chevrolet Impala carrying Malaja and the driver and passenger opened fire, striking the 1-year-old in the head . On the road: The shooting took place at an intersection near an apartment complex in Kent, Washington . Robinson said the driver and passenger of the black car opened fire, then drove off, but police did not give details on the possible conflict between the people in both vehicles.

"A 78-year-old woman used her own detective work to track down a burglar who had stolen her jewellery during a raid on her home. Nina Anderson searched pawn shops near her house in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after gold and silver necklaces worth nearly £400 were taken from her bedroom as she watched television. The great-grandmother, who lives with husband Maurice, 75, eventually spotted two of the stolen items in the window of a Cash and Cheque Express in the city centre two months after the raid. Her actions, which echo those of Agatha Christie character Miss Marple, led to the arrest of burglar Martin Campbell, who has now been jailed for three years. Detective: Nina Anderson, pictured with husband Maurice, 75, searched pawn shops near their house in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after gold and silver necklaces  were taken from her bedroom as she watched TV . Real-life Miss Marple: Mrs Anderson's (left with her husband) actions mirror those of Agatha Christie character Miss Marple, who was played on ITV by actress Geraldine McEwan (right) between 2004 and 2007 . Portsmouth Crown Court heard Campbell, who had been hired to do odd jobs for the couple, forced his way into the  house when Mrs Anderson was at home alone on December 28. He was arrested by police when Mrs Anderson noticed necklaces missing from her jewellery box, but was later released with no further action. Determined to retrieve her stolen jewellery, Mrs Anderson began looking in nearby pawn shops. She spotted  two of the missing necklaces in the window of a branch of Cash and Cheque Express on February 19. The pawn shop was able to provide a bank statement, photo ID and ownership declaration that Campbell, 28, had provided when he sold the jewellery. Mrs Anderson contacted the police, who used the records to re-arrest Campbell. Mrs Anderson's actions mirror those of  Miss Marple, a fictional character who appears in 12 of Agatha Christie's novels, solving difficult crimes with her shrewd intelligence. Breaking in: Campbell forced his way into the house when Mrs Anderson was at home alone. Above, the damage done to the door during the raid . She said: 'I left copies of the stolen gold in pawn shops around the city. 'I found myself looking in the windows every time I passed by. Then this time something caught my eye - it was my silver necklace. 'It took my work to do it, otherwise we wouldn't have heard anything.' Prosecutor Martyn Booth told Portsmouth Crown Court: 'The police had effectively concluded their investigations. Thankfully the Andersons had conducted their own enquiries. 'Enquiries established that the defendant had turned up on December 30 two days after the burglary trying to sell the items.' An 18ct gold necklace with an image of St Anthony that Mrs Anderson's late father gave to her when she left Italy in 1957 is still missing. Mrs Anderson said she had treated Campbell like 'one of the family' when she hired him as a handyman and that the burglary was a 'great betrayal'. She said: 'We can't trust anybody, I'm locking myself in. I've been through quite a lot, I've been traumatised. I've had to go to the doctors to get sleeping tablets.' Barry McElduff, defending, handed a letter to the judge written by Campbell apologising to the Andersons. Mr McElduff said: 'He accepts full responsibility for he offences. He expresses remorse and shame. Temptation got the better of him.' The father-of-one has had 24 court appearances for 40 offences, including previous burglaries in 2002, 2003 and 2006. He admitted burglary and fraud relating to pawning the jewellery. He was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison in addition to a suspended sentence for stealing a bicycle that he was serving when he committed the crime. Link: Cristos Charalambides, franchisee of the Cash and Cheque Express where the jewellery was found, with Nina and Maurice Anderson. The pawn shop was able to provide records that traced back to Campbell . Sentencing Campbell to three years, Judge Sarah Munro QC said: 'You describe them as people with hearts of gold. 'You threw their kindness back in their faces as you did their trust in you by breaking into their home and stealing jewellery. These offences, as I hope you understand, were a great betrayal. 'They've led to a considerable detrimental effect on that couple.' The officer investigating the burglary has praised the Andersons for their detective work. He said: 'It was her integrity which led to the recovery of two items. We always encourage victims of crime to check out the normal joints, second hand shops, pawn shops.'

"Europe has been urged to copy Australia's military-led 'stop the boats' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean. Australian PM Tony Abbott – who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach Australia – said the EU should 'urgently' follow his lead. His hardline policy has proved controversial but Mr Abbott said it was the only way to prevent disasters such as the loss of 900 lives when a fishing boat capsized on Saturday night. Hardline: Tony Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania yesterday morning . Solemn: A young man, bows his head as he makes the short walk from the rescue boat's deck to the Catania shore where hundreds of people had gathered . New life: Members of the Italian Police look on as a migrant who survived the ship sinking off the coast of Libya walks the ramp of an Italian Coast Guard's vessel upon arrival at Catania's port yesterday morning . He said: 'The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats. 'That's why it is so urgent that the countries of Europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people-smuggling trade across the Mediterranean.' Conservative Mr Abbott won power in 2013 on a 'stop the boats' pledge, and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months. Operation Sovereign Borders involves the Australian Navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea, and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from. Mr Abbott has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the United Nations over Australia's obligations to refugees, saying his policy was the 'most decent, most compassionate' solution. In the Mediterranean, callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by European nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back. Last year, Italy scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives. But the horrific loss of life over the past week in a spate of migrant shipwrecks has prompted calls to urgently reinstate the rescue missions. EU leaders including David Cameron are meeting tomorrow in what charities are calling a 'life or death' summit to solve the problem. Save the Children warned that 2,500 youngsters could die in the Mediterranean this year. Chief executive Justin Forsyth said: 'EU leaders hold the lives of thousands of desperate people in their hands when they meet. 'With every day that they prevaricate and delay restarting search and rescue operations, the risk grows that more people will die.' Taken to safety: An unknown survivor of the Mediterranean migrant tragedy is wheeled off an Italian coastguard ship in the Sicilian city of Catania . Horror: A man carries the body of a dead child onto the Greek island of Rhodes after a boat carrying dozens of people ran aground, killing at least three in one of a number of tragedies involving migrants in recent days . Chaos: Video footage shows a large, wooden double-masted boat with people packed on board, just metres away from the Greek island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea . Migrant boats approaching Australian waters are turned back by the Navy or sometimes even towed back to where they came from. Any vessels which manage to get close are taken under naval escort to the Pacific islands of Nauru or Papua New Guinea, where they are detained while migrants' asylum claims are processed. Migrants are then matched with a country that will resettle them. Those detained on Nauru are sent to Cambodia, which is paid to take them by the Australian government. A similar arrangement exists with Papua New Guinea for those detained there. Any migrants who actually make it to Australia by sea are automatically blocked from staying – even if they are found to be genuine refugees. The controversial scheme – which began 18 months ago has been attacked by human rights advocates who say it violates Australia's international obligations. However the government says it has greatly reduced the number of illegal immigrants arriving on Australian shores. Yesterday Mr Cameron pledged the UK would 'make a contribution' to search and rescue operations. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said refugees also needed to be persuaded to stay in their home countries in the first place. 'We've got to start in the upstream countries. We've got to deal with the traffickers,' he said, adding he 'absolutely' supported a 'more formidable operation on the sea'. Ed Miliband said the Government's policy of 'leaving people to drown' had been 'wrong'. The Labour leader said: 'Frankly I think it is a stain on Europe to have these things happening. 'We've got to act on search and rescue, and that is about basic humanity and I think that people all around the country will recognise this.' London Mayor Boris Johnson said Britain had a 'moral duty' to do more. 'I think it is an absolute tragedy and obviously we must do whatever we can to help the humanitarian response,' he said. One of the architects of Australia's tough border policies, retired Army Major-General Jim Molan, said European leaders were guilty of 'incompetence'. Mr Molan said the tragedies were 'worsened by Europe's refusal to learn from its own mistakes and from the efforts of others who have handled similar problems'. In the Mediterranean, the tide of human misery has only worsened. Saturday's disaster was the most catastrophic in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year – 30 times higher than the same period in 2014. In the past week alone, more than 1,000 have died. Border chiefs have warned that one million migrants are waiting to set sail off the coast of Libya, with the need for drastic action to address the crisis greater than ever before. Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has warned of a 'genocide' and said: 'Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction.' Rescue: A woman is laid to the ground after being rescued by Greek men as she tried to reach Europe aboard a wooden boat which ran aground on the island of Rhodes, killing three people . Saved: Three people died after a boat carrying dozens of migrants ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes . Sunday morning: Italian coastguard responds to migrant ship after it capsizes off the coast of Libya with 700 passengers unaccounted for . Sunday afternoon: Passengers accounts of the ship say as many as 950 people may have been on board with 300 locked in the hull. Another boat is rescued off Sicily carrying 100 Syrian refugees. They are all brought to safety . Monday morning: A boat runs aground on the Greek holiday island of Rhodes killing a man, woman and child .

"Cheesy slogans such as ‘reach for the stars’ could be detrimental to pupils, it has been claimed. Carl Hendrick, head of learning and research at Wellington College, Berkshire, has attacked the ‘tidal wave of guff’ in classrooms. These ‘missives in mediocrity’ often tell pupils to ‘live your dream’ and ‘you can do it’ and ‘be all that you can be’. Cheesy slogans such as ‘reach for the stars’ on posters in schools could be detrimental to pupils, it has been claimed. Above, a stock image of a motivational poster . But the glossy notices are ‘often reductively misinterpreted as “you can achieve anything if you believe”’. Mr Hendrick argues that schools should concentrate on boosting pupils’ confidence by teaching them well and providing ‘clear and achievable paths to academic success’. Writing in a blog, he claimed that motivational posters ‘sit alongside a set of approaches that may well be doing more harm than good’. But Vic Goddard, headmaster of Passmores Academy in Harlow, Essex, and star of Educating Essex, told the Times Educational Supplement he is a fan of the posters. Mr Hendrick argues that schools should concentrate on boosting pupils’ confidence by teaching them well and providing ‘clear and achievable paths to academic success’. Above, a stock image of three confident pupils . He has one outside his room saying: ‘I am not telling you it is going to be easy, but I am telling you it is going to be worth it.’ It comes as teachers have been told they must not talk about getting fat or compliment colleagues on losing weight in front of pupils, Government-backed guidance said. They should also avoid discussing ‘unflattering photos of celebrities’, how ageing ravages people’s looks and ‘fat-shaming’ youngsters. The advice is supposed to help pupils develop positive body images amid ‘society’s intense focus on physical appearance’.","Cheesy slogans could be detrimental to pupils, a researcher claimed .

"It was a 'once in a lifetime' opportunity to work with one of Australia's most well-known personal trainers. But followers of Gold Coast training queen Ashy Bines were shocked to receive an email on Saturday advertising one of her exclusive programs for an eye-popping $US49,500 per year. Ms Bines on Monday apologised to her 'very angry and upset' followers after an extra zero was added to the cost of the yearlong program - the real price being a tenth of that, or $4,950. 'There was a mistake in the wording,' Ms Bines said in an email to her thousands of followers, after questions from Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Ashy Bines, pictured, upset her followers when she mistakenly advertised the price of one of her courses as $US49,500 - ten times it's real $USD4950 price .

'This caused a lot of girls to be very angry and upset with me which is the last thing I ever want. Ms Bines blamed the confusion on an unnamed editor.

'I am a terrible speller myself hence why I have an editor and I think this is her first mistake in 4 years! 'I apologise for the confusion and so does my editor'. One astonished follower wrote on Ms Bines' Facebook page at the weekend that she would be 'homeless and starving' if she paid the originally advertised price.

'I'd love to do the program with the email where you give one on one advice but 50,000 omg that is what I make in a year,' wrote 'Brandi'.

"As Charlotte Cosby showed off her super-slim figure in a new Instagram photo, many of her fans balked at her now tiny frame. For the Geordie Shore star, who has lost has lost two and a half stone and four dress sizes over the past year, is looking thinner than ever. In fact, she is looking so thin, that some have questioned whether the 24-year-old actress has taken things too far. Scroll down for video . Over the last year Charlotte Crosby has lost over two and a half stone, but the reality TV star has come under fire for this picture in which she appears to be very slim . One Twitter user commented that she thought Charlotte was 'far to skinny [sic] whilst other commented on her Instagram pictures . One user on Twitter posted a picture of the star with the comment: 'Charlotte Crosby is far to skinny! She's promoting to girls that she has a ""healthy body"" [sic]' Another commented on her Instagram: 'I can guarantee you she starves herself to look like this.' But Charlotte is not the only Newcastle resident to have lost weight. Her co-stars Vicky Pattison, 27, Holly Hagan, 22, and Marnie Simpson have also all dropped the pounds over the past 12 months. Charlotte has a lost a lot of weight over the last 12 months (left, before the weightloss, and, right, after) , she puts this down to exercise and having cut back on take-aways and booze . Charlotte in 2013 before her weight loss transformation attending the Radio 1 Teen Awards at Wembley . And the women aren't afraid to show off their bodies. Vicky regularly posts then and now pictures of herself to her 1.6million Instagram followers charting her weight loss progress. Holly and Marnie are the same. Sharing pictures of their super slim bodies, often in bikinis or skimpy outfits. But have these girls taken things too far? Well, one doctor thinks they might. Dr PhD Marilyn Glenville told us that there is a lot of pressure on women in the media to try and stay thin. Vicky Pattison regularly posts pictures of herself to Instagram, before (left) and after (right) her weight loss . Marnie Simpson said she felt compelled to lose weight after seeing that her fellow Geordie Shore Castmmates had dropped so many pounds . She said: 'There is too much too much pressure as they are in the public eye and understandably want to look good but it may push them into unhealthy eating patterns in order to achieve that look. 'Because of the pressure the weight loss can be taken too far and too fast as with many of the Geordie Shore girls.' She continued: 'When weight loss is very fast the body is encouraged to lose fat, muscle and water. Water is just a temporary loss and you also do not want to lose muscle. 'And for women it is important not to lose too much fat, because then periods will stop and it can affect not only fertility but also increase the risk of problems like osteoporosis because the woman has lost the protection of the female hormones.' Holly Hagan is the fourth Geordie Shore girl to dramatically lose weight, she had even posted a picture of herself trying out a waist trainer to Instagram (left) Holly posted this picture of herself to Instagram where he ribs are clearly visable . Holly was larger when she started on the show, but, she has since slimmed down after revealing she felt fat . Dr Marilyn also revealed that it is best for fans to stick away from following celebrities in their diets. She said: 'It is better to choose a plan to suit your body and to take into account whether you have a sedentary job or working away from home a lot so can’t control your food easily. 'It will make a difference if you are very stressed and also how old you are because metabolism tends to slow down as we get older. 'It is important that you choose a diet that suits your lifestyle, age and how you want to look so that you don’t end up looking and being too thin or causing health problems.' However two of the girls have hit back at the criticism of their weight. Holly told the BBC: 'What really annoys me is when I read articles and it's like, ""Holly lost three stone in one month"" and that is giving such a wrong impression to the girls out there reading that and thinking, ""Oh yeah I can lose three stone in one month"". She continued: 'They just pluck these figures out of thin air, and it shouldn't be allowed to happen because that could have really damaging effects.' Charlotte has also denied losing weight just for her DVD: 'Sadly I just put weight on through loads of partying, drinking, having a boyfriend and eating takeaways every night,' she said. 'I don't know why I would ever want to put weight on and look that fat and ugly. Why would anyone ever want to do that? It's so stupid that people even say that.' Much has been made of just how the Geordie Shore girls, who were famous for their booze and take away heavy diets, have managed to loose so much weight. Here's what they've said... Charlotte Crosby . Charlotte's diet was not the most conventional. As her BFF Vicky revealed that she uses a controversial sounding 'three tin' regime. 'She basically thinks you should eat three tins a day and that's it. So you could have a tin of beans for your breakfast, tin of tuna for your dinner and a tin of pears for your tea,' said Vicky. Charlotte also introduced exercise into her life to beat the bulge. She started working with celebrity trainer Richard Callender and released a number one best selling fitness DVD. Holly (plain yellow bikini) recently posted this picture of her and Charlotte saying that the pair were now proud of their bodies . Holly Hagan . Holly, who recently posted a picture of herself in a Kim Kardashian-style waist trainer to Instagram, trains hard and has lost over a stone and a half. She said: 'I do work hard to maintain my body as I work with a personal trainer 2/3 times a week, and we train really hard together.' She also maintains a calorie-controlled diet and has previously revealed that she prioritises fruit and vegetables over stodgy treats. 'Carrots before carbs,' she explains. 'I've been doing it for so long now that when I eat s*** it makes me feel bad. I prefer to be healthy now.' A typical day for her would be scrambled eggs for breakfast, a chicken salad for lunch, and for dinner, steak and vegetables. Vicky Pattison . Before embarking on her weightloss transformation Vicky survived on a diet of takeaways. Now, she's a svelte size six after insisting that producers provide the reality show stars with a healthier menu - something she says has 'made all the difference'. 'It’s made such a difference,' she says. 'You don’t get much time to cook, so we used to have a crisps cupboard and a chocolate drawer, which we'd descend on like a pack of raccoons after a night out. 'With the catering, we swapped our fry ups for eggs or porridge for breakfast and then salads and meat platters for lunch. That made keeping our figures loads easier.' Vicky also followed the her own Seven Day Slim routine, which she turned into a DVD, which saw her shed three stone over the course of six months. Following her dramatic slim down she was unhappy with the way her breasts looked and had a boob job to plump them back up again. Vicky posts these pictures to her Instagram detailing how she has transformed her body . Marnie Simpson: . Marnie decided to lose weight at the end of last year after becoming jealous of her co-stars slim bodies. She dropped 17lbs - over a stone - in just one month and said: 'A lot of people started to pick up on my weight on Twitter and say some really hurtful comments. 'I remember one person said, ""You used to be the skinniest and now you're the fattest."" 'Another said, ""Your face is huge,"" because when I do pile on the pounds it always shows up really quickly on my face in the shape of a double chin. 'There were also lots of comments about being be the ""fat one"" in the show and the ""fat lass"". 'I'd be lying if I said those comments didn't really hurt - you try to ignore them but it is impossible.' After a month of intensive work-outs and eating healthily, the reality TV star went from 9st 10lbs to a super-slim 8st 7lbs.","Charlotte Crosby was criticised for her slim frame on social media .

"Taken at the dawn of photography, these unique pictures are some of the first ever taken of the city of Bristol, nearly 100 years before much of its historic centre was destroyed by Nazi bombing. The images, captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer Hugh Owen, have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to £30,000. Everything from the waterfront, city centre and St Mary Redcliffe church can be seen in the shots, as well as The Fourteen Stars Tavern building which was pulled down in 1857. It became part of the site for The Bristol Brewery Georges before that was closed in 1999 and later turned into a block of flats. Many of the buildings pictured have changed dramatically between the 19th century and today, particularly the area of High Street. Other shots are almost identical, including the one of St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist, which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the Second World War. The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s. They are due to go up for auction in Cirencester tomorrow. Stepping back in time: The Fourteen Stars Tavern (pictured left) can be seen in a photo believed to have been taken shortly before it was knocked down. It was replaced by The Bristol Brewery Georges, which has since closed and been converted into flats. As it is today (right) Many uses: There was a builder, undertaker and joiner stationed at Broad Quay Bristol when this photo was taken between 1850 and 1855 . How Broad Quay Bristol looks now. It has become restaurants but retained some of its old character for people to enjoy while they eat . Little difference: The view through St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist has not changed much between 1850 and today - apart from the road works . High Street in Bristol (left in 1850) is one of the areas where the buildings have changed quite dramatically over the past 160 years. The structure was overhauled in 1962 to make way for what is the former Norwich Union building. Today it stands defunct and boarded up (right) This fascinating picture shows Sleep Street in Bristol at the dawn of photography, believed to have been taken between 1850 and 1855 . St Mary Redcliffe church was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries and has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. Pictured left is what the towering structure looked like in the 19th century after being snapped by Hugh Owen and, right, how it appears now . Hugh Owen's photograph shows St Peter's Hospital, which was destroyed in the Bristol Blitz in 1940. Built as a merchant's house, it had been a showcase of Jacobean architecture before it was bombed . Not much change: The church is renowned for the beauty of its Gothic architecture and is classed as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. Queen Elizabeth I is said to have described it as 'the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England' St Mary-Le-Port Street in Bristol. The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s . Area of beauty: College Green, Bristol, as it looked in the 19th century. A replica of the Bristol High Cross had been erected there, in the shadow of the cathedral, because the original was deemed too fragile to move again . Missing landmark: The remains of the replica cross can now be seen in nearby Berkeley Square, where they were transferred in about 1950 from College Green (pictured). Much of the trees which shielded the cathedral are now gone . Another image of Sleep Street in Bristol.

"The father of a 6-year-old girl whose teeth were so rotten her life was endangered pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment. Kenneth Wanamaker Jr, 37, pleaded guilty on Friday, weeks before a scheduled trial in the Northhampton County, Pennsylvania, case against him after the vast majority of his daughter's teeth were found to be abscessed. A dentist had testified the girl's teeth were in such bad shape they posed a potentially fatal threat to her health. Kenneth Wanamaker Jr, 37, of Northhampton County, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment after his daughter's teeth were found to be in a possibly fatal condition (File photo, August 14) A dentist report said that the girl had fourteen abscessed. She had been scheduled for surgery in March but did not have the procedure because her parents did not set up a pre-operation examination . Fourteen of the girl's 20 teeth were either abscessed, and two more needed to be pulled or had severe root and tooth decay, the dentist said, according to the Morning Call. She had been scheduled to have surgery on her teeth in March but did not end up having an procedure because her parents never scheduled a pre-operation examination. Wanamaker also pleaded guilty to false swearing and is eligible for parole. His sentence is two months to a year in prison, but he's been in jail since having his bail revoked in December for failing to enroll in drug treatment and was still behind bars as of Friday afternoon. Defense attorney Mark Freeman said the girl's treatment was put off while the family looked for an affordable way to pay for it. Authorities still are investigating Wanamaker and his partner Jessica Hoffman, 32, in connection to the deaths of Wanamaker's other children. A seven-month-old baby boy Tyler died of pneumonia in 2011, and there were two stillborn deliveries since 2007, one of which was linked to his Hoffman's methamphetamine abuse, prosecutors said. Wanamaker (right) and his partner Jessica Hoffman (left) 32, are also being investigated for the death of their 7-month-old baby boy in 2011. Wanamaker said that he and his partner are raising a happy, well-adjusted family that is involved in activities such as youth car racing . The mother had tested positive for meth in 2013 after arriving at the hospital with one of her still born baby Krystopher's arms already out of the birth canal, the Morning Call reported. She gave birth to another child last year. A district attorney said that he would reach a decision about further prosecutions within several weeks. Wanamaker will also pay a $750 fine to local Division of Children, Youth and Families and complete 15 hours of community service as part of his sentence. Hoffman, 32, was said to have gained back custody of her children after complying with court supervision. The father told WPVI that he and his partner are raising a happy, well-adjusted family that is involved in activities such as youth car racing. Other charges against Wanamaker have been withdrawn. Hoffman's case has been moved to June after she received a new lawyer. Arrangements are being made for the daughter to have oral surgery this summer.","Kenneth Wanamaker Jr, 37, pleaded guilty and received up to year in prison .

"Cigarette-smoking teenagers hit a new low last year as youngsters turn to e-cigarettes instead, a study has revealed. Around two million high school students admitted to buying vaporizers in 2014 - more than triple the 660,000 recorded the year before. But smoking of traditional cigarettes plummeted to about nine per cent. On the rise: Around two million high school students now admit to buying e-cigarettes . The CDC report, released on Thursday, is based on a national survey of about 22,000 students at middle schools and high schools, both public and private. Tom Frieden, CDC director, remarked that the results are 'alarming' and 'shocking'. 'What's most surprising is how in­cred­ibly rapid the use of products other than cigarettes has increased,' Frieden said in an interview quoted by The Washington Post. 'It is subjecting another generation of our children to an addictive substance.' E-cigarettes typically deliver nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin and flavorings through inhaled vapor. They have been on sale in the United States since 2006, but this is the first year that the Centers for Disease Control has measured their use. It follows a government-funded study released in December which found similar trends, leading experts to warn of a potential 'epidemic of teen tobacco use'. 'The concern is that e-cigarette advertising is recruiting intermediate risk adolescents to nicotine use- kids who would not otherwise have started smoking,' said James Sargent, of Dartmouth Hitchcock's Norris Cotton Cancer Center in a paper published  in the journal Pediatrics. There are currently more than 400 brands of 'e-cigs' available. E-cigs contain far fewer cancer-causing and other toxic substances than cigarettes, however their long-term effects on health and nicotine dependence are unknown. The popularity of e-cigarettes, which typically deliver nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin and flavorings through inhaled vapor, has increased in the past five years. 'These are kids who might go on to smoke cigarettes, which are much better at delivering nicotine than e-cigarettes. 'If this pattern of use is adopted by adolescents in the continental U.S., we could be in for an epidemic of teen tobacco use in this country that could greatly reduce the overall benefits to public health of e-cigarettes.' Researchers have been critical of the fact that packaging and marketing of e-cigarettes is not regulated, and that manufacturers' opportunities to target adolescents are wide open, absent FDA regulation of these products. There are currently more than 400 brands of 'e-cigs' available in the US. E-cigs contain far fewer cancer-causing and other toxic substances than cigarettes, however their long-term effects on health and nicotine dependence are unknown.

"Bobby Flay is said to be offering his soon-to-be ex-wife just $5,000 a month - despite a personal worth of more than $20million. According to TMZ, the prenup between the Food Network star and the Law And Order: SVU actress provides her with the relatively meager sum for five years. The report also claims that the prenup contains a clause that allows the chef buy her out of the $8million marital home for just $1million - with an extra $50,000 to pack and move her stuff. Unhappy: Stephanie March is unhappy with the $5,000 a month she has been offered by Bobby Flay as per their prenup, according to TMZ; He filed for divorce on Friday (pictured in June 2013) Flay filed for divorce on Friday, just one day after it emerged he had separated from his wife of ten years. TMZ claimed the 50-year-old was 'heartbroken' about the split - while his wife is 'mighty unhappy' with the prenup. Also on Friday the New York Daily News claimed the actress questioned her spouse about rumours he was romantically involved with Mad Men star January Jones in 2010. 'I know Stephanie basically asked him after January Jones, ""Did you f*** her?""' an insider told the site. March was said to be suspicious after her husband happened to be on the scene when single mother Jones got into a car accident in LA in 2010. The source added that he denied any romance. There was concern about this woman: The New York Daily News on Friday claimed that March asked her spouse if he had any romantic liaisons with January Jones - he allegedly said no; here Jones is pictured in March . Her love interest these days: Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth . Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth. Legal documents obtained by TMZ state that the marriage has 'broken down irretrievably.' It has been reported they separated three weeks ago. And because they have no children together there is no issue about child support but they are fighting over property already, it was alleged on Friday. Flay has already moved out of their New York City apartment. The couple has secured their own attorneys and are discussing the terms of divorce, according to the news site. Once so close: Flay and March, who reportedly separated three weeks ago, pictured in January 2013 . TMZ went on to report that the marriage began to unravel over the past year and a half.

Stephanie claimed Bobby said 'he was busy with work' and instead sent his assistants to help her. Moved out: The Iron Chef Of America star - pictured in 2013 - is said to have moved out of the couple's New York City apartment . Boiling point: The marriage suffered when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day because he was busy, TMZ reported; Flay was pictured with President Obama in 2009 . In February, the pair didn't celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary together. According to TMZ, Bobby attended a wine festival in Florida with his assistants instead. This will be Stephanie's first divorce and a third for Flay, whose two previous marriages both ended in divorce.

"Police are trying to find a gang of vigilante paedophile hunters accused of posing as children online and then beating up men who agree to meet them. The group working in the North-West has been accused of filming the attacks, the latest of which was on Saturday, and then sending online messages demanding money to keep the film secret. One teenager has told Greater Manchester Police he was beaten up by the gang, who reportedly tricked him into believing he was meeting an underage girl in a church car park after dark. The 19-year-old thought he was meeting a 14-year-old girl he had spoken to on on the internet in Atherton - but when he got there he was attacked by a gang of men who accused him of being a paedophile. Attack: One teenager has told Greater Manchester Police he was beaten up by the gang, who reportedly tricked him into believing he was meeting an underage girl in a church car park in Atherton (pictured) After escaping, the teenager then reported the matter to police and was promptly arrested on suspicion of grooming. He has been bailed while police investigate. In a second similar incident, concerned shoppers called police when they saw a man being beaten up in Market Place in Wigan at about 2.40pm on Saturday. Their target, Andrew O'Neill, 25, has since admitted in court that he groomed an under-age girl. He had made contact on a dating website with a 'girl' called Alex, Wigan Magistrates' Court heard. But after booking a hotel room and turning up to meet the girl in Wigan on Saturday afternoon, he was confronted by a number of men and attacked. Concerned shoppers witnessed the assault on Market Place in the town centre as O'Neill was head-butted and lost two front teeth. Other members of the group filmed the incident. He escaped the attack and went to the police to report the assault. The video was then posted on Facebook with the tag 'NWI Nonce Busters' - believed to be a reference to right-wing group the North West Infidels. The video has since been taken down. O'Neill, formerly of Castlehey, Skelmersdale, was charged by police after reporting the assault and admitted an offence of attempting to meet a girl under 16 following grooming, between April 11 and 18. He was remanded into custody for his own safety and will appear for sentence at Liverpool Crown Court on May 11. Nicola Ormerod, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant has contacted somebody said to be called 'Alex' on a profile on a dating website. 'General discussions then turn flirty and sexual and she said she is 14. Second meeting: Concerned shoppers called police when they saw a man lose his teeth after being beaten up in Market Place in Wigan . 'There's an arrangement made for the two parties to meet. The defendant has already booked a hotel room and is found in possession of a tube of lubricant. 'It's been a set-up profile from a group. He thought this person was 14 and has arranged to meet for the relevant offence. 'It has had press coverage over the weekend. It is from a particular group who set this up and the defendant has been assaulted.' Andrea Woods, defending, said O'Neill had no previous convictions and co-operated with police. O'Neill was the second man arrested by police over the weekend following alleged vigilante paedophile stings. A second man, aged 19, has been released on bail on suspicion of committing a similar offence to O'Neill. Det Insp Charlotte Cadden from Bolton police said: 'These men were targeted because they had illegally arranged to meet up with underage girls online. Andrew O'Neill, 25, one of the vigilante group's targets, has since admitted at Wigan Magistrates' Court (above) that he groomed an under-age girl . 'I want to make it clear that grooming and arranging to meet up with children you have met over the internet is a criminal offence and if you are caught doing this you will be arrested and prosecuted. 'It is unacceptable that this group are posing as underage girls and meeting up with men with the view to either blackmailing them or attacking them in the street. 'If you have any information regarding these incidents, please contact the police as soon as possible.' The first attacker in the Friday incident was white, aged between 18 and 20, had shaven brown hair and was wearing a white t-shirt and a black tracksuit.

"Ricky Ricardo Chiles III (pictured), who was suspected of fatally shooting two people, shot himself with his gun on Thursday morning . A man suspected of fatally shooting two people at the scene of a traffic accident that killed his nephew has taken his own life, according to police. Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, 27, killed himself with a single shot  as police closed in on him at the Presidential Inn & Suites in Lyon, Illinois on Thursday around 9am, said Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn. Since Tuesday, police were looking for Chiles III in connection to the killing 40-year-old Archie Brown Jr and 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles. Brown struck and killed the gunman's two-year-old nephew Damani Terry after he darted into the street in front of Brown's van, authorities said. Damani's brother, Rasheed and also the nephew of Chiles III, was  struck by the gunfire at the scene of the accident. He later died at a hospital. Police believe Chiles III decided to exact revenge and took the law into his own hands. 'This sad example is what we get when we have folks who decide it's their responsibility to use their guns to redress their grievances,' said Flynn. On Wednesday around 7.30pm, Flynn said Milwaukee police obtained a warrant on for the arrest of Chiles III in connection to Sunday's shootings. He was with his girlfriend at the motel on Thursday, who has not been identified, and who was uninjured in the incident. Police said it is not clear if she will face any charges, according to the Journal Sentinel. Scroll down for video .

While at the scene an unidentified gunman shot Brown and Damani's 15-year-old brother, Rasheed Chiles (right) After being released from prison in August 2013 for serving a two year-conviction for a 2011 bank robbery where he was the getaway driver, Chiles III was on extended supervision at the time of the shooting on Sunday. He was also prohibited from possessing firearms. Chiles III had a previous criminal history which included convictions of disorderly conduct, resisting an officer and fourth-degree sexual assault. Police Captain Timothy Heier said the car accident occurred at 5.10pm on Sunday after little Damani ran into the street in a residential neighborhood on the 4600 block of North 48th Street in Milwaukee. Witnesses said on Sunday that Damani and Rasheed had been attending a birthday party when the accident and shootings took place. According to reports, Rasheed had brought his toddler brother to a house party Sunday, but the little boy got out of the house and darted into the street . When Damani was run over, Rasheed rushed outside to his aid, at which point someone opened fire. The teen was struck in the shoulder and later died during surgery .

Brown Jr, a father of four, was struck in the head by a bullet and died at the scene near a park on Milwaukee's near northwest side before officers arrived. Rasheed, who was caught in the crossfire, was hit in the shoulder and was taken to a hospital, where he died during surgery, according to police. The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed in a statement late on Monday that Damani and Rasheed were brothers. A police statement said Brown Jr was distraught about hitting the child and stopped right away, according to witnesses. Mayor Tom Barrett called the shooting of Brown an 'assassination' during an earlier emotional press conference. 'Someone got angry,' Barrett said. 'Someone took a gun and basically assassinated this gentleman.' Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn speaks to reporters on Thursday providing details related to Chiles III's suicide on Thursday morning . Above, the scene of a car accident in Milwaukee, Wilconsin on Sunday. Police saud they had obtained a warrant on Wednesday night for the arrest of Chiles III in connection with Sunday's shooting . A local alderman suggested that the shooting was carried out in revenge of the child's death . Following Thursday morning's incident, Brown's father, Archie Brown Sr, said Chiles III cheated himself out of being judged by a man's system where he would be incarcerated. 'He he took a way out that put him in a worse situation because now he went to meet his maker to answer for his crimes,' Brown Sr told the Journal Sentinel. On Wednesday, a vigil was held for Brown Jr as his wife as well as family and friends attended. Following the shooting, Barbara Sprewer, a witness, said she saw Damani looking around before crossing the street, apparently heading for some girls dancing in the nearby park. She saw the van approach, and estimated it was going 25 to 30mph. Archie Brown Sr, identified his son, father-of-four Archie Brown Jr, as the driver who was shot in the head and killed at the scene . 'Nobody was watching the baby,' she said. After the child was hit, she saw the driver get out. She said she heard shots but did not see who shot him or Rasheed. 'I feel helpless. I feel numb,' she said. 'I saw them alive, and I saw them deceased. I've been reliving this since I woke up.' Bob May, 68, another next-door neighbor, said he heard five gunshots as he was washing dishes and thought at first it was firecrackers going off in the park. He said he looked out to see the van with its door open and people talking on phones. May said his neighbors had moved in about six months earlier and he did not know them. Brown Sr said his son, a real estate entrepreneur and landlord, was a great father to his four daughters, including a six-month-old baby. 'He liked to laugh. He took good care of his children. He was an excellent father to his children,' Brown Sr said. Brown Jr's half brother Riles Rilley also spoke with the Journal Sentinel and said that the 40-year-old was the co-owner of Seven West nightclub. 'Just a good person all around. Never had any enemies. Always looking to do the right thing,' he said. The shootings are among a climbing number of violent deaths in Milwaukee this year. The city has counted 43 homicide victims so far this year, compared with 14 at the same point last year. 'There just seems to be a sensibility among a segment of the community that committing acts of violence in support of one's reputation to get revenge for a perceived slight, or for a perceived business dispute over illegal drugs, or to exact revenge is somehow approved,' said Flynn. 'And in that set of circumstances there's going to be not only tragedies, there's going to be dreadful mistakes.' Chiles III was with his girlfriend at the Presidential Inn and Suites Motel (file photo above) in Lyon, Illinois when police closed in on him. Authorities said it is not yet known whether she will face charges in connection to the incident .","Ricky Chiles III, 27, shot himself on Thursday as police closed in on him .

"Deep within Utah's San Rafael desert, thousands upon thousands of goblins lurk in the shadows. But rather than frightening visitors, they are a geologist's dream: gnarly rock formations which have been created by gradual erosion of Entrada sandstone over millions of years. The 'goblins' are scientifically known as 'hoodoos' - rock protrusions consisting of relatively soft rock topped by harder stone that preserves each column's spire-like shape from weather erosion. But the mushroom like structures and hiking trails winding through this unearthly landscape, make this a popular attraction for tourists . The softer rock has been removed by wind and water, leaving thousands of unique constructions, which are further chiselled by water and dust erosion. Once known as the Mushroom Valley, the area was first discovered by cowboys searching for cattle. In 1964 it was designated a state park.

"Sophie English was one of thousands of babies who was born at the height of the Vietnam War and adopted by an Australian family. There has been very little information to help Ms English find her birth mother who made the heartbreaking decision to give her up and for more than 40 years she has had many questions about her heritage. She was finally given a chance to find closure with ABC's Foreign Correspondent reporter Sally Sara who travelled with her to Vietnam in search of answers. Scroll down for video . Sophie English (right) with another adoptee Le My Huong who has since found her mother and moved back to Vietnam . The last time Ms English had seen her home country was when she was 10 months old. Despite being grateful for the opportunity to call herself Australian, she has always struggled with the pain of not knowing her birth mother and wondering what her life could have been. 'If you think about it too long it could make you cry because... there aren't words that could convey it,' Ms English told the ABC. 'I might've been on the boats, fishing and I would be working really hard like them, but I would have that sense of family. Ms English pictured here with some snakes in Truong Long village, Vietnam on her trip with Foreign Correspondent . Ms English (pictured with Ms My Huong and ABC journalist Sally Sara) goes on a journey to re-connect with her mother land, Vietnam . 'I would probably have grandchildren by now and I would have that deep need in me fulfilled.' Journalist Sally Sara told Daily Mail Australia Ms English's story was not about finding her mother but finding 'peace with her mother land'. While they were in Vietnam, Ms English got the chance to meet another adoptee, Le My Huong, who had a similar story to hers. Ms Le has been lucky enough to find her mother and has since moved back to Vietnam to be with her family. Sara said Ms English and Ms Le meeting for the first time was a profound moment in their journey. 'That was probably most raw and powerful moment of the whole story when Sophie got to sit down with My Huong’s mum,' Sara told Daily Mail Australia. 'This was the first time [Sophie] had met with a Vietnamese mother who had given up a child during the war.'

Sara said it was very moving to see the exchange between Ms English and My Huong's mother. 'Sophie wanted to ask My Huong's mum what it was like to give up a child and how hard that was,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'The most important thing Sophie couldn't say these things to her mother [instead] she held onto My Huong's mum's hand [and said] as adoptees we don't blame you, you did what you had to do and don't feel guilty about that and be proud of the lives we had.' Sara said she was not sure if the trip gave Ms English the closure she needed to move on but had given her valuable insight on how to move forward. 'How could you ever extinguish hope of finding your mother?' she said. '[Sophie] was pretty amazing. She said she cried more in two weeks than her whole life. 'I would say Sophie's a very strong, intelligent woman and I really admire the way that she's handled this whole situation.'

"Patents have already hinted that Apple is looking to boost the cameras in future models of the iPhone and iPad, but its latest acquisition confirms it. The tech giant has bought Israel-based Link Computational Imaging in a deal reportedly worth $20 million (£13.5 million). LinX makes 'multi-aperture' cameras small enough to fit into smartphones and tablets that come with depth-sensing technology - as seen on HTC One's M8 duo-camera. Scroll down for videos . Apple has bought Israel-based Link Computational Imaging in a deal reportedly worth $20 million (£13.5 million). LinX makes 'multi-aperture' cameras small enough to fit into smartphones and tablets that come with depth-sensing technology. This technology could be added to the next-generation iPhones and iPads . Rather than capturing a flat 2D image, the technology is able to sense the depth of each object in a photograph. This lets people refocus an image after its been captured, or measure the dimensions of a room, for example. 'Utilising state-of-the-art multi aperture imaging technology that combines innovative image processing [with] advanced sensor and optics technology, our cameras set new standards for image quality parameters such as low light performance, refocusing and more,' said the firm. Rather than capturing a flat 2D image, the technology is able to sense the depth of each object in a photograph. This lets people refocus an image after its been captured or measure the dimensions of a room, for example. HTC One M8's version combines an UltraPixel and a Duo Camera. The first sensor captures the image, while the the second captures depth information. Once a photo is taken there are four editing options called Ufocus, Foregrounder, Seasons and Dimension Plus. These use depth information in different ways to make photos look more professional. Meanwhile, computers with Intel's RealSense 3D camera can recognise and respond to facial expressions and hand gestures so users can interact with them more naturally. It is already fitted to a range of laptops including the Asus N551JQ and Asus X751LD, and last week Intel's boss Brian Krzanich unveiled a version designed for smartphones and tablets.

Once a photo is taken there are four editing options called Ufocus, Foregrounder, Seasons and Dimension Plus. These use depth information in different ways to make photos look more professional. For example, Ufocus lets users switch the focal point of an the shot, even if they appear blurry in the original picture. Foregrounder and Seasons lets users add effects such as a zoom, blur, snow and rain to an image.

'Our cameras set new standards for image quality parameters such as low light performance, HDR, refocusing, and more,' said the firm . And if a patent awarded earlier this month is anything to go by, the camera on the iPhone 7 could take even better photos. The papers, originally filed in 2011, detail a three-sensor camera that splits light to boost the number of pixels it can manage. The patent is called 'Digital camera with light splitter' and explains: 'A digital camera component is described that has a light splitter cube having an entrance face to receive incident light from a camera scene. 'The cube splits the incident light into first, second, and third colour components that emerge from the cube through a first face, a second face, and a third face of the cube, respectively. Computers with Intel's RealSense 3D camera can recognise and respond to facial expressions and hand gestures. The technology is already fitted to a range of laptops and last week Intel's boss Brian Krzanich unveiled a version designed for smartphones and tablets (refocusing examples pictured) 'First, second, and third image sensors are provided, each being positioned to receive a respective one of the colour components that emerge from the faces.' Put more simply, instead of using a standard single sensor to collect the data of an image, the proposed system uses mirrors to split the incoming light in three, namely green, red and blue. These beams of light are then projected onto three sensors. A patent filed by Apple in 2011 and awarded earlier this month details a three-sensor camera (illustrated) that uses mirrors to split incoming light in three - namely green, red and blue . These beams of light are then projected onto three sensors. Each sensor can then collect and use more pixels per photo compared to a single sensor.

The files also explained that these mirrors could stabilise the image and direct the light in a way that accounts for shaking hands, for example. In its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple added a new sensor with so-called Focus Pixels to its 8MP iSight camera. It also improved its facial detection and exposure control. Focus Pixels use a bespoke image signal processor to collect more information about an image, including lighting, to provide faster autofocus. To showcase how good this technology Apple has launched a marketing campaign that only uses images shot on its latest handsets. Each photograph is accompanied by a caption on the online gallery, which says where it was taken, whether an app was used to improve the shot and a tip about why it is a good photo, which amateurs could use to boost their photographic prowess. For example, an image of a man in a field of sunflowers says: 'Photographing a subject from behind can add wit to a photo. Here, the subject and the flowers are both facing away from the camera.' Similarly, photographer Dan Rubin recently produced a range of photos for fashion brand Vida, each shot on the iPhone.

Mrs Kebede, who posed for Vogue in a colourful geometric ensemble amid a crimson backdrop, was discovered in Ethiopia as a teen, and moved to Paris and then New York, where she carved out a successful modelling career. In part, she has Vogue Paris to thank for her meteoric rise to fame, after it put her on its May cover in 2002 and dedicated the entire issue to her. Mrs Kebede has been married to Ethiopian hedge fund manager Kassy Kebede for 15 years, and has two children with him, Suhul, 14, and Raee, ten. American Vogue has been leagues ahead on pushing diversity at the newsstands, having featured more black cover stars in 2014 than it ever has before in a single year. Four stars - Rihanna, Lupita Nyong'o, Joan Smalls and Kanye West - appeared on its covers last year out of a total of 15 overall, the rest of whom were white.

Harper’s Bazaar U.S. and UK, Vogue UK, Vogue Netherlands, Vogue Paris, Vogue Ukraine, Vogue Russia, Teen Vogue, Numéro, LOVE and Porter all failed to use a single woman of minority on their covers at all in 2014.

"A gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay - in a fight that has cost taxpayers £200,000. The 78 Irish travellers, who hail from just four families, had refused to budge despite facing three different courts, a planning inquiry and a council. And locals in Hardhorn, Lancashire, accused the group  of trashing their leafy village - and branded them the 'neighbours from hell'. A gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay . The group claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans . Last October, the camp, which had flouted planning rules, appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal. But despite being given four months to leave the site without the chance to appeal, the group used a loophole to take their case to the Supreme Court. They claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans. The Supreme Court later rejected pleas for the group to be allowed the right of appeal under a 'point of law of general public importance.' But now it has been revealed that a further judicial review at the High Court has been granted. Fylde Council said that fighting the 'Battle of Hardhorn' has already cost the local authority £200,000 in legal fees which will be met by the public purse. Parish councillor Maxine Chew said: 'It is a disgrace that a shocking amount of public money has been spent fighting this. 'The travellers really have been the neighbours from hell. The amount of anti-social behaviour like fly tipping, theft, drunkenness has escalated hugely in the past four years since the travellers set up camp.' The camp (pictured) appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal last year . A village spokesman added: 'After five years five months the travellers site have fought every decision, we believe that they have used legal aid to fight the Secretary of State and Fylde BC. 'The question what we would like to know is how these people qualified for legal aid? Using taxpayers' money to fight the taxpayer!' He added the decision to hold a judicial review on the grounds presented is 'totally wrong'. 'This community will be devastated with this news as we have been so patient and have endured over 450 negative incidents over the five-plus years. 'Over eight caravans set on fire to burn refuse, horses killed & dogs killed on the road from the site, drunken labourers asleep in gardens, police raids and many cases of ASB. 'The judge might have had a different view if he lived by this site. We wanted this ordeal to come to an end. There are or have been three houses for sale in Hardhorn and not one has sold in the 5 years. 'How can the application that is being challenged suddenly be overturned using a new application, the hearing was on the old application.' A judge gave permission for the judicial review application to proceed after arguments over legal technicalities regarding the processes of planning permission. Fylde Council said the legal battle has already cost the local authority £200,000 which will be met by the public purse . The saga began after a field in the village was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from West Yorkshire . The full judicial review will be held on either July 29 or 30. The saga began in November 2009 after a field in the village - which featured in BBC's Gardeners World - was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from West Yorkshire. The travellers then set up camp after sneaking in during the the dead night in what neighbours described as a 'military-style operation' and after council offices had closed for the weekend . The group of around 30 adults and 40 children, from Irish and Scottish families, immediately began work laying foundations under outdoor spot lights. Angry villagers wrote to local councillors, raising concerns about noise, road safety and a potential drop in house prices with one saying he and his wife had not been able to sleep due to noise from the site. Locals had complained of the travellers leaving generators running 24 hours a day, poaching, trespassing, and leaving dogs to bark all night, while others had complained they had been verbally abused. Officials at Fylde District Council later went to a district judge to stop the group laying hardcore foundations to make their 2.4 hectare site more permanent. They were granted an injunction banning the travellers from bringing more caravans onto the land but were ordered to allow them to bring water to the site and to use power generators. Locals in Hardhorn, Lancashire (pictured above) accused the camp's (pictured nearby) occupants of trashing their leafy village . But in 2010, a county court judge then told the authorities to 'use their best endeavours' to help the travellers get a post code for the land from the Post Office. At the time, the travellers argued they needed a postcode to help fire and ambulance crews find them if they were in need of an emergency - and the ruling meant they could also apply for state benefits, plus utilities including gas electricity and water. The group then applied for planning permission to stay on the fields for good and proposed to install further utility buildings, cesspools, fencing and hardstandings. Fylde Council refused the group retrospective planning permission and issued an enforcement notice instead demanding that they move off the site. An inspector at a planning inquiry also ruled that they had to leave. But a travellers group representative Elizabeth Collins then appealed and took the matter to the High Court in September 2012. There, another judge ruled the planning inspector's decision should stand. He also ordered Miss Collins to pay £8,000 in costs. The group were initially given until July last year to quit - but just days before the council's deadline for the travellers to move, Miss Collins lodged an appeal which further delayed the eviction. Arguing the enforcement notices were 'unlawful', she said the eviction would force her and her extended family on to the roadside, which will have a major impact on the children living on the site. She added that the children's human rights were 'violated' as eviction would affect their health and educational prospects.","Irish travellers have refused to budge from site in Hardhorn, Lancashire .

"A dilapidated country mansion in the Scottish Highlands that was once the secret love nest of Coco Chanel and the Earl of Grosvenor has gone on the market for £3million. The Rosehall Estate near Inverness boasts a 22-room main house along with 700 acres of land and five separate out buildings. It was built in the 1820 but its most colourful period of its history was during the 1920s after it was bought by Hugh 'Bendor' Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster. The main house on the Rosehall Estate near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, which was once the secret love nest of the Duke of Westminster and Coco Chanel . The main house, pictured, has 22 rooms, which is set in 700 acres of land along with five separate out buildings that are on the market for £3milllion . The house has not been lived in for more than 60 years and is now in a dilapidated state, right. Its most colourful history was when it was used as a secret love nest of the Duke of Westminster and Coco Chanel, left, . The super-wealthy land owner would spend his summers at the property with the fashion designer, with whom he had an affair between 1923 and 1929. Miss Chanel would love to fish on the estate's river, catching more than 50 salmon, according to former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who stayed with her at the property. She redesigned the whole of the building's interior, making the property unique in the UK and despite leaving the home 85 years ago, a number of the rooms still bear her work.

The French designer painstakingly decorated each room in subtle, elegant hues, much of it based on the look of her Paris apartment. She had hand-blocked wallpaper shipped in from France, and oversaw local workmen as they put together simple fireplaces. Churchill, a friend of the Duke of Westminster, stayed at the mansion in 1928 as he recuperated following an illness. In letter to his wife, Clementine, the future PM described both Chanel and the main house as 'very agreeable'. As well as the main house on the 700 acre estate, it also comes with five outbuildings including a cottage set near to a wooded area . More of the outbuildings that come as part of the Rosehall Estate. Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill also stayed there while recuperating from illness . He wrote: 'The air is most exhilarating, keen and yet caressing. Coco got three fish yesterday. 'This morning it is raining, which is good for fishing. We all play Bezique so that the time is not burdensome. 'Coco is here in place of Violet. She fishes from morn till night, and in two months has killed 50 salmon. She is very agreeable - really a great and strong being fit to rule a man or an Empire. 'Bennie is very well and, I think, extremely happy to be mated with an equal - her ability balancing his power. We are the only three on the river, and have all the plums.' But the years and the harsh weather hasn't been kind to the estate and it has not been lived in for 60 years.

The estate has been put on the market with London-based RE/MAX for £3 million - making it one of the most expensive properties for sale in Scotland. It is thought that the Duke and Miss Chanel were introduced in 1923 when the fashion designer was 40 by British socialite Vera Bate Lombardi. The Duke is said to have lavished her with expensive gifts, extravagant jewels and costly art and even provided her with a home in London's prestigious Mayfair. However, he is thought to have been devastated when she turned down his proposal of marriage, when she reportedly said: 'There have been several Duchesses of Westminster, there is only one Chanel.'","The Rosehall Estate near Inverness boasts a 22-room main house, five separate buildings and 700 acres of land .

"A Washington Post reporter detained in Iran has been charged with espionage and collaborating with 'hostile governments', nine months after his arrest. The charges against Jason Rezaian had been shrouded in secrecy until now in what has become a politically sensitive case that has parallelled with high-level nuclear talks between Iran and global powers, including the United States. Monday, Rezaian's lawyer Leila Ahsan detailed the four serious offences her client faces, in a decision branded absurd Monday by the White House and the newspaper. As well as allegedly spying under the first two charges, the 39-year-old journalist, the Post's Tehran correspondent, stands accused of gathering classified information and of disseminating propaganda against the Islamic republic. Scroll down for video . Detained: Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, seen here in 2013, was jailed in Tehran on July 22 last year . Rezaian, who was detained in July 2014, was officially charged in December, but details of the charges had never been released. Ahsan, who said she had access to the complete criminal file, said it contained 'no justifiable proof' against Rezaian, and that she had seen no legal reason to continue his detention after the case's preliminary investigation. But she said requests for bail had been turned down and criticised Iranian media for publishing allegations about Rezaian that are 'wrong and contrary to reality'. No date has yet been set for trial, Ahsan said, shortly after a senior judicial official described the dossier against the journalist, who holds both American and Iranian nationality, as 'thick'. Rezaian will face the allegations in one of the Islamic republic's revolutionary courts, whose jurisdiction includes handling crimes against national security. Its cases are heard behind closed doors. However Ahsan said: 'Jason is a journalist and the nature of his work is to have access to information and to publish it. He had no access to confidential information, either directly or indirectly.' Rezaian was detained in Tehran on July 22 last year, along with his Iranian wife Yeganeh Salehi, also a journalist, who was released on bail after spending two-and-a-half months in custody. Rezaian is being held in the capital's notorious Evin Prison and his family have frequently spoken of their fears for his health, citing his need for medication to combat high blood pressure. But Ahsan said he was 'in good spirits' despite being held in cramped conditions. He has also had no access to newspapers or media. His mother Mary said she had discussed the charges with the journalist's wife, who remains in Tehran, but had no further comment. The reporter's detention has political resonance both because of his dual nationality and the long-running nuclear talks regarding Tehran's disputed nuclear programme. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it had no official confirmation of the allegations, but if reports of Rezaian being accused of spying were true it would be 'absurd' and that the charges should be 'immediately dropped'. But the journalist's predicament would have no bearing on a nuclear deal either way, he added. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif last week said the reporter faced 'very serious' allegations but it was a matter for Iran's judiciary, insisting the case was free of political interference. Ahsan also said the allegations against her client 'had no link' with the nuclear talks, but in a nod to the diplomacy she added: 'I hope this matter will accelerate the liberation of my client.' Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (pictured) last week said the reporter faced 'very serious' allegations but it was a matter for Iran's judiciary . In a rare official comment regarding Rezaian, Gholamhossein Esmaili, Tehran's judiciary chief, said Monday: 'The file is thick and contains different aspects.' Quoted by the official IRNA news agency, he added: 'In due course the judgment will be pronounced.' In a statement, the Post's executive editor Martin Baron said: 'The grave charges against Jason that Iran has now disclosed could not be more ludicrous. 'It is absurd and despicable to assert, as Iran's judiciary is now claiming, that Jason's work first as a freelance reporter and then as The Post's Tehran correspondent amounted to espionage.' Rezaian was among four US citizens that President Barack Obama last month urged Iran to return home. On April 2, Iran and world powers agreed the key parameters for a deal that would end a 12-year standoff about concerns that Iran is seeking a nuclear bomb, an allegation it denies. A final agreement is due by the end of June.","Jason Rezaian faces trial for collaborating with 'hostile governments'

"A five-year-old boy born with parts of his brain in the wrong place has stunned doctors by walking two miles every day. Brave Finley Lamb suffers from rare brain abnormality Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia - which means many of his 'grey matter' cells have not migrated to the correct position. It left the boy, from Wallasey, Merseyside, unable to walk and talk, and with a 90 per cent chance of developing Epilepsy. Finley Lamb, five, pictured with his dad Dan and mother Sara, suffers from a rare brain abnormality . He is also highly likely to suffer heart, lung and bowel problems. But the five-year-old amazed mother Sara when he took his first steps last year and has continued to defy the odds by starting primary school - and he even makes the journey on foot. 'It was around May last year when Finley just got up on his own and walked across the room - we were amazed,' said the mother-of-two, 37. 'It just seemed to click with him and ever since then he has been building up from 50 metres a day, now to two or three miles five days a week. 'His programme says he has to do at least two miles a day and he can even get up curbs now on his own and walk up steps with a rail which is amazing. 'When Finley was diagnosed with PVNH we were told he would probably never walk or talk - but now he is in mainstream school and playing with the other kids and his little brother. 'We just can't believe his progress. We never thought he would be able to lead an independent life, but now there is no reason why he shouldn't be able to. We are so pleased.' Finley defied the odds to take his first steps last year and now enjoys walking the two miles to school . Finley made huge progress after he started a programme designed specifically for him by the Family Hope Center, based in Philadelphia, USA, just two years ago in April 2013. The centre treats children with special needs and developmental delays and suggested special exercises and lifestyle changes intended to stimulate Finley's brain. Finley was diagnosed with PVNH when he was two years old, which affects around just 50 children in the UK. But the determined schoolboy has made huge developments - with his brain function going from 54 per cent to 76 per cent and his mobility increasing from that of a seven-week-old baby to a two-year-old toddler. And he now attends St Peter and St Paul Primary on the Wirral, Merseyside. Sara - who also has a three-year-old son Noah with husband Dan - said: 'Finley has made so much progress and that is why I am so passionate about getting this message out. 'It is hard to think what he would be like had we not found the Family Hope Center and he still wasn't able to walk or talk. And he was under a lot of emotional stress. 'At three-and-a-half he wasn't walking or crawling, he slept in a cot like a baby and couldn't speak at all. 'Now he doesn't stop talking. I nearly crashed the car one day because he said his first sentence and said 'Mummy I don't want to go there'. I thought there must have been someone else in the car. Finley's mother Sarah, pictured with him left, said: 'We never thought he would be able to lead an independent life, but now there is no reason why he shouldn't be able to' 'I think sometimes there is a misconception that disabled children don't realise what they are missing, but it was shocking for us to find out just how much Finley actually does understand. It is a neurological disorder caused by clumps of grey that did not move to the correct location in the brain during early development. PVNH can cause seizures, breathing problems, joint problems, intellectual delays and other concern. It affects just 50 children in the UK. Little is known about the long term outcome of patients with periventricular nodular heterotopia . 'He is very determined to do things now and he questions things when he cant do them. 'His behaviour has changed so much and I didn't think that was possible. 'He is so much more confident and independent, and just like a normal child now. It is amazing - he won't let me do anything for him now. 'It has been hard work for us, but if it is working you don't care how much effort or time it takes. I think he will have another year or two left on the programme then he should be finished.' Finley is due to have his fifth appointment with the Family Hope Center in Liverpool next week - and has visited the center in Philadelphia three times.","Finley Lamb, five, suffers from Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia .

"Ed Miliband this morning launched a furious attack on David Cameron and other EU leaders for leaving refugees to drown by stopping search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean. The Labour leader said it was unacceptable to abandon thousands of immigrants boarding makeshift boats in Africa in the hope of making it to Europe. He also called on the UK to take a 'fare share' of refugees fleeing civil war. Mr Miliband's remarks came amid growing alarm over the number of desperate families risking their lives to escape the raging civil wars in the Middle East and North Africa. Scroll down for video . The Labour leader said it was unacceptable to abandon thousands of immigrants boarding makeshift boats in Africa in the hope of making it to Europe . Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in boats launched from Libya. Speaking in Manchester this morning, Mr Miliband attacked the decision to abandon European rescue missions. He said: 'The original decision was a mistake and it should be reversed.' Mr Miliband said: 'The logic is we are leaving people to die because it is a pull factor. We are better than that. We can't be leaving people to drown.' Earlier, he said: 'We cannot stand by as people drown in European waters simply to escape conflict in Libya and Syria. If I was prime minister, I would be working with other European leaders to act.' Local residents and rescue workers help a migrant woman after a boat carrying migrants sank off the island of Rhodes, southeastern Greece, yesterday . Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in boats launched from Libya . But senior Conservative minister William Hague insisted that the rescue missions had not helped. He also defended the Government's intervention in Libya in Libya 2011, helping to overthrow Colonel Gaddafi. He said it would be 'wrong to think that whatever's happened in Libya in the last few years is the cause of this'. Tunisian Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, was arrested when in Sicily last night some 24 hours after his overcrowded boat capsized in the Mediterranean killing hundreds of migrants . He added on BBC Radio 5live: 'Let me remind you of something as well, which is that when Colonel Gaddafi was still in power, there were periods when he simply allowed people to do exactly this, to get into boats and try to go to Europe – that was one of the ways in which he put pressure on Europe. 'So I don't think that is the change in this situation; I think this is a problem that goes well beyond Libya.' The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said the priority for stopping the migrant crisis had to be to stop people boarding boats rather than stepping up patrols in the Mediterranean. He said: '[It is] the human traffickers and smugglers who are peddling this terrible trade which is leading to so many people dying in the Mediterranean. 'And I think if we can do [tackle] that and provide more aid and assistance in North Africa to encourage people to stay put rather than risk life and limb moving great distances, that it seems to me is a more sustainable solution than coming up with lots of arbitrary numbers about who takes in which number of migrants from North Africa. And that's where the focus of our attention should be in the summit tomorrow.' The political row over how to tackle the crisis was sparked after 950 men, women and children drowned this week. Survivors told of how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. Elsewhere three people died when a rickety wooden boat ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes. Among them was a tiny child whose lifeless body was carried to the shore by a local man who had waded in to try to save him. Sunday morning: Italian coastguard responds to migrant ship after it capsizes off the coast of Libya with 700 passengers unaccounted for . Sunday afternoon: Passengers accounts of the ship say as many as 950 people may have been on board with 300 locked in the hull. Another boat is rescued off Sicily carrying 100 Syrian refugees. They are all brought to safety . Monday morning: A boat runs aground on the Greek holiday island of Rhodes killing a man, woman and child . Monday afternoon: Italian and Milanese coastguards respond to two distress calls off the coast of Libya from boats thought to be carrying up to 400 people. EU heads of state call for urgent action to ease the migrant crisis with an emergency summit called for later in the week . Monday at midnight: The surviving passengers of the Libyan boat arrive in Catania, Sicily. Among them is the crew's Tunisian captain and his Syrian crew member. Both were arrested and charged with 'favouring illegal immigration'. The captain was additionally charged with multiple manslaughter.","Around 1,300 people have drowned fleeing to Europe in the past two weeks .

"Garnet has been abandoned for almost 100 years. The tiny Montana outpost was established in the 1860s by miners looking for gold and silver, but it was devastated by fire around 1912 and deserted a few years later. While the town has since been restored, it remains empty, and local folklore says the area is haunted by former residents, with visitors saying they heard music and laughter, even in winter, and the sound of doors slamming in cottages where there aren't any doors. Now the U.S. Bureau of Land Management is offering free food, housing a job to people willing to live in Garnet and work as a tour operator, as the government prepares the village to become a new tourist stop. Scroll down for video . Ghost town coming back to life: The former mining town of Garnet in Montana was deserted after a fire in 1912.

New hot spot: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management in Missoula is offering free food, housing a job to people willing to live in Garnet and work as a tour operator, as the government prepares the village to become a new tourist stop. Creepy: Local folklore says the area is haunted by former residents, with visitors saying they heard music and laughter, even in winter, and the sound of doors slamming in cottages where there aren't any doors . Abandoned: Garnet was restored after half the town was devastated by fire, but it remains deserted, even though there is a mine nearby . Ghostly: Locals say the spirits come out around midnight. Garnet has no electricity, so the new workers might be in for a fright . There are four positions, with some workers operating as tour guides and others keeping the grounds. The job ad was first posted in local newspaper The Missoulian, expecting to only find interest from within Montana . It stressed there was no electricity or plumbing. Regardless, the story was almost immediately shared 32,000 on Facebook. The following day, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's office in Missoula was inundated with calls and emails. 'The calls came in almost immediately,' BLM spokeswoman Maria Craig told The Missoulian. 'Garnet Ghost Town Ranger Nacoma Gainan told me the next morning he already had 130 emails and he didn't know how many phone calls. The phone was ringing all morning. 'We got people asking about it from South Africa, from China, the United Kingdom, Germany and all over the country.' 'There were more out-of-state people than Montanans calling.' Help wanted: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is looking for volunteers to help manage Garnet Ghost Town, a Montana mining town more that's more than 100 years old, and has been mostly abandoned for nearly that long . Spooky: Garnet isn't a ghost town in name only: Rumors abound of real-life hauntings . Vacancies: The workers to volunteer to run Garnet will be put up in one of the cottages to live . Preparing: Once a mining town with a population of 1,000, Garnet is set to boom again as a tourist stop . Craig said that the working day wraps about 4.30pm, with the tourists leaving, giving the workers plenty of time to settle in before nightfall. She added that the job applications have now closed due to the overwhelming response, but was not clear whether the positions had been filled. Ellen Baumler, the Montana Historic Society's expert on all things creature comforts, wrote in her book, Montana Chillers, that the ghosts of Garnet would come out at midnight. She said people had reported the sound of a piano and that winter visitors had seen visions, according to The Bulletin Standard. 'Late at evening, the spirits of Garnet arrive out to enjoy in the moonlight,' Baumler wrote. 'Sometimes, in the deep wintertime silent, a piano tinkles in Kelley's Saloon and the spirits dance to ghostly new music. 'Men's voices echo in the empty rooms. But the moment a living, human hand touches the building, the noises stop.' Chilling: Interestingly, most of the spooky stories that surround Garnet have been reported in the winter . Janet Goodall, of Buffalo, New York, has worked at the Garnet visitor information center. She told Fox News it was more just strange things occurring rather than ghosts that she heard in her time there. 'I've seen visitors become friendly and helpful when unexpected things happen, like flat tires, empty gas tanks, keys locked in cars, minor injuries, and in one case, a diabetic faint,' she told the network.","The town of Garnet in Montana was established in the 1860s by miners looking for gold and silver .

"A church preacher is being held on suspicion of murdering his pregnant British wife in a hotel room in Ghana. The body of Charmain Adusah, 41, was discovered by hotel staff face down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days. Her husband, Eric Isaiah Adusah, a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher, was alleged to have left the hotel hurriedly on the day she is believed to have died. Whirlwind romance: Charmain and Eric Adusah, who were married last September, were said to have argued during stay, according to local reports . He told hotel managers at the time that his three-month pregnant wife was ill and did not want to be disturbed. A close family friend claimed last night that Mr Adusah, 28, flew back to London but later returned to Ghana after his wife’s body was found by concerned hotel staff who used a spare key to check on her after she failed to answer the door. Mr Adusah, originally from Ghana, is being held in police custody in the African country on suspicion of murdering the former NHS radiography assistant, whom he married suddenly last September – following a whirlwind romance – in a wedding which shocked her family and friends. His wife, whose maiden name was Speirs, already had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship in Wales. Christmas wishes: The couple pictured on a Christmas card. Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010 . But the boy has not yet been told the awful news and was staying with his father, a British man, last night. Mr Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. He has led sermons he describes as ‘divine visitation’ events across the UK and Ireland, receiving £1million in charitable donations in five years and giving sermons on religious satellite television channels. A close family friend last night accused Mr Adusah of being a ‘wolf in sheep’s clothing’, telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘We think he brainwashed her.’ Mrs Adusah – who was considered the ‘First Lady’ of her husband’s ministry – grew up in Arbroath in Scotland, and studied a degree in photojournalism at Swansea University. She worked as a radiography assistant in the Welsh NHS and later separated from the father of her son. She was described as a ‘free spirit’ who started following Mr Adusah’s church around two years ago. They started a relationship early last year and married in September in London. The couple had travelled to Ghana early this month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious conference hosted by controversial evangelist ‘Bishop’ John Yaw Adu, who has been exposed for chaining up mentally ill patients at ‘prayer camps’ for days on end so he could ‘heal’ them through prayer. Local reports claim Mr Adusah and his wife had argued at the start of the trip and he had booked himself into a budget motel alone, leaving her to stay with Bishop Yaw Adu. Happier times: The body of Charmain Adusah, left, was discovered by hotel staff face down in a bath. Husband Eric Isaiah Adusah is being held on suspicion of her murder . Arrest: Eric Isaiah Adusah, a Ghanaian British based Pastor, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his pregnant British wife Charmain Spears . After the conference ended, the couple apparently reconciled and checked into the Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua, where they booked in for five days on March 16. The upmarket hotel has security gates and tropical gardens. The couple were said to have argued over the length of their stay, according to the reports, with Mrs Adusah apparently wanting to stay in Ghana for a month but her husband saying it was far too long. Mr Adusah is said to have left the hotel at dawn the next day and warned reception that his wife did not want to be disturbed. But hotel managers became concerned when she still had not left the room and would not respond to knocks on the door. On March 20 hotel porters used a spare key to gain access to the room. A spokesman for Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at the police headquarters in Koforidua said Mrs Adusah was ‘found dead in the bath lying prostrate with a white towel wrapped around her, almost in a decomposed state’. Her close friend Christine Stephen, 42, of Camberley, Surrey, who has known Mrs Adusah since childhood, told The Mail on Sunday that the family did not hear about her death until March 21. She said: ‘I spoke to Charmain’s family and they said Eric had been in touch on that Saturday to say she had died. He said he was flying back to Ghana to identify her body on Sunday. Tragic: Charmain Adusah was found face down in a bath by hotel staff in Ghana . The Global Light Revival Ministries, founded by Eric Adusah in 2010, is a revivalist evangelical movement registered as a British charity and has received more than £1m in donations. It hosts gatherings across the UK and Ireland . He also told them he had returned to England because he had a three-day church event he had to attend here. But he was vague about the details of what happened, saying she had wanted to remain out there to help underprivileged children. ‘Charmain’s family couldn’t get hold of him after that Saturday, presumably because he had been arrested back in Ghana.’ Mrs Stephen said none of her friends took to him. ‘We thought he tried to cut her off from us, that he had brain-washed her. What person declares himself a prophet? Charmain was religious but she wasn’t a pastor.’ Mrs Stephen said the family wants to go to Ghana and repatriate their daughter’s body but they cannot afford it. Charmain’s mother Linda Speirs, 61, last night said she had been given legal advice not to comment. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We confirm the death of a British national in Ghana. Mr Adusah has not requested consular assistance.’ A representative of Mr Adusah’s church said: ‘There is no story. She died of natural causes.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Her body was discovered by hotel staff face down in bath .

"A man who dresses as the Cookie Monster to greet visitors to New York's Times Square was arrested for allegedly groping a teenager. Ranulfo Perez, 48, was arrested by police  after he allegedly groped the breasts of a 16-year-old girl who was outside a Toys R Us store as she was shown round with her tour group. However he was later released by the Manhattan District Attorney over concerns that the teenager lost sight of her attacker and could not be sure it was Perez. The incident is the latest involving people dressed up as costumed characters in Times Square, amid claims of sexual harassment and disorder. Scroll down for video . A man who dresses as the Cookie Monster and greets visitors to Times Square was arrested for allegedly groping a 16-year-old and then freed after police could not be sure it was him. Officials said the number of costumed characters in the area, like those pictured, are becoming an increasing problem in New York . The girl had claimed she was grabbed in a hug by a man dressed as the Cookie Monster who then touched her breasts. Perez was arrested at the scene, and charged with forcible touching in a manner injurious to a child less than 17, as well as second degree harassment, gothamist reported. The incident took place at about 5.30pm on Sunday. He was released on Tuesday morning as police confirmed they would not be prosecuting the case. The teenage girl, who was visiting from Winsconsin, told the New York Post: 'I am beyond upset about it. My level of anger right now isn't just about being molested. The fact that the Manhattan DA is 100 percent OK with it is utterly disgusting.' Perez told the newspaper that officers, who arrested him on Monday, had got the wrong Cookie Monster. He said: 'I love people and I love children . . . It could have been anyone else, but not me.' In recent years there has been a rise in the number of people dressing up in costumes as characters from popular television shows in Times Square, leading to calls for them to be regulated and forced to apply for a licence costing $175. In 2012 a man dressed as Elmo was arrested in Times Square following a loud verbal exchange . Rosa Sanchez, 36, pictured here dressed as Elmo, was arrested for aggressive panhandling . Costumed characters are a regular appearance in Times Square, with a number demanding tips . The characters are becoming renowned for causing disturbances in their interaction with members of the public and a crackdown on the issue has been dubbed Operation Sesame Street. Police have recently been distributing flyers reminding people that they do not have to pay to pose with the characters, following a number of incidents. Almost 20 costumed characters were arrested last year for a catalogue of offences. A man who dresses as Elmo from Sesame Street has been arrested several times for disorderly conduct for making anti-semitic remarks to passersby. Last year Rosa Sanchez, 36, from New Jersey, was taken into custody Tuesday for allegedly demanding tips in an aggressive manner from passersby while dressed as Elmo. More people are dressing up as the Cookie Monster (left), Woody from Toy Story (centre) and Elmo (right) Also in 2014 a man dressed as Toy Story hero Woody was arrested after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman by grabbing her buttocks. Several other costumed panhandlers were also arrested - in July, a man dressed as Spider-Man was charged with punching a police officer who intervened in a tipping dispute with a tourist. Three more men dressed as Spider-Man, Iron Man and Elmo were arrested that same weekend and charged with disorderly conduct for obstructing pedestrian traffic. In 2013 a different man dressed as the Cookie Monster was held by police over claims he had shoved a toddler.","A man dressed as the Cookie Monster in Times Square was arrested .

"People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13% higher than a colleague . The cost of divorce can wreck retirement many years after the break-up of a marriage, according to research. People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra £2,100 a year – £17,800 rather than £15,700 – to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages £22,100, Prudential’s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that £9,500 – the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday’s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse’s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests . The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce – usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse – does not fade away even as old age approaches. Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through ‘pension-splitting’ arrangements. One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research . Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: ‘Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. ‘A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made. ‘During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people’s lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.’ The findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.","People who have never been divorced can expect an extra £2,100 a year .

"Comedian Sarah Silverman was forced to apologize after she was caught exaggerating a story about being paid less than a man for a gig - to highlight the gender pay gap. The comic and feminist campaigner recalled an incident at the New York Comedy Club when she claimed she was paid less than her male counterpart, for a piece she recorded a wage-discrimination-activism video for Levo League. But Silverman has been forced to apologize after New York Comedy Club owner Al Martin revealed the story was false, because Silverman had been paid less purely because she appeared as a guest on the show and wasn't meant to receive anything - her male counterpart Todd Barry was booked for the slot. Scroll down for video . Comedian and campaigner Sarah Silverman has been forced to apologize after she used a fake story about getting paid less than her male friend to do a job, as she tried to emphasize the issue of the gender pay gap . Silverman has since publicly apologized to Martin and revealed she fabricated the story. But she stressed that critics should not use the story as a way to undermine the gender pay gap campaign. 'To the maniacs who want to use this as a chit against women’s issues, I ask that you please don’t. Because that would be super s****y,' she said in a statement, according to National Review. In the video, released on April 6, Silverman accused Martin of paying her $50 less than Barry to perform. She claimed while both did 15 minute back-to-back sets she was paid $10, while Barry went home with $60. 'So I went back inside and I asked the owner Al Martin and I said, ""Al, why did you pay me $10 and you paid Todd Barry $60?""' she said. Silverman appeared in the video and was later forced to apologise for fabricating the pay gap story S . 'And he, it was so perfect. He goes, ""Oh, did you want a $60 spot?"" It was symbolic, I didn’t need $60, but, you know it was pretty s****y.' She added: 'If you work a job and a man is working the same job, then you should be getting paid the same.' However Martin revealed what really happened in a Facebook post - prompting Silverman's apology. She said: 'When I was interviewed by Levo, they asked me ""Do you remember a time you were paid less for the same job"" and this story, being just that, popped into my head.' The comic said she regretted mentioning Martin by name, who had always been 'so lovely' to her. She also admitted her anecdote had not been a good example of the gender pay gap. Silverman apologized for naming club owner Al Martin in the fabricated story but said the issue around her incorrectly recounting the anecdote should not be used to undermine the campaign for wage equality . Silverman is dating Welsh actor Michael Sheen (left)  Before that, she was with Jimmy Kimmel (right) In a Facebook post Martin said he fully accepted Silverman's apology and invited her back to perform. He wrote: 'It takes a big person to apologize and and today Sarah proved she is that kind of person.' Silverman came under criticism last month after she posted a list of ten 'rape prevention tips' on Twitter. Critics blasted the comic for offering 'tips' to potential rapists while dozens of men responded by branding her sexist for suggesting that all men desire to rape women. The sarcastic set of rules, which focus on the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim, also include 'if you are in an elevator and a woman gets in, don't rape her', as well as 'when you encounter a woman who is asleep, the safest course of action is not to rape her'.","In campaign video Silverman said she was paid six times less than her male counterpart .

"The number of female genital cosmetic operations performed on the NHS has risen five-fold in the last decade as women worry they're not 'normal'. Labial reduction procedures - surgery to reduce the size of the inner ‘lips’ of the vagina - have risen five-fold in the past 10 years, with more than 2,000 operations performed in 2010. And the trend is reflected  in Australia where  procedures have more than doubled in the same time period. The labia are lips which protect the vagina. There are inner labia – the labia minora - which are thinner, and the outer labia – the labia majora, which have more tissue and fat. Labial reduction procedures - surgery to reduce the size of the inner ‘lips’ of the vagina - have risen five-fold in the past 10 years, with more than 2,000 operations performed on the NHS in 2010 . They naturally vary in size and shape, but some women are dissatisfied or distressed about the appearance of their labia, even when they are classified medically as perfectly normal. The surgery involves reducing the size of a woman's labia minora to make them more symmetrical and smaller than the labia majora. This is done by cutting away the ‘excess’ skin with a scalpel, or possibly a laser, and stitching up the loose edge with dissolvable stitches, until it heals. Experts at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists at the World Congress in Brisbane, have called for more research to try and better understand women's motivations. A study by the University of Melbourne explored the views of women aged 18 to 28. Interviews focused on participants' views of the 'normal' and 'ideal' vulval anatomy, on cosmetic surgery and the sources of information available. Calida Howarth, from the university, said: 'It is essential that doctors do not assume that women have an inherent knowledge of their genitalia and the anatomical terms used to describe it. 'This contemporary women's health issue requires further research and interdisciplinary collaboration if we are going to ensure best practice and achieve optimal outcomes for our patients.' A labiaplasty is a surgical procedure to reduce the size of the labia minora – the flaps of skin either side of the vaginal opening. Most labiaplasty operations are done by private clinics as cosmetic surgery, to change the appearance of the female genitals. Occasionally, there may be a medical need for the operation (for example, because the tissue is affected by disease), in which case it might be covered by the NHS. However, the NHS doesn't routinely provide this operation. It's natural and normal for a woman to have noticeable skin folds around the vaginal opening and, in most cases, this shouldn't cause any problems. Some women are dissatisfied with or distressed about the appearance of their labia, even when they look perfectly normal to the health professional examining them. A labiaplasty involves shortening or reshaping the vaginal lips, a bit like shortening a hem on a dress. It is usually performed by a gynaecologist or plastic surgeon. The unwanted tissue is cut away with a scalpel or possibly a laser, and the loose edge may be stitched up with fine, dissolvable stitches. It can be carried out using either a general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic with sedation, and the whole procedure takes about one to two hours. However there is a lack of research investigating how effective this procedure is. This means there's no guarantee it will achieve a long-lasting desired effect, and there are short- and long-term risks to consider. Source: NHS Choices . The researchers concluded that women would benefit from better access to information showing a range of normal vulval anatomy. Another study led by the University of New South Wales examined attitudes to pubic hair removal and the relationship with physical discomfort, viewing pornography, genital self-image and the consideration of labiaplasty. The study found no link between the removal of pubic hair and requests for the cosmetic surgery. However, the study also highlighted the need for careful recognition among the healthcare profession of the possible reasons for the increase in women seeking surgery. Cathy Cui, one of the researchers, said: 'While women request labiaplasty for physical and psychological reasons, the reasons for increasing numbers of surgeries in the last decade are not clear.' Research has exposed a lack of education regarding the management of patients requesting female genital cosmetic surgery. Tristan Harding, from the University of Melbourne, said: 'GPs would be greatly assisted by practice guidelines when faced with such requests. 'If they are able to provide adequate, accurate information to patients, this may prevent unnecessary surgery and alleviate patient anxiety. 'GPs should also consider referring women to a gynaecologist rather than a cosmetic surgeon when they wish to have surgery.' The studies highlight a need to improve clinical guidance for healthcare professionals, the experts said. And they called for further research around the surgery and patients' knowledge and perceptions of 'normal' vulval anatomy. Meanwhile a consultant plastic and aesthetic surgeon told MailOnline said many of his patients seek the surgery because they suffer problems ranging from pain and tearing to extreme psychological distress. Mr Miles Berry, who works at the Weymouth Street Hospital, London, said he believes the rise in operations is down to an increase in awareness and availability of the procedure. While many people believe these women are simply seeking a ‘designer vagina’, he said most are having the procedure for functional reasons or because they have been traumatised by having labia that are misshapen or low-hanging. Some will never enter into a relationship for fear of a partner seeing their genitalia, while others cannot undress in public or wear a bikini, he told MailOnline. Other women have labia that are so long that horse riding, cycling or having sex is painful. ‘One woman was part of the cycling team, she had persistent swelling and chafing. It stopped her cycling,’ Mr Berry said. Meanwhile consultant plastic and aesthetic surgeon Miles Berry told MailOnline said many of his patients seek the surgery because they suffer pain and tearing and extreme psychological distress . There are also women who have torn their labia during intercourse, or while horse riding, which as well as being excruciatingly painful, causes bleeding. ‘When women with this condition wear tight clothes, like jeans, they experience chafing,' added Mr Berry. ‘One lady used tampons to keep her labia inside because they were hanging down below her underwear. ‘I saw another lady who was getting recurrent thrush as she had all this extra tissue down there that was moist.’ His clinic carried out 49 procedures in 2014 compared to 27 in 2013 – an 80 per cent rise - while NHS figures show there were 2,000 labiaplasties performed in 2010 – a five-fold rise since 2001. Many women who come for a consultation with Mr Berry are so insecure about the way their labia looks it is impairing their life, he said. Women can be born with naturally long labia or that are shaped in a way that their owners deem unattractive, he explained. In some women, they stretch naturally over the course of a lifetime, while others experience stretching or tearing as a result of childbirth, and are embarrassed by the result. This is usually due to hormones associated with pregnancy, the stretching of the vagina during the birth or due to the loss of the pelvic floor muscles.","NHS labial reduction procedures risen five-fold in the last 10 years .

"Children are being auditioned at school for Britain’s Got Talent to stop them bunking off lessons, it has been revealed. Teachers say that youngsters have been playing truant as they attempt to find instant stardom on the ITV talent show. As a result, for the first time producers have held auditions at dozens of secondary schools and colleges around the UK for the new series. Scroll down for video . Brace yourselves: Britain's Got Talent judges Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon strike glamorous poses . The move has helped reduce unauthorised absence levels in some schools on the days of auditions. Teacher Angela Butler said Britain’s Got Talent spent two hours at her school – Newtown High School, in Powys, mid-Wales – and a local sixth-form college in November. Around 30 Newtown High School pupils aged 11 to 18 sang and played instruments for producers during preliminary auditions after getting permission from their parents. Mrs Butler, a head of year, described similar on-site auditions across the region as a preventative measure to stop youngsters skipping school. Speaking at the NASUWT union’s annual conference in Cardiff, she attacked the shocking truancy levels in the city caused by auditions for talent shows. The Britain's Got Talent judges and presenters are seen on stage before the start of the 2015 series . The 52-year-old said the day for auditions was ‘the day throughout Wales when most kids are absent’. She added: ‘I think that is an absolute travesty, that kids think that is the way that they’re going to have a route out of poverty and not education.’ Simon Cowell has defended allowing young children to take part in Britain’s Got Talent, despite fears by child welfare campaigners that many of them are too young to cope with fame. The music mogul says the ITV show – which has no lower age limit – provides opportunities to those who might not otherwise have them. Cowell, 55, who has a 14-month-old son, Eric, with partner Lauren Silverman, said: ‘Every kid who comes on our show is there because the child wants to be on our show and we make sure we look after them. ‘As for whether it’s the right thing having someone so young singing on the show – they may not have the opportunities in life other people have.’ Speaking afterwards, Mrs Butler told how Britain’s Got Talent had changed how it auditions to stop pupils ‘coming down to Cardiff’ on school days. She said: ‘For a couple of years we had absences. It must have been a problem throughout Wales because this time, for the auditions that have happened for Britain’s Got Talent, they actually sent people into schools. ‘When the producers from the programme came to our school, they said they were going all around schools to prevent exactly this [truancy]. 'They spent two hours in our school and they must have seen 30 kids, perhaps more than that. Then they moved onto a sixth form college in the same town.’ But she also bemoaned how children now seem to think fame is the only way to succeed: ‘Children now think The Voice or Britain’s Got Talent or The X Factor or winning the lottery – that’s how they’re going to get on and have the things that they see celebrities doing. I do think that kids want this quick fix.’ Britain’s Got Talent – and its judging panel Simon Cowell, David Walliams, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon – is returning on Saturday for its ninth series, with ITV chiefs expecting bumper audience ratings. A source from the show said: ‘Last year was the first time we’d ever gone to schools. We did go to schools all around the country. ‘We are the one of the few talent shows that allow kids to enter, so the logical extension of that was going to schools to allow kids to audition as easily as possible.’ BGT – and its judging panel Simon Cowell, David Walliams, Amanda Holden (pictured) and Alesha Dixon – is returning on Saturday for its ninth series, with ITV chiefs expecting bumper audience ratings .","ITV's Britain's Got Talent is returning on Saturday for its ninth series .

In the book, she advocates the elimination of: 'dairy, eggs, sugar, corn, wheat, gluten, potatoes, tomatoes, red meat, shell or deep-water fish.' But Gwyneth still allows herself to drink alcohol: 'I really like a martini or a glass of red wine in the evening', she said. 'I think it’s a really nice way to say, “OK, it’s adult time now.” Having lived in England for so long, I have become a real booze hound.'

Also banned are tea, coffee, sugar, fizzy drinks including soda and tonic water and, of course, alcohol. While following the plan, at least 70 per cent of your diet should be alkaline, while the other 30 per cent can be acidic, which basically means a lot of fruit and vegetables.

"Leroy J. Toppins went missing on Friday night while playing with siblings in the front yard of his family's home in Washington Court House, Ohio. His parents worriedly reported him missing after he disappeared about 6pm. More than 100 locals joined a search for the toddler that lasted all day Saturday. However at 7pm, the boy's body was found in a pond at an old stone quarry, a short distance from where he was last seen, local network NBC 4. The quarry had been abandoned for years. Tragedy: Leroy J. Toppins went missing about 6pm Friday while playing with siblings in the front yard of his family's home in Washington Court House, Ohio. His body was found in an adjacent quarry Saturday night . Scene: After a search spanning almost 24 hours, dive crews found the toddler's body about 7pm Friday in Sugar Creek Stone Quarry, a short distance from the family's house . The property is adjacent to the former Sugar Creek Stone Quarry. The quarry had been abandoned for several years. Search crews had been combing through the area for almost 24 hours, but were hampered by the area's conditions, according to Concord Green Fire Chief Ralph Stegbauer. 'Even the creek lines where the volunteers are working are very steep,' Stegabauer told WHIO. 'A lot of brush, a lot of trees and, of course, this time of year the water is up high so we have a lot of things in the water.' The boy's body was found about three feet from the pond's shore. Tragically, officials said the pond wouldn't have been there if it weren't for recent rain. No foul play: Police say they have no reason to consider the death of Leroy suspicious, believing he wandered off by himself . Police said the missing two-year-old was found dead in a runoff pond near his house in Fayette County. The quarry was adjacent to his family's home and had been abandoned for years . Police do not believe the death was suspicious. 'At this point there's nothing to indicate foul play,' Fayette County Sheriff Vernon Stanforth told WLWT5. 'The family has been extremely throughout the process. 'We believe the child merely just wandered away and got too close to the water. 'We're never equipped to deal with death regardless of where it is, it's especially troubling when you have a small baby.'

"Christy Turlington Burns may be about to run her fourth marathon in as many years, but the former supermodel insists that childbirth was by far her toughest challenge yet. The former supermodel, who's gearing up for the London marathon on 26 April, told Red Magazine that giving birth has been her toughest physical challenge. And Christy, who suffered a potentially life-threatening complication shortly after the delivery of her daughter Grace, now 11, said today she's feeling 'stronger and healthier' than ever. Scroll down for video . Fitness fanatic: Christy Turlington, pictured last month training for the upcoming London Marathon, says that after experiencing a tricky childbirth, 'anything' seemed possible, including three marathons to date . Christy - who is mother to daughter Grace and son Finn, eight, with her husband of 11 years Edward Burns, 47 - had just given birth to Grace in 2003 when she was struck with a post-partum haemorrhage, causing her placenta to become embedded in her uterus wall. She suffered massive blood loss and was forced to undergo a painful procedure whereby the doctors manually tore her placenta free without pain relief - an experience that could easily have killed her had she not been in such good hands. ‘I actually feel stronger and healthier than ever,' she says. 'Giving birth was probably the most empowering thing I’ve ever done physically. I was like, now I can do anything. I can run a marathon… I can run three marathons!’ Her experience inspired her to launch Every Mother Counts in 2010. 'I guess my own experience of childbirth was the epiphany,’ she says of her decision to launch Every Mother Counts in 2010, an organisation dedicated to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers around the world. Getting better with age: The 46-year-old mother-of-two, pictured in 2013 with her kids Finn, eight, and Grace, 11, insists she's feeling 'stronger and healthier' than ever . Good cause: Christy, pictured training her first marathon in 2011, launched Every Mother Counts in 2010, an organization dedicated to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers around the world . Dedicated: According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable - a statistic she's determined to change . She said: ‘What I realised was actually how lucky I had been that so many women don’t even get to choose when they become pregnant.' 'They don’t get to choose whether they will be medicated, or have a natural birth. This is just how it is, and it’s not an ideal way to bring life into the world, I don’t think.’ According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable. But, as she points out, the U.S. is one of the eight countries worldwide where maternal deaths are on the rise. Christy, who became famous alongside Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista in the era of the supermodels, now runs marathons in aid of Every Mother Counts. She said she is determined to strengthen the 'sisterhood' between mothers around the world, wherever the happen to be. Last month, the former face of Calvin Klein was unveiled as the celebrity face of Apple Watch. She appeared in a promotional video to promote the gadget's fitness software, in which she is shown training for a half marathon in Africa, in order to highlight Apple's partnership with Every Mother Counts.

"A Texas mom who has already spent seven years in prison for the murder of her four-year-old adopted son, and was released shortly before Christmas, will not face new murder charges. Hannah Overton, 37, wiped back tears as she, along with her husband Larry and five children, celebrated news that after having her conviction overturned for poisoning her son, Andrew Burd, with an overdose of salt, prosecutors have dropped all charges against her and will no longer be looking into her case. Throughout her incarceration, her family  stood by her and protested her innocence, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka had said shortly after she was released that he would push again for capital murder charges. He could do this as her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, meaning this would not be a case of double jeopardy. Scroll down for video . Hannah Overton (above wiping away tears with her daughter and son) will not be tried on murder charges again in the death of her adopted son . Overton's five children and husband Larry (above) were there to  celebrate the news . In a news release however, Skura said that he would not be trying the case again due to 'a myriad of factors which came about after a careful review of the previous trial, re-interviewing some of the key witnesses, consulting with some of the medical experts involved in the case, reviewing evidence adduced at recent hearings and staffing the case with the current prosecutors assigned to the case.' A judge then granted Skura's motion to dismiss. 'Wow, we don't even know where to begin,' Overton said after hearing this news. 'We are so excited about all God has done in and through all of this. He has carried us through.' An appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News. Original prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since. On a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well. When he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning. A week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning. But during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt. The mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in Overton's innocence. Late last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka was set to try her again . Overturned: In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Overton's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4-year-old foster son, citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of Andrew Burd (right) New details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence, like providing details on the boy's stomach content at the time of his death. The defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy's vomit were unavailable but Overton's lawyers claimed Eastwood withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested. The pediatrician that had treated Andrew before he was placed in Overton's care has also said that the child's medical state was not properly explained at the trial. Dr Edgar Cortes said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder. 'I think that if we're going to be fair, if we're going to be just, we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration,' he testified at a February hearing, part of Overton's appeal. Teachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to eat trash on one occasion. Andrew died a day after the Overtons took him to the hospital. Prosecutors claimed he died after Overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning. Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica . The boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children. But the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home. 'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008. Eastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010. In 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.","Hannah Overton will not be tried on murder charges again in the death of her adopted son .

"It was a fishing trip with a very big catch – namely the £9 homemade rowing boat in which the two anglers ventured out on to the open sea. Built with discarded scraps from house conversions including loft insulation board and polystyrene, it was glued together with silicone sealant. Amazingly, the 6ft vessel held together long enough for the men to set up their rods and haul in some fish. But they were scuppered when an oar snapped 200 yards off Jaywick, Essex, and they had to call 999. The bungling fishermen who had to be rescued from their DIY boat, who have been named as Aaron Jones, right, and Jamie Toms, left . The DIY boat used by a pair of fisherman, who had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew. The men cobbled it together using insulation boards, scrap plywood, laminate flooring, coat hangers and silicone glue . The anglers had already taken the boat out to sea the day before their rescue without any problems. They got the materials to build the boat for free and spent £9 on silicone glue to hold the boat together . A lifeboat crew arrived to find neither man wearing a lifejacket, and one unable to swim. Despite the experience, one of the men yesterday pledged to return to the water with another homemade boat. Jamie Toms, 27, a self-employed builder, said: ‘I’m already thinking about doing it again but next time I’ll get a little engine instead of oars. ‘The boat itself was solid – it was waterproof. We took it out the day before and we were in it for two or three hours and it floated, no problem. The long and the short of it is that this time one of the oars snapped. They were proper oars but one snapped at the join so we were stranded with only one oar. ‘I only called 999 as I was worried for my mate as he can’t swim. He was panicking and shaking because it was cold, so I was more concerned for his safety than my own. ‘If it was just me out there I would have tried to swim to shore. What’s the worst that could happen? I would have drowned.’ The boat was put together by Mr Toms’s friend Aaron Jones, who scavenged 4in-thick insulation board, polystyrene and scrap wood. The DIY boat during its construction. The pair used scrap wood that they had found and spent just £9 buying silicone adhesive . As well as using scraps of wood, the pair also made a DIY anchor using a 15 metre rope and a lump of scrap iron . After rescuing the men, who were found without lifejackets the RNLI crew had to bring the boat to the shore . After the rescue, Clacton RNLI returned the fishing equipment to the pair before they destroyed the unseaworthy boat . One of the men, named as Jamie Toms, who had to be rescued . Coathanger wire was used to make the rowlocks, the rings on either side of the boat that provide the pivot for the oars. The only outlay was £9 on the sealant to glue and waterproof the craft. Mr Jones, who is also in his 20s, refused to comment yesterday. But Mr Toms added: ‘We’re just two lads who were bored and wanted to make a boat – why not? It’s better than going out and doing drugs and committing crime. 'Obviously I said thanks to the lifeguards and sorry for being a bit of an idiot and going out with no safety gear. ‘I was quite calm as I’d already been in that situation before so I knew what to do. ‘In about 2006 me and a few mates bought a rubber dinghy and got p***** up as we wanted to see how far we could get out before needing to be rescued.’ The pair, from Jaywick, lost their anchor, made from scrap iron, in the rescue. But they did come home with a dogfish, two cod and three crabs. Joff Strutt, of Clacton RNLI, said the lifeboat crew had been stunned by the men’s stupidity. The boat was destroyed.","Two men had made the DIY boat at their home using scrap wood and glue .

"Nick Clegg tonight vowed to block the Tories imposing deep welfare cuts as the price of any future Coalition deal. The Deputy Prime Minister said he would not allow the Lib Dems to prop David Cameron up in power if he insisted on pushing ahead with his plan to slash £12billion from the benefits bill. In an interview on the BBC, Mr Clegg also suggested he would veto a new deal unless the Tories agreed new taxes on the rich. But the Deputy Prime Minister defended his record in government with Mr Cameron. Asked if he was proud of his record in power, Mr Clegg said: 'Hell yes.' Scroll down for video . The Deputy Prime Minister said he would not allow the Lib Dems to prop up David Cameron in power if he insisted on pushing ahead with his plan to slash £12billion from the benefits bill . The Lib Dem leader, meanwhile, accused the Tories of ‘lashing out’ at Labour because they knew they could not win the election. Mr Clegg's remarks come after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon launched an extraordinary attack on Ed Miliband last week. Mr Fallon said the Labour leader had stabbed his brother in the back to win the leadership and was now 'willing to stab the United Kingdom in the back to become prime minister' by giving up the Trident missile system to secure the support of the SNP. Mr Clegg’s insistence that he will not go into Coalition with the Tories if they insist on such deep welfare cuts increases the possibility that the Lib Dems could strike a deal with Labour after the election. However, the Deputy Prime Minister said he would also veto a deal with Mr Miliband if Labour did not set out in more detail how they would slash the deficit. He said: ‘I wouldn’t accept £12billion of welfare cuts. In exactly the same way that I could never countenance recommending to the Liberal Democrats entering into a coalition with the Labour Party that isn’t serious about balancing the books rather than the specious stuff they’ve come up with today. 'Equally I would not recommend to the Lib Dems that we go into coalition with the Conservatives if they insist on a plan which is a marked departure from what we’ve done in this coalition. ‘They’re asking for £12billion over two years. We’ve made £20billion over five. They want to ask the poorest to make additional sacrifices whilst not asking the richest to pay an additional penny through the tax system to balance the books.’ In an interview on the BBC tonight, Mr Clegg said the price of another Coalition would be new taxes on the rich and a scaling back of the Prime Minister’s planned welfare cuts . Asked by host Evan Davis if he felt ‘betrayed’ by the Prime Minister at any stage since 2010, he pointed to the AV referendum. He said: ‘It was shoddy it was unnecessary I didn’t think they needed to win the argument by being quite so personal. I wish the referendum had been fought on its merits. ‘What I have learnt about the Conservatives – and you can see it in this election campaign – when they think they’re about to lose their grip on something that they like, usually power, they can lash out, they’re doing it in this election campaign because they realise they’re not going to win it.’ But Mr Clegg said the Coalition had been ‘worth’ all the pain. He said: ‘Yes, of course it has and any Liberal Democrat will tell you that… we took the decision as a democratic party. And we decided that notwithstanding the impact on our short term political popularity it was the right thing for the country. ‘And a time when people are so cynical about politics, and so fed up with politicians isn’t it a good thing that a party, a plucky brave party put country before party and I have an old fashioned belief that if you do the right thing, that there are plenty of fair minded folk out there who will recognise that…was every decision a decision I would relish?

"A morbidly obese man has started documenting his efforts to lose more than 300lbs - without weight loss surgery - after the intense back pain brought on by his size prompted him to get serious about his health. For years, Iowa-based writer Daniel P. Finney, ignored that at 563lbs he was severely overweight - even shrugging off strangers who called him 'fatty' as he walked down the street. But after a series of health issues, the 39-year-old became inspired to shed more than half of his body weight the natural way and chronicle his journey for The Des Moines Register. 'I know I'm responsible for my actions,' the columnist wrote for the newspaper's website. 'And I'm the only person who can really fix the problem.' Scroll down for video. Weight loss journey: Daniel P. Finney, 39, of Iowa, is sharing his efforts to lose over 300lbs; he started out weighing 563lbs and has lost 20lbs in a month . Daniel shared that he has been overweight since high school, and over the years has gotten used to the fact that he doesn't fit into seats at most public venues or booths at restaurants. As one of 79 million obese Americans, he has also become accustomed to the emotional pain of being called 'fatty' and getting verbally abused by strangers. In fact, even a diagnosis of Type II diabetes didn't alarm him enough to change his habits, and other health issues, like regularly pulling muscles in his calves, became a way of life. It wasn't until a combination of intense lower back pain - caused by carrying groceries, since Daniel said he can't carry anything that weighs much more than a magazine - and trouble sleeping led him to see a doctor. 'The pain had reached a point where I was practically immobile,' he said, adding that he could walk only 150 feet before he would have to stop. That's when an X-ray showed him that he also had arthritis and a narrowing of his spinal cavity. His doctor referred him to the Mercy Weight Loss Clinic in West Des Moines, Iowa. Now, Daniel is working with a therapist to tackle his emotional eating issues, as well as a nutritionist and a physical therapist. He also uses a calorie-counting app on his phone to track his eating, but admitted that even though he is serious about losing weight, making major lifestyle changes isn't easy. 'I don't know if I want to go through the rest of my life eating a leaf of kale and two scoops of vitamin supplements and sipping a thimble of water,' he said. 'The thought terrifies me of no more pizza, nachos, chicken wings, Mountain Dew or fries.' But he is still determined to try to lose over 300lbs the old-fashioned way, rather than go under the knife. If he chose to have gastric sleeve surgery, which makes the stomach smaller and reduces the hormones that produce cravings, he could lose as much as 60 per cent of his excess weight in a year - but Daniel said he is afraid of such a drastic medical procedure, and his doctor has told him that it should only be considered as a last resort. Working hard: Daniel is working with a mental health therapist, a physical therapist, and a nutritionist to lose weight and recover from myriad health problems . 'It took me a long time to gain the weight. It will take time to lose it,' said Daniel, adding that his goal is to move slowly and lose 'maybe 50 or 52lbs a year'. Focusing more on changing his lifestyle than dieting could be the key to long-lasting success for the writer, as a study by the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination found that more than 95 per cent of diets fail. So far, his efforts are paying off: After three weeks working toward his goal, he said that for the first time in years he felt better about his health. Now a month in, he has lost 20.6lbs, which he noted is equal to the weight of 'four fully grown Chihuahuas' or 'a tire for a full-sized sedan'.","Iowa-based writer Daniel P.

"The FBI have recovered one of the gold bars stolen in a $5 million armored truck robbery in North Carolina last month. Investigators say the location the bar was found - somewhere in South Florida - has provided them with a big break in the case. 'This confirms that there is a South Florida nexus to this,' Justin E. Fleck, supervisory special agent of the squad leading the investigation, told ABC News. 'We believe that additional gold bars from the robbery may still be in South Florida and we continue to need the public’s help in solving this crime.' The highway heist occurred on March 1 in Wilson County, almost halfway into the truck's journey from Miami to Boston. Police have previously said they suspected it was an inside job because the 18-wheeler truck - owned by transport company TransValue - pulled over when one of the two armed guards on board 'felt sick'. Big break: The FBI say they recovered this 26-pound gold bar - worth up to $500,000 - somewhere in South Florida, which has provided a big break in their investigation into last month's highway heist in North Carolina . The guards said that after the vehicle stopped they were approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered them to lay on the ground. The men spoke in Spanish and said they were 'policia.' The trio tied the guards' hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods before taking 275lbs of gold. The gold totaled $4.8 million, but the truck was carrying about $10 million worth of metal, so the thieves left half the load - mostly silver - behind. Suspects: Police previously shared sketches of the suspects thought to be male and possibly Hispanic who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger. There are three suspects altogether . White van: Two security guards working for Transvalue Inc of Miami were reportedly approached by three armed men driving a white van, pictured here, after pulling over on the interstate . Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. admitted last month the story was suspicious. 'There is suspicion at this time that this could be an inside job due to the circumstances of the robbery,' a Wilson County Sheriff's Office detective wrote in a search warrant obtained by ABC. 'The fact that the truck was robbed immediately upon it pulling over at an unannounced stop is suspicious in and of itself,' the document added. 'It is also suspicious because there are no markings on the side of the truck that would indicate the type of cargo contained therein. 'The suspects also went directly to the trailer and found the gold which was in unmarked five gallon buckets. It is not believed that this is a random act due to the nature and facts of this robbery.' Police are now seeking a search warrant for the phones of the armed guard who felt sick because of the suspicious nature of the case. Search: Armed robbers are suspected of stealing $5 million in gold from an 18-wheeler taking the precious from Florida to Massachusetts on Interstate 95. Above, deputies investigate a wooded area near the road . Location: The men 'ordered the guards to lie on the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods, before taking 275lbs gold' Cone: This photo is of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back . Investigation: Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr, pictured, said that differing stories from the guards about the armed robbery had led to suspicions over their accounts of the heist . Woodard shared sketches of the three suspects who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger. Meanwhile, a photo was shown of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back. The traffic cone had the marking of a company that only does work in Florida, according to ABC. Woodard said the driver and the passenger, who speak little English, are not suspects, but both men have been interviewed separately several times by police. He added that the driver and the passenger did violate their company’s policies by exiting the vehicle without their firearms and leaving the firearms inside the truck. Wilson County Sheriff's Deputies investigate an area near Interstate 95 in Wilson, North Carolina, on Monday . Investigation: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined in the search for the robbers, thought to be male and possibly Hispanic. Neither of the guards was injured during the 'very rare incident', TransValue said . A reported 275lbs of gold were stolen and silver was also being carried in the truck, which was stopped near mile marker 114 on the highway. Locks on the back of the truck were sawed off, according to WITN. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined in the search for the robbers, thought to be male and possibly Hispanic. The metal was owned by Republic Metals Corporation in Opalocka, Florida, according to a search warrant. TransValue, which specializes in transporting valuable goods and money between financial centers, keeps goods they move insured for up to $100 million. A $50,000 reward is on offer for information leading to an arrest. Shortly after the heist confused drivers told 911 dispatchers that they saw uniformed drivers run into the North Carolina highway with their hands bound, motioning for help, according to recordings.","Heist occurred March 1 in Wilson County, North Carolina .

"One penalty, a quiz answer-in-waiting and an extraordinary precedent that might just linger. That was the surreal upshot of one of the shortest international matches in history on Thursday night, when 22 women from England and Norway’s Under 19 sides got together for a couple of minutes of football. Leah Williamson stood up, a player for Arsenal Ladies but virtually anonymous in wider conversations about football. Not anymore. Leah Williamson (centre) stepped up again to take the penalty during the 18-second rematch against Norway . Williamson went the same way as her successful spot-kick last Saturday and found the net once again . Norwegian goalkeeper Oda Marie Hove Bogstad was unable to stop Williamson's brilliant effort . The England captain wheels away in celebration after handing her side a crucial 2-2 draw . The England players join the Arsenal star in celebration in front of a small crowd at the Seaview Stadium . England held on in the final moments to secure the draw and, with it, a place in this summer's finals in Israel . Williamson blows a kiss to the crowd as Mo Marley's side look ahead to this summer's tournament . Number of seconds played: 65.18 after the players returned to the centre circle . Number of England players on the pitch: Norway were already down to 10 outfield players, but England brought on a sub to replace one injured in the game vs Switzerland . Days between spot-kicks: Five days between Saturday's clash and the controversial rematch . Number of goals scored: 1 - the infamous penalty . She found out on Wednesday that England would have to visit the Seaview Stadium in Belfast for a single penalty; she spent Thursday waiting as the frenzy grew and dragged her profile with it. But, at last, a footballer of English blood who can take a penalty. She rode the storm and tucked it away for 2-2 and a place in the European Championships this summer. Williamson said: ‘They were the longest 24 hours of my life, I hadn't slept. I went through so many emotions and just felt excitement. ‘We had a conversation just before I came out which was quite emotional. We have been through a bigger journey than some people go through in their whole careers because of what happened.’ The broader context here was the decision that led to this tiny portion of a match being repeated five days after it was first played. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier on Saturday . Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute . Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway in Belfast . The details are famous by now, as is the protagonist. Williamson scored a 96th-minute penalty to make it 2-2 against Norway last Saturday, but her England team-mate Rosella Ayane had encroached the box. Instead of ordering a retake, a rising German referee, Marija Kurtes made a startling error and gave Norway a free-kick. The possibilities that will arise from UEFA deciding to restage the game from the point of that mistake are fascinating. Daniel Geey, a sports lawyer at FieldFisher, told Sportsmail: ‘Many would see this as a dangerous precedent because UEFA are intervening in an on-field refereeing mistake. ‘UEFA need to make clear in any judgment what powers they have in extraordinary circumstances like this. There’s effectively a Pandora’s Box opening to clubs questioning even blatant refereeing mistakes in matches that may, for example, determine promotion or relegation.’ A UEFA spokesman said: ‘It hasn’t happened so far and we have no reason to suspect leading referees would be capable of such basic errors. It is mostly a matter of experience. Some of the referees at Under 19s level will be just starting out themselves.’ Williamson probably experienced more than most. According to the laws of the game, a penalty should be retaken if it entered the goal after encroachment by team-mates of the player taking the kick. Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box . Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner . Ahead of the 18-second rematch, a UEFA statement read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has ordered the match to be replayed. 'The replay of the match should be carried out as follows: . 'The match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the Football Association at the European Women's Under-19 Championship 2015 match between England vs Norway played on April 4, 2015, and extended according to the discretion of the referee. German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month . England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday . 'The penalty kick shall be retaken by the Football Association. 'According to the Laws of the Game (Law 14), a team-mate of the player taking the kick infringes the Laws of the Game: . - the referee allows the kick to be taken . - if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken . - if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred . 'As the ball entered the goal, the kick should have been re-taken. Thus the CDEB ordered that the remaining time of the match should be replayed in accordance with article 6 (e) and 7 (2) of the disciplinary regulations. Williamson scored from the penalty spot during England's 3-1 victory against Switzerland on Thursday . Jenna Dear (right) scores with a header as England inched closer to European Championship qualification . 'Teams must field the same players which were on the pitch at that moment. Any of these players can take the penalty kick.' An FA spokesperson said: 'After England Women U19s' match against Norway on Saturday, April 4, the FA lodged an appeal to UEFA following a disallowed penalty. 'Due to an incorrect application of the game's laws by the match referee, UEFA have ordered the match to be replayed from the point of the penalty. 'The remainder of the match will be played on Thursday at 9.45pm at the same stadium – Seaview, Belfast.' Williamson is congratulated by her England team-mates after scoring past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot . Former Everton and England captain Mo Marley is head coach of the national women's U19 team . Although it only lasted around 50 seconds, officials, stewards and paramedics were all required to attend and admission was free for fans. England, coached by former national captain Mo Marley, were 2-0 down to Norway on Saturday before substitute Ayane pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point. However, Wiliiamson's penalty was disallowed and the match ended in defeat. England brushed off the disappointment on Monday, though, with a 9-1 win against Northern Ireland. Both England and Norway had to start the match with the same players who finished Saturday's match and both teams had completed what should have been the final round of Group 4 matches just hours earlier on Thursday. Marley's side defeated Switzerland 3-1 as Jenna Dear scored twice at the Seaview Stadium either side of another Williamson spot-kick as she scored past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot from 12-yards. The controversial decision further complicated the already complex qualification process for July's finals after UEFA had announced that Norway had sealed their place regardless of the result in Belfast. After an initial qualifying round last year, the Elite Round is comprised of six groups of four teams playing at locations across Europe. The six group winners and best-placed runner-up (Norway) - decided by the best record against the first and third-placed teams in the groups - went through to join hosts Israel at the showpiece event in July. England women's senior head coach Mark Sampson tweeted: 'Difficult circumstances for our @england U19. I have been proud that in challenging circumstances you have conducted yourselves superbly & represented your country with great pride. 'Regardless of final outcome you should be very proud. We are very proud of you.' September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain . Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off.

A household name the world over, Bundchen rivals soccer legend Pele for the status of Brazil's most internationally famous citizen, and her meteoric rise from a middle-class family in a small, rural town to superstar is the stuff of modeling legend. When the iconic model announced at the weekend that she would walk her final catwalk on this week in Brazil, it marked the end of an era on the catwalk. On Wednesday she told her followers: 'Today after 20 years in the industry it is a privilege to be doing my last fashion show by choice and yet still be working in other facets of the business. #firstrunway #14yearsold.'

The 5ft 11in Amazon told a Brazilian newspaper: 'Automatically my body tells me if what I do is worth it, and it asked to stop.' She told the Folha de São Paulo newspaper: 'I respect my body, it's a privilege to be able to stop.' Bündchen continued: 'I don't see how to continue [modeling on the catwalk]... and stopping will leave room for other projects I have for myself.' She was born and raised along with five sisters, including a fraternal twin, in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, a center of German immigration to Brazil. Bundchen was discovered by a modeling agency at age 14 and she came in second place in a nationwide modeling contest, before moving to New York to work the fashion runways there. By age 20, she'd become a fashion sensation, her freckled face and flowing dirty blond locks gracing the cover of top fashion magazines worldwide and her unique combination of legginess and curves causing a sensation during her runway appearances. Bundchen's success with her healthy good looks was heralded as marking the end of the sickly skinny and bedraggled ""heroin chic"" look that had dominated runways for years. The Brazilian beauty was one of the Victoria's Secret Angels from 2000 until mid-2007. On the catwalk, the leggy supermodel pioneered the 'horse walk', a stomping movement created when a model picks her knees up high and kicks her feet out in front.

She ventured into acting and appeared in fashion flick The Devil Wears Prada in 2006. From 2000 to 2005, Gisele was in a relationship with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. She married NFL star Brady in 2009. The New England Patriots quarterback says he has no plans of his own to retire. The 6ft4in athlete told the Salesforce World Tour - according to the Boston Herald: '[Boston] is where my kids were born, where they'll be raised. I'll be a lifer here.'

"Alan Greaves, pictured, claimed 'the Illuminati framed him by downloading child abuse images on his computer . A father-of-eight caught with almost 20,000 images of child abuse on his computer and mobile claimed he was framed by the Illuminati. Police raided Alan Greaves's home in Colne, Lancashire in September 2013 where they found the disturbing images on a digital storage device. Forensic examination of the abuse images found almost 700 were of the most serious category, with a further 872 at the next level. Burnley Crown Court heard there were also 17,821 other indecent images with 106 movies. Laura Barbour, defending, said she had been instructed the reason Greaves had the images on his computer was because he was conducting an investigation on the 'Illuminati'. He believed the group 'disseminates' such material and that is how images ended up on his computer, the court heard. She added: 'He told police he has no interest in children sexually in any way.' The court was told the defendant, who has children aged around 30 to two-years-old, was also a full-time carer for his disabled sister. Jailing him for 21 months, Judge Simon Newell said there appeared to be sexually-explicit images of females aged just 10, or younger, which had assembled over a three-year period. 'If it was not for people viewing these images, there would be a chance these children would not be harmed,' he said. Greaves, who pleaded guilty to two offences of making indecent images, was also given a sexual harm prevention order and told to sign the sex offenders' register for the next 10 years. He is also barred from working with children. Burnley Crown Court, pictured, heard that almost 700 of the images were in the most serious category . The Illuminati featured in the movie Angels & Demons based on the best-selling novel by Dan Brown . Some conspiracy theorists claim the pyramid and eye on a US $1 note is evidence of the Illuminati . The Illuminati are a secret society who was founded in the late 1700s in Munich, Bavaria, named after the Latin word for 'Enlightenment'. The secret society has been blamed for a range of events by crazed conspiracy theorists. Some theorists have linked the organisation with the Battle of Waterloo; the French Revolution; the assassination of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. Others believe that the Illuminati control Hollywood and have a membership which includes senior political leaders. According to one conspiracy theory site, there are only 6,000 members worldwide with a ruling council consisting of five Americans, five western Europeans, one Russian and one Indian. The Illuminati claim they want to overthrow current governments and introduce their own New World Order. The organisation have been accused of being devil worshipers and conspiracy theorists claim that the Illuminati manifest their power by showing their symbols such as triangles, pyramids and the number 666. Conspiracy theorists believe the Illuminati want to rule the world with a single government which they control and introduce a single currency. The more far-fetched theorists claim the Illuminati control groups such as the Bildeberg group as well as the United Nations. They are also accused of having control of the Free Masons and other secret organisations.","Alan Greaves owned almost 700 of the worst type of child abuse images .

"A lottery winner who thought her husband was playing an April Fools' Day prank when he told her they had scooped £53million has returned to making lunches for pensioners a week after their big win. Angela Maxwell said she would not give up her five-hour shift preparing meals at the lunch club at Coningsby Community Hall in Lincolnshire despite winning millions of pounds. The 67-year-old was seen arriving there yesterday morning, just days after her husband Richard stunned her with the news they had won £53million. Scroll down for video . Angela Maxwell has returned to her shift at a local lunch club for pensioners a week after scooping £53million with her husband Richard . Asked what they planned to do with the money last week the couple, who have two adult children, said they would buy a new minibus for pensioners in the community. Otherwise they intended to carry on as normal, they said, with the occasional splurge on holidays and designer clothes. Mrs Maxwell had just returned from her shift at the community hall with a stack of dirty tea towels for washing last Thursday when she learned of the win. At first she said she thought her husband was playing an April Fools' Day prank, she said at the time. 'I just didn't believe it, then he showed me the numbers on the website and I dropped the basket of tea towels on the floor,' she said. 'I then just sat down in the chair for about half-an-hour stunned.' Despite becoming an overnight multimillionaire, Mrs Maxwell said she would not stop working at the lunch club where pensioners are served a two course meal for £3. She spent more than four hours at the club yesterday, the Mirror reports, leaving shortly before 3pm after the sitting. Mrs Maxwell said she would not give up her role at Coningsby Community Hall (pictured) where she prepares meals for pensioners . The couple said they would not change their lives too drastically despite the windfall, describing themselves as 'simple people'. 'Winning this amount of money would change anyone but we are going to try and stay grounded and live the way we've always done,' Mr Maxwell, a cancer survivor, said last week. As well as a new minibus for local pensioners, the Maxwells said they would spend their money on upgrading the family to First Class on a forthcoming holiday to New Zealand. Mr Maxwell, an avid golf fan, said he would also like to tour the world to attend tournaments and competitions. 'Richard says he wants to travel round the world watching sport. I can go with him but I don't think I'll be watching any sport. 'It'll be retail therapy for me,' added Mrs Maxwell. The couple said they planned to use the money on buying a new minibus for local pensioners and upgrading their family to First Class on an already planned holiday to New Zealand .","Angela Maxwell returned to Coningsby Community Hall yesterday morning .

"A Wall Street banker raped an Irish student in a 'disgusting, violent attack' because he was determined to have sex on his birthday, a court heard on Wednesday. Jason Lee forced himself on the 20-year-old in a bathroom and told her to 'shut the f*** up' so her friends in the next room would not hear. The assault ended when the girl kneed him in the groin and staggered out in such a ‘hysterical’ state she was unable to talk. Lee tried to downplay the incident and said it was 'no big deal' and dismissively told the first police officer on the scene: 'We're good, you can go', the court heard. Lee walked hand in hand with his wife Alicia into New York Suffolk County Court on Wednesday . Former Goldman Sachs managing director Jason Lee, 38, faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old Irish woman in the Hamptons in August 2013 . The rape allegedly happened when Lee, 38, invited the victim and her friends to party at his rented $33,000-a-month mansion in the Hamptons on Long Island, New York during the summer of 2013. On the first day of the trial, Kerriann Kelly, the Chief of the Major Crime Bureau at Suffolk District Attorney's office, said that Lee and his victim were 'from such different worlds that they might have been from different planets'. She had spent the summer in New York on a J-1 student work visa and was staying with her brother for a night out before flying home to Ireland. Lee was a high flying executive at Goldman Sachs who lives in Manhattan, but Miss Kelly said: 'What you see is not always what you get'. She told the court: 'What you see in the court room this morning is a defendant dressed in a very professional suit, his hair is nicely combed. he is copiously taking notes as I speak. 'That's not the same individual the victim encountered in the early morning of August 20 2013. Not even close. 'What she encountered was a man who wanted one thing and one thing only, and that thing was sex. He used her to get it.' Lee has pleaded not guilty to first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault charges. He could face 25 years in jail if convicted. On Wednesday he walked into Suffolk District Court wearing a dark suit hand in hand with his wife Alicia, who sat in the public gallery. The court was told that Lee and his friend Rene Duncan met the victim and her friends at the trendy Georgica restaurant and lounge in Wainscott on August, 19 2013. The two men were there celebrating Lee's 37th birthday and they invited the Irish group back to his mansion a short distance away. Miss Kelly said that they were having a good time partying the night away, drinking wine and eating pizza they found in the freezer. The victim and her female friend stripped down to their underwear and got in the pool but Lee got completely naked and jumped in after them. Afterwards, around 6am, the victim went into a downstairs bathroom to change, and she 'became aware that Jason Lee was trying to force his way into the bathroom by pushing open the bathroom door,' Miss Kelly said. 'The victim saw him, he was naked, and she thought: ""Is this a joke?"" She pushed back and said: ""What do you think you're doing?""' Miss Kelly said that the victim pushed so hard she left her fingerprints on the door, but Lee was too strong and forced the door open. As he did so she went flying onto her back, hurting her hip and scratching her leg. Miss Kelly said: 'Now he had her exactly where he wanted her, on the floor, on her back and he climbed on top of her and he held her down.' The victim tried to shove him off but she was unable to. Miss Kelly said: 'She asked him to get off her. She told him: ""No""'. Lee has denied first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault and could face 25 years in jail if convicted . 'The defendant put his hand over her mouth and held his hand down so hard that the victim tried to bite him but was unable to. 'Then he told her to shut the f*** up, shut the f*** up. 'He didn't want anyone to interrupt what he wanted to do at that time and in that place - on his birthday'. Miss Kelly described how Lee pulled up her dress, pulled down her underwear and raped her. She said: 'He had no regard for her. 'He had no condom and the 37-year-old Jason Lee you see before you here had no regard for the 20-year-old Irish girl who was just visiting (her brother). 'He took advantage of her because he wanted to have sex and because he was going to do whatever he had to do to get it'. Miss Kelly said that the attack only stopped when the victim managed to knee him in the genitals, making him 'back off in pain'. As she waked out of the bathroom the victim was 'hysterical and crying', Miss Kelly said. Miss Kelly said: 'She couldn't say what was wrong to her. Lee was a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. A representative from the company said he left the firm last year . 'Her brother was upset and said: ""What's happened to my sister? What went on in that room?""' 'The victim couldn't speak she was so hysterical.' The police were called by Mr Duncan because he thought that his car had been stolen, though the court was told that he had actually loaned it to some of the victim's friends who had left earlier. During the call to the 911 dispatcher Lee allegedly said: 'It's not big deal, there is no problem here, we don't need you to come to this house'. The victim's brother however insisted they come and said: 'There's something wrong with my sister'. Lee was the the first to approach East Hampton police officer Sarah Mortensen when she arrived at the mansion and told her: 'We're good, you can go. We don't need you. We have got this under control'. However the victim's brother also approached her and said that Lee had 'done something to my sister'. The victim then got into the officer's car and recounted her ordeal, at which point she called for backup. During this time Lee disappeared and would not be found for two hours, the court was told. Whilst in hiding he called Mr Duncan numerous times, called two taxis - one of which was turned away by officer Mortensen - and tried to hail an Uber taxi multiple times. He was eventually found in a Range Rover parked in the driveway which had tinted windows 'curled up in the fetal position', Miss Kelly said. When asked by a police officer what he was doing, he said he was 'embarrassed' and 'fell asleep' That night the victim was taken to be examined by a sexual assault nurse who found she had injuries to her vagina. She also had a scratch almost the entire length of her leg, an injury that was consistent with her account of the incident. The house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred . At that point the victim realised that she did not have her dress and could not find it. Search warrants were executed on Lee's rental home but it was nowhere to be found. The court was told that seven months later a private investigator working for Lee delivered it to prosecutors in a box - there was no explanation why or how. In his defence Lee has hired Andrew Lankler, one of the top white collar criminal defense attorneys in New York. In his opening statement Mr Lankler said that the prosecution had been 'rushed' and that there were 'critical inconsistencies in the stories provided by the victim and the witnesses'. He said that the bathroom where the alleged rape happened was 12 feet from where the victim's brother and her friend were but that they did not hear a noise. He said that the facts were 'entirely consistent with the circumstances under which consensual sex occurs' but that it could have been 'perhaps regrettable consensual sex'. Before the allegation of rape the evening had been fun for all concerned and everyone had been taking pictures together, he said. Mr Lankler said: 'This is not a case that involves an allegation of rape in some back alley between people who are completely unknown to each other'. The trial continues.","Jason Lee, 38, was arrested in August 2013 after a woman accused him of attacking her at the home he and his wife rented in East Hampton .

"University students who smoke cannabis can expect to get lower grades across the board but especially if they are studying maths, a new study has revealed. Statistics collected at Maastricht University in Holland, where cannabis is decriminalised, have shown that students who were able to buy the drug from coffee shops were five percent less likely to pass their courses. At the same time, foreign students who did not have ready access to the mind bending drug did better on average, the Observer reported. The study will rankle with the increasing number calling for the legislation of cannabis around the world . Economists Olivier Marie from the Dutch University and Ulf Zölitz of IZA made their findings based on what happened in Maastricht in 2011 when the city let only German, Dutch and Belgian nationals have access to its 13 coffee shops, where cannabis was sold. The restriction was put in place to combat drug tourism which was thought to be tarnishing the city’s image. Tourists particularly from France and Luxembourg were visiting Masstricht solely to smoke cannabis. Marie and Zölitz studied the 54,000 sets of grades from students all around the world and came to a stark conclusion. In a paper recently unveiled at the Royal Economic Society conference in Manchester the economists showed plainly that those without easy access to the drug did better in their studies on average. The temporary prohibition constrained consumption amongst the non-German, Dutch and Belgian nationals and their brain function improved. Students who were able to buy the drug from coffee shops were five percent less likely to pass their courses . Marie was quoted as saying the difference was found to be similar to those observed in the US when students reach legal drinking age. The change before and after restriction was seen to be even more pronounced amongst ‘low achievers’. Without access to cannabis they had a 7.6 percent chance of passing the courses. The pair also came to stark conclusions when looking at stats for maths students. For those courses numerical skills the policy effect was ‘five times larger’. For those stuying courses with numerical skills the policy effect was ‘five times larger’, the Maastricht University (pictured) study stark concluded . While there is increasing clamour for the legalisation of cannabis across the world, the economists say there is very little evidence of how the drug – which has been linked to psychosis – affects society. Coffee shops may start to spring up in Berlin with Uruguay planning to be the first country to fully legalise the drug. The drug study says: ‘If marijuana is legalised like it is in many states in the US, we should at least inform consumers about the negative consequences of their drug choices.’ Consuming THC – tetrahydrocannabinol – the active ingredient in Cannabis is much the same as drinking pure vodka it concludes. Marie, a father, said the study has informed how he advises his own 13-year-old son, about cannabis and he shares the findings as a precautionary measure. The economists say there is little evidence of how the drug, linked to psychosis, affects wider society .","Study at Maastricht University found access to drug lowered grade scores .
Those who could buy cannabis legally did 5% worse across all courses .
Statistics were worst for maths students or those developing number skills .
Economists say more to be done to investigate the drug's affect on society ."
"A hoard of silver coins worth £34million that was sunk by the Nazis on board a steamship has been salvaged by a British-led team at a record depth of 5,150m (17,000ft). The SS City of Cairo was travelling from Bombay to England in 1942 when it was torpedoed by a U-boat 480 miles south of St Helena, taking 100 tons of rupees with it to the bottom of the ocean. It was long assumed that the vessel's cargo, belonging to the UK Treasury, would be lost forever such was the complexity of the task facing salvage experts. Treasure trove: Some of the 100 tons of rupees found buried in the ocean floor at a record depth of 17,000ft after the cargo ship they were being transported on was sunk by a Nazi submarine during World War Two . Record find: Some coins are raised to the surface during a pioneering recovery project by a British-led team . Hidden: The City of Cairo was finally discovered (above) 'broken in two and buried deep in the seafloor silt' Underwater company Deep Ocean Search used powerful sonar to locate the vessel on the sea floor . That was until a team led by British expert John Kingsford used pioneering techniques to track down the ship with powerful sonar and robotics. Underwater company Deep Ocean Search (DOS), which included 20 French oceanographers, was then contracted by the UK Ministry of Transport to recover the coins from a record depth of 17,000ft - some 4,500ft deeper than the Titanic. A spokesman for DOS said: 'This was to be a difficult search as the water depth would exceed 5,000m, the weather, swell and currents were known to be challenging and the presumed site was some 1,000 miles from the nearest land in the foothills of the mid-Atlantic ridge.' When the ship was finally discovered,  it was 'broken in two and buried deep in the seafloor silt', adding that 'parts of the ship had metres of mud heaped upon it.' The SS City of Cairo was sunk en route from Bombay to India, via Cape Town and Recife in Brazil . The rupees, belonging to the UK Treasury, were being transported from India to England when the ship sunk . Underwater company Deep Ocean Search, which included 20 French oceanographers, was contracted by the UK Ministry of Transport to recover the coins from a record depth of 17,000ft - 4,500ft deeper than the Titanic . Keeping it under wraps: The recovery took place in 2013, but has only now been made public . The SS City of Cairo was travelling from Bombay to England, via Cape Town and Recife, Brazil, when it was attacked by a Nazi U-Boat on November 6, 1942. The U-68 hit the vessel with one torpedo, but waited a further 20 minutes before firing the second. That crucial delay gave 296 of the ship's 302 passengers and crew time to escape in lifeboats. Famously, the German captain, Karl-Friedrich Merten, approached the lifeboats and told the survivors: 'Goodnight, sorry for sinking you.' The victims were eventually rescued three weeks later, but 104 had died. Maeva Onda, one of the oceanographers on board the salvage ship, SV John Lethbridge, said the search submarine was successful on its first dive. 'After two hours of underwater descent, the robot transmitted the first images of the wreck. It was incredible,' she told Le Figaro, as cited by the Daily Telegraph. The find was confirmed when the robot brought up coins stamped with the Crown. But the team suffered 'serious' problems trying to recover the bulk of the hoard because of the depths involved. The spokesman for DOS said: 'The team quickly found that operating at this depth caused serious technical difficulties which were new to us and which had to be resolved, quickly. 'The combination of pressure, temperature, repeated dives at this depth and other issues resulted in multiple breakdowns of systems such as we had not experienced before when working in 3000m to 4000m depths.' The recovery took place in 2013, but has only now been made public. DOS has left a plaque commemorating their find on the sea bed. Maeva Onda, one of the oceanographers on board the salvage ship, SV John Lethbridge, said the search submarine was successful on its first dive, adding: 'It was incredible'","SS City of Cairo sunk by U-boat en route from Bombay to England in 1942 .

"The ultimate supercar sales pitch? Can I sell you a car for your wife as well as your girlfriend? It may sound more like the kind of line once uttered by used-car salesman Arthur Daley but such is the wealth of a new breed of rich who are buying up Ferraris, Lamborghinis  and Porsches, that it's not an unfeasible question. A new Channel 4 series shines a light on the UK's billion-pound supercar industry, where some of the best salespeople can turn over millions of pounds of profit every year. Scroll down for video . A woman in a man's world: Expert seller Saba Syed, pictured above with husband Sheikh Amari, sells luxury cars to the super rich. Saba says more and more women are coming into the showroom . Happy to break the mould: Saba doesn't flinch in the traditionally male-dominated world of motoring and says: 'Women have very good taste in cars.' While mere mortals might only dream of getting behind the wheel of some of these ultimate driving machines, a select portion of the world's population are trading them like toys. A standard supercar can cost around £250,000, with the exterior paint alone costing up to £10,000, while some of the industry's more sought-after vehicles can expect to sell for millions at London's prestigious car auctions. The supercar business is unashamedly male-dominated - these are the original boys toys, after all. Yet one woman is breaking the mould, with a little help from her car-loving husband. Preston-based Saba Syed and husband Sheikh Amari have been married for 12 years and run one of the country's leading supercar dealerships exporting dream cars across the globe. While Sheikh buys the cars, Saba does the selling and isn't afraid to be a woman in a man's world. In fact, she thinks her gender helps her sell more cars. Driving down a different path: Tom Hartley left school at 11 to focus on 'wheeling and dealing'...his son Carl has followed the same path, ditching education in favour of a role in his dad's business . In Supercars: The Million Pound Motors, airing tonight, she says: 'It just feels great to be that one person who's not the stereotype.' She insists her dealership goes the extra mile to ensure cars are extremely clean: 'Our prep is quite in-depth and we clean in places where most dealers wouldn't. That's a woman's touch.' Her husband admits he's addicted to cars: 'If you cut me open you've got super unleaded fuel coming out of me.' He describes the classic cars that he sells as 'works of art'. Saba says that she can tell straight away what a customer wants: 'My focus is on the lifestyle choice. I firmly believe that anyone who comes in knows whether they want to buy or not. 'You live once, you work hard. They're buying into a lifestyle of luxury.' Although the premium car market might traditionally be seen as something that men enjoy more, Saba says more and more women are coming into the showroom. 'Women have very good taste in cars. You don't honestly think we talk about cars do you [when selling]. We talk about shiny, red soles!' Another leading UK supercar salesman is self-made millionaire Tom Hartley, 53, who runs his motoring business with son Carl. Tom sells to everyone from actors to music industry stars and even has a helipad next to his showroom to ensure would-be buyers can zoom in and out from the skies if they need to . Hartley left school at 11 to concentrate on honing his wheeler-dealer skills and now turns over millions of pounds every year. His biggest sale to date is a car that fetched £40million. His son Carl followed an almost identical route, leaving education at 11 to join the established business. The pair, who live in seven-bedroom luxury mansions opposite each other in Derbyshire have their spectacular showroom inbetween their properties. The father-and-son duo sell to everyone from celebrities to footballers and music industry people to actors and shift around £4million worth of luxury cars every week. Carl says of his deal-maker Dad: 'He's my role model, everything I know, I know because I've learned from him.' Owner Tom has been warned to take a backseat in the business due to health problems caused by his full-on lifestyle, a task that he's not found easy: . 'Slow down? I don't think I will. I love challenges. I love adventure. I love gambling and I love taking a risk.' In matte black, please: The world's wealthy are lusting after the Lamborghini Aventador . Top speed: 217mph (350km/h) Acceleration: 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 2.9s . Fuel tank capacity: 90 litres (23.8 gal.) Engine oil capacity: 13 litres (3.4 gal.) Distribution: Only 200 units were made . If you have around £300,000 to spend on a flash car, then the Lamborghini Aventador is the car of the moment. Footballers love them as do the young, rich Arabs who flock to London during the summer months. UK supercar dealer Tom Hartley says the car is the 'leading in-demand, super-rich car to buy.' The Aventador retails at around £300,000 and boasts an incredible set of specs, managing 0-62mph in 2.9 seconds and reaching a top speed of 217mph. Earlier this year, boxer Amir Khan posted a shot on Instagram of his Aventador. Other celebrities who own one of the vehicles include the Kardashians and Justin Bieber. Last month, Premier League striker Steven Fletcher was widely ridiculed after he took delivery of the supercar, with fans quick to point out that his performance on the pitch didn't merit such extravagance. Dozens of fans shared a mock message on Twitter reading: ‘Steven Fletcher: two seasons, seven goals, one new Lamborghini Aventador.’","Saba and Sheikh Amari run luxury car dealership in Preston .

"An Australian teenager has joined the puffy pout craze by using a shot glass to pump up her lips to ridiculous proportions. Violeta Tupuola, who lives near Canberra and already has naturally beautiful voluptuous lips, has joined the #kyliejennerchallenge sweeping social media of placing the opening of any narrow vessel over their mouth and sucking in until the vacuum of air causes their lips to excessively swell. In an attempt to emulate Kylie Jenner's bee-stung pout, Violeta got the shock of her life when she removed the shot glass and suddenly had such protruding lips that social media users compared her to a duck. Scroll down for video . In an attempt to emulate Kylie Jenner's bee-stung pout, Violeta  had such protruding lips that social media users have compared her to a duck . The response from one socail media user when watching Violeta's video was to post a photo of her with a duck . Violeta has joined the #kyliejennerchallenge by placing a shot glass over her mouth so the vacuum of air causes the lips to swell . The new craze is popular among teens desperate to emulate Jenner's famous plump lips (pictured) The video starts off with Violeta putting lip gloss on her already luscious lips before she suctioning the shot glass over her mouth. When she first saw the bizarre result, which is reportedly painful with the effect lasting up to hours, she gasped and put her hand to her mouth in disbelief of the strange look and began giggling. Violeta then took her  her hand away and exclaimed 'Oh my god! I can't even close my mouth' and then puts her hand over her mouth again while still laughing. She freaked herself out even further when after applying bright red lipstick which created a clown effect. The teen then began to pout and then reacted in a repulsed fashion saying 'ewwwwww' while touching her massive lips. Despite being quite alarmed by what she had created, Violeta seems to be impressed at the same time - wondering whether she could get the same effect to plump up her butt. 'Look how big it is - maybe I could do this to my a***!' then screws up her face and exclaims 'ewwwwww' yet again. Violeta freaked herself out with the bizarre look that is said to be painful and last hours . Despite being quite alarmed, Violeta wonders whether she could get the same effect to plump up her butt . Violeta shows off her  already naturally beautiful voluptuous lips before pulling the crazy stunt . Countless teens, both boys and girls, have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on Twitter and Instagram, which in many cases has led to severe bruising around the mouth. Surprisingly, given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat, it appears the results are far from desirable. 'I screwed up,' wrote one teenage girl along with her #kyliejennerchallenge selfie, while another complained she looked 'gross'. A worrying new trend dubbed the '#kyliejennerchallenge' is sweeping social media, encouraging teens to blow their lips up to epic proportions using bottles or shot glasses (pictured) 'Made my chin look like a hickey a week ago and I'll say I've never felt so dumb,' one disgruntled teen admitted. 'I did the #kyliejennerchallenge and my lips turned purple,' claimed yet another. The method - one this journalist won't be road-testing - works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar, which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell. Problematically, the results are said to last for hours, even days, with several people complaining that they were stuck with the after-effects for a lot longer than expected. The reportedly painful method involves participants placing their mouth over the opening of a cup, jar or shot glass and sucking in until the air vacuum causes their lips to swell up .

"Allegations: Veteran peer Lord Janner (pictured in 2002) has repeatedly denied claims he abused young boys at care homes and is now not fit to stand trial despite 'credible evidence' His name and face may not be immediately familiar to everyone today but, in his pomp, Lord Janner was one of the most prominent Labour politicians and campaigners of his time. His entry in Who’s Who occupies nearly 50 lines: MP for Leicester West (1970-97)… distinguished barrister… author… broadcaster… former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. After training at the University of Cambridge and Harvard Law School, he qualified as a barrister in 1954 and was appointed a QC in 1971. He has fought tirelessly for the return of Jewish assets held in Swiss banks by the Nazis, and was made a life peer on his retirement from the Commons in recognition of his achievements in public life. Those are the bare facts of Greville Janner’s gilded career. For nearly 25 years, however, a shadow has hung over Lord Janner of Braunstone in the same way it did Cyril Smith and a string of other establishment figures. We now know, from victims who have come forward following his death – too many for the allegations not to be true – that late Rochdale MP Smith was a serial paedophile. But was Janner? Detectives have interviewed more than 20 men who claim they were abused by Janner in their youth. It is suspected he used his hobby as a magician – Janner is a member of the Magic Circle – to get close to them and gain their trust when he visited children’s homes in Leicestershire between 1969 and 1988. But the evidence will never be tested in court after Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, ruled that it was not in the public interest to put the Labour peer on trial because of his age and ill health. Janner, 86, is a father of three. His youngest daughter, Laura Janner-Klausner, 51, is an ordained rabbi and serves as senior rabbi at the Movement for Reform Judaism. His son Daniel Janner is a prominent QC. Janner’s wife Myra died in 1996 and he has not been seen outside his flat in Hampstead, north-west London, since police investigating the claims of historic sexual abuse raided it in 2013. Shortly afterwards, reports emerged that he was suffering from advanced dementia. In the month before the raid, Janner attended the Lords 15 times, claiming £2,100 in daily allowances, which has inevitably cast a critical spotlight on the decision to not prosecute him. Janner, it should be stressed, strongly denied the allegations against him – including claims of rape – when they surfaced nearly 25 years ago at the trial of Frank Beck, a care-home warden suspected of abusing scores of children in his care. Beck, a former Liberal councillor, was given five life sentences. Yet, the 1991 case made sensational headlines for very different reasons. One of those headlines can be found in a faded newspaper cutting. It reads: ‘My Commons date and night with MP Janner.’ The witness in question was Paul Winston, then aged 30, who lived at one of Beck’s care homes in Janner’s constituency. Mr Winston claimed under oath that Janner had abused him repeatedly between the ages of 13 and 15. Scroll down for video . Pointing: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, in what was is the most recent moving image of the Labour peer . Director of Public Prosecutions: Last year, Alison Saunders (pictured) said prosecutors will pursue justice for victims of child sex crimes whether their cases were '30 days or 30 years old' - but not in the Janner case . He said that he had sex with Janner in a Holiday Inn hotel, at the MP’s home when his wife and children were away, and visited him in the Commons. The jury were shown letters the MP is said to have sent to him on House of Commons notepaper. Some were reportedly signed ‘love Greville’. They are now in the hands of the police. One was alleged to have been penned by Janner after they had stayed together at his home. ‘It feels strange not to have you flipping around me like a friendly flea!,’ the letter said. ‘In fact – I miss you.’ Referring to an encounter in the swimming pool of the Holiday Inn, Mr Winston said: ‘I was fondled in my private area. It seemed at first like a bit of fun, being thrown around the water, but he would hold me close.’ Beck used the testimony as part of his defence: that he was being prosecuted to divert attention from Janner and other high-profile (unnamed) paedophiles and that he was trying to shield the boys under his charge from them. Paul Winston was not the only witness to implicate Janner. Two others were called for the prosecution, saying Beck had raped them, but in cross-examination, they appeared to confirm some details of Mr Winston’s story. Probes: Greville Janner, left in 1974, served as an MP for decades and was investigated in 1991, 2002 and 2007. Janner was mentioned during the trial of paediophile Frank Beck, right,  who died in jail . One, a woman, said she heard an argument between Beck and Mr Winston in which he [Beck] was shouting that he wasn’t [allowed] to see Greville Janner any more.’ The other, a man, said Mr Winston had boasted about ‘having friends in high places’. Were the allegations made simply to muddy the waters? The jury thought so, finding Beck, who died in prison in 1994, guilty of the majority of charges against him. Days later, Janner, then in his 60s, broke his silence on the affair by making a personal statement to Parliament. Under parliamentary rules, personal statements are not debatable, so there were no follow-up questions from MPs. Janner told them: ‘There was, of course, not a shred of truth in any of the allegations of criminal conduct against me during the trial. ‘Meanwhile, as my wife, my family and I have had a taste of the suffering which Beck can impose on innocent people, will you join me in sending the real sufferers, the individuals who endured his homes and whose lives have been wrecked at his hands, the profound sympathy of us all?’ His statement was greeted with cheers. Fellow Labour MP Keith Vaz described Janner as a ‘brave man’ and others passed on leader Neil Kinnock’s ‘tremendous support’. Police interviewed Janner and Mr Winston, but no charges were ever brought against the MP. One of the detectives who worked on the Frank Beck case was Mick Creedon, who is now Chief Constable of Derbyshire. Last year he made a sensational claim in The Times. He said there was ‘credible evidence’ against Janner and that he and his colleagues wanted to make an arrest but were prevented by ‘more senior people’ from doing so. To put it bluntly, the investigation was blocked. Influential: Lord Janner was chair of the Holocaust Educational Trust and vice-president of the World Jewish Congress . Mr Creedon said: ‘The decision was a clear one: he [Janner] will be interviewed by appointment and there won’t be a search of his home address or his constituency office, of his office in the House of Commons. It was a decision made by people more senior than me.’ The allegations against Janner remained buried in newspaper archives until the authorities began re-opening historic child abuse cases in the wake of the Jimmy Savile affair. Many revolve around the Elm Guest House, a gay sauna in Barnes, west London, where boys are believed to have been abused by a string of powerful men in the 1970s and 1980s, including Cyril Smith. One of the people who contacted the police was Paul Winston. At the same time, two booklets from the archives of former MP Andrew Faulds – who died in 2000 – emerged. One, a four-page leaflet entitled Janner Fails to Answer ‘Sex With Boy’ Evidence and published by a group calling itself Concerned Leicester Parents, landed on the prominent Labour backbencher’s desk in 1992. The second, a 24-page booklet entitled Is Grenville Janner QC, MP, Above the Law?, arrived in 1995. Both booklets appear to have been printed professionally and sent anonymously to Mr Faulds (and presumably to several other influential figures) by individuals anxious to ensure further attention was paid to the 1991 trial. While Janner’s health has made the prospect of prosecution impossible, the stench of an establishment cover-up will continue to surround this deeply troubling case . The 1995 booklet provides a detailed account of an alleged victim’s testimony. It tells how the boy spoke of meeting Janner in the Commons when he was 13. He said was invited to Janner’s home when his wife was away. ‘We ended up in his bed together and he cuddled me. We cuddled and fondled together. I didn’t like it and told him to stop.’ So began a two-year sexual relationship, the boy claimed. The booklet also says that the boy ‘had been able to provide the police with information about Janner’s home, hotel rooms, life, habits and person in... infinite and verifiable detail’. The 1992 leaflet also refers to an alleged victim’s ‘detailed’ evidence: ‘Such evidence, submitted under oath... requires a specific and detailed refutation.’ Crown prosecution lawyers have spent nine months studying volumes of evidence gathered by Leicestershire police against Janner. This week officers visited Mr Winston, now in his mid-50s and living on the outskirts of Leicester, and other alleged victims in person to inform them of the decision not to proceed with the case. It has raised further questions about the CPS in the face of growing criticism of the conduct of Operation Elveden against tabloid journalists. This is the fourth time that Janner has escaped prosecution. He was interviewed by police after the Beck trial, and was the subject of further allegations of abuse in 2002, but these were not referred to the CPS. A third investigation was launched in 2006 after police received a complaint from yet another alleged victim. A dossier was passed to the CPS which decided there was ‘insufficient evidence’ to bring charges. Inevitably, while Janner’s health has made the prospect of prosecution impossible, the stench of an establishment cover-up will continue to surround this deeply troubling case.","Lord Janner will not face prosecution despite facing credible evidence .

"The stylist behind singer Rita Ora's unique, over-the-top hairstyles has revealed how much work the chart-topper has to put into ensuring her blonde locks remain totally healthy. Chris Appleton, who has been working with natural brunette Rita, 24, for the past two years, confessed to Daily Mail Online that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and 'maintenance'. 'We have to color the hair every three weeks,' he explained. 'We've managed to get the timing perfect so that she's not coloring it all the time. If you keep bleaching it, you push it too far and it can look awful, which has been done in the past by other celebrities! Scroll down for video . Style icon: Chris Appleton (R) has been working as singer Rita Ora's hairstylist for two years . Haircare regimen: According to Chris, Rita's blonde locks need to be colored every three weeks, a process which can dry out the hair if done too frequently . 'I also make my own hair masks, which I make her sleep in, to ensure that her hair stays in the best condition possible. 'I'm so strict with Rita, I want to make sure that her hair always looks great, and that means a lot of work. When she has any spare time, I make her condition.' But despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep Rita's barnet looking its best, Chris insists that the singer isn't planning to follow in Kim Kardashian's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon. 'Blonde is such a statement, despite the fact that it's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes,' he said. 'We've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that I'm eager to keep the color consistent.' The singer did have a chance to experiment with a darker hairstyle when she appeared in the recently-released Fifty Shades of Grey movie however; Rita's role as Mia, the younger sister of charismatic businessman Christian Grey, saw her don an extremely short, dark wig, which Chris believes helped Rita to separate herself from the character. Innovation: Every hairstyle that Rita models has something unique and different about it. 'I always want to do something to make her hair look special,' Chris explains . The girl with the pearl... hair: This embellished hairstyle is one of Chris' favorites . 'It worked for the film, because she wasn't Rita, she was Mia Grey, and I think that was a good thing,' Chris said. 'But I don't know if it's a style we will be trying out on Rita in real life!' While Rita might not be planning to replicate Mia's severe hairstyle any time soon however, Chris says that she is certainly not averse to experimenting with a variety of different looks - be they temporary, or permanent. Indeed, the decision to cut Rita's hair into a much shorter style just a few months ago was actually made on a whim, during a late-night styling session. 'I was talking to Rita about chopping her hair for a year, but it was about finding the right time,' he explained. 'Then at two in the morning, I was working on her hair, and we'd been doing it for hours, and she just said: ""I think it's time."" 'She called me the next day and was so happy with it, which was great. And it looks amazing, it was just a bit weird that we decided to do it then and there so late at night, or early in the morning I guess.' CopyKaty: According to Chris, singer Katy Perry recreated two of Rita's hairstyles for her This is How We Do video . Something different: For her role as Mia Grey in the recently-released movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Rita had the chance to experiment with darker locks . And beyond the length and color of Rita's hair, Chris is determined to ensure that her style is always fresh, unique and interesting, and is often experimenting with different textures, embellishments and colorful accessories. 'Sometimes I get a lot of time to work on a look - I'll know what outfit she's planning to wear for a red carpet, or an appearance, and I can plan accordingly,' he explained. 'Other times, I don't really get any time at all and I just have to pull it out of the bag! 'But I always want to do something to make her hair look special; if she's wearing a really detailed dress and we want the hair to be more simple, I'll do something really subtle - like the gold leaf that we used in her parting at the 2014 Met Gala. 'But if we want to go all out, then we'll work with loads of different accessories, or colors. I loved when we sewed loads of pearls into her hair, I thought that looked amazing. And it was so different and unique.' 'It's all about the details - I’m all about adding details to the hair. People will watch, [so] make it worthwhile.' Put a ring on it: Chris and Rita will often work together in order to come up with a new and unique way of accessorizing her hairstyle . Twisted: Rita often showcases Chris' work on her Instagram account . While Chris admits that he and Rita don't always see eye-to-eye about what hairstyle they should go for, he adds that she is always willing to go the extra mile in order to create something that is totally unique. And it seems that the seemingly endless hours Rita and Chris have spent working on maintaining and perfecting her varied hairstyles have more than paid off, with many of the more elaborate styles inspiring numerous other celebrities and style icons to create similar looks. 'The people behind the new Star Wars movie loved the hair we created for the UK version of The Voice [on which Rita is a judge] so much that they are going to use it in their next film,' Chris revealed. 'Katy Perry also did a similar style to the gelled baby hair that Rita had at Coachella for her This is How We Do video. 'The same look was also used at a number of fashion shows including DKNY and Givenchy.' 'Chris is incredibly talented,' Rita says of her ongoing relationship with the hairstylist. 'We work so well together drawing inspiration from any number of things - from Marilyn Monroe to London street fashion. Chris is always up for creating real moments, trying something different while keeping me smiling the whole way.'","Hairstylist Chris Appleton explained the inspiration for 24-year-old Rita's unique and over-the-top hairstyles .

"This is the first photograph revealing the face of murder-accused U.S. teenager Heather Mack's baby. Little Stella Schaefer is being cared for in prison by Mack, 19, who allegedly murdered her socialite mother Sheila Von Wiese-Mack in a plush Bali hotel last August before stuffing her body in a suitcase, together with her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21. While Stella was being looked after by a friend outside the court today, a blanket fell away, revealing the child's face to the world for the first time. Scroll down for video . Exclusive: This is the first photograph revealing the face of murder-accused teenager Heather Mack's baby . Motherhood: Little Stella Schaefer is being cared for in prison by Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murder . U.S. teenager Heather Mack allegedly murdered her socialite mother Sheila Von Wiese-Mack in a plush Bali hotel last August before stuffing her body in a suitcase, together with her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21 . The little girl was kept outside Denpasar District Court while her parents appeared briefly, but separately, before a panel of three judges. Lawyers for both Americans said they rejected the premeditated charges that had been laid upon them. Last month a prosecutor demanded Mack, from Chicago, spend 15 years in a Bali prison, Indonesia, sparing her the death penalty, and Schaefer 18 years. As she waited in a holding cell to go into the court today, Mack sat on a bench with her baby in a carry cot - donated by a friend - beside her. 'Tomorrow, I'm having my stitches out,' she revealed in a reference to the birth of the baby by caesarian last month. 'It will also be time for Stella to have her injections - all the health injections that young babies have to have.' The battered body of Mack's 62-year-old mother was found 'folded up' in a suitcase that had been loaded into the boot of a waiting taxi at  St Regis Hotel in Bali's seaside Nusa Dua district last August. Schaefer has admitted hitting the victim with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defence while Mack has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the boot of a taxi they had ordered. Father: Tommy Schaefer has admitted hitting Sheila Von Wiese-Mack with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defence . Denied: Lawyers for both Mack (right) and Tommy said they rejected the premeditated charges that had been laid upon them . Tommy Schaefer's defence team, appearing at a separate hearing, rejected claims of premeditated murder . The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali via the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel. Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel. Mack said during an earlier court hearing that  they panicked after Schaefer’s attack with the metal bowl. She said they thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the U.S. Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. In court today, Mack's lawyer, Ary Soendardi, said that all the prosecution claims were rejected by the defence team. He said at the time of Mrs Mack's death, her daughter was 'just pregnant' and for several reasons this had to be taken into consideration. Heather Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell  until the child is two years old. She said she plans to continue breast feeding during this time . Birth: The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice . Since being held in jail, Mack has been keeping her baby with her in a crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison . Tommy Schaefer pictured here in prison with baby Stella, who was born by caesarian on March 17 this year . He also asked the court to note that her pregnancy had continued throughout the charging process and she was now a young mother with a tiny baby. Schaefer's defence team, appearing at a separate hearing, also rejected claims of premeditated murder, referring to earlier statements that the 21-year-old had struck out against Mrs Mack in self-defence because she had gripped him by the throat. The pair - and possibly the baby - will be back at the court again on Thursday next week when the defence teams are expected to present evidence supporting the couple's claim of innocence. Mack was previously told by the chief prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya she had 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother', but was spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby'. Tommy Schaefer, 21, pictured in court today, is accused of murdering his girlfriend's socialite mother Sheila . Mack, pictured in court today, is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women . Murder-accused Heather Mack, 19, from Chicago, listens to her interpreter at Denpasar District Court in Bali . Since being held in jail, she has been keeping her  baby, who has six fingers on one hand, with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice. The child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother. Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old. Mack says she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years. She revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell. Jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime.

"Researchers plan to drill 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) below the surface of the Chicxulub crater in Mexico to try and answer the question of how the dinosaurs died out. The core they hope to retrieve will allow them to look back in time 10 million to 15 million years into the past. It could help uncover exactly what happened to create the crater - and if it killed off the dinosaurs. UK researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago (illustration shown). They found the heat near the impact site in Mexico was not intense enough to ignite plant material. A heat pulse lasted less than a minute, too short to set plants alight . The impact site is believed to be the 125 mile (200km) wide Chicxulub crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. When the six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid hit what is now Mexico approximately 66 million years ago, dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval, which left them vulnerable. Previous researcher has questioned the theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs. A team of researchers has found that heat near the impact site would not have been sufficient to ignite plants. It suggests our understanding of the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs may not be as complete as thought. 'The Chicxulub impact crater has been a remarkable scientific opportunity for the 20 years since it's been discovered,' Sean Gulick, of The University of Texas at Austin Institute for Geophysics, told Livescience. An international team of scientists met last week in Mérida, Mexico, located within the 125-mile-wide (200 kilometers) Chicxulub crater, to discuss their plans for the drilling project, slated to start in spring 2016. They believe that when a big rock smashes into Earth at high enough velocities, the collision causes the crust temporarily to act like a liquid, first forming a so-called transient crater (like the indentation that forms on a lake surface after a rock is thrown in), and the center rebounds, or splashes, upward and then outward. 'We think the peak ring is the record of the material that rebounded and splashed outward,' Gulick told Live Science. All of these ideas are based on models and aren't necessarily what happened. 'We've never gotten a rock back from a peak ring to know if that's correct,' Gulick said. Previous researcher has questioned the theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs. A team of researchers has found that heat near the impact site would not have been sufficient to ignite plants. It suggests our understanding of the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs may not be as complete as thought. The team of researchers from the University of Exeter, University of Edinburgh and Imperial College London recreated the immense energy that would have been released from the asteroid impact 66 million years ago. Further away from the impact site in Mexico (shown), in places like New Zealand, the heat could have lasted up to seven minutes and caused some localised fires. But the theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid impact is not correct, according to the scientists . They found that the intense but short-lived heat near the impact site could not have ignited live plants, challenging the idea that the impact led to global firestorms. These firestorms have previously been considered a major contender in the puzzle to find out what caused the mass extinction of life on Earth 66 million years ago. The impact site is believed to be the 125 mile (200km) wide Chicxulub crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Researchers believe that when a big rock smashes into Earth at high enough velocities, the collision causes the crust temporarily to act like a liquid, first forming a so-called transient crater (like the indentation that forms on a lake surface after a rock is thrown in), and the center rebounds, or splashes, upward and then outward. For years scientists have debated whether an asteroid, climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs. But last year, a study claimed that the majority of the prehistoric creatures were wiped out by a perfect storm of 'colossal bad luck'. Dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction if it had come slightly earlier or later in history, scientists said. But when the six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid hit what is now Mexico approximately 66 million years ago, dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval, which left them vulnerable. The study by an international team of palaeontologists led by the University of Edinburgh looked at an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils, mostly from North America. They found that widespread volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs' food chain when disaster struck. If the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier, when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust, they may have survived, according to the study. A heat pulse in the surrounding the area lasted for less than a minute followed the impact. While this was too short to ignite live plant material nearby, the effects of the impact further away could have been sufficient to set some material alight. The researchers said as far away as New Zealand, the heat would have been less intense but longer lasting, heating the ground for seven minutes - enough to ignite live plant matter. But nearer the site such a scenario was unlikely, pouring water on the global firestorm theory. The experiments carried out in the laboratory showed that dry plant matter could ignite, but live plants including green pine branches, typically do not. 'By combining computer simulations of the impact with methods from engineering we have been able to recreate the enormous heat of the impact in the laboratory,' said Dr Claire Belcher from the Earth System Science group in Geography at the University of Exeter. 'This has shown us that the heat was more likely to severely affect ecosystems a long distance away, such that forests in New Zealand would have had more chance of suffering major wildfires than forests in North America that were close to the impact. 'This flips our understanding of the effects of the impact on its head and means that paleontologists may need to look for new clues from fossils found a long way from the impact to better understand the mass extinction event.' The experiments carried out in the laboratory showed that dry plant matter could ignite, but live plants typically do not. Pictured is the fire propagation apparatus recreating the impact induced thermal pulse at the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) boundary. Halogen lamps are delivering the thermal radiation in the image . Plants and animals are generally resistant to localised fire events - animals can hide or hibernate and plants can re-colonise from other areas, implying that wildfires are unlikely to be directly capable of leading to the extinctions. If, however, some animal communities - particularly large animals - were unable to shelter from the heat, they may have suffered serious losses. It is unclear whether these would have been sufficient to lead to the extinction of species. 'This is a truly exciting piece of inter-disciplinary research,' said Dr Rory Hadden from the University of Edinburgh. 'By working together engineers and geoscientists have tackled a complex, long-standing problem in a novel way. 'This has allowed a step forward in the debate surrounding the end Cretaceous impact and will help Geoscientists interpret the fossil record and evaluate potential future impacts. 'In addition, the methods we developed in the laboratory for this research have driven new developments in our current understanding of how materials behave in fires particularly at the wildland-urban-interface, meaning that we have been able to answer questions relating to both ancient mass extinctions at the same time as developing understanding of the impact of wildfires in urban areas today.'","UK researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago .

"A woman from Nova Scotia who has a prosthetic leg may have started off on the wrong foot with someone who shares a parking lot with her. Despite receiving weekly angry notes on her windshield scolding her for parking in a handicap space, Natasha Hope-Simpson said she felt flattered that someone mistook her for someone who could walk normally. 'I have a video of you walking away from your car on numerous occasions, you are not HANDICAPPED! The next time you park here I will forward the Video's to police with your license plate number. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!!!!,' reads one of the fuming letters Hope-Simpson received. Scroll down for video .

Flattering note: Even though this letter left for Natasha Hope-Simpson on her windshield is filled with venom and anger, she viewed it as flattering because someone could not tell she was missing her leg . Hope-Simpson became disabled after her leg was crushed in a tragic hit-and-run accident in 2013 and she lost a part of her left leg below the knee. She has a handicap permit on her car but that was not enough to convince a furious onlooker that Hope-Simpson has a true handicap. 'I'm kind of flattered about that, because I've been working pretty hard on my walk to make it look natural,' she told CBC. AOL reports that Hope-Simpson is an artist and has accepted her loss by taking in an opportunity to create wearable art. With the help of  the founders of the Alleles Design Studio, McCauley Wanner, 27, and Ryan Palibroda, 32, Hope-Simpson gets to sport funky prosthetic creations below her left knee and even helps to design them. Wearable art: Natasha Hope-Simpson turned her handicap into an opportunity to create art and helped to create the design on her prosthetic leg . CBC spoke with Tova Sherman who serves as an advocate for people with disabilities and who was heartbroken when hearing about the angry note. According to Sherman, disabilities come in many forms and just because on the surface someone doesn't seem disabled, it doesn't mean that they aren't. 'It's really none of our business whether they run out of the car, or crawl out of the car. Great example is people who live with fibromyalgia — chronic pain — it is episodic, meaning it comes and it goes,' she says. She says even someone with a disability like fibromyalgia who looks normal may be fine one day and not be able to lift their arms the next.

"Scarface and Godfather actor Al Pacino is offering die-hard fans the chance to fly with him on a private jet – but it will set them back an eye-watering sum of £25,000 (or $41,500). The unusual meet and greet is part of a ticket package offered by a Cambridge-based tour operator ahead of Pacino’s three-city speaking tour in the UK and Ireland. But the 74-year-old actor, who has made millions over an illustrious career spanning six decades, is drawing criticism for the pricey promotion. Die-hard fans of actor Al Pacino can fly on a private jet with him from Glasgow to London for £25,000 . Event Travel, which is offering the five-figure ticket package, declined to say whether anyone has paid for a spot on the private jet, which will fly from Glasgow to London. Most commercial flights on the same route last roughly 80 minutes. According to an online itinerary, the package includes a commercial flight ticket from any UK airport to Glasgow, plus a ticket to Pacino’s show in the Scottish city on May 19. The VIP package, priced from £25,000 or $41,555 per person, includes: . Up to two hardcore fans will then fly from Glasgow to London with Pacino on his entourage after the show, giving them the perfect opportunity to corner the actor and question about his roles as Tony Montana in the cult film Scarface, Michael Corleone in The Godfather trilogy, or his Academy Award-winning performance in Scent of a Woman. Dubbed ‘The Amazing Experience’, it also includes three nights in a five-star hotel in London, transfers and a ticket to the actor’s May 22 show at the Hammersmith Apollo. Pacino fans who find the price too steep can opt for ‘The Unique Experience’, which allows them to eat lunch with the actor at his hotel before the London show, for £7,500 ($12,000). If that is too pricey, fans can buy a £2,500 ($4,150) ticket package that includes about 20 minutes of alone time with Pacino in his dressing room, or they can spend £650 ($1,080) for a group meet and greet. Actor Al Pacino arrives with Camila Sola (left) and Lucila Sola for a screening of the film Manglehorn in 2014 . The speaking series, ‘An Evening with Pacino’, is being marketed as ‘an exceptional opportunity to catch an icon in the flesh’. Organisers are promising never-before-heard stories and never-before-seen video clips, plus a chance to ask questions. It follows a sold-out event at the Palladium in 2013.","Promotion is part of Al Pacino's speaking tour in the UK and Ireland .

"A terminally-ill five-year-old has died just days after his devoted parents granted his final wish by getting married at his hospital bedside. Corey Edwards was born with a complex congenital heart defect and endured eight traumatic open heart surgeries in a bid to save his life. His greatest wish was for his parents Jemma, 21, and Craig, 28, to tie the knot, but despite getting engaged three years ago, his ill health put their plans on hold. Corey Edwards, five, has died five days after his final wish - to see his parents get married - was granted . Corey, who was born with a complex congenital heart defect, held the rings at the ceremony at his bedside in Bristol Children's Hospital . Corey's condition had gradually deteriorated since January, when he was admitted to hospital with a cold, and his parents were warned he had just days to live. To grant the little boy's final wish, staff at Bristol Children's Hospital pulled out all the stops to allow his parents to marry at his bedside, including getting the Archbishop of Canterbury's permission for the ceremony to be held on the paediatric ward. The five-year-old held the rings at the wedding on Saturday, with his mother saying Corey looked 'very handsome' in a suit. Sadly Corey died last night, five days after the ceremony. Speaking shortly after the wedding, father-of-three Mr Edwards, from Teignmouth, Devon, said: 'It may not have been the day we had initially planned in our heads but it didn't matter to us. 'To have our son there meant more than anything and it will be a day we will never forget. 'We can't thank the staff enough for what they have done for us and Corey and we would like them to know how much we appreciate their hard work and dedication.' The terminally ill boy's parents Craig and Jemma had been engaged for years but delayed tying the knot because of Corey's ill health . To grant the little boy's final wish, staff at Bristol Children's Hospital pulled out all the stops to allow his parents (pictured with sisters Isabelle and Caitlyn) to marry at his bedside . Mrs Edwards added: 'The most important thing for us was having our son Corey at our side, holding the rings and wearing his suit. 'We couldn't have been more proud of him. We were also incredibly lucky to have our daughters there and the support of so many.' After deciding to get married, the couple had barely 48 hours to organise the ceremony, which was complicated by requiring permission from the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby to go ahead. The newlyweds signed the wedding register at their son's hospital bedside . The law allows couples to marry in hospital if one of them is desperately ill and that did not apply in this case. But a law dating back to Henry VIII gives the Archbishop of Canterbury special dispensation to allow weddings in hospital for 'pastoral reasons'. 'When we knew Corey's wishes, everyone on PICU (Paediatric Intensive Care Unit) and Ward 32, including staff and friends, got together to help us,' Mr Edwards said. 'The Bishop of Bristol had to write to the Archbishop of Canterbury to get special permission for us to marry in the hospital and we are so grateful he agreed.' Corey was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart defect when he was seven months old and had eight open-heart surgeries as well as other treatments. Staff at Bristol Children's Hospital grew close to the family during numerous hospital stays., and rallied together to help with the wedding. Mr Edwards, a council road sweeper, said: 'When we got the go ahead, we only had a matter of days to plan. 'We rushed into town to buy a dress and suit and made do with our engagement rings as wedding rings. 'We couldn't believe the generosity of all those involved. One nurse helped to do Jemma's hair, whilst another two members of staff made the cake and iced it. 'Chairs were pulled together to form an aisle and decorations were put up to make it feel like a wedding venue. 'We were married by the hospital's chaplain, Rev Stephen Oram, who was very excited to be sharing this occasion with us.' Corey was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart defect when he was seven months old and had eight open-heart surgeries as well as other treatments . After deciding to get married, the couple had barely 48 hours to organise the ceremony, which was complicated by requiring permission from the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby to go ahead . Mr Edwards added: 'It turned into a really, really amazing day and Corey was so proud. He looked very handsome. I think he really enjoyed it, which was the main thing. 'Getting married is usually the bride and groom's special day, which it was, but it's more Corey's special day because he is such a special boy. 'It was nice to share our special day with the people who have helped us enjoy Corey's short life. It has got to the point where there isn't more they can do now, which is obviously very hard. 'Instead of being at his bedside crying the whole time at least on that one day we had a real special day. We know he was happy that day. 'When he's home and well you wouldn't know he is a cardiac patient. He's happy, running around and loves to play.' The newlyweds spent their wedding night at their son's bedside and later returned to the nearby Ronald McDonald House where they are staying whilst Corey is in hospital. Speaking before Corey passed away, William Booth, matron for PICU, said it was a privilege to share the special day with Corey's family. He added: 'The whole hospital was abuzz with excitement. 'One of the nurses made and iced a cake others brought in flowers and gifts for the newlyweds. 'Lots of the nursing and medical teams involved in Corey's care came in over the Easter break to share this special occasion with them all.'","Corey Edwards, five, was born with a complex congenital heart defect .

"A Russian submarine close to the coast of Britain may have dragged a trawler violently backwards after snagging in its nets, a fishermen's organisation has claimed. The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident 18 miles from Ardglass on the south-east shore of Northern Ireland and the vessel was badly damaged. Ardglass is one of Northern Ireland's main fishing ports and local trawlermen are usually more concerned about hitting their quotas than Cold War-style intrigue. Violently dragged: Captain Paul Murphy of the Karen, a fishing trawler, holds up a snapped steel cable aboard his boat. The damage is thought to have been caused by a Russian submarine . The incident happened off the coast of Northern Ireland and is the second time in two months that fishermen have reported being dragged by a suspected submarine (file picture) The 60-foot boat's captain Paul Murphy was pictured holding a snapped steel cable on board his boat following the alarming incident. Nato exercises were held this week in northern Scotland and Ardglass fishing representative Dick James said the alliance's drills may have attracted Russian interest. This week RAF Typhoons were launched to intercept two Russian aircraft near UK air space, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. Mr James said: 'Our defence forces are not up to much if a rogue submarine of unidentified nationality is tearing around the Irish Sea.' Last month a trawler captain claimed his boat was nearly dragged down by a Russian submarine while fishing off the Scottish coast. The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident 18 miles from Ardglass on the south-east shore of Northern Ireland . Alarming episode: The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident and was badly damaged . The trawler's captain Paul Murphy points to an on-board computerised tracking system that shows his boat's unusual movements during the incident . Angus Macleod, 46, was fishing for haddock and skate when he became convinced that a hostile vessel was caught up below his boat Aquarius. The submarine attempted to free itself, taking the 65ft vessel and his two-ton catch with it. Recently Russian warships reportedly used the English Channel en route to military exercises in the North Atlantic. The coastguard said the Karen reported a collision at a point known as the Calf of Man not far from the Isle of Man. The skipper said the boat had been snagged and dragged backwards at speed. Mr James added: 'You don't need to go long at that until you go under.' The four crew members scrambled to release wires connecting the net to the out-of-control trawler, which had been moving slowly forward but was suddenly sent careering backwards through the water. As the ship steadied the shaken seamen stopped to catch their breath but there was no sign of the cause. The vessel made its way back to Ardglass and part of the deck had to be lifted because it was so badly damaged, and another section was ripped off. Mr James added: 'It is a bl***y mess.' He said Royal Navy protocols mean an incident like this would not happen involving a British submarine. He said: 'It is possible that it was a Russian submarine. Another recent alert: This week RAF Typhoons were launched to intercept two Russian aircraft, believed to be 'Bear' bombers, (stock image) near UK air space . No explanation: Experts said Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression . 'You cannot always prevent it but if an incident like this did happen the (Royal Navy) protocols said that the submarine would immediately surface to check on the health and welfare of the people involved and this one did not. 'Paul Murphy, the skipper, said that he sat for five to 10 minutes catching his breath to see if the submarine would surface. 'It was a submarine, it had to be, it could not have been anything else.' The incident came as Britain hosted a Nato exercise in northern Scotland involving more than 50 warships. Separately, the MoD has said RAF Typhoons, from RAF Lossiemouth, were deployed 'after Russian aircraft were identified flying close to UK air space'. It said it could not comment on Royal Navy submarine movements or the fishing vessel incident. Tensions over the Ukraine conflict have soured relations between the West and Russia, which is suffering from US and EU sanctions imposed because the Kremlin is backing separatists in eastern Ukraine. A map showing how jets were launched from RAF Lossiemouth on Monday, shortly after HMS Argyll was deployed to monitor a Russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the English Channel . Mr James, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producers' Organisation, said: 'There has been Russian activity. There have been Allied exercises going on, the Russians have been taking an interest in it. 'The question mark now is what kind of a submarine was it? 'If it was Allied it should have been following an agreed protocol where this should not have happened.' Sinn Fein Northern Ireland Assembly member Chris Hazzard said the community was angry. He said: 'The fact that this submarine didn't even surface to make sure the fishermen were safe has caused considerable resentment in the area. It is totally unacceptable that a submarine would show such contempt for maritime workers. 'The skipper and his crew on the Karen, and indeed all of the local fleet, deserve to know the truth about what happened. 'Whether this is a British vessel attached to the hugely controversial Trident system or a Nato submarine in training, our local fishermen deserve justice.'","The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's alarming incident .

"Three people were arrested for being drunk and disorderly on a Ryanair plane that was about to leave Britain for the Algarve. Two 49-year-old women and a 23-year-old man  were removed from the plane just before it left Bristol for Faro around 7pm yesterday (Thursday). Chris Ware, head of security at Bristol Airport said: 'The Bristol Airport police team were requested by flight crew to attend a delayed departing flight to Faro. A Ryanair flight took off without three booked passengers bound for Faro yesterday after they were arrested for being drunk and disorderly . 'The airline requested the delayed passengers board the flight in anticipation of the air traffic slot time improving. 'Three passengers were removed from the aircraft and subsequently arrested. 'Abusive, aggressive or anti-social behaviour on board an aircraft or at the Airport will not be tolerated, the normal protocol of dealing with disruptive passengers was implemented. 'Unfortunately the actions of these individual passengers further delayed the aircraft's departure.' Airport Team Sergeant Mick Parminter added: 'We want everyone who travels through the airport to have a safe and enjoyable start to their trip. 'We would warn anyone travelling through the airport to know their limits. Passengers have a personal responsibility for their own behaviour. 'On average over half a million passengers travel through the airport every month without incident however we will not allow the behaviour of a few to spoil the enjoyment and travel plans for everyone else. 'Alcohol-related anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.' Bristol Airport confirmed that the drunk passengers' actions caused further delays to the Ryanair flight . A spokesperson for Ryanair told MailOnline Travel: 'The crew of this flight from Bristol to Faro requested police assistance prior to departure after three customers became disruptive. Police removed and detained these individuals before the aircraft departed to Faro. 'We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and we sincerely apologised to other customers for any inconvenience caused. 'The safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. This is now a matter for local police.' This latest incident comes only days after Ryanair took the unprecedented step of banning passengers from bringing their own booze on board flights between Glasgow and the party island of Ibiza out of concerns for safety and comfort. The Dublin-based airline informed passengers travelling on the notorious flight from Glasgow Prestwick Airport to the Spanish island that their alcohol purchases from duty free shops are no longer allowed in the cabin, and they risk being kicked off the flight if they don't comply. In a statement to MailOnline Travel, a Ryanair spokesman said the airline made the decision after consultations with customers and airport officials. The spokesman said: 'Those who have purchased duty free alcohol will be asked to either place their purchases in their cabin baggage and into the hold at the boarding gate, or leave their purchases behind. 'The comfort and safety of our customers and crew is our number one priority and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour at any time.' The spokesman declined to identify the incidents which sparked the ban or say what will happen to passengers caught trying to sneak alcohol on board.","Two women aged 49 and a 23-year-old man removed from plane .

"A masked burglar stole vintage watches worth more than £200,000 from an antiques shop in a Mission Impossible-style raid by crawling along the floor to avoid setting off the infrared beams. The thief scaled a two-storey antique market before breaking into a rooftop vent and squeezing down a narrow shaft to reach the store. He picked three sets of locks and crawled on the floor ‘like a snake’ to avoid triggering infrared security beams. 'Like a snake': This CCTV footage shows how a masked thief avoided infrared beams during a raid on a jewellers in Hampstead, north London, by crawling around the shop in a 'Mission Impossible'-style heist . Mission Impossible: The burglar, who crawled around the shop on his front, spent just eight minutes in the luxury shop before fleeing with more than £200,000 worth of stock . Wearing a dark hooded jacket, jeans and Nike trainers, the burglar stole 124 rare timepieces before climbing back up the shaft and escaping in a waiting 4x4. The eight-minute raid, which has been likened to a Mission Impossible film, took place at the Vintage Watch Store in Hampstead, North London, on Saturday at about 9pm. Although the thief was able to bypass alarms and evade several CCTV cameras, he was captured on a camera hidden in the ceiling overlooking display cabinets. Crawling: The man and an accomplice returned the following night to try a similar break-in but were disturbed and fled . The man and an accomplice returned the next evening, but fled empty-handed after neighbours heard them trying to smash through the reinforced vent and alerted police. They left behind ladders, a screwdriver and a balaclava, which are being analysed by police for DNA evidence. The daring raid happened a week after the Hatton Garden heist where gems worth up to £60million were stolen by a professional gang who climbed down a lift shaft to reach the vault. Antique: The thief stole 124 antique watches worth more than £200,000 in the heist on Sunday night . Gold: Among the watches taken a 18-carat gold 1910 Swedish Royal Presentation Wedding Pocket Watch worth more than £12,000 . Another 18-carat gold Fusee Verge, which has an estimated value of £9,000, was also taken in the raid . Simon Drachman, who owns the Hampstead jewellers, said the raid on his shop was also carried out by someone who knew what they were doing. The 53-year-old said: ‘It was very much a Mission Impossible thing. He was extremely fit and managed to squeeze through a vent that is two feet high and wide. He cleaned up the counters and made sure everything was clear.’ He added: ‘These are rare watches and unique. They are not easy to find and he knew exactly what he wanted.’ The crime took place at shortly before 11pm on Sunday, April 12 at the Vintage Watch Shop owned by Simon Drachman . The business is a two-storey antiques market on Heath Street, which the thief accessed via a rooftop vent . Among the haul was an 18 carat gold Goliath 8-Day Swedish royal presentation wedding pocket watch made in 1910 worth £12,500; an 18 carat gold Fusee Verge watch by Thomas Earnshaw of London worth £9,000; and a gold Fusee Liverpool Massey 4 pocket watch made in 1824, worth £8,000. But Mr Drachman added: ‘These watches cannot go on the market for quite some time because there are only four or five key dealers, who all know each other.’","Thief stole 124 watches from Vintage Watch Shop in Hampstead, London .

"It has been more than a month since much-loved teacher Sharon Edwards graced the halls of her school. While her students at Coutts Crossing Public School on the NSW north coast hold on to the hope the mother-of-three will turn up to school again one day, the police focus has shifted to treating the teacher's disappearance as a homicide. Ms Edwards was last seen on March 14, after she caught up with friends at the local Good Intent Hotel. Investigators, including forensic officers and the dog squad, returned to her home in Grafton on Monday with a crime scene warrant. Police also went back to the nearby suburb of Lawrence, where Ms Edwards and her husband, John, still own their family home on Neill St. Sharon Edwards, 55, was last seen between 10pm and 11pm on Saturday March 14 in Grafton, NSW . Pictured from left: Her son Zac, husband John, son Eli, Ms Edwards and her third son Josh . The family made an emotional appeal for information as police said it was a homicide investigation . Detectives say she was last seen alive at her Grafton home that night and have traced her last known whereabouts to the Lawrence area in the early hours of March 15. Son Eli Edwards said his father saw Ms Edwards early on Saturday night at their Grafton home. He then went back to Lawrence and said he didn't see Ms Edwards there, Eli said. When his father went to see her at the Grafton house on the Sunday morning, her car was left parked in her driveway and the clothes she had been wearing on March 14 were thrown in the washing basket in her bedroom. However her phone and bag were gone. There was no sign of forced entry at her Grafton home on the NSW north coast and it has left her family despairing and fixated on their many unanswered questions regarding her disappearance. Sharon Edwards, 54, posted a smiling image of herself in front of a sunrise on the morning she disappeared . It was first noticed Ms Edwards was missing when she failed to show up for a class she was due to teach . The unexplained disappearance has rocked the tight-knit family who have likened the situation to 'something out of a movie'. 'That is the worst part - we don't know. We have no answers,' Eli said. 'My old man's taking it pretty hard and I guess we are all just going through stages.' Eli last heard from his mother on March 14 when he sent her photographs of his baby daughter, who Ms Edwards adored. Mr Edwards appeared in Grafton Local Court on Monday on unrelated unregistered firearm possession charges. Ms Edwards had taken on a new literacy and numeracy job this year at Coutts Crossing Public School and was working on Pinocchio the musical, friend Tracy Hunt told AAP. 'She is just great with all the kids and all the different ages, she is one of those teachers that always have time for them,' Ms Hunt said. 'She was very well-loved ... she is very well-loved.' Ms Hunt said some students had been asking where Ms Edwards was. 'The worst part is there is nothing you can say, because no one knows anything,' she said. 'You just have to hope she is going to turn up safe and sound.' Police  forensically examined three properties - one in Grafton and two, including a vacant block, in nearby Lawrence . The 55-year-old was last seen between 10pm and 11pm on March 14, after spending the afternoon with close friends at the Good Intent Hotel in Grafton on the north coast .

'I always see these men drinking alcohol and smoking and sleeping on the park benches. It’s an infestation,' resident Erika Halcin, 36, told the New York Post on Thursday. 'I pray to God they close that shelter,' she said. 'They are so nasty and they scare all the children. I don’t want to think about what might happen to one of these kids,' she added. Three of the residents in the shelter are convicted rapists and four of them were pedophiles with male and female victims as young as six. Stover, who was arraigned on Thursday for rape, predatory sex assault and other charges for last Saturday's attack in the bathroom at the Turnmill Bar on East 27th Street, is a convicted sex offender. One block from a school: The men's shelter filled with convicted sex offenders is just one block from The Churchill School for special needs children . Shelter:: Bellevue Men's Shelter houses at least 14 convicted sex offenders and is one block from a school . Stover was arrested on rape charges in 1992 in Southampton for raping and sodomizing a 42-year-old stranger after overpowering and threatening her with a sharp object. He was released in July 2012 and then found himself in the shelter. The New York Post reports that the shelter houses more than double the amount of sex offenders at the Charles Gay Family Center on Wards Island, where just six registered sex offenders reside. Other residents of Bellevue said the shelter has lots of problems. 'This is a f–ked-up building,' one older resident told the New York Post. 'We got crackheads, killers and all kinds of convicts in here.' A maintenance worker said most of the men just know how to live in a prison. 'The guys who live in here come from hard times. They have had a hard life. A lot of what these guys know is just how to do time in a penitentiary.' 'I don’t make eye contact with these men,' he told the New York Post. 'He kept his head down and didn’t talk to nobody. It’s a shame that it takes a woman getting raped to get any acknowledgment of the shelter,' said a resident who recognized a photograph on Stover. 'He’s one of a thousand guys with problems at this shelter,' he said. Turnmill's bathroom is in the basement, which is distanced from the busy main floor of the Gramercy Park sports bar . A spokesperson at the Department of Homeless Services told the New York Post that she could not confirm the address for any of the 13 offenders and said that if any of them moved, the DHS would not tell the registry. 'By law it’s the individual who is supposed to alert the registry,' Parikh said. Sex Offender Stover was arrested on Wednesday after being recognized by a bartender as he walked by the establishment. Stover allegedly grabbed the victim, a Long Island student, by the throat, forced her into a stall and attacked her before fleeing the bar. When the 23-year-old victim had entered the Turnmill bar bathroom at about 7.50pm on Saturday, her attacker, thought to be Stover, was hiding in another stall. The ex-convict reportedly grabbed the woman by the neck and said, 'I'm going to rape you. Be quiet,' and groped and licked her body, sources said. He allegedly ripped off the woman's pants and began raping her, but fled after he realized he couldn't sustain an erection, sources said. The victim ran out of the bathroom and told her boyfriend what happened. He then reported the attack.","Rodney Stover, 48, a convicted sex offender lived in a shelter group of convicted pedophiles and rapists .

"An African American teenager who was shot by a police officer in the back because his friend was holding a toy gun is suing Los Angeles for $20 million. Jamar Nicholson, 15, and his friends were hanging out in an alleyway in South L.A. before school on February 10 when two police officers working for the LAPD's criminal gang-homicide unit approached the boys with their guns drawn. The LA Times reports that one of the teenagers was holding a toy gun that the officers thought was real and  it prompted the officers to fire. Suing LA for millions: Jamar Nicholson (left) and his friend Jason Huerta (right), who stand solemnly in the alleyway where Nicholson was shot, are suing the city of Los Angeles for $20 million . Nicholson was shot in the back by officer Miguel Gutierrez and is in pain but he says he and his friends feel lucky to be alive. Nicholson was standing next to the unidentified teenager who was holding the replica of the gun. 'Jamar is really lucky to be alive. With respect to the other kids, they are lucky as well that they weren’t hit. It doesn’t appear that the officer who shot used a lot of discrimination with where he aimed the pistol,' Jamar's attorney Herbert Hayden told Yahoo News. The gun that officers thought was real had an orange tip indicating that it was fake. Another attorney John W. Harris who is representing Nicholson and his friend 17-year-old Jason Huerta is arguing that Nicholson and his friend posed no threat to police officers or themselves. 'The LAPD shot first and then asked questions later,' Harris said. The LAPD says that at 7.45am on February 10, officers saw a teen holding what appeared to be a gun and they claim they told him to drop it. Real or fake?: One of the teens present at the shooting was holding this fake gun with an orange tip that LAPD say they thought was real . 'Officers ordered him to drop the weapon multiple times. The individual ignored the officer's commands,' a police news release reads. Attorney Hayden said that had a camera been rolling, the LAPD's story may have been expressed differently. 'The police department’s officers have each other’s backs. If there is no camera rolling, they are free to construe the facts how they see fit,' Hayden said. 'It’s so bizarre in this incident that testimony of the people we interviewed is so drastically different from the story the LAPD has been pumping out since this first started,' he added. Hayden said that the officer who shot Nicholson, Miguel Gutierrez, also shot and killed a dog in 2008 when responding to a traffic collision. Both Nicholson and Huerta said they feel traumatized by what happened to them. Seeking justice: Jamar Nicholson, second from left, listens to his attorney John Harris speak during a  press conference on Wednesday in South Los Angeles where he was shot on February 10 . Nicholson said he had to miss school as a result of the shooting and said that he felt tremendous pain from his injuries. 'I see a cop and I get nervous,' he said. 'I've never really looked at police in a certain way, until that day.' Nicholson and Huerta say they have never been in trouble with the law before. 'You can check our records,' Huerta insisted. 'That's a bad way to meet officers,' Nicholson said. His friend nodded. 'Got off on the wrong foot,' Huerta said. Officer Gutierrez has returned to full duty since the incident, though it remains under investigation.","Jamar Nicholson, 15, was shot in the back by officer Miguel Gutierrez on February 10 because his friend was holding a toy gun .

"A man caught on film by surveillance cameras allegedly hitting his three-year-old toddler in the face at a supermarket was arrested on Friday. KERO-TV reports 23-year-old Justin Whittington of Bakersfield, California was taken into custody on Thursday night on suspicion of child endangerment after the video of the alleged abuse surfaced online. The relationship between the toddler and Whittington has not yet been revealed by police but the owner of Vest Market Harry Dindral said the man was the boy's father and said that he's seen them in the store together before. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . The punch: Surveillance video shows a man chasing a toddler then hitting him in the face . The video posted to social media and shared thousands of times shows a boy running through Vest Market. The toddler is approached by a man believed to be his father who hits him in the face. The man then is then shown aggressively yanking up the toddler by his shirt. A pregnant woman, can be seen coming and taking the distraught boy away. The child appears to leave the store crying and covering his face. The police were notified of the video after it was leaked online. They asked the public for help identifying the man in the video who ruthlessly punched the small child. By midnight, the man who was caught on video punching the toddler, 23-year-old Justin Whittington, was in police custody. The Kern County Jail website showed Whittington remained behind bars on Friday with bail set at $1 million. 'That was horrible, man,' owner of Vest Market Harry Dindral told the Daily News. Horrifying: Video shows the injured boy crying on the floor, then the man who may his father, yanking him up off the ground by his shirt . 'The worst thing I've ever seen,' he said of the incident at his establishment. Dindral says he was in the back of the store when his employee ran to him and told him to watch the surveillance video to see if there was any proof of the violent assault. Dindral later gave the footage to cops who were able to track down the suspect. 'It was the right thing to do,' Dindral told the Daily News. 'You don’t hit a child like that.' Local Tattoo artist Chris Danaher who works near the market said he could never fathom acting violently towards a child. 'I would never imagine treating a child like that,' Danaher told ABC. 'His wife or girlfriend or whatever was clearly pregnant. She had no regard to it. She picked up her son and left the store,' he added. Danher said sadly the child is too young to truly understand what is going on. 'It's terrible. That kid is obviously too young to know what was going on. Honestly, couldn't be more than 3 years old, and I just couldn't imagine anyone doing that to me or me doing that to a child whatsoever,' said Danaher. The boy was later examined by medical personnel at his home and he did not require hospitalization. It is unknown whether or not he will be placed in new custody. A second video released on Friday shows Whittington allegedly picking up his son like a rag doll. The potential child abuse case is currently under investigation.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"The Ohio parents of a two-year-old child who authorities say was beaten and starved to death were indicted on aggravated murder charges Wednesday. Hamilton County's prosecutor said that the grand jury also indicted Andrea Bradley, 28, and Glen Bates, 32, on murder and child endangering charges in Glenara Bates' death. Prosecutor Joe Deters says the parents, both of Cincinnati, could face the death penalty if convicted of all the charges. Scroll down for video . Facing charges: Andrea Bradley (left), 28, and Glen Bates (right), 32, have been indicted on aggravated murder charges in the beating death of their 2-year-old daughter last month . Innocent: Glenara Bates was brought to an Ohio hospital last month dead and weighing only 13lbs . Deters' statement says Bradley took her baby daughter to a hospital March 29 where the girl was pronounced dead. The child had been badly beaten and had bruises, belt marks and bite marks, he said. The child also had injury to her head and broken teeth, and injuries had been inflicted over an extended period of time. She had over 100 wounds to her body total. According to the prosecutors, at the time of her death Glenara weighted only 13lbs - the average weight of a 3 or 4-month-old infant. Hamilton County Coroner Lakshmi Kode Sammarco, who performed the autopsy on Glenara, described it as the worst case of starvation she's ever witnessed in her career. 'There is no doubt in my mind this child was tortured for the majority of her pitifully short life,' Sammarco said. She recalled that it took a team of pathologists more than four hours to document all of the toddler's numerous injuries and scars. ‘The abuse this baby suffered is beyond belief,’ Deters said. 'If they [parents] get executed, God bless them, I’d like to see it.' The prosecutor said Bradley had seven children and is expecting her eighth child in July. Five of the other children — ages 1, 4, 5, 7 and 8 — were living with Bradley. Glenara had been taken away from the family after being diagnosed with malnutrition, but child services returned the girl to the mother just weeks before her death. Deters said that in her final days, the toddler ate and slept in a bathtub filled with feces and blood. 'You wouldn't treat your dog like this,' he said, . The parents are now in the custody of the Hamilton County Department of Job and Family Services. None of the other children showed current signs of abuse, Deters said. Matriarch: Bradley had seven children and is expecting her eighth child in July. This image from last July shows the woman pregnant with her youngest child and holding what appears to be a cigarette . Five of Bradley's seven children — ages 1, 4, 5, 7 and 8 — were living with the woman at the time of Glenara's death . He said an older child lives with paternal relatives. The indictments come on the same day that child-welfare workers across Ohio are promoting awareness and prevention of child abuse and in the wake of a high-profile Cincinnati case involving a 3-month-old infant's decapitation. That child's mother, Deasia Watkins, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of aggravated murder. Last week, Bradley’s sister, Desana Townsend, told the station WCPO that the 28-year-old mother of eight tortured her daughter. Investigators say Glenara's parents dropped her from 6 feet above ground, and her mother then tried to sew her head wound at home with a needle and thread. Calling her sibling 'heartless,' Ms Townsend said Bradley did not deserve to have children. Detective Eric Karaguless said during a preliminary hearing that the couple admitted to the abuse, which lasted more than three weeks. Investigators say Glenara's parents dropped her from 6 feet about ground, and her mother then tried to close up her head wound at home with a needle and thread . Bradley allegedly told detectives during questioning that she had whipped the toddler with a belt and failed to seek medical help for her after Glenara was dropped on her head. The mother of eight has a history of child abuse dating back to 2007, according to documents. On Wednesday, Job and Family Services Director Moira Weir publicly acknowledged that her agency mishandled Glenara's case. 'We cannot comment publicly on the specifics of this case, but I will say a preliminary review shows we failed to follow our own policies and procedures in this case,' she stated.","Andrea Bradley and Glen Bates charged with aggravated murder in the beating death of their two-year-old daughter Glenara .

"Detectives have released a CCTV image of a woman (pictured) they want to trace after £60 was stolen from an epileptic woman's handbag . A 'despicable' thief who stole £60 from an epileptic woman's handbag after she collapsed and suffered a violent fit is being hunted by police. Detectives have released a CCTV image of a woman they want to trace after the money was stolen in Ryemarket Shopping Centre, Stourbridge, West Midlands. The female victim collapsed and started violently fitting in a seizure that lasted 20 minutes, leaving her in 'great distress'. Passers-by rushed to comfort her but police believe one person took advantage of the drama, reaching into the woman's handbag and stealing £60 cash. Officers said the CCTV showed a woman moving the victim's shopping trolley before leaving the market on the afternoon of April 7, West Midlands Police said. She has been  described as a white woman in her 30s or 40s, around 5ft 5in tall and with long dark hair which was tied back in a ponytail. Detective Inspector Nigel Smith said: 'It's a truly despicable crime. 'The lady is clearly in great distress on the floor and, while most people's immediate concern is for her well-being, one person sees it as an opportunity to steal from her.' The victim made a full recovery and only realised her money had gone after the incident. Mr Smith added: 'We've secured a CCTV image of a woman we need to speak to about the theft. 'She is one of around 12 people who were stood near the lady but is seen to quickly leave having put her hand on the shopping trolley. 'We'd urge anyone who believes they recognise the person in the CCTV to contact us.' Anyone with information about the incident, which happened on the afternoon of April 7, is urged to call police on 101.

"Edwin Mee denies a series of sex offences which complainants claim took place when he worked as as an Army recruitment sergeant in Croydon . An Army recruitment sergeant who served with the Special Forces in Iraq has denied sex attacks on 11 female cadets - saying they 'never happened'. Edwin Mee, 46, is said to have abused his position of power to abuse or rape 11 alleged victims while working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London. The Scottish officer - known as 'Jock' - allegedly carried out the attacks on women aged from 15 to their early twenties between October 2010 and September 2011. Taking to the witness box to give evidence at London's Southwark Crown Court today, Mee told jurors about his military career, and firmly denied the allegations. He branded one alleged victim - who says she became pregnant after he raped her - a 'time waster' and a liar. Lisa Wilding QC, defending, asked her client: 'The allegations against you are that in respect of two complainants, that you raped them, and in respect of the others that you touched them sexually, what do you say generally about those allegations?' Mee replied: 'That never happened ma'am.' Mee joined the army aged 24, and went on to serve tours of duty in Iraq - where he was attached to the Special Forces, and Afghanistan - where he was attached to a parachute regiment - and Bosnia, jurors heard. By the time the allegations against him came to light he had acquired the rank of sergeant, and he was suspended in 2011. The court was told that Mee was medically discharged from the Army in April 2014. He explained that his father had been an engineer in the Royal Navy, his mother an Army nurse, and that his step-brothers had also been in the Army. Lisa Wilding QC, defending Mee, asked him how he felt about his time in the Army. He replied: 'Everyone knows how I feel about the Army. My family served in it - the Army was my life, and if it wasn't for all this mess, I would still be there.' When arrested, Mee gave a prepared statement to police denying the allegations against him. Referring to one of the rape allegations, he said: 'I have never raped any person in my life.' He went on to deny each of the sexual assault allegations saying 'I did not sexually assault any person', when talking about each individual incident. However, giving evidence, Mee conceded that he would often swear in the recruitment office and shouted at recruits saying things like 'I'll rip your head off and s*** down your throat'. When asked why he was like this, he replied: 'If I felt they were trying to mess me about, if somebody missed an appointment. These are courses that are paid for by the British army. 'If someone missed an appointment I would get them on the phone and b****** them. At the time I just thought it was normal. It was just the way I spoke.' Mee said that the Army, from which he is suspended, is 'his life' and insisted the offences 'never happened' He further admitted that he would often make comments to 'threaten or intimidate' recruits because the Army is not a nine to five job and they needed to understand that they could lose their lives. But Mee also told jurors that he was 'protective' over his candidates and felt that he was in the best position to help them, occasionally 'cutting corners' to help them progress. He had a total of 565 candidates on his books while working at the recruitment centre. The court has heard that Mee targeted alleged victims by staying late at the careers centre to conduct after-hours interviews with applicants - in which he 'gauged their vulnerability'. One of the women, who is originally from Sierra Leone, claims she became pregnant after Mee raped her. He is accused of having threatened to halt her application at one point, telling her: ‘I am from the army, I can do anything’. But Mee denied her claims. He said: 'She was a time waster and she lied to me with regards to her application and medical condition.' 'She had a problem with her weight and I had to send her away, she was slightly overweight I believe,' he said. Giving evidence from behind a screen, the complainant told jurors Mee raped her after pretending to ring the Home Office to help secure her visa. Mee was working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, when the alleged incidents took place . He dismissed her account that she believed he could influence her immigration status. 'I would say that is absolutely ludicrous and rubbish,' Mee told jurors. He further denied slapping her bottom, asking her to live with him and asking for sex on the telephone. 'Did you ever say ""I will marry you if you don't get a visa"",' asked Ms Wilding. 'No I did not,' replied Mee. Another complainant, aged 16 at the time of the alleged offence, says Mee asked to see the piercing in her stomach area the first time they met to discuss her application. She claims that he later slapped her bottom and, when she complained, told her: 'It's you who needs the Army.' At the time of the alleged sex attacks, he was employed as a recruiting sergeant with the British Army at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office (ACIO) in Croydon. Mee, of Croydon, south London denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Southwark Crown Court heard Mee was protective of his recruits and 'cut corners' to help them in their careers .

"Two kayakers died, and another  remains hospitalized in serious condition, after a sudden Seattle storm with 35mph winds overturned their boats during a church-organized trip. Mandi L. Walkley, 39, and Jacob M. Austin, 52, were in the Dungeness Bay, where swells were as high as 3ft, for one to two hours before they could be rescued by the Coast Guard. Both passed away after they were transported to nearby hospitals. William D. Kelley, 50, who was also rescued by the Coast Guard, has improved from critical to serious condition. His pastor, Bill Bowers, said Kelley is 'not able to speak at the moment'. Mandi L. Walkley, 39, (left) and Jacob M. Austin, 52, (right) died after a sudden storm in Washington's Dungeness Bay hit their church kayaking trip . 'He's got a tube down his throat,' Bowers, who is with the Mountain View Church in Tumwater, told the Seattle Times.  'But I've talked with his wife, and they're hopeful. He's squeezing their hands and blinking at them.' Fellow kayaker William D. Kelley, 50, remains hospitalized. His condition has improved from critical to serious . Walkley, Austin and Kelley were part of a group of seven people who set out on Saturday for an excursion along Washington's Dungeness Spit. According to Sgt. Lyman Moores of Clallam County Sheriff's Office, forecasts had predicted there would be stormy weather the day of the scheduled trip a week ago and that an advisory had been issued a day before. 'No one should've been out there in a kayak,' he said on Sunday. But, according to fellow kayaker Dennis Caines, the terrible weather 'came up all of a sudden' and took the group by surprise. 'We weren't ready for it,' he said. And a video the friends took during the trip shows that the weather was calm as they paddled to the New Dungeness Lighthouse for a lunch break, according to King 5 News. Caines and the group left the lighthouse around 1.30pm. He told King 5 that within 10 minutes of the wind picking up, he and his wife Linda 'couldn't see anybody or another kayaker anywhere'. The couple, who were riding in a tandem kayak, and two other people with the group paddled safely back to shore. Walkley, Austin and Kelley were stranded in the water for one to two hours before they were rescused by the Coast Guard. They had been part of a group of seven that were kayaking along the Dungeness Spit (pictured) Dennis Caines, who was also on the trip, said the weather was calm as the group stopped at the New Dungeness Lighthouse (pictured) for lunch. But minutes after they got back in the water, the wind picked up . At around 2.30pm, Walkley, Austin and Kelley were spotted by a lighthouse attendant, who notified the Coast Guard. The Navy also provided a rescue chopper. Caines said that everyone in the group wore life jackets, and that both he and his wife were also wearing wetsuits. According to Moores, the lifejackets weren't enough to protect the kayakers from the Bay's cold water, which was measured at 49 degrees on the day of the accident. Moores said that kind of temperature could shut down the human body 'in a matter of minutes'. 'These people weren't prepared for the conditions,' he told the Seattle Times. 'They were just wearing cotton clothes.' But, according to Caines, the kayaks the group used were also well-outfitted. At 17-feet long, they had rudders, which help keep the boat straight during waves and winds, as well as rain skirts and pumps designed to keep water out. Pastor Bowers told the Seattle Times he was unaware if the trip's organizers had known about the storm forecast, but said 'no one on that trip would have done anything if they thought it would put them into danger'. Caines and his wife Linda, who were riding with the group in a tandem kayak, said that within 10 minutes of the wind picking up they couldn't see anyone else in their group . And Walkley's mother Janeen said her daughter 'always took precautions', even leaving her own kayaks at home to use the larger kayak designed for the sea. 'Knowing Mandi, if she knew the weather was going to be that nasty, I don't think she would've gone,' Janeen said. According to Caines, the group had known and liked Walkley and Austin, neither of whom were part of the Mountain View Church - which organized the trip for both members and nonmembers. 'We lost two good friends and one is struggling,' Caines, who called Walkey 'such a beautiful person', told King 5 News. 'It just feels unreal,' said Linda Caines. 'People we were friends with, that were there, and then they weren't.'","Mandi L. Walkley, 39, and Jacob M.

"An Irish tourist accused of leaving his brother in a coma after a late night argument in Sydney has pleaded guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm after the crown declined to downgrade the charge. But Barry Lyttle, 33, will now be sentenced in Sydney's local court, where the maximum jail term is two years, rather than the district court, where people could face up to 10 years for that offence. Patrick Lyttle, 31, was rushed to hospital and spent six days in a coma after he was allegedly struck by his brother, Barry in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner-city on January 3. Downing Centre Local Court was told of the plea during a brief mention on Thursday, where Lyttle was supported by family, including his younger brother Patrick, whom he punched in Potts Point in the early hours of January 3. His elder brother was charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. Lyttle's legal team had tried to negotiate a lesser charge over the attack, with Patrick publicly speaking out in support of his brother and calling for the charges to be dismissed. But prosecutors decided to go ahead with the original charge and that Lyttle agreed to plead guilty. The Irishman could learn his fate as soon as Thursday afternoon when the matter returns to court for a possible sentencing hearing. The hearing is expected to include CCTV footage of the attack and evidence from criminologist John Braithwaite, an expert in 'restorative justice', which covers sentencing options other than imprisonment.

Lyttle's lawyer, Chris Watson, said if talks were successful they expect the matter to remain in the local court jurisdiction and to be dealt with quickly. Outside court Patrick said he had made 'a fantastic recovery'. Mr Lyttle spent nearly a week in an induced coma in January following his brother's alleged attack before making his remarkable recovery at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner suburbs. Patrick's appearance in court today was his first without wearing a beanie. He appeared in fine health as he and his brother arrived wearing matching suits and shoes. The younger Mr Lyttle has previously called on the charges laid against his brother to be dropped. The brothers, who have been accompanied by their father OIiver throughout their stay in Australia, wish to return home to Ireland together as soon as possible. The matter will return to court on April 16. Patrick Lytlle (middle) has called on charges against his brother Barry (left) to be dropped .

"Two best mates from rural Victoria have vowed to keep Aussie lingo alive by making memorabilia that encapsulates the fading vernacular. Jeff McCubbery, 72, from Mandurang and Ian Bullock, 65, from Blackburn devised the plan for Captain Cootie Cards over twenty years ago in a bid to counter the influx of lingo from overseas. The pair now has a quirky range of greeting cards, coffee mugs, stubby-holders and calendars – but their hopes of spreading the message were dashed after they were spurned by the companies they pitched their products to. An Illustration from best mates Ian Bullock and Jeff McCubberry, who have vowed to keep Aussie slang alive through a range a range of custom memorabilia . McCubberry told Daily Mail Australia they designed the idea after meeting on a fishing trip 25 years ago. 'We met at an annual fishing trip, and quickly learned we shared the belief that the language we grew up with was waning.' 'People are dorks not drongos, guys not blokes. We decided to do something to keep the vocabulary afloat,' McCubbery said. 'We decided to consolidate the Australianisms we knew and loved from our upbringings-instead of the Americanisms which have ,' said Ian Bullock. With Ian Bullock (left) as illustrator and and Jeff McCubbery (right) as designer, the duo have devised a range of greeting cards, coffee mugs, stubby-holders and calendars emblazoned with down under lingo . One illustration depicts weather forecast map with the various Australian climatological zones – the Northern Territory is 'bloody muggy' , Alice Springs is 'dry as a dead dingo's donger', and Victoria is 'cold as a witch's tit'. Another card shows a fisherman sleeping next to a lake with beer can in hand and the accompanying message: 'flat out like a lizard drinking.' McCubberry believes the rise of television and the internet has let a torrent of lingo loose from Britain and America that has eclipsed the home grown counterpart. McCubberry said when the pair met on a fishing trip 20 years ago 'we quickly learned we shared the belief that the language we grew up with was waning' The best mates use lingo from their upbringing which they say has disappeared, such as the term: 'I don't give a rats a**' With McCubberry as designer and Bullock as illustrator, the mates got to work on a range of products that embody down under speech from a bygone time. But much to their dismay the pair got a rude shock when time came to pitch the product a manufacturers. 'Nobodies interested, said McCubbery. 'They say it's too crude or uncouth. It doesn't make sense because colourful language is a pivotal part of Aussie culture.' The duo plan to launch a digital campaign in hopes of finding a distributor to get their products on the market . Bullock said they had a deal with a major distributor that fell through before another wholesaler offered them a rather insulting rate to print the cards. 'It was pretty insulting really. It's been a real knock back but we're determined to stick at it.' The mates plan to launch a website and social media campaign in hopes of finding a distributor to get their products on the market. 'It's just a matter of getting my head around the online thing. We're sticking at it for sure,' said McCubbery.","Jeff McCubbery and Ian Bullock met on a fishing trip twenty years ago .

"For people that like their dating chilled out, an app that’s been dubbed ‘Tinder for marijuana users’ has just gone global. Called High There!, the app is officially described as the world’s first global social network for cannabis enthusiasts. The network is designed to let users meet one another online to make friends and form relationships without being judged for their habit or views. The High There! app is  described as the world’s first global social network of cannabis enthusiasts. Users share their interests (left) and energy levels when using cannabis (right) as part of their profile . When High There! first launched two months ago, it could only be downloaded by users in the US who live in states that have legalised cannabis. But now it’s available globally via Apple’s App Store and Google Play, after getting approval to widen its reach. The app quickly became popular in New York, California and Colorado, with 41,000 downloads in the first six weeks and it’s expected to a hit in the Netherlands, Spain, England and Australia, Forbes reported. Users swipe to choose to connect to people - like in the popular dating app Tinder. When High There! first launched two months ago, it could only be downloaded by users in the US who live in states that have legalised cannabis (a joint is pictured) but a global version was rolled out yesterday . The medicinal properties of hemp are being used by pet owners to treat their cats and dogs. Hemp is legal and unlike cannabis, contains little tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high. There are a rising number of firms in the US that sell biscuits containing cannabidiol extracted from hemp, believed to alleviate joint pains, treat mood disorders and even help animals lose weight. Research has also suggested that CBD can relieve pain and discomfort in dying pets and calm animals down. Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits for both cats and dogs. 'Due in part to their small body size, dogs and cats can take advantage of small amounts of CBD, THC and other cannabinoids found in hemp and can therefore reap the benefits of this great plant,' the firm said. 'We are not interested in, nor are we advocating the administration of, the well-known psychotropic compound THC, in concentrations sufficient to produce the 'high' or psychotropic effects which are normally associated with marijuana. 'We are not advocating the administration of marijuana, by any route, to animals in order to produce medical benefit or to produce any psychotropic effect.' The firm writes on the App Store: 'Chat with your connections and invite your friends who also want to engage in shared experiences within a non-judgmental environment. 'You can use High There! to date, go out with new friends, or simply connect with people who are like you. As we say, “You've got more friends than you think.”' Denver-based Founder and CEO of High There! Todd Mitchem, said that the app doesn’t encourage the sale of marijuana but is simply a social network for people who consider it part of their lifestyle. It deletes the accounts of people who post photos of the drug in their profile picture and takes down images of marijuana in their picture section. Despite the measures, Mr Mitchem said he was surprised that the app was allowed to go global. Writing on the High There! blog, he said: ‘This news was a surprise, but the allowance was made because we are a responsible social network and because we focus on building connections rather than just showing off your weed.’ He’s a former Chief Revenue Officer of hash oil maker, O.penVAPE and says that 12 million people use some form of the drug, meaning that there is a real opportunity to connect users on a social network. His motivation for rolling out the app widely is personal too, because his mother used the drug to battle cancer, which Mr Mitchem claims saved her life. ‘To you, that mother just like mine, fighting cancer in a state where the stigma still exists around weed, High There! is here for you. His motivation for rolling out the app globally (illustrated with this image) is personal for Mr Mitchem, because his mother used to drug to battle cancer, which he claims saved her life . The app deletes the accounts of people who post photos of the drug in their profile picture and takes down images of marijuana (a stock image is shown) in their picture section . ‘To all of you in states where cannabis is now legal, High There! is definitely here for you too! ‘And to the countless women and men who simply want to meet other like-minded, amazing people in a non-judgmental way, High There! is here for you also.’ The app has been likened to Tinder, which also lets users swipe through prospective friends and partners. At its regional launch, Mashable reported that Mr Mitchem created the app after women didn’t find him appealing on conventional dating sites, because he smokes cannabis. ‘We wanted to build a cool piece of technology that solved the problem of where do million and millions of cannabis consumers go to meet people, connect with people and build relationships,’ he said. ‘A lot of people say we’re the Tinder of weed, but that’s only one facet of the whole thing. It’s so much bigger. He says the network is actually primarily designed for platonic connections. ‘As we open the platform to the entire planet, I am certain meeting new like-minded people will take on some exciting new paths,’ he added.","HighThere! app is the world's first social network for cannabis enthusiasts .

"The brass lamp is being sold at auction in June by auctioneers Hansons (above with model in period costume) A brass desk lamp used by Florence Nightingale as she wrote about her nursing experiences in the Crimean War is to be sold at auction. It was given as a gift to two sisters who worked as servants for the Nightingale family at Lea Hurst, near Matlock, Derbyshire. Dating back to around 1840, the 10in tall lamp will go under the hammer at Hansons in Etwall, Derbyshire, on June 26. After her experiences in the war Nightingale returned to Derbyshire, where she had spent her childhood, in the 1850s. She wrote of what she had seen in the conflict with her 1859 Notes on Nursing still considered as having shaped the profession today. During the war she became known as The Lady with the Lamp thanks to a report in The Times. She had been sent to Selimiye Barracks in Scutari, now Istanbul, in 1854 to care for soldiers. She pleaded with the British newspaper to appeal to the Government for better working conditions having been horrified by the squalor and disease fighters faced. The result was Renkioi Hospital, a civilian facility built in England and shipped to the area to care for those who had been hurt. It was there Nightingale earned her nickname, carrying a lamp as she completed rounds of the hospital's patients through the night. The lamp from her Derbyshire home was passed down through generations of the Lea Hurst servants' family. Auctineer Charles Hanson said: ‘The lamp is quite remarkable. It has a wonderful provenance, which confirms it helped ignite Florence and her writings late into many a Derbyshire night. 'Such an iconic object and it’s association with such a leading lady will be guided at £1000-2000. With interest and competition it may just ignite, since it is such a wonderful object.' Florence Nightingale penned nursing notes at her Derbyshire home after returning from the Crimean War .","A brass lamp from the nurse's Derbyshire home is to go under the hammer .

"New aerial photos show the trail of destruction a tornado inflicted on a small Illinois farming community. Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could. But buildings in the settlement were virtually flattened when the vortex slammed into the area at around 7pm on Thursday night. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way. Geraldine M Schultz, 67, and Jacklyn K. Klosa, 69, were killed in her home by the storm, authorities announced, while around a dozen people were injured. This aerial photo shows a path of destruction, after a tornado swept through the small town of Fairdale, Illinois . Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could . The DeKalb County Sheriff's Office bused residents back to the scene of the devastation so they could begin to take stock of what was left of their property. Seeing the wreckage up close for the first time since Thursday's storms left some amazed that they survived. 'I thought my parents were dead,' said 32-year-old Adam Davis, who hopped into his truck Thursday and raced along with the tornado in the hopes of getting to his parents' house and rescuing them before the twister struck. He found them standing in their doorway frozen in disbelief and grabbed them just in time. On Saturday, he was helping collect what could be salvaged from his childhood home, now full of debris, its roof ripped off and its windows broken. 'It's not necessarily the mementos yet; it's the essentials for now. One step at a time,' he said. Eight tornadoes roared across northern and central Illinois during Thursday's storms, the National Weather Service confirmed Saturday. The strongest hit Fairdale, where two people were killed. That tornado also injured 22 people. Debris surrounds a plot where a house once stood in the farming community. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way . The weather service gave it a preliminary EF4 rating — its second strongest — with winds of between 180 and 200 mph. It was a half-mile wide and remained on the ground for at least 28.7 miles, a record long path for that part of Illinois. Al Zammuto, a 60-year-old machinist, was preparing to inspect what was left of the roof on a former schoolhouse that he had been transforming into his home over the past year. He will have to start over. 'I don't know how much of the roof came off,' he said. 'I'm going to climb a ladder later today and see.' In all, some 70 buildings were destroyed or damaged in Fairdale, authorities said. Another 50 buildings were hit in nearby Rochelle. All buildings have been searched, but not all residents have been accounted for, so cadaver dogs are being used in parts of DeKalb County, the Illinois State Police said late Friday. The tornado blew numerous vehicles from nearby interstates, and troopers helped rescue a trapped driver in an overturned semi-trailer. As the cleanup began, tales of survival continued to emerge. The vortex created a path through the fields and wiped out a house as it made its way to the town. A building is left standing in a property above . Kelly Newman, 46, lost her Rochelle home. For her, the storm began with a moment of playful wonder at the size of the hail. She ran outside to collect some of the pieces to put it in the freezer to show her children. 'Then I noticed to the southwest there was a huge black funnel thing, but it didn't look like a tornado because it was just way too wide,' she said. But the telltale train-like roar sent them and their 19-year-old daughter running for the basement. The house cracked and collapsed around them, raining down debris and a dusting of what she described as 'muddy soot.' The family survived, and several police officers helped free her husband, who had been trapped nearly upside down between two collapsed walls. 'We're alive, we were spared. Our lives were saved,' she said. A destroyed house is seen in Fairdale is pictured on Friday, hours after a tornado ripped through the community .

"Police were making their final security checks outside St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington today, as the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child approaches. With Kate's due date is just over three days away, officers were out in force, pulling lamp posts apart as they scoured the area for anything troubling. The police were watched by a small but growing group of royal fans, many of whom had set up camp on a set of benches and had decorated the area with posters and bunting. Scroll down for video . Ready to go: John Loughrey takes a nap on his makeshift bed outside the Lindo Wing in Paddington . Patriotic: Royal fan Terry Hut takes a break on Mr Loughrey's bench . Festive: Mr Hut sits with another veteran royal fan, Margaret Tyler, 71 . Leading the pack was a familiar face, that of self-confessed royal 'superfan' John Loughery, 60, who camped out overnight ahead of the 2011 Royal Wedding and was the only member of the public to attend every day of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana in 2008. Mr Loughery, a former chef, said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the BBC that he wouldn't be surprised 'if a portrait of me is hanging inside Kensington Palace in 100 years from now'. Today, he was more concerned about the Queen and her 89th birthday and happily showed off a handmade sign wishing her many happy returns. Along with group of fellow fans, Mr Loughery went on to delight the world's media - many of whom have gathered but have so far had little to do - with a chorus of Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday: Mr Loughrey holds up a sign wishing the Queen a very happy 89th . Serenade: Mr Loughrey, Mr Hut and fellow fans also serenaded the monarch - and the Press - with a song . Decoration: Mr Loughrey and Mr Hut also came prepared with a selection of royal-themed decorations . Something to do: The Press, who have had little to do so far, happily filmed the waiting fans . Nearly there: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured last month, is due to give birth on the 25th April . Also watching proceedings was royal fan Terry Hut, 79, who, in his Union flag suit, umbrella hat and sunglasses, provided the grey London street with a bright splash of colour. Mr Hut, who came prepared with Prince and Princess balloons, is a veteran of several royal births and spent 12 days camping outside the Lindo Wing ahead of Prince George's birth. Equally serious about the Royal Family is Margaret Tyler, 71, an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than £10,000. Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a £1,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London. Memorabilia: Mrs Tyler, who has a royal collection worth £10,000, came prepared with a Kate figurine . Cheerful: Despite their long wait, the group all appeared to be in good spirits . Ready for action: Mr Hut and Mr Loughrey both came prepared with balloons and signs . Serious business: While the royal fans sang, the police conducted a search of the area . Like Mr Loughery and Mr Hut, Mrs Tyler was also at the Lindo Wing for the birth of Prince George and ended up spending six days waiting for him to arrive. 'I was there for six days,' she told a recent episode of BBC2 show Collectaholics. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting. I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.' The Duchess of Cambridge, who is currently at Kensington Palace, is expected to give birth within days and is due on the 25th April. Today, Kensington Palace announced that her husband Prince William had completed his Air Ambulance training early, freeing him up to be with his wife and avoiding a two-hour hospital dash from Norfolk. Checks: They scoured the area for anything undesirable, watched by press and fans . Final preparations: The Duchess is due to give birth in just over three days . Thorough: The police even searched inside the lamp posts outside the Lindo Wing .

"Trade was taking place between East Asia and the New World hundreds of years before Christopher Columbus arrived in the area in 1492. This is according to a series of bronze artefacts found  at the 'Rising Whale' site in Cape Espenberg, Alaska. Archaeologists discovered what they believe to be a bronze and leather buckle and a bronze whistle, dating to around A.D. 600. Trade was taking place between East Asia and the New World hundreds of years before Christopher Columbus (left) arrived in 1492. The discovery was made after archaeologists found what they believe to be a bronze and leather buckle (right), dating to around A.D. 600 . Bronze-working had not been developed at this time in Alaska, and researchers instead believe the artefacts were created in China, Korea or Yakutia. 'We're seeing the interactions, indirect as they are, with these so-called 'high civilisations' of China, Korea or Yakutia,' Owen Mason, a research associate at the University of Colorado, told LiveScience. 'Native copper and meteoritic iron were hammered into a variety objects by late prehistoric inhabitants of arctic and subarctic North America,' reports the research team on the website Arctic Research Consortium. '[But] there is no evidence for the smelting, casting, or alloying of metals in the Western Hemisphere north of Mexico prior to the arrival of Europeans. Bronze-working had not been developed at this time in Alaska, and researchers believe the artefacts were created in China, Korea or Yakutia . Pictured are archaeologists working at the Rising Whale site at Cape Espenberg, Alaska. Researchers believe those who lived at the Rising Whale site may be part of what scientists call the 'Birnirk' culture . 'As a result, these two artefacts give the best and least ambiguous evidence to date that non-ferrous industrial smelted metals were arriving in Alaska via prehistoric trade across the Bering Strait.' Researchers believe those who lived at the Rising Whale site may be part of what scientists call the 'Birnirk' culture. This is a group of people who lived on both sides of the Bering Strait and used advanced skin boats. They are believed to have lived in small family dwellings containing either an entrance that led to a single room with sleeping platforms. Birnirk settlements were small, with only a few families living in a settlement at a time. They were talented seal hunters, known for their use of innovative equipment, such as ice scratchers to lure seals over frozen waters. They were also known for their use of ground slate weapons, including knives, blades, arrows, and spears. Researchers believe those who lived at the Rising Whale site may be part of what scientists call the 'Birnirk' culture. This is a group of people who lived on both sides of the Bering Strait and used skin boats and harpoons to hunt whales, LiveScience reports. The latest discovery of bronze artefacts backs up earlier evidence for trade between Alaska and other civilisations prior to 1492. Inside the house, tests on obsidian items – created by volcanic glass – had previously suggested they came from the Anadyr River valley in Russia. LiveScience notes that anthropologist Berthold Laufer published an analysis of texts and artefacts in the journal T'oung Pao in 1913, in which he found that the Chinese had an interest in obtaining ivory. He said that some of the walrus ivory may have come from the Bering Strait. There is also evidence that plate armour made using ivory and bones began appearing in Alaska around 1,000 years ago. A controversial hypothesis, put forward by amateur historian Gavin Menzies, suggests that China discovered the Americas 70 years before Columbus. He bases his theory on an alleged 18th century copy of a 1418 map charted by Chinese Admiral Zheng He, which appears to show the New World in some detail . Its overlapping style is similar to plate armour developed in East Asia, thousands of years ago.

He bases his theory on an alleged 18th century copy of a 1418 map charted by Chinese Admiral Zheng He, which appears to show the New World in some detail. 'The traditional story of Columbus discovering the New World is absolute fantasy, it's fairy tales,' Mr Menzies told MailOnline. Among Menzies other claims are that the first inhabitants of the Western hemisphere didn't come over land from the Bering Strait, but instead were Chinese sailors who first crossed the Pacific Ocean 40,000 years ago. He also writes that DNA markers prove American Indians and other natives are the descendants of several waves of Asian settlers. Most scientists believe that humans arrived in the New World 15,000 years ago by crossing the now-flooded land bridge that had formed across the Bering Strait. But a recent genetic study suggests there were also journeys taken by people from East Asia to the New World at a later date.

"The four sisters caught in the middle of a battle between their parents that spanned two continents have told their side of the story. More than three years ago Claire, Emily, Christine and Lily Vincenti were taken from their Italian home by their mother, which sparked an ugly dispute that included claims of kidnapping. Their mother, Laura Garrett, had Australian passports made for the girls and fled to Australia. She claimed she had to escape her abusive partner, Tomasso Vincenti. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flashback to 2012: These were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart when four young sisters were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's Sunshine Coast home in the middle of the night and forced onto a plan back to their father in Italy . The sisters were returned to Italy in 2012, after Ms Garrett's story fell apart. The two eldest children, Claire and Emily, told 60 Minutes' Tara Brown they had moved on from the ordeal. 'I think they were thinking more about themselves than us, you know, because we were put at the centre of this whole situation, and I don't know, they were a little bit selfish,' Claire Vincenti said. 'Because you know, we went through all of this — I mean, they did as well, but it was most hard for us than them, because they're the adults.' 'If I think about it now, maybe I've said stuff that I exaggerated a little bit, and that was just because I was liking my life in Australia and that was just because I didn't want to leave.' The four Vincenti sisters, including the two older girls Emil and Claire, had a 'monster' of a father who abused them and their mother,or so the story went after the girls were removed from their home in dramatic circumstances and return to Italy . Despite being embroiled in the very public and traumatic feud where the Vinceni girls were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's home in the middle of the night to go back to live with their father in 2012, the girls have established healthy and happy lives in Italy and speak to their mum every night. 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown interviewed the two eldest girls, Emily and Claire, who she described as elegant, gracious, reserved and studious, at their home near Florence and they expressed their regret for the way they handled the dramatic exit. 'They are really well, really centred and settled,' she said. What had led up to the removal of the four sisters in Australia and their return to Italy was the fact that their mother had taken them from their home in Italy on a 'vacation' and never returned, claiming the girls' father Tomaso was an abuser . Laura Garrett (pictured) has consistently maintained that she was removing her daughters from Italy back to Australia for their own safety . The four Vinceni girls miss Australia and their mother, but they are happy and calm girls in contrast to the dramatic and hysterical scenes in which they were removed from Australia in late 2012 . 'They are really well, really centred and settled. 'They are elegant, gracious, reserved and studious,' 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 'They are very calm.' Tara said the girls were somewhat aware of the hysteria the distressing scenes of their exit caused and 'have a bit of regret about how they handled it ... so public and being so vehement, but they were manipulated'. The girls are living positive and fruitful lives, attending school six days a week, talking about what they will study at university and going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence. 'They speak with their mother every night and their father believes it is best for them to have both parents in their lives,' Brown said. Despite claims by the girls' mother that they were not happy in Italy, the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with their father Tomaso. 'They are still children who have seen a very bitter custody fight and ultimately they would like to live with both of their parents.' This scene of one of the Tomaso girls in apparent distress outside her father's villa in Florence after the four sisters were taken back from Australia to Italy . Emily and Claire Vincenti (pictured) are now aged 16 and 17 and are living in Italy with their father . The story was that the girls had been taken from their abusive father back in Italy to hide out in Australia and now they were being sent back to the 'monster' against their will. The scenes of the girl's forced return caused widespread outcry, particularly as the girls' mother portrayed the cruelty of the Dad, and the girls -  then aged nine to 14 years old - frightened and distraught. That was in 2012 and it seemed unbelievable to many Australians who watched the scenes play out that the girls were legally being returned to their Italian father as approved under Italian law. What had been lost in the drama was the fact that the four sisters had earlier been taken by their mother from Italy without the knowledge or permission of that father, Tomaso Vincenti, and that the girls had been born in Italy and spent the greater part of their young lives there. Now 60 Minutes has returned to the village near Florence where the girls have been living with their Italian Dad and interview the two elder girls, Emily and Claire Vincenti and talked to them about their lives and the dramatic circumstances in which they were apparently wrenched from their mother, Laura Garrett. Emily and Claire talked about their parents and were filmed going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence . The four Vinceni girls miss Australia and their mother, but appear happy and calm in contrast to the dramatic and hysterical scenes in which they were removed from Australian in late 2012 . The dramatic turn in the lives of the Vincenti girls began in 2010, when they left Italy ostensibly just for  month's holiday back in Australia, with their mother's family on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. Laura Garrett and Tomaso Vincenti had met when she was a schoolgirl and had gone to Italy as an exchange student. Her host family was Tomaso's parents and Laura and Tomaso fell in love. Laura became pregnant and the pair married. Ms Garrett gave birth to four healthy girls, but in 2007 when the youngest was only around  four years old she split from Tomaso. Under Italian law, both parents were granted equal custody. In 2010, Laura told Tomaso she wanted to take the girls back to Australia for a vacation. Ms Garrett told the Australian embassy in Italian entirely different story, that she was fleeing an abusive husband and father and she needed their assistance. Despite claims by the girls' mother than they were not happy in Italy, the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with father Tomaso . Once back in Australia, Ms Garrett and her daughters settled down to life in Queensland for two years, until the dramatic scenes which saw them returned to Italy. Now aged twelve to 17, the young women behave in complete contrast to the screaming, hysterical girls captured on camera in 2012. Just a day after being taken to their father's villa on the outskirts of Florence, the two older girls were filmed running to the front gates when they saw media camped outside and pleaded for reporters to help them return to Australia. The eldest girl was taken back inside by her father, while her sister clung to the gate as her grandmother urged her to return inside. She held onto the gate for an hour, during which local police and social workers arrived. The girls had not seen their mother since they left Australia, but after 60 Minutes went to Italy to film the story, Laura Garrett  has subsequently turned up for a three-day visit. Ms Garrett has previously said in the years since her daughter's return to Italy that the girls were unhappy. 'They don't seem to be settling,' she said in 2013. 'I keep getting constant requests from them to come home.' Tara Brown said the girls loved Australia and missed it, but they were calmly getting on with their lives and planning their immediate futures in Italy.","Four sisters were at the centre of an international custody dispute .

"A Utah man was shocked to discover that his 'informal meeting' with a federal official to discuss veterans was actually with President Barack Obama. Last Friday, 26-year-old Lance Futch donned a white wrinkled polo shirt and drove to Hill Air Force Base in Utah thinking he was going to be led into an auditorium to talk about how to help veterans get more jobs in the infinitely abundant field of solar energy. Instead, Futch was sat at a table with Obama, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch,  congressman Rob Bishop, and Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker - all of whom were wearing suits and ties. Scroll down for video . Surprise!: Lance Futch (right) was shocked on Friday when his meeting with a Federal White House official about jobs for veterans turned out to be with President Obama . 'I was told that it was going to be an informal event — that it was going to be business casual,' Futch told The New York Post on Wednesday. 'If I had known it was my Commander-in-Chief, I definitely would have been wearing my blues,' said the National Guardsman, referring his dress uniform. Futch said he was shocked but honored when the senior official turned out to be Obama. 'That's just amazing,' said Futch, describing the experience. The White House had asked Lehi-based company Vivant Solar to send a representative with military affiliation to the base during Obama's visit last week. The company chose Futch, who designs solar cells and is serving his fourth year in the Utah Air National Guard. Kady Cooper of Vivant Solar told Daily Mail Online that the discussion lasted about 40 minutes and that Obama asked Futch specifically about solar energy as a career path for veterans. He told the president that it's a growing industry and a great opportunity for a stable career path after the military. 'We're always going to have a sun,' Futch told the AP on Wednesday. At the Hill Air Force Base, Obama announced the expansion of solar energy training programs from the current three military bases to a total of 10.

"This picture shows the dramatic moment a 'hero' police officer smashed a car window to save a  baby trapped in the vehicle on one of the hottest days of the year. The boy's mother frantically tried to open the door when the keys to her Range Rover were locked inside and the eight-month-old boy was stuck in the car alone as temperatures hit almost 23C yesterday. She grew increasingly distressed as the car became hotter - with no fresh air inside the vehicle - and called police for help. The incident occurred when temperatures peaked at 22.8C at St James's Park in London - making it the second hottest day of the year so far beaten only by today when temperatures soared in the capital to nearly 24C.

'Hero': Kingston Police published a photo of the incident on their Twitter account, along with a caption hailing PC Resteghini as a 'hero' Officers were called to the parked car in Surbiton, south-west London, at lunchtime yesterday and the baby was rescued after officer PC Resteghini smashed the car's window with his baton. Kingston  Police tweeted the picture along with the caption: 'PC Resteghini has just rescued an infant trapped inside a hot vehicle, smashing a window to gain access #hero'. Police confirmed the baby was unhurt. The baby's father told MailOnline there had been a fault with the Range Rover's automatic locking system and that the matter was being investigated. His wife had left the keys in her bag inside the vehicle, which the man, who did not wish to be named, said was designed not to lock if the keys are inside. He said: 'My wife had put our son into the car seat in the back and closed the door. When she did that it locked automatically and wouldn't open when she walked round to the driver's side. 'She was extremely panicked so called the police. They were fantastic and turned up in about five minutes. They tried for a while to get into the car, in the same way my wife had, but eventually had to smash the window.' Speaking to Radio Jackie News, PC Resteghini said: 'We used one of the batons to gain entry to the car...the baby was safe and well and the mother was OK.'

"Two Las Vegas parents have been arrested after a child's corpse was discovered in a car, a baby was found with severe malnutrition and a sheltered teenager was impregnated by her stepfather. Jondrew Lachaux, 39, and Kellie Phillips, 38, turned themselves in after the three children were found, North Las Vegas police said. They have been arrested and face child abuse charges, while Lachaux is also charged with concealing evidence after the toddler's badly decomposed body was found in the garage. A teenager is also being held on a child abuse charge. Arrested: Jondrew Lachaux (left) and Kellie Phillips (right) turned themselves in after the children were found . According to court documents, the man and woman took five of their children on a trip to Oakland, California, eight months ago. The couple left behind two daughters - a teen who is Phillips' biological child and Lachaux's stepdaughter and a sickly three-year-old toddler - in their suburban Las Vegas home because the rental vehicle was full. Authorities say Lachaux reportedly impregnated the teen, who gave birth at home without any medical care to a now four-month-old girl. She struggled to care for herself and her three-year-old sister who had medical problems while pregnant and home alone. But the teen said she was too scared to call for help even after the food and medication left by their mother ran out. 'The totality of evidence is leading investigators to believe she was almost a prisoner in her home, police Sergeant Chrissie Coon said. 'Fugitives can psychologically confine their victims without physically being present.' The case first unraveled on April 1 when the teen was seen at McCarran International Airport with a very sick baby. The infant was hospitalised in an extremely critical condition for severe malnutrition and hypothermia resulting from surviving on watered-down baby formula. In an interview with police, the teenager described the abuse at home in detail, claiming Lachaux raped her without her mother knowing. For the past five years, the family had lived in North Las Vegas, but the children rarely went outside and were home-schooled. The teen told police she has had braces on her teeth from five years ago but hadn't seen a dentist since. Jondrew Lachaux faces child abuse charges and concealing evidence after the toddler's badly decomposed body was found in the garage . The teen said her three-year-old sister apparently had trouble breathing and died. She called her parents for two weeks before Lachaux called back to learn of the death. She said in late March her stepfather came home to hide her sister's corpse and then kicked her out of the house in fear that her mother would find out about the pregnancy. Lachaux and the teen apparently hid the badly decomposed body in the back seat of a broken-down Mercedes in the garage. The corpse was concealed in a box surrounded by blankets, plastic bags and pizza boxes, according to court records. The coroner's office said it has not yet positively identified the body or the cause of death. The teenager was homeless for a few days, staying in public places including the airport and on the Las Vegas Strip. She is now being held in juvenile detention on a child abuse charge. The other five children - aged one, four, seven, eight and nine - were found with Phillips in good health and have been put in protective custody.

"The father of two British jihadis who were killed while fighting in Syria has left the UK and travelled to Libya in a bid to find his eldest son and bring him home. Abubaker Deghayes, 46, has left his home in Brighton in an attempt to rescue his son Amer, who travelled to the Middle East in January last year. The 21-year-old has been fighting for the organisation Jabhat al-Nusra, a group affiliated with al-Qaeda, who are battling the Islamic State and Syrian forces. Abubaker Deghayes, whose two sons died while fighting in Syria. He has now left his home in Brighton to travel to the Middle East to bring home his remaining son Amer, who is also in Syria . Mr Deghayes eldest son Amer, who is fighting for the Jabhat al-Nusra, a group affiliated with al-Qaeda, who are battling the Islamic State and Syrian forces. He has not been in contact with his father . Mr Deghayes two younger sons were killed fighting Syrian government forces in two separate incidents last year. Abdullah, 18, was killed last April after suffering a bullet wound to his stomach and Jaffar, 17, was reported dead six months later after being shot in the head during a battle in Aleppo. And after not hearing from Amer, who is also in Syria, for nearly four weeks, he says he is on his way to the country to rescue his son. Mr Deghayes has insisted he has not 'run away' to join the fight and has informed British authorities of his intentions to rescue his last-remaining son. It is believed he is with his brother Omar Deghayes, with the pair currently in Tripoli, the capital of Libya, after travelling via Italy and Tunisia. Omar was previously held by the US as an enemy combatant at the notorious Guantanamo Bay detention centre between 2002 and 2007, but was released without charge. Speaking from Libya, Mr Deghayes said: 'I am in Tripoli at the moment in Libya. 'It looks and sounds like I have run away from the authorities but I didn't leave until I informed them, through my lawyers, what I was intending to do. 'I will go and try to bring Amer home. I told people that I have been going to Syria long before the government started to change its stance on people going out there.' Mr Deghayes younger sons Abdullah, left, and Jaffar, right, who were both killed in separate incidents while fighting in Syria . Jaffar Deghayes was spotted leaving Gatwick Airport for Syria with three other men from the Portsmouth area . Mr Deghayes found out that his first son, Abdullah, had died in Syria when his eldest son Amer called him and told him . It is not the first time he has pleaded with his sons to come home, and he once travelled to Turkey and met Jaffar and Abdullah to try and stop them from entering Syria, but failed. His dramatic rescue could also be in vain as in November Amer said he wouldn't come back to the UK until 'all Muslim lands are liberated' and that jihad was 'not for tasters.' Mr Deghayes also insisted that he could have easily joined the fighting if he wanted to, but chose not to because he disagrees with war. He added: 'If I wanted to join the fighting, I could have done so easily. But out of personal belief and nature, and not the government, I haven't. I don't like wars and bloodshed. 'I am fine and all is well. I shall be back in Brighton soon.' Mr Deghayes is a trustee of a local mosque in East Sussex, and is a controversial figure, who once said a suicide attack on Tony Blair could be morally justified. He was secretly recorded at a mosque in 2006 branding the then prime minister and US president George W Bush ‘legitimate targets’. He previously insisted that his three sons were not 'terrorists' but had travelled to Syria to defend 'those who are weak'. Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) followed soon after . The Deghayes brothers while they were young. Their family insist they went to Syria to help the weak . He said his sons had been 'stubborn' about travelling to Syria after seeing videos of the atrocities online. In a film released last year, Amer said he had no intention of returning to Britain, adding: ‘My work here is not done. I came here to give victory to the people and make sure that they receive justice, and we still haven't reached the goal yet.’ He added: ‘I'm in the Syrian civil war because I believe it's my duty to fight here ...The Muslim nation is like one body. If one part complains, the other parts react, so I don't see it as a Syrian conflict. I see it as an Islamic conflict.’ Since Amer travelled to Syria, he has been in regular contact with his father and mother Einas Abulsayen via Skype. It was during two such phonecalls that be broke the news that his brothers had been killed. The first call came in April. Speaking about Abdullah's death at the time, Mr Deghayes said: 'Amer told me Abdullah advanced into territory of the Syrian army then a sniper shot him in the chest. Mr Deghayes is believed to have travelled to Libya with his brother Omar, pictured, who was previously held by the US as an enemy combatant at the notorious Guantanamo Bay detention centre . 'He fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed. You feel he died a good death as a Muslim. As a martyr, he goes to paradise. But at the same time you feel sad for the loss.' Meanwhile when Jaffar died six months later, he added: 'Amer sent me a message via the internet. All I know is that (Jaffar) was fighting against Assad and was killed in battle. ‘I don't know much else. I can only hope and pray to God to accept him and have mercy on him.’ The Brighton father's attempt to rescue his son comes as reports suggested a 17-year-old girl from Brighton was stopped at Gatwick Airport, West Sussex, on suspicion of attempting to join jihadis in Syria. The teenager is described as a close friend of the Deghayes family. Sussex Police have urged members of the public with concerns or information about anyone planning to travel to Syria to contact them. The force said in a statement: 'The Government advice continues to be that no one should travel to these war zones and that the most effective way to help the affected population is through humanitarian support.'","Abubaker Deghayes has left Brighton to go and rescue his eldest son Amer .

"The Ukip candidate exposed by The Mail on Sunday after calling for all immigrants to be sent home is at the centre of a row over claims she falsely said her son was injured in Afghanistan. Victoria Ayling, who is running for the key election seat of Great Grimsby, made the comments after being confronted by her local party over her non-attendance at Ukip meetings. After saying it was because she had spent ‘five months nursing her son back to health after being blown up in Afghanistan’, Lieutenant Colonel Ron Shepherd, the leader of Ukip’s North East Lincolnshire group, launched an investigation. Scroll down for video . Row: UKIP politician Victoria Ayling, with party leader Nigel Farage, who is being questioned over claims about son . Astonishingly, he has raised questions about whether she has misrepresented her son’s situation. Mrs Ayling denies that is the case. It is the latest controversy to hit the 55-year-old, who in 2013 was caught on camera calling for all immigrants to be repatriated, saying: ‘I just want to send the lot back.’ She claimed her remarks had been taken ‘out of context’. Mrs Ayling fought Great Grimsby at the 2010 Election as a Tory, coming within 714 votes of a shock victory against Labour veteran Austin Mitchell, who is now standing down. The seat is high on Ukip leader Nigel Farage’s hitlist. Controversy: Victoria Ayling on front page of Mail on Sunday . Lieut-Col Shepherd set out his findings in a memo dated Monday December 8, which read: ‘I understand her son Anthony Bowles is stationed in Woolwich as part of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment. I have spoken with the Adjutant of 1 RA who cannot release details to me. Anthony’s grandmother Brenda has stated he’s not been blown up.’ Shortly afterwards, Mrs Ayling was confronted by local Ukip councillor Matt Stinson about whether her son had been injured. The incident took place at a meeting attended by David Soutter, whose job is to vet Ukip candidates. Mrs Ayling fought back, saying: ‘It is a private matter and nothing to do with you, Matt. My son had problems in Afghanistan and is recovered and back in service. ‘If anybody in the Army is giving out mistruths or anything about my son I want to know their name – they have got no right to talk about another soldier’s private life.’ Last night, this newspaper was called anonymously by a man who said he was a soldier who had served alongside Mr Bowles. The unidentified caller said Ukip’s Grimsby party had been unfair to Mrs Ayling – because she had kept the matter quiet to protect her son. He added Mr Bowles had been caught up in a ‘very bad situation’, which he declined to describe. Lieut-Col Shepherd said last night: ‘You’ll have to talk to Victoria about that.’ Mrs Ayling said: ‘This is a private matter.’ The MoD declined to comment.","Victoria Ayling said she spent five months nursing son back to health .

"The family of a North Carolina toddler who drowned in a pool last week went to set up an online fundraiser to help them with his funeral costs, only to discover that scammers have beat them to the punch. Four-year-old Austin West passed away last Saturday after he slipped while chasing a bumblebee in the backyard and fell into an in-ground pool at his family's home in Gastonia. Austin’s grandfather, Jeff West, says that when he attempted to launch a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to cover his grandson’s final expenses, he was shocked to find that there were already multiple pages carrying the deceased boy's name on the site. Family tragedy: Austin West, 4, pictured left and right with his mother, drowned in a pool April 6 while chasing a bumblebee in the yard . Preying on the weak: When the toddler's family went to set up a GoFundMe account to help raise money towards the funeral, they have discovered several unsanctioned fundraisers. This screen shot shows the real page set up by the Wests . ‘We had a big setback when phony GoFundMe accounts were set up before I made one, so I don't know just how many donated to these scams before the real GoFundMe page got set up,’ Mr West lamented to the station WBTV. ‘What people will do to make a buck off of a child.’ The fake fundraisers have since been deleted from GoFundMe.com, but West says the family are still in desperate financial straits and are in urgent need of donations. On Thursday, Austin's grandfather set up a genuine donation page hoping to collect $10,000. As of Friday evening, only $315 has been raised. A spokesperson for GoFundMe said in a statement that the company investigates every complaint of fraud it receives.

"A Paratrooper who braved heavy Taliban fire to rescue a wounded comrade received the Victoria Cross from the Queen yesterday. She told Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey: ‘I don’t get to give this one out very often. Did you ever imagine you’d be standing here? Well done.’ But in fact the 27-year-old is the second member of his family to receive the highest military decoration for valour – a cousin was given the honour 70 years ago. Scroll down for video . The Queen awards a Victoria Cross to Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey, who showed immense bravery by drawing enemy fire and helping his comrades before taking the fight to the Taliban in August 2013 . It is just the sixth time the Queen has given a VC to a living, British recipient during her reign . L/Cpl Leakey said he was 'uncomfortable' about being singled out ahead of others in his regiment and insisted the battle was 'just one job, one patrol out of multiple patrols' L/Cpl Leakey is only the sixth living British soldier the Queen has presented with his medal. He was invested in a ceremony at Windsor Castle. L/Cpl Leakey, of 1 Para, is the third British serviceman to receive the VC for bravery during the Afghanistan campaign but the other two awards were made posthumously. In 2013, he braved heavy gunfire from 20 Taliban insurgents in Helmand to rush to the aid of a wounded US Marine. He also took control of a machine gun post to begin the fightback, then ran down a barren hillside, dodging a hail of bullets, picked up another machine gun and continued the battle in which 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. According to the official citation, L/Cpl Leakey, who is single and from Hampshire, showed ‘complete disregard for his own safety’ as his unit came under attack for around an hour. The Paratrooper shared a brief exchange with the Queen as he was awarded the honour at Windsor Castle. He said the Queen told him: 'I don't get to give this one out very often' Special medal: The VC can be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy . Lance Corporal Leakey showed 'complete disregard' for his own safety during the firefight in August 2013 . It added: ‘Displaying gritty leadership well above that expected of his rank, Lance Corporal Leakey’s actions single-handedly regained the initiative and prevented considerable loss of life, allowing a wounded officer to be evacuated.’ Speaking after the investiture, L/Cpl Leakey said: ‘It’s such a great honour and massively humbling to be put among all those people who have received the VC in the past. ‘My family are very proud and happy but the lads in the battalion know this isn’t something you seek out. ‘You just do what you deem necessary on the day and any one of them could be standing where I am today. ‘It’s great for my family, my friends, my regiment – but it does for me highlight the sacrifice everyone’s made in Afghan, not just in terms of the loss of life and limbs but people going away for months on end.’ His parents, Rosemary and Mark Leakey, who saw him receive his medal from the Queen, said: ‘It’s been a very emotional, a very moving occasion. 'We’re just so delighted that Josh is here in one piece to receive the honour with his family and all the Paras, especially when you hear that so many VCs are awarded posthumously. ‘We were particularly pleased his grandparents were able to be here too – three generations together and representing all three services: Royal Navy with his grandfather, RAF father and Josh the Army.’ Emotional: Lance Corporal Leakey being hugged by Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter (right), after he was named as being awarded the VC at Lancaster House in London in February . L/Cpl Leakey is the second member of his family to receive the award, following his second cousin twice removed, Nigel Leakey (right), who fought in the Second World War . Proud family: (L-R) Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey's uncle Lieutenant General David Leakey, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, alongside his brother Ben, mother Rosie and father Mark in Westminster . The wounded US Marine who L/Cpl Leakey rescued described how the Para ran through a hail of machine gunfire to save him. Captain Brandon Bocian said: ‘I hadn’t met L/Cpl Leakey prior to that day but am grateful for his actions. The fact that he chose to leave his position to help me speaks of his courage and character. I am happy to hear that he is being formally recognised.’ L/Cpl Leakey’s distant cousin Sergeant Nigel Gray Leakey received the VC posthumously for his gallantry in an attack on Italian tanks in East Africa in 1941. The 28-year-old, who was serving in the King’s African Rifles, leapt on a tank, wrenched open the turret and shot dead the crew but was killed trying to repeat the feat on another tank. Born in Kenya, he was the son of Arundell Gray Leakey – a cousin of Louis Leakey, the prominent Kenyan archaeologist. According to the official citation, the 1 Para hero showed 'complete disregard for his own safety' as the force came under attack from around 20 insurgents armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in Helmand province. The firefight lasted for around an hour. 'Displaying gritty leadership well above that expected of his rank, Lance Corporal Leakey's actions single-handedly regained the initiative and prevented considerable loss of life, allowing a wounded officer to be evacuated,' the citation said. A US Marine Corps captain was shot and wounded and the force's communications had gone down. First, Lance Corporal Leakey dashed across a barren hillside which was being raked with enemy fire and undeterred by the 'very clear and present danger', he gave first aid to the wounded officer. But with the 'snap and crack' of enemy fire all around him, he realised that two of his group's machine gun teams had been surrounded.

Despite being the most junior member of the force he took control of the situation and began the casualty evacuation. He went back up the hill and took control of one of the machine guns – with bullets ricocheting off the gun's frame – before running down again, drawing enemy fire. His 'courageous' action spurred those around him to fight back with renewed ferocity. But the firefight continued. Lance Corporal Leakey, 'with the full knowledge of the dangers', exposed himself to Taliban fire once more. Weighed down with 60lb of equipment, he ran to the bottom of the hill, picked up a second machine gun and climbed back up the hill. Drawing the majority of enemy fire, with rounds flying past his head, he opened fire. Then he handed over the machine gun to a comrade and supervised the evacuation of the wounded officer. During the battle 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. The Marine officer made a full recovery.","Joshua Leakey receives sixth VC Queen has given to a living UK recipient .

"The family rift in France’s National Front deepened yesterday after founder Jean-Marie Le Pen pulled out of regional elections – but said his granddaughter should stand in his place. The 86-year-old’s announcement came after he infuriated his daughter Marine, the far-right party’s current leader, with a series of racist and anti-Semitic remarks last week. Mr Le Pen had repeated his claim that the Holocaust - in which the Nazis murdered six million Jews - was ‘a detail of history’ and had also praised France’s wartime leader Marshal Petain, who collaborated with Hitler. Keeping it in the family: National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, 86, right,  angered daughter Marine, 46, and now wants granddaughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, to replace him in the regional elections . Next generation: Shortly after her grandfather's comments, Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, pictured with Le Pen in 2012, confirmed that she would seek the party’s nomination . His 46-year-old daughter had reacted furiously to the outburst, saying she would oppose his candidacy in regional elections in December and accusing him of ‘political suicide’. Now party founder Le Pen has told French publication Le Figaro that he will not stand in the south-east Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur region ‘even though I think I am the best candidate’. He said it was because the party was at risk of being ‘dangerously weakened’ over what he called a severe but unjustified crisis over his comments. The former paratrooper, who remains the Front’s honorary president and will retain his seat in the European Parliament, said: ‘If I must make a sacrifice for the future of the movement, I would not be the one to cause it damage,’ Mr Le Pen said the best replacement candidate would be his grand-daughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, who confirmed shortly after that she would seek the party’s nomination. Family feud: National Front leader Marine accused her father of 'political suicide' after he called the Holocaust ‘a detail of history’ and had also praised France’s wartime leader Marshal Petain . Mr Le Pen told the magazine: ‘If she accepts, I think she would head a very good list (of candidates). She is certainly the best, I am not going to say after me, but she is.’ His granddaughter is seen as more socially conservative than her aunt. Unlike Marine, Marion was firmly against a 2013 law permitting same-sex marriage in France. Asked if he felt betrayed by his daughter, Mr Le Pen told Le Figaro Magazine: ‘Betrayed would be going a bit far, but let’s say I’m disappointed.’ A top party official, Florian Philippot, said on i-Tele television that Le Pen had discussed the decision with party leadership. By standing down, Mr Le Pen avoids possible formal exclusion as a candidate on Friday, when the National Front’s political bureau meets to designate who will run in the December election. Opinion polls see Marine Le Pen as likely to make it to the second round of 2017 presidential elections but not win.","National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen pulls out of regional elections .

"An Oregon lawmaker proposed legislation Monday creating uniform standards for hand dryers in public restrooms. The bill says that the recent proliferation of powerful dryers is efficient, but can sometimes trigger ringing of in the ears, or cause discomfort for people with development or sensory disabilities. The measure would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that is about as loud as a school cafeteria. A measure proposed to the Oregon legislature would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels, about as loud as a school cafeteria. (File photo) It also wouldn't allow hand dryers blowing air downwards to blow air faster than 115 mph, in case the hand-dryer manufacturer doesn't label the decibel level. Bill sponsor Democratic Sen. Chris Edwards told the Senate Committee on Business and Transportation that the new generation of hand dryers used to elicit episodes in his autistic son, who would cry and cover his ears when he heard them. It's not the hand-dryer motor that's too loud, Edwards said, it's the 'air knife' against the hand that can cause a sharp, shrill sound. 'I almost didn't bring this bill because this is not the most consequential bill of the legislative session. We all know that,' Edwards said. Democratic Senator Chris Edwards (left) sponsored the bill after his autistic son had episodes after hearing loud hand dryers. Republican senator Chuck Thomsen (right) says he prefers paper hand drying . 'But nonetheless there are those of us that just find these hand dryers to be extraordinarily obnoxious and disruptive to family members.' The bill would also 'requires downward blowing hand dryer to not blow air at an air velocity that exceeds 115 miles per hour'. High-speed, efficient new hand dryers, such as the Dyson Airblade or the Excel Xlerator, are fast replacing the old models, which often left hands still dripping wet. Still, there are some who would prefer if hand dryers were a thing of the past altogether. 'The new ones are faster, but I still would ban them all and go back to paper,' said Republican Sen. Chuck Thomsen of Hood River. The bill, SB 488, is scheduled for a hearing on Wednesday.","Bill would require all new dryers to be no louder than 84 decibels .

"As California struggles with a devastating drought, huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta — and the prime suspects are farmers whose families have tilled fertile soil there for generations. A state investigation was launched following complaints from two large agencies that supply water to arid farmland in the Central Valley and to millions of residents as far south as San Diego. Delta farmers don't deny using as much water as they need. But they say they're not stealing it because their history of living at the water's edge gives them that right. Still, they have been asked to report how much water they're pumping and to prove their legal rights to it. Scroll down for video . Drought: In this photo taken Friday March 27, 2015, low-flow water emitter sits on some of the dry, cracked ground of farmer Rudy Mussi's  almond orchard in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta near Stockton, California . Resources: Rudy Mussi watches his grandson, Lorenzo, 20 months, tries to turn a water valve on his almond orchard  in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (March 2015 file photo) At issue is California's century-old water rights system that has been based on self-reporting and little oversight, historically giving senior water rights holders the ability to use as much water as they need, even in drought. Gov. Jerry Brown has said that if drought continues this system built into California's legal framework will probably need to be examined. Delta farmer Rudy Mussi says he has senior water rights, putting him in line ahead of those with lower ranking, or junior, water rights. 'If there's surplus water, hey, I don't mind sharing it,' Mussi said. 'I don't want anybody with junior water rights leapfrogging my senior water rights just because they have more money and more political clout.' The fight pitting farmer against farmer is playing out in the Delta, the hub of the state's water system. With no indication of the drought easing, heightened attention is being placed on dwindling water throughout the state, which produces nearly half of the fruits, nuts and vegetables grown in the U.S. A large inland estuary east of San Francisco, the Delta is fed by rivers of freshwater flowing down from the Sierra Nevada and northern mountain ranges. Located at sea level, it consists of large tracts of farmland separated by rivers that are subject to tidal ebbs and flows. Most of the freshwater washes out to the Pacific Ocean through the San Francisco Bay. Some is pumped — or diverted — by Delta farmers to irrigate their crops, and some is sent south though canals to Central Valley farmers and to 25 million people statewide. The drought now in its fourth year has put Delta water under close scrutiny. Twice last year state officials feared salty bay water was backing up into the Delta, threatening water quality. There was not enough fresh water to keep out saltwater. Mussi, a second-generation Delta farmer, said Central Valley farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater . In June, the state released water stored for farmers and communities from Lake Oroville to combat the saltwater intrusion. Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Water Resources, said 'thousands of acre-feet of water a day for a couple of weeks' were released into the Delta. An acre-foot is roughly enough water to supply a household of four for a year. The fact that the state had to resort to using so much from storage raised questions about where the water was going. That in turn prompted a joint letter by the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation calling for an investigation into how much water Delta farmers are taking — and whether the amount exceeds their rights to it. 'We don't know if there were illegal diversions going on at this time,' said Vogel, leaving it up to officials at the State Water Resources Control Board to determine. 'Right now, a large information gap exists.' Some 450 farmers who hold 1,061 water rights in the Delta and the Sacramento and San Joaquin river watersheds were told to report their water diversions, and Katherine Mrowka, state water board enforcement manager, said a vast majority responded. State officials are sorting through the information that will help them determine whether any are exceeding their water rights and who should be subject to restrictions. 'In this drought period, water accounting is more important to ensure that the water is being used for its intended purpose,' said U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spokesman Louis Moore. Mussi, a second-generation Delta farmer whose family grows tomatoes, wheat, corn, grapes and almonds on 4,500 acres west of Stockton, said Central Valley farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater. 'All of a sudden they're trying to turn their water into a permanent system and ours temporary,' Mussi said. 'It's just not going to work.' Shawn Coburn farms 1,500 acres along the San Joaquin River in Firebaugh about 100 miles south of the Delta. As a senior rights holder, he figures he will receive 45 percent or less of the water he expected from the federal water project. On another 1,500 acres where he is a junior water rights holder, he will receive no surface water for a second consecutive year. 'I don't like to pick on other farmers, even if it wasn't a drought year,' said Coburn. 'The only difference is I don't have a pipe in the Delta I can suck willy-nilly whenever I want.'","As California struggles with a devastating drought, huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta .

"Edwin 'Jock' Mee, (pictured outside court at an earlier hearing) allegedly targeted 11 cadets as young as 15, during the army interview process . An army recruitment sergeant got a teenage cadet pregnant after raping her during a campaign of abuse against female recruits, a court heard today. Edwin 'Jock' Mee, 45, allegedly targeted 11 cadets, aged between 15 and 25, on a military base in Croydon, south London, during the army interview and screening process. Southwark Crown Court heard he had a preference for vulnerable black women born overseas, who he isolated and 'kept' to himself so he could sexually abuse them. Many of his vulnerable victims were threatened with deportation if they did not submit to his sexual demands. One of the women, a virgin in her early 20s, fell pregnant when Mee raped her in a locked waiting room, jurors were told. She was in the UK on a student visa and Mee told her she needed to renew her passport and asked if she worked as a prostitute in the UK, jurors heard. He became 'aggressive' and looked down her top and rubbed her thigh while she was taking a test, it was claimed. After raping her, Mee told her she was a 'sweet child', jurors heard. Doctors found that she had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy for which she was operated on after collapsing in hospital. When she called Mee to explain what had happened, he allegedly replied 'I thought you were safe' and never spoke to her again. On another occasion he raped a 19-year-old from Sierra Leone after asking her for sex on the basis that he would get her a passport in return. 'He pressurised her to the extent that she felt she would be compelled to submit to his demands,' Rosina Cottage QC said in opening the case to the jury. 'He told her that she had control over her status in the country.' Mee raped her, before forcing her to perform a sex act on him, it was said. 'He told her that if she said anything, no one would listen to her, she would not have a job, she would have nothing,' Miss Cottage said. The divorced father-of-five denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration, which are said to have happened between October 2010 and September 2011. Mee, formerly of Croydon but who now lives in Glasgow, wore his grey hair in a pony tail and dressed in a smart suit and tie as he listened intently while Miss Cottage opened the case. She said the attacks had been an 'abuse of trust and power by this defendant in order to bully and groom young women'. He would 'gauge their vulnerability' and speak to the women about sex, touch them and in the most serious instances rape those over whom he had established control, Miss Cottage said. She added: 'A number of the complainants in this case were young black women, born outside the United Kingdom. 'Whether the defendant believed that this gave them a vulnerability in relation to their immigration status, or gave him an excuse to pretend that he had some power over them, the inference that the prosecution say can be drawn is that he deliberately targeted these young women.' She told the court Mee, known to many as 'Jock', was employed as a recruiting Sergeant with the British Army at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office (ACIO) in Croydon. 'His job was to screen cadet applications, interview those applicants and support their application through the process of attaining certain fitness levels and tests,' she said. 'Each of the complainants in this case was a cadet whose application was in the charge of this defendant.' She explained that the interview involves a three-part process, starting with a meet and greet, then a more personal interview with questions about family circumstances, motivation and commitment. The third interview, known as a confirmation interview, should be conducted by a different person from the first two, but the Scottish officer ignored the system, jurors heard. 'Each of the complainants seems to have been kept by him, to himself. Every interview, every appointment,' said Ms Cottage. One girl was just 16 when Mee allegedly slapped her bottom and when she said she didn't like it he told her: 'It's you who needs the army'. Ms Cottage said: 'Initially he appeared professional, but then started to talk about his wife and telling her about personal matters. The divorced father-of-five (pictured leaving court yesterday) denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration, which are said to have happened between  2010 and 2011 . 'He then wanted to ask her about her private life and whether she had a boyfriend. He asked her if she had body piercings and asked to see the piercing in her stomach area. 'She told him she was uncomfortable with this line of conversation and then he asked her if she would go and have a coffee with him. 'After she left she had a call from the defendant on a mobile phone asking her whether she had thought about his offer of coffee.' A week later the girl returned to the office to book the British Army Recruitment Battery - a computer based test and it was then that he allegedly slapped her bottom. The woman decided not to pursue a career in the Army 'because of the defendant's behaviour'. Giving evidence behind a curtain, she told the court that Mee explained during their first meeting that his wife had cheated on him. Another of the complainants broke down in tears as she gave evidence where she claimed that Mee 'made a joke' about her quiff hairstyle during a visit  to the recruitment centre with her mother. Jurors were told Mee had a preference for vulnerable black women born overseas, who he  'kept' to himself so he could sexually abuse them . She explained to the court from behind a screen that during her first meeting with the sergeant, when she was around 19, after she applied to join the army online and was invited for an interview with Mee in 2011. He allegedly asked if she would date people of other races because the Army 'doesn't stand for racism'. On another visit, her mother told the recruitment officer that she was 'worried' about her daughter joining the Armed Forces. Sobbing, the witness, who is now 23, told the court that Mee had replied jokingly, and added: 'He said that I would attract the Taliban with my hair.' Under cross-examination by Lisa Wilding QC, for the defence, she later admitted that the sergeant had joked instead that she would 'scare the Taliban off' with her hair. On a separate occasion, the complainant went to the centre to carry out some physical training, which she admitted struggling with, and Mee asked her into his office. He ordered her to do some sit ups while he held her ankles, it was said. 'I lay down, he held my ankles and I did some sit ups,' she said. 'I didn't want to do it and he was like, reassuring me because I had a skirt on.' She only managed 10 sit ups and Mee told her to attend a training session the following Thursday. The witness, who said she was the only woman, added: 'After the session finished we went back to his office, he said I needed to practice more and improve my fitness. 'When I was leaving he hit my bum when I was walking out the door. I was quite shocked, I didn't know what was going on. I just wanted to go and I did.' Later she claimed to have contacted Mee to say that she had decided not to join the Army because of the 'physical aspect of it'. She said she did not tell anyone about the smack on the bottom until police sent a letter to her house. Asked why she had not spoken about the incident with her mother, she said she was 'kind of embarrassed'. The Scotsman listened to the evidence of his alleged victims with the aid of a hearing loop. Ms Cottage said: 'This is a pattern of sexual, bullying behaviour that was repeated again and again to the female cadets to make them feel that he had power over them and control over their future.' He was British Army recruiting sergeant at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon (pictured) in the Careers and Information Office . The youngest alleged victim was just 15 when she went several times to the recruitment office. He asked her for a date and tried to kiss her on the lips in a corridor, but she turned away and he 'got her on the cheek', the court heard. On Thursday afternoons there were fitness assessments at Croydon Athletics Arena for up to 30 cadets supervised by two staff members, it was said. A number of Mee's alleged victims attended the regular Thursday training sessions, the court heard. Ms Cottage said: 'Sergeant Mee regularly stayed the latest of all the officers. The ACIO is closed to members of the public at the weekends, but occasionally the defendant was seen on the premises at weekends. 'A fellow officer, Stuart Conroy noticed he would conduct interviews with applicants out of hours and particularly remembers the defendant interviewing a young woman who Sergeant Conroy had interviewed earlier in the day,' she said. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The trial, which is expected to run for six to eight weeks, continues.

"A mum  has come under fire for sending out invitations to her son's first birthday in which she lists very specific requests for the boy - including some rather large and pricy gifts. The unnamed woman, whose email was shared by a recipient yesterday on Reddit, demands a $63.99 water table from WalMart, a $19.99 play tent, a $14.99 play tunnel from Ikea, and a $7.99 Cheerios book, writing: 'If you are unable to get these items, please let us know so we can buy them right away for him.' She even goes as far as to require that her guests include a receipt with their gifts so that she can get the full value back if she needs to return them. A mum has come under fire for sending out invitations to her son's first birthday in which she lists very specific requests - including some quite large and expensive gifts. The invite was shared on Reddit . The recipient of the email, who deleted the child's name from the email, labelled the post 'Most demanding 1st birthday invite ever', sparking an online backlash against the pushy mum. The invitation reads: 'When we return items without receipts, we only get about 50% of the value, so it's like throwing away money if you don't include a receipt with the gifts. 'With formula costing us $80 a week, it is always nice to be able to return items that he doesn't need to get formula instead.' She assigns specific presents to each member of the family, explaining: 'I provided my mom and sister-in-law [retracted] with a list of 4 other items that [retracted] would like for his birthday so that they can buy from their list and avoid duplication. 'We're asking for gifts only from grandparents and the direct aunt/uncle for [retracted]'s birthday party, and similar to Christmas, would like to restrict it to 2 items total per household.' The mother also asks that the gifts do not have her son's name on them, claiming that personalised goods attract kidnappers. The letter reads: 'Please refrain from any personalized gifts that would be used outside of the house. 'Clothing with names is the #1 thing that leads to kidnapping, so we don't need to broadcast [retracted]'s name on clothing or toys.' The mother requests guests buy this play tunnel and this tent from Ikea . THE ONLY OPTION THAT WILL DO: The mom also very specifically requests this water table from Walmart because of how the water drains . The mother demands receipts for each gift so she can get the full value back if she returns them, and asks that the gifts do not have her son's name on them, claiming that personalised goods attract kidnappers . And she adds that her son does not need any more books than he already has. 'Right now, [retracted] has 32 board books on his shelf, and 25 additional books waiting for him in storage once he is 3+ years of age. (And at this point, he hates when we try reading to him,) she says. The mother concludes the letter: 'Please let us know if you have any questions about any items not on this list that you are considering purchasing and we can let you know if we already have it or if it is in storage waiting for him. 'By the way, a formal invite from [retracted] will be arriving in your mailboxes soon...' The email has been viewed more than a million times on Reddit, with web users voicing their outrage in the comments section. One person said: 'This child is going to be a spoiled f****** nightmare as an adult.' Another commented on the mum's knack for sucking the fun out of what should be a celebratory occasion, writing: 'Why is this written in the format of a company memo that is demanding harsh behavioral changes from its staff?' Frageeelay wrote: 'I would buy the loudest nosiest toy possible and give it to the kid.' A user called Frenchbloke said: 'If she was my relative, I'd just get her an Amazon gift card (assuming I'd show up to the birthday party at all). 'If the mother doesn't want to keep up with the pretense of a birthday party, then that means I don't have to either.' Lmfoley79 commented: 'Whoever wrote that has absolutely NO social skills. 'Clearly they have no ability whatsoever to analyze their own actions and predict the reactions of others, whether spoken or unspoken.' Others were confounded by the mother's aversion to personalised presents, with one sceptic writing: 'Personalized stuff increases your chances of being kidnapped? I've never heard of this. Is it because strangers know your name?' Reactions have been equally heated on Twitter, where a commenter named Bill Roehl wrote sarcastically: 'I bet these people are fun at parties.' Another critic tweeted that the lengthy email was the 'perfect example of the problem with parents today.' And Twitter user Marie C Hogg said: 'Number of guests likely to attend this birthday party? Zero.'","Mum's email invite to her son's first birthday was shared on Reddit .

"Angels slugger Josh Hamilton filed for divorce from his wife two months ago - around the same time he admitted to an alcohol and drugs relapse, it has emerged. The divorce petition was filed in late February in Tarrant County, Texas, where Hamilton played five seasons with the Texas Rangers before moving to LA, the Dallas Morning News reported. Hamilton, 33, married his wife Katie in 2004. Katie, who will appear on the 10th season of The Real Housewives of Orange County when it airs this summer, has a daughter from a previous relationship and three more daughters with Hamilton. The petition doesn't detail the reasons for the split and only cites 'conflict'. Scroll down for video . Split: Josh Hamilton filed for divorce from his wife, Katie, in late February, it has emerged. The filing comes after his self-reported relapse and just months after they celebrated 10 years together (pictured) Loved up: When he shared the above photo in November, he gushed about how much he loved his wife . In the petition, Hamilton outlined 34 requests. Among them, he called for his wife to be banned from using his Maserati and 1972 Chevrolet Blazer, the Dallas Morning News reported. He also requested she be prohibited from 'hiding' the children from him, from allowing men to stay the night while his children are home, and from making disparaging remarks about him or his family. But in March, Mrs Hamilton submitted a general denial to her husband's petition and this month, the couple agreed not to communicate with each other throughout the case. Hamilton is not allowed to see his children without supervision, according to court records. He is also banned from going to the couple's properties in Westlake Texas; Newport Coast, California; and Valley Mills, Texas. Last week, the couple's six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home in Newport Coast went on the market for $16.5 million. The property has ocean views, an eight-car garage and a pool and spa, according to the listing. Family: The couple has four daughters, including a 14-year-old (right) from Katie's former relationship. Hamilton is now not allowed to see the girls without supervision, according to court records . Split: The couple, pictured last year, have not listed the reasons behind their divorce, citing only 'conflict' Katie Hamilton, pictured with her oldest daughter, Julia, will appear on the upcoming 10th season of the Real Housewives of Orange County. She has custody of the couple's four daughters . The divorce petition comes just months after the couple celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary and Hamilton gushed about his wife on social media. '10 years ago today, I said ""I do"",' he wrote on his Twitter page on November 10 as he shared a photo of him and his wife. 'There are no words to describe how much I love and adore this lady.' Earlier this year, Hamilton, a former Major League Baseball Most Valued Player, underwent shoulder surgery before spring training for the LA Angels. He then self-reported that he had suffered a cocaine and alcohol relapse - the latest incident in his well-documented history of substance abuse. Hamilton was suspended for three seasons between 2003 and 2005 and was ordered to undergo regular drug testing when he was reinstated into baseball in 2005. After his recent relapse, Major League Baseball officials said Hamilton had violated his treatment program, but the players' association disagreed so an arbitrator was called to make a decision. Uncertain future: Hamilton, pictured in October 2014, signed with the LA Angels in 2012 but self-reported a substance abuse relapse earlier this year. He will not be disciplined but may not return to the team . Without divulging reasons, the arbitrator ruled that Hamilton did not violate terms of the agreement, and the player will not be disciplined for the relapse. After overcoming his early addiction problems, Hamilton played for the Texas Rangers between 2008 and 2012 and was named the AL MVP in 2010. During that time, he had two public relapses, including one before the 2012 season. In 2012, he signed a five-year, $125 million contract with the Angels, but owner Arte Moreno last week said he could not guarantee Hamilton will return to play for the team. He claimed that Hamilton's contract said the deal could be terminated if he relapsed. The Dallas Morning News reported that he was not assigned a locker during spring training and merchandise with his name on has been removed from the team's stadium store.","Josh Hamilton, 33, filed for divorce from his wife Katie in February - around the time he self-reported a cocaine and alcohol relapse .

"Former Cuban president Fidel Castro has appeared in public for the first time in more than a year, his first since his country reached a landmark agreement with the US to reestablish ties. The state-run Cubadebate website says Castro greeted a group of Venezuelans visiting the capital of Havana. Cubadebate on Friday published four images that show Castro sitting inside a bus, each with a different person stretching an arm through the window to shake his hand. Images of Fidel Castro meeting with Venezuelan visitors to Havana were reported in Cuban media on Friday, though the encounters were said to take place on Monday . The meetings, with photos taken inside Castro's bus, are the former president's first public appearance since January 2014 . Castro's face is largely obscured by a dark-colored baseball cap. He sports longish gray hair and a beard. The website said the encounter occurred Monday, but did not explain the delay in publishing the photos. He is shown shaking hands, which Cubandebate said occurred 'for hours,' with Venezuelans in Havana who had come for solidarity events. Castro will turn 89 on Aug. 13. He was last seen in public at the inauguration of an artist's studio in January 2014. In February and March of this year, official Cuban media published photographs of Castro taken during private meetings with a Cuban student leader and with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. State media reports about the event said that Castro was 'full of vitality' and shook hands 'for hours' before going to a school . Castro, whose country has close ties with the leftist Venezuelan government, said that the South American country had become the target of 'imperial greed' Though Monday's reported appearance is his first in public since a landmark deal to reestablish ties between the US and Cuba, Castro met with spies released by the US in the agreement earlier this year . He also appeared with the Cuban agents who were freed from prison in December after a landmark agreement between the Obama administration and his brother Raul to reestablish ties between the island and the US. Fidel, older than his brother by five years, expressed skepticism about the deal, which includes plans for a US Embassy in Havana and has lessened travel restrictions. Cuban media said that Castro's meeting went off 'without the slightest of problems' and he urged his residents to write to Obama and urge him to stop saying that Venezuela y was a threat. It said that the former leader talked about how the South American country had become a target for 'imperial greed'. The American president signed sanctions against several Venezuelan officials earlier this year. Castro, whose recent public appearances often largely serve the function of proving that he is alive, was said to be 'full of vitality'. He also reportedly stopped and spoke at a school. The former revolutionary stepped aside temporarily as president due to serious illness in July 2006, and Raul took over permanently in February 2008 after he was elected the country's new leader. Fidel Castro took over Cuba after the fall of the Batista military dictatorship. Raul Castro (left) is five years younger than his brother and has taken over as president of Cuba.

"Chatting happily and smiling during a peaceful walk in the grounds of their Scottish country home, they could be any long-married couple enjoying a stroll. But this is the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall and the intimate shot marks not 40 years of marriage but 10. The couple, who married a decade ago  at the Windsor Guildhall, are spending their anniversary privately at Birkhall in Deeside. Scroll down for video . Portrait of a happy marriage: Charles and Camilla in the new photo released to mark their 10th anniversary . Big day: The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall on their wedding day a decade ago . Birkhall, which sits on the Queen's Balmoral estate, was the location for their honeymoon and was also the venue for their first anniversary celebrations. The new image, which is the work of top photographer Oliver Dann, was taken in the run-up to last month's visit to the U.S but was released by Clarence House today. In it, Charles wears a country coat made from Inveravon Estate Tweed and a matching hat by Lock & Co, while Camilla sports a hat by the same firm and a coat by Moncler. Charles and Camilla finally married following a relationship spanning 35 years in a relatively quiet civil ceremony at the Windsor Guildhall on the 9th April 2005. Despite fears that the couple would be booed - Camilla was reportedly so nervous that she had to be dragged out of bed - the ceremony went off without a hitch. Since then, the Duchess of Cornwall as she is now known, has become an integral part of the Royal Family - and would be cheerfully accepted as Charles' queen by 50 per cent of Britons. That marks a significant turnaround from the Duchess' earliest days as a royal, with Camilla following Charles' lead and often appearing nervous in front of photographers. But her enthusiastic championing of causes ranging from osteoporosis to sexual abuse survivors has not gone unnoticed and her relationship with the Queen is now said to be close. 'Her role has changed dramatically,' explains royal biographer Penny Junor. 'One minute she was a mistress and then she was an HRH. 'When she first married Charles she was very nervous. On her wedding day, she was terrified. She had no idea if she would be booed in the street. 'In fact, there was a very warm reception. The streets were packed in Windsor. She has slowly gained courage and confidence. Initially she was very much in the background, supporting the Prince and she still does that. 'She's never had any ambition for herself. She didn't want to be a princess or a duchess. She just happened to love a man who was the Prince of Wales and look at the fuss that caused. She doesn't want to be a star or be curtseyed to. Happy: The pair are all smiles as they arrive at the British ambassador's residence in Washington last month . Cheers! Charles and Camilla pictured enjoying a dram during a visit to Birkhall last summer . 'But slowly, slowly she has become much more involved in royal life and taken on an awful lot of charitable causes.' The Duchess is now patron or president of 85 charities, joint patron or president with the Prince of four, and is affiliated to a number of other organisations. Ms Junor added: 'It's really, really valued by those charities. She works extremely hard. Having been a woman who up to her mid-50s had been a wife and a mother and a country woman who enjoyed horses and dogs, she's completely reinvented herself and become an ambassador for the country.' In 2013, Camilla made her first ever appearance at the State Opening of Parliament wearing a glamorous champagne silk and lace Bruce Oldfield gown. The Duchess, whose presence was seen as a boost for Charles, topped that with the Queen Mother's priceless Boucheron tiara and the Dame Grand Cross of the Victoria Order sash. She returned for the 2014 state opening as well and is expected to return once again for this year's event.

Support: The Queen shares a carriage with Camilla during the Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 . One is amused: Camilla laughs with Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cornwall during the Diamond Jubilee . Similarly styled: The Duchess' dress sense has also evolved over the last 10 years and is much like her daughter-in-law's . The Duchess has also carried out joint engagements with the Queen and in November hosted a reception on behalf of the monarch for the Commonwealth Essay competition. During the Diamond Jubilee in 2012, the Queen and Camilla sat side-by-side in the ornate 1902 state landau - a step that would have been inconceivable a decade earlier. The Duke of Edinburgh had fallen ill and the Prince of Wales and Camilla stepped in to ride with the monarch in the carriage procession back to Buckingham Palace. But it was Camilla, not Charles who was seated next to the Jubilee Queen. She was present too on stage, standing next to the sovereign, as Charles paid tribute to his mother at the finale of a pop concert in front of the Palace. During the Golden Jubilee concert in 2002, prior to her marriage to the Prince, Camilla was seated several rows behind Charles. On Charles and Camilla's seventh wedding anniversary in 2012, the Queen made the Duchess a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) - a personal seal of approval from the monarch. 'I don't think that the Queen has ever had any personal animosity to Camilla. In the Eighties and Nineties when Charles and Diana were at each other's throats, Camilla was seen to be the cause and it threatened to destabilise the monarchy,' says Ms Junor. 'The Queen has always been fond of Camilla. She knew her for years and years, long before she was involved in the break up of the marriage.' She added: 'The Queen reacts to public opinion. Once the public were going to accept Camilla, the Queen was able to accept her publicly. 'They've got a great deal in common. They're mad about horses, dogs. They're country women.' When Camilla married Charles, aides insisted she did not want to be known as queen when the Prince acceded to the throne but intended to be known as princess consort instead. But according to some legal experts, unless there is change in the law, Camilla will technically become queen when Charles is king - no matter what she decides to call herself. At the time of her engagement to the Prince in 2005, a poll showed that only seven per cent of people believed Camilla should one day be queen. Happily married: Charles has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since his marriage . Close: The Duchess has always known how to make Charles laugh and he 'adores her' in return . Royal duties: With half of Britons supporting the idea, it is increasingly likely that Camilla will become queen . A decade later, half of all Britons say she should become queen when Charles takes the throne according to a poll by YouGov. A third think she should be given a lesser title out of sensitivity to Diana, Princess of Wales and 16 per cent were unsure. When the Prince was put on the spot and asked if Camilla would be his queen in an interview in November 2010, he replied: 'That's, that's, we'll see, won't we? That could be.' 'I think there's still a hard core of people out there who want nothing to do with Camilla and think she's the devil incarnate but the vast majority think she's a good thing,' adds Ms Junor. 'She is familiar now as any member of the Royal Family. She's a fixture. It would be very strange if she were not called queen. 'I think she will be embraced and think the public will have no problem with it whatsoever. Charles is hugely proud of her and she's so important to him. 'He adores her. He wants her by his side - that's an absolute given.' Born Camilla Rosemary Shand on the 17th July 1947, the Duchess of Cornwall's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones. The daughter of Major Bruce Middleton Hope Shand and his wife Rosalind, the Duchess was born in London but spent much of her childhood in Sussex along with her siblings, Annabel and Mark. According to her biographer Giles Brandreth, her upbringing, although not royal, was certainly a grand one. 'Camilla is often described as having had an ""Enid Blyton sort of Childhood"",' he writes. 'In fact, it was much grander than that. 'The Shands had position and they had help – help in the house, help in the garden, help with children. 'They were gentry. They opened their garden for the local Conservative Party Association summer fête. Enough said.' After a stint at a Swiss finishing school, Camilla burst onto the London social scene as a debutante on the 25th March 1965. But it wasn't all fun, with the future Duchess of Cornwall working as a secretary for a succession of London firms to pay for her Belgravia flat, which she shared with Lady Moyra Campbell. In the late 1960s, Camilla met the man who was to become her first husband, cavalry officer Andrew Parker-Bowles, with the couple dating off and on for several years - with Mr Parker-Bowles striking up a relationship with Princess Anne at one point. Camilla, meanwhile, had struck up a relationship with Prince Charles, who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971. When the couple split following an overseas posting for Charles in 1973, Camilla reconciled with Parker-Bowles and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year. Two children followed. Tom in 1974 and Laura in 1978. But it was her continuing relationship with Prince Charles that would come to define her, with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people. In 1992, claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when Diana: Her True Story was published, followed, a year later by the 'Camillagate' scandal. By 1995, both marriages had come to an end and Charles and Camilla were unofficially back together, with the future Duchess often seen attending events with the prince. Royal acceptance soon followed with the Queen making Camilla part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. A year later, the Duchess moved into Clarence House and on the 10th February 2005, Charles and Camilla's engagement was announced. The couple married just under two months later in Windsor, with Camilla taking the title of the Duchess of Cornwall.","Clarence House has released a new photo to mark 10th anniversary .

"An angry neighbour who stormed onto the catwalk at Sydney's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week while fashion designer Kym Ellery was taking her bow has compared the noise being made at the event to a jumbo jet. Maurice Thibaux, 67, caused quite a stir at Sunday night's opening show held at the Carriageworks in Eveleigh - in Sydney's inner city. The French native - who lives next door to the venue - crashed the stage to make a complaint about the noise, which he claims was 'similar to a jumbo jet taking off over your head'. Scroll down for video . Maurice Thibaux stormed the catwalk at Sydney's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week on Sunday night at the Carriageworks . Mr Thibaux said he had no problem with the music but the rumbling that came with it. 'I was watching TV and I use headphones, which are noise cancelling, so normally it cuts out all the noise. In fact I can't even hear the telephone,' he told 9News. 'I could hear a rumble... so I took of my headphones and the rumble continued. It felt like the house was shaking.' Mr Thibaux said he did not even know he was walking into a fashion week event because the bright lights obstructed his vision. Mr Thibaux, who lives next door to the Carriageworks, points at where the fashion show was taking place at the Eveleigh venue . The 67-year-old French native said he had no problem with the music but the rumble that accompanied it . 'I had no idea where I was to be honest. I could have been on the moon. It's embarrassing,' he said. The 67-year-old said he was 'very sorry' to have disturbed the show, which finished at 7pm. But he was not the only neighbour of the Carriageworks that found the noise disturbing. Jane Houselander said she did not sleep on Sunday night and neither did her neighbour who was 'incredibly upset' and 'very anxious'. Footage of the incident shows Mr Thibaux storming the stage with his hands over his ears, wagging his finger and shouting at a security guard who escorted him from the runway. He claims the noise was as loud as a jumbo jet flying overhead and was trying to make a complaint about it . Sunday night marked the start of Sydney's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. This photo is from the Ellery show . Mr Thibaux was eventually escorted off the catwalk by a security guard at the Carriageworks . Hardcore electronic music with a heavy bass line boomed throughout the space for the duration of the show, which lasted about 15 minutes. He was overheard complaining that show organisers were showing little respect for the local community. 'The noise is way too loud, this is disgrace,' eye witnesses overheard him say, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. 'It was loud but it was all part of the dramatic vibe,' a guest at the Ellery show told Daily Mail Australia. The Australian designer was not fazed by the disruption, the eye-witness added. 'Kym ran out merrily at the end, aside from that it all went perfectly,' they said.

"It looks like your typical outback fibro home, tin roof and all, but this property which is currently for sale is now at the centre of one of Australia's most chilling murder mysteries. For days now, detectives have swarmed over three bedroom Leeton home where Stephanie Scott's accused killer, high school cleaner Vincent Stanford, 24, lived with his mother Anika and elder brother Luke. In a rare scene of frantic activity on this peaceful suburban street, home to families and pensioners, investigators clad in blue forensic overalls heaped bags of evidence out the back of the property on Thursday evening. Detectives had first arrived at the property on Wednesday night speaking to two occupants before Mr Stanford arrived home and charged after investigators discovered discrepancies in his alibi. Police allege they discovered blood inside the school cleaner's Toyota Hilux, a picture of a burnt body on his mobile phone and a set of school keys thought to belong to Ms Scott inside the property itself. Neighbours told Daily Mail Australia the Stanford family have lived at the property, which is on the market for $179,000, for 'around 13 months'. Gail Scanlan, who lives next-door, said they would regularly chat to the 'beautifully manner' but quiet Mr Stanford over the backyard fence. Scroll down for video .

An advertisement published on the Domain property website touted the positive features of purchasing the three-bedroom home, targeted at potential buyers looking to escape the rental market.

"Relatives of the victims of a South Korean ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people a year ago have held a rally demanding the government salvage the vessel. The 6,825-tonne passenger ship sank off the southwest coast on April 16 last year with most of the victims, high school students. Thousands of protesters met in the capital Seoul to call on officials to raise the Sewol after senior government officials said they would 'consider it.' Scroll down for video . One year on: Relatives of the victims of a South Korean ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people a year ago and other civic members shout slogans during a rally in Seoul, South Korea, on Saturday . A total of 295 bodies were recovered from the ferry, and nine victims remained unaccounted for when divers finally called off the dangerous search of its interior last November. The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests with hundreds of bereaved parents, many with their heads shaved and clad in white mourning robes, marching 22 miles to Seoul from their home town of Ansan last week. President Park Geun-Hye has pledged to 'actively consider' raising the Sewol, taking into account the opinions of the relatives and salvage experts. But senior government officials said the salvage operation would cost £68million . Senior ministry official Yeon Yeong-Jin said: 'And that is only an estimate, as the final cost would be greatly dependent on weather conditions, technological uncertainties.' Protest: Demonstrators holding placards calling on the government to salvage the Sewol ferry in Seoul . Stricken: Rescue operations saved some of the passengers on a South Korean ferry Sewol that capsized on its way to Jeju island from Incheon, but 300 perished in the tragedy . The tragedy sparked nationwide grief and outrage as it became clear that regulatory failings, official incompetence and the ship's illegal redesign were the main causes. Park's administration was widely criticised for its response to the disaster, and her approval ratings have only just begun to recover. After months of political bickering, parliament passed a bill in November initiating an independent investigation into the sinking. But relatives have accused the government of trying to influence the probe by appointing officials to key posts in the 17-member inquiry committee. Unrest: Demonstrators clash with police officer while trying to march to the presidential Blue House after a rally in Seoul . Emotional: Protesters clash with police while a woman weeps while holding a placard calling on the government to salvage the wreck, one year after it sank killing 250 students . Wreck: People are calling on the South Korean government to raise the stricken Sewol at an estimated cost of £68 million . More than 50 people have been put on trial on charges linked to the disaster, including 15 crew members who were among the first to climb into lifeboats. The Sewol's captain was jailed in November for 36 years for gross negligence and dereliction of duty, while three other senior crew members were sentenced to jail terms of between 15 and 30 years.","Most victims of the disaster were high school students .

"A former bodyguard  who struggled to bond with his nine-year-old autistic son has finally mended their relationship - by becoming his second mother. Until two years ago, 50-year-old Roxy Wallace was a bodyguard called Bob, who lived a reclusive life, plagued by depression. The long-term condition was caused by Bob's belief that he had been born into the wrong body, a turmoil which made it impossible to have a meaningful relationship with his son William. Scroll down for video . Happy families: Roxy, who was formerly a bodyguard called Bob, has finally mended her relationship with her nine-year-old autistic son William by becoming his second mother . Transition: Roxy (left) struggled with depression  after secretly wanting to live life as a woman. She told her wife Jo, 44, (right) about her feelings two years ago and says she is now the 'luckiest woman in the world' Committed: The pair, who married in 1994, are now happier than ever, following Roxy's transition . But, in October 2013, Roxy finally revealed the truth to 44-year-old Jo, her wife of 20 years. With Jo's full support, Roxy started on the journey of gender reassignment - a move which has finally given her the parent-son relationship which has always been missing. Jo and Roxy are still together, now in a lesbian relationship. And for William, 'mummy Roxy's' new lease of life has changed everything - and he has no desire for 'grumpy daddy' to return. 'I love my second mummy so much. I never want my daddy back', he said. Roxy, from Churchdown, Gloucestershire, began to struggle with depression shortly after marrying Jo in 1994. It led to crippling migraines, a condition which made Roxy distance herself further from the family. But Roxy is now happier than ever, after starting hormone treatment with the full backing of her family. She hopes to have full gender reassignment surgery by Christmas. She said: 'My biggest fear was pushing my family away - but my depression was so bad that's what I was doing anyway. I just didn't realise at the time. 'My family have been so supportive of me, and it's helped me grow and improve as a person. I now feel like the luckiest woman in the world. Vows: Jo, aged 23 on her wedding day, has supported Roxy - pictured as 29-year-old Bob - during her transition. Roxy changed her named by deed poll and hopes to have gender reassignment surgery this year . Roxy began to struggle with depression after the pair were married (left). She had become a full-time carer for the couple's son but the pair never really bonded. Pictured right: Bob, then 42, with William, 14 weeks . 'Not only has my amazing wife stood by me, but my son and I are closer than ever. 'When I was Bob, William was so closed off but now he calls me ""mummy Roxy"" and is so much more affectionate and cuddly. I feel so blessed to have such a fantastic family.' In 2006, when Jo gave birth their son, Roxy became a full-time carer for William. But the pair never really bonded. Roxy said: 'I was so depressed and in pain every day that I convinced myself that Jo was going to do a runner and I'd be left without her or William, so I put up a wall between us. 'I'd feed, water and bathe him but I never connected with him emotionally. 'Looking back now, I had never felt right in myself. Ever since I was about eight years old, I'd never been into football and just wanted to read Jackie magazine. Secret: Roxy finally told Jo how she felt in October 2013 while the pair were watching TV. Pictured: Jo, then aged 22, with Bob, then 28 . 'Growing up I thought maybe I was gay because I was so girly, even though I wasn't attracted to men and I was bullied constantly for being effeminate.' Finally, in October 2013, while Roxy and Jo were watching TV, Roxy revealed her secret. Jo said: 'We were just slobbing on the sofa like any other night when Bob just blurted out that he was a woman, and wanted to start living as a woman. 'In my mind it came out of nowhere, but suddenly everything made sense. 'Bob had been a miserable recluse for years and I'd always known something was eating him up inside. I was shocked, but all I wanted was for Bob to be happy so I agreed to help him. 'After all, I had been in love with him for 20 years and it didn't matter to me what he looked like on the outside.' William (pictured left and right with Roxy), who adores 'mummy Roxy', has no desire for 'grumpy daddy' to return. 'I love my second mummy so much. I never want my daddy back', he says . She added: 'Watching Bob become a recluse had been so painful. I could see he was in turmoil but even he didn't seem to know why. 'It was such a hard time for us and we stopped going out with friends all together.' After that, the pair set the wheels in motion for Roxy's transition. They bought her female hormones online and a new wardrobe. And in the following July, Roxy legally changed her name by deed poll. Jo added: 'We go out clubbing all the time now - Roxy is the best friend I have ever had. She has all the qualities that made me fall in love with Bob, only more. 'William is thrilled too. He loves having two mummies.' Roxy added: 'I wasn't the best dad in the world but I'm making up for lost time by being a better mother. 'Bob was so masculine and afraid to show emotions but Roxy is very tactile and loving. 'Nothing makes me happier than when William jumps on me, throws his arms around me and gives me a huge kiss.'","Roxy Wallace, 50, was born as a boy, but wanted to live life as a woman .
