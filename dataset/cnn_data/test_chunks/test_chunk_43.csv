"Larry Upright hated Hillary so much she made it into his obituary . A North Carolina man's obituary asked two things of friends and family: instead of sending flowers for the funeral, give the money to charity. And don't vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016. The family of 81-year-old Larry Upright added the political message to the obituary announcing the Kannapolis man's death and burial this week. Upright's daughter, Jill McLain, said the rock-ribbed Republican was passionate about politics. She says that recollection prompted his family to ask obituary readers to reject Clinton's presidential bid, not necessarily to spark controversy. 'We did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad,' Jill McLain told WSOC-TV. Mike Upright said his deceased father voiced his opinions regularly. 'We did this for him,' Mike Upright said. 'We know he's up there giggling right now. Just laughing out loud.' The obituary also describes Upright as an active member of local Masonic and Shriners organizations and a country club. He retired after a career in the building automation industry. For their dad: 'We did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad,' said his daughter Jill McLain . Meanwhile, a group of Nevada sex workers have come out in favor of the Democratic contender. The group, calling themselves Hookers For Hillary, all work at Dennis Hof's infamous Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Carson City. The legal brothel, which was the subject of HBO's Cathouse series, has drafted a four-point platform explaining their endorsement. 'The Bunny Ranch entertains customers from all around the globe, and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will.'","Larry Upright wrote impassioned plea for people not to send the Democrat to the White House in 2016 .
Family said that Upright would most likely be 'up there giggling right now'"
"Most people, when scooping a massive win on the pools or national lottery, might follow the advice of a grey-suited financial adviser and buy a good-sized house, a reasonably flash car, take a couple of nice holidays and then live off the income from what’s left. But the story of Viv Nicholson — who died on Saturday aged 79 — is an exuberant lesson in what happens when you ignore all the advice and just blow the lot. When Viv, a cake-factory worker from Castleford in Yorkshire, and her coal miner husband Keith won £152,319, 18 shillings and 8d on the Littlewoods Pools in 1961 — the equivalent of around £3 million today — she announced that her life from now on would emphatically be neither sensible nor boring. Scroll down for video . In the money: Viv and husbandKeith receiving their chequefrom Bruce Forsyth in 1961 . Throwing her arms wide open towards the assembled Press in the plush surroundings of the Grosvenor House Hotel in London, the petite 25-year-old blonde charmed the world with an unapologetic joie de vivre, declaring that the money would indeed change her life. ‘Just imagine,’ grinned Nicholson. ‘I am going to buy masses of dresses and suits and coats. Brigitte Bardot won’t stand an earthly once I get cracking. There’ll be new clothes, too, and presents — dozens of them — for our three children.’ And then — in a phrase that decades later became the title of a hit musical starring Barbara Dickson — she famously announced that she was going to ‘spend, spend, spend’. Unbeknown to the media, Viv was so poor that she couldn’t even afford a pair of tights for the press conference, and had to borrow her sister’s. She was earning just £7 a week at the factory, and her husband the same amount in night shifts. When the couple got the train to London to collect their cheque, she was astonished to see so many people at King’s Cross rushing towards her compartment. ‘I thought: “Oh, I didn’t realise there were so many people who wanted to catch a train,”’ she said later. ‘That is how naive I was. They were reporters.’ The story of Viv Nicholson — who died on Saturday aged 79 — is an exuberant lesson in what happens when you ignore all the advice and just blow the lot . After the cheque presentation ceremony at the Grosvenor House, she collapsed into the arms of the man who had handed the couple their massive winnings — Bruce Forsyth. The following morning her ecstatic face and the headline ‘Spend, Spend, Spend’ were plastered over nearly every newspaper in the land. Soon after breakfast, Viv was good to her word — she went out and started on her mission. For her new wardrobe, there was only one place to go — across Hyde Park to Harrods. And of course, in the style of every pools and lottery winner, Viv bought the car of her dreams. In her case, the motor was as ostentatious as her bumptious personality — a pink Cadillac. And she dyed her hair to match. The couple quickly moved out of their semi-detached council house on Kershaw Avenue, and into an £11,000 upmarket sprawling ranch-style bungalow complete with swimming pool in the well-to-do Leeds suburb of Garforth. ‘The neighbours hated us and our noise,’ she admitted. ‘Mind you, we did party, party, party . . .’ The children were sent to private schools — the one sensible thing she did was to set up a trust to pay for their education — and Keith even bought a racehorse. It was a display of feckless extravagance at odds with an early Sixties Britain yet to escape the shadow of Fifties austerity. For a short while, all seemed well, and the family travelled through the U.S. and Europe, when such globetrotting seemed impossibly exotic. But without anyone to guide them — the counselling on offer to today’s lottery winners was nowhere to be seen — the young couple were overwhelmed by the wealth those eight score-draws had brought them. Their new home, which they called Ponderosa after the ranch in TV western Bonanza, was the scene of riotous parties and its built-in cocktail bar was an unheard of luxury for the mid-Sixties. The couple’s propensity for bubbly was such that Viv was known to wash in it. When they weren’t partying at home, they were knocking it back at the local pub, the Miners Arms. Viv also claimed they had to buy a new luxury car every six months, as she pranged them so often. ‘I used them to learn to drive. I was awful at reversing and would always reverse into somebody’s plant pot or door.’ Their spending was frittered away not just on motors, but on clothes and a lifestyle to match. Their new-found fame bought access to the celebrities of their day, and the couple rubbed shoulders with the likes of Leonard Rossiter, Joan Collins and even Mae West. And they had to look the part. Viv Nicholson pictured outside the West-End production of 'Spend Spend Spend' in 2000 . For some, Viv’s behaviour encapsulated the nascent consumer culture that was heralded by Harold Macmillan’s famous words from a few years before that the British people had ‘never had it so good’. Although Viv was undeniably susceptible to such commercial pressures, there were other problems. ‘When we first won the money all we did was drink,’ she admitted. ‘I used to fall over, I was falling from one table of drinks to the next for the first month or two.’ As well as struggling to cope with their excessive penchant for alcohol, both Keith and Viv struggled to adjust to a strange new social life. Old friends and neighbours were jealous of their wealth and resentful of their hedonistic lifestyle. It didn’t help that Viv had a temper, and she and Keith often fought. ‘Keith hated it,’ she later confessed. ‘I used to throw things at him when I lost my rag.’ But such incidents would soon seem trivial. In January 1965, Keith was killed after losing control of his powder-blue Jaguar on the A1, and skidding down an embankment. Keith’s uncle, Frank, also died. That crash not only robbed Viv of a husband, but it also took away what remained of their wealth. Barbara Dickson (left), star of the musical Spend Spend Spend and Viv Nicholson, upon whose life story the musical was based . By then, the couple had blown half of their winnings, and in the wake of his death, Harold Wilson’s Labour Government with its punitive tax system helped itself in death duties to the remaining half. ‘Even his watch,’ Viv would bitterly recall. Within little more than four years, Viv had gone from rags to riches to rags again. What she did have left were her looks and a certain celebrity, so she soon found herself singing Big Spender — what else? — in a strip club in Manchester. However, the managers wanted more from Viv than just her voice, and insisted she should strip at the end of the song. Viv agreed, but only if she could keep her underwear on. Her request was refused, but Viv was defiant. ‘I kept my knickers and bra on,’ she recalled. ‘I was frogmarched into the back and told: “You’ll do it properly tomorrow or you’re sacked.”’ Viv still refused to strip, and the following night was indeed sacked. ‘I earned £50, which didn’t even cover the petrol there and back,’ she said, ‘I couldn’t do it; I wasn’t a stripper.’ Viv also spent time with lawyers to claw back some of the fortune taken by the taxman. She recovered a few thousand, quickly spent in the way that Viv knew best — on booze and the high life. To find some security, Viv remarried, and did so in her unique style three times in quick succession. She moved to Malta to start a new life, but a punch-up with a policeman put paid to that, and she was deported. Without a bean and back in Castleford, Viv tried to commit suicide, and was admitted to a mental institution. But soon she picked herself up, as she always had. In 1977, she published her autobiography called — naturally — Spend, Spend, Spend. This was turned into a BBC play, in which Viv was memorably portrayed by actress Susan Littler. In 2011, she suffered a stroke, after which she was afflicted by dementia. But, despite it all, Viv never rued a single day . In 1984, Morrissey, lead singer of The Smiths, selected a vintage photo of Viv to grace the sleeve of the band’s latest single, Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now. And in 1999, that West End musical took off, earning Viv a hefty £100,000 in royalties. One might have thought that by then Viv would have learned her lesson. But no, she spent it, mostly on drink, which nearly killed her. After a spell in hospital, she recovered, and found stability in becoming a Jehovah’s Witness and working in a perfume shop in Wakefield. In 2011, she suffered a stroke, after which she was afflicted by dementia. But, despite it all, Viv never rued a single day. ‘Would I do it all again — you bet I flaming would,’ she said. ‘I bought designer clothes, I travelled, I gave my kids a good education and I had a ball. I’ve packed more into my life than 20 people. I have no regrets.’ Of course, it is easy for us to judge how Viv spent her life. For while her story is a parable on the perils of avarice, and how money really doesn’t buy happiness, it is also a lesson in the corrupting influence of celebrity. Famous and feted as she was, her money brought more entertainment for the rest of us than it did for her. Even so, isn’t there a part of us all that wants to do as she did — to throw off the shackles of responsibility and convention, and spend, spend, spend?","Viv won £152,319, 18 shillings and 8d on the Littlewoods Pools in 1961 .

"An investor has paid a whopping $71.2 million for a sprawling Florida estate - just two weeks after he gave a speech that slammed the rising wealth gap in America. Paul Tudor Jones II, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, bought the Casa Apava estate in Palm Beach last week, the Palm Beach Daily News reported. The Mediterranean-style seven-bedroom, 18-bathroom property was built in 1918 and has 420 feet of oceanfront access, as well as a tennis court, movie theater, swimming pool and gym. The hefty purchase came days after Jones, 60, warned that increasing inequality could spark a revolution as he gave a sold-out TED talk in Canada in March. Scroll down for video . New home? Paul Tudor Jones II, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, spoke out against the rising wealth gap in America at a TED talk in Canada last month - and bought a $71m home days later . A spokesman for Jones declined to comment when reached by DailyMail.com. In the speech, the self-made billionaire called the current wealth gap 'disastrous'. 'The gap between the one per cent and the rest of America, and between the U.S. and the rest of the world, cannot and will not persist,' he said. 'Now here's a macro forecast that's easy to make, and that's that the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest, it will get closed. History always does it. It typically happens in one of three ways - either through revolution, higher taxes or wars. None of those are on my bucket list.' He said that while he is a proud capitalist because of the successes it has allowed him, he added that capitalism has become increasingly focused on short-term earnings, CNBC reported. 'It's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies,' he said. 'It's threatening the very underpinnings of our society.' Sprawling: The ocean-front home, which was built in 1918, has seven bedrooms and 18 bathrooms . Stunning: The Mediterranean-style home has ocean views one side and views across a lake on the other . Impressive: As well as 420 feet of oceanfront access, the home has a gym, tennis court and boat dock . Peaceful: There is also a swimming pool, a pool house and a movie theater at the sprawling estate . Luxurious: The former owners previously sold off three other parts of the estate in separate sales . He has formed Just Capital, a non-profit that aims to boost justness in companies by asking people how they deem a company to be just - and then judging the top 1,000 firms against these criteria. Jones is married to Australian-born Sonia Klein, a former model who runs a chain of yoga studios in New York, and they have four children together. They live in Greenwich, Connecticut. He has an estimated net worth of $4.6 billion, according to Forbes, which ranks him at number 352 on its list of the world's billionaires. He is also one of the biggest philanthropists in the hedge fund world. He co-founded the Everglades Foundation, which strives to protect the Everglades in Florida, and established the Robin Hood Foundation, which aims to alleviate poverty in New York. It has raised and granted more than $1.45 billion to the poor. Jones, a graduate of the University of Virginia, has also given the college donations for a new basketball arena and various research facilities.

Critic: In his speech last month, he said he is a proud capitalist because of the successes it has allowed him but that capitalism has become increasingly focused on short-term earnings - which needs to change . In the Florida sale, Jones bought the oceanfront part of the property, which sits on six-acres of land. Three lakefront sections of the estate were sold last year, earning its sellers, real estate developer Dwight C. Schar and his wife Martha, a total of $116.1 million. The amount for the entire property means it is the island's highest ever deal for an estate with multiple parcels sold separately, according to the Palm Beach Daily News. The Schars bought the property from millionaire Ron Perelman in 2004 and 2005 for $85.6 million. The estate was originally designed by Abram Garfield, the youngest son of President James Garfield, in 1918 for U.S. Rep Chester Bolton and his wife, Rep. Frances Bolton. It was later restored and altered by Ferguson, Murray and Shamamian Architects LLP.","Paul Tudor Jones II, who is worth $4.6 billion, reportedly bought the oceanfront Casa Apava estate in Palm Beach last week .

"Johnny Manziel has been released from rehab. After checking into a facility on January 28 and stating that he wanted to 'be a better family member, friend and teammate,' the Cleveland Browns quarterback is out and ready to begin offseason workouts with the team, which begin on April 20. This as many are still wondering what future the highly touted athlete will have in the NFL. Scroll down for videos . Johnny Manziel (above) has been released from rehab after entering a facility on January 28 . This after Manziel's partying had been a topic of conversation since his rookie season began last July, with some worried his drinking was a priority . Manziel's hard-partying and off-the-field antics were well known while he was in college . According to ESPN, Manziel was 'doing great' in rehab, and had the full support of his team. Now comes the real test however, as he will be forced to compete with Josh McCown for the starting quarterback position, who just signed a $14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons. This after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts, Manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the Cleveland Browns season last December, but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem. Especially after one incident last year when, after partying until well past midnight, Manziel, who is suffering from an injured hamstring, skipped out on a Saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept, and in turn was fined by the Browns. Manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior, saying; 'It’s about being accountable . . . instead of looking like a jackass.' And while his season may have been over at that time, many believed Manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy, which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at FDR Lounge at the Delano in Miami on over the New Year holiday, alongside the likes of LeBron James and Ryan Phillippe, and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend Colleen Crowley and some buddies poolside at the Delano. At this point, some in the sports world, chief among them columnist Skip Bayless, began to suggest that the Heisman Trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking. The aqthlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released . Appearing on ESPN’s First Take, Bayless, a noted supporter of Manziel, did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking. 'My concern, I repeatedly said, was if Johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol, and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails, then I’m going to be out,' said Bayless. 'In talking to people in and around the Cleveland Browns, I believe Johnny Manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol. And I believe ... that it is time for Johnny to get some help. He continues to lie to his executives, to his coaches, to his teammates, to the media, and most of all, he continues to lie to himself.' He then said he would label Manziel an 'alcoholic.' Manziel was known for his partying while at Texas A&M, but said he was a changed man during the 2014 NFL Draft, noting that he had 'grown up,' before being selected 22nd overall by Cleveland. Just days into his training with the Browns however, the local press began calling him out on his partying, which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field. A source told Cleveland.com at the time; 'Team officials had bought into Manziel's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat-boy lifestyle back in College Station, Texas, and they've been stunned by his non-stop antics.' A photo snapped of Manziel before the start of the season and later posted to Instagram showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter . Manziel while the 2013 Heisman Trophy as the quarterback of the Texas A&M University Aggies . Also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of Manziel and later posted to Instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter, leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine. Browns head coach Mike Pettine spoke to Manziel soon after the problematic photo was posted, a photo that could have led to an inquiry or a drug test from the NFL, and said he felt that things were back on track and that Manziel was focused on football once again. There was also an odd incident during the regular season when he got into a fight with a fan in the lobby of his apartment building, and while alcohol seems to have played a role in the incident, it was the fan who was inebriated, not Manziel. It should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by ESPN in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college, Manziel did seek help for an alcohol problem, seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks. Manziel would later claim this report was false, and that he had never seen a counselor for anger management or for alcohol abuse while in college. Manziel is now set to begin offseason workouts with the Cleveland Browns on April 20 . As for his future with the Browns, that is a little unclear. Some, including ESPN's Pat McManamon, have called on the Browns to fire Manziel after he overslept for his treatment last year, saying he and fellow player Josh Gordon have a 'complete lack of professionalism.' Gordon was also out with Manziel and showed up late for the team walk-through, an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season. Currently, Manziel has a four year contract with the Browns worth about $8.25 million. The 22-year-old also has some of the most coveted, and lucrative, endorsement deals in the sports world with, among others, Nike, McDonald's, MusclePharm, and Snickers. For now though, Manziel seems to be committed to laying low and focusing on the football. 'When [Manziel] is back, it will be full speed ahead for him, said Pettine. 'I think he's very anxious at this point. We'll be prepared as we will with every other player. When they get back to town, we're going to coach the heck out of them.'","Johnny Manziel has been released from rehab after entering a facility on January 28 .

"A woman who ended up getting lost while running a marathon in Raleigh, North Carolina and ended up having to hitch a ride with the cops to get back on course, still won her race some nine minutes ahead of her closest competitor. Heidi Bretscher's troubles began around mile 17 of the Rock N' Roll Raleigh Marathon that took place earlier this month. The 28-year-old runner was so far ahead of the pack it wasn't clear to her which way she was meant to go. Wrong way: Heidi Bretscher, 28, said she was on pace to beat her personal record when she, and the two cyclists who were accompanying her, missed an unmarked turn . Retracing her steps: At mile 19, Bretscher was leading the women's race by about 30 minutes. She found a police officer who gave her a ride back to mile 17 . Somehow, she ended up running entirely off the planned route and around a lake that wasn't even on the course. Despite her unscheduled detour, Ms. Bretscher's was brought back on track by a couple of helpful cops who drove her in their patrol cars back to the point in the race where things became muddled. After working out her timings and distances she still managed to cross the line well ahead of her closest rival. 'I'm a little frustrated,' she told ABC 11 following her victory. 'I ran three miles off course because I didn't know which way to run in the race.' 'Usually when you cross the finish line, you're really excited. I wasn't excited,' she said. 'I was just really nervous that I was going to get in trouble because I didn't stay on course.' No sign: The route changed from the 2014 race leaving several turns unmarked allowing runners to get lost . Off course: Before the mishap, Bretscher said she was on pace to run her best time ever . On form: Race officials said as soon as they learned of Bretscher's confusion, the course was fixed and crew members were alerted . The organizers had hoped that things would be different this time around after changing the course from last year to help ease the traffic and impact on local residents. Competitor Group Inc., the main company responsible for organizing the Rock N' Roll marathons, said that they worked with the city of Raleigh but hadn't realized the confusion it would cause. 'It's just an embarrassing situation on behalf of everyone involved with Rock N' Roll and something that we're working to fix for next year,' Competitor Group's Dan Cruz said. At mile 19, Bretscher was leading the women's race by about 30 minutes. She came unstuck when she arrived near at a split near Lake Johnson. Not knowing whether to turn left or right, she ended up choosing incorrectly. 'I saw Mile 18 while I was on the trail. However, I never saw Mile 19 and eventually it became clear that we were off track,' she said. Course officials didn't seem to have a clear idea over what she should do either. It wasn't until she approached a traffic cop when she was able to find a clear solution who helped get her back on track. But even then things didn't improve because the police officer dropped her back at mile 17 where her problem first began. A second police officer agreed to whisk her to mile 22, just four miles from the finish line. Winner! Despite her detour, Bretscher managed to be the first woman and third runner overall to finish the race with a time of 3:06:59, nearly 10 minutes ahead of the next woman to cross the finish line . Returning runner: Competitor Group Inc. said that Bretscher was the only runner affected by the course, and as a silver lining, they're offering her a second shot at one of their other marathons, free of charge . The whole incident left Ms. Bretscher feeling frustrated because she had been on pace to run her best time ever. 'One of the hardest things for me, actually, was when I was in the car with the second police officer. I heard the male runner winning the race, and I knew I should have been really close to the finish line at that point,' she said. 'So that was really discouraging for me, but I was still so determined to win.' After crossing the finish line her win came under scrutiny but it was calculated that even with the ride from cops, after analyzing her times, she still came in some nine minutes ahead of her closest rival. Bretscher managed to be the first woman and third runner overall to finish the race with a time of 3:06:59. Competitor Group Inc. say Bretscher was the only runner affected by the new course design and have agreed to allow her entry to another of the marathons they run, free of charge. Ms. Bretscher says despite the error which cause her a great deal of frustration at the time, she will likely be back at the race next year under the presumption that course officials will have learned from their mistakes and that everything will far more smoothly.","Heidi Bretscher, 28, was running the marathon in Raleigh, North Carolina .

"Customs officials have seized what is being described as a 'zoo in a suitcase' from a woman accused of smuggling 108 exotic animals in Russia. In the bag, carried in the hold of the aircraft, there were 55 snakes, 35 lizards, seven turtles, six lemurs, two monkeys and even a suspected leopard cub.

"The owner of an auto repair shop in Michigan has become the latest business owner to claim his religious views should allow him to be able to refuse serving gay customers. Brian Klawiter posted a message on his company's Facebook page on Tuesday in which he announced that openly gay people are not welcome at his business because he considers homosexuality to be wrong. 'I would not hesitate to refuse service to an openly gay person or persons,' he wrote. 'Homosexuality is wrong, period. If you want to argue this fact with me then I will put your vehicle together with all bolts and no nuts and you can see how that works.' Brian Klawiter posted a message on his company's Facebook page announcing that openly gay people are not welcome at his business in Grandville, Michigan . Klawiter, 35, claims he has been surprised at how his message, which he said he only expected to be read by his friends and customers, has attracted national media attention. So fat the mechanic's post has been shared over 1,000 times, attracting hundreds of comments and more than 1,800 likes. The controversy has put Klawiter and his business, Dieseltec, at the center of a media firestorm similar to the one Memories Pizza in Indiana experienced after the owner said her religious views would prevent her from serving a gay wedding. The pizza company received hate mail but also over $840,000 in donations from supporters via a GoFundMe campaign. Some critics have accused Klawiter of making his inflammatory statements to attract similar financial support, a claim he denies. The businessman claims he was taking a stand for conservative Christian values and amongst other issues, he is also promising a discount for gun owners. Critics have accused Klawiter of trying to cash in on the anti-gay backlash which netted an Indiana pizzeria over $840,000 earlier this month . 'I can't say I regret posting. I feel strongly about morals and belief. But the response: These people are using every tactic imaginable to absolutely destroy my business,' he told MLive. In a second Facebook post on Thursday he reiterated his intention that he would 'stand firm on my views.' He also attempted to explain that his nuts and bolts analogy was a reference to male and female reproductive organs rather than a threat to deliberately sabotage vehicles.

"Vulnerable boys were trafficked from a children’s home before being abused by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile ring, a victim has claimed. Richard Kerr, 53, said he was one of three youngsters who were taken from the home in Belfast to London in the 1970s. Once in the capital, they were allegedly molested by politicians and other Establishment figures at Dolphin Square and Elm Guest House – which are now under investigation by Scotland Yard. Claims: Richard Kerr, 53, said he was abused by ‘powerful people’ in a Westminster paedophile ring . His account provides the first clear link between three alleged major VIP paedophile rings that operated in London and Northern Ireland. And the claims will add weight to calls for the allegations about the Irish children’s home to be covered by the official abuse inquiry now being chaired by judge Lowell Goddard. Mr Kerr told how he suffered abuse at Kincora children’s home in Belfast, where victims have accused MI5 of blocking police inquiries. He said he and two other boys were then trafficked to London in 1977, where they suffered further abuse in two locations. He said he endured his most violent ordeal at Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London. Boys – many in local authority care – are alleged to have been abused by figures including the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, Cabinet ministers, clergymen, pop stars, spies, judges and members of the royal household. Site 1: The Kincora children’s home in Belfast. Mr Kerr said he was one of three youngsters who were taken from the home to London in the 1970s . ‘I was tied up here. I do remember that. I don’t know why I was tied up, but I was tied up with my hands behind my back,’ he told Channel 4 News. ‘They took photographs. Other men were there. Other men came into the room. It wasn’t just this one man.’ Site 2: Location of the former Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London . Mr Kerr, who now lives in Dallas, Texas, made a highly emotional return to London last month to visit the scenes of his alleged abuse for the first time in over three decades. He claimed he was also taken to the exclusive Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico, where police are investigating allegations that a Conservative MP murdered a young boy. He said: ‘I remember going in with this guy. He told me to sit down and relax and explained about his [drinking] glasses. ‘He had Waterford Crystal and he wanted me to have a brandy, and we had a small one. And then we had a sexual encounter.’ Scotland Yard has said allegations surrounding the murder of three boys by a VIP paedophile ring linked to Dolphin Square are ‘credible and true’. One alleged victim, known only as Nick, has already claimed he saw a Conservative MP strangle a 12-year-old boy around 1980 and that a Tory Cabinet minister watched as another boy was murdered the following year. Mr Kerr, whose full interview will be broadcast by Channel 4 News at 7pm tonight, said the two boys from Kincora children’s home who were taken to London with him both went on to kill themselves. He said his abusers included politicians but he still had fears about naming them. ‘I need to know that I can have faith in our government,’ he said. ‘But right now, when they’re not willing to bring Kincora into Westminster, the message that sends to me is that there’s some kind of cover-up, and there has been.’ Abuse victims were granted leave in February to bring a legal challenge to the Government’s refusal to include Kincora in the remit of Justice Goddard’s wide-ranging abuse inquiry. Site 3: Dolphin Square luxury flats complex in Pimlico, London. Police are investigating allegations that a Conservative MP murdered a young boy there . The children’s home in east Belfast was run by William McGrath, the head of an extreme Protestant loyalist group called Tara and an alleged MI5 informant. He and two other members of staff – William Semple and Joseph Mains – were jailed in 1981 for sexually assaulting boys in their care. But Mr Kerr, who was sent to live at Kincora in 1975 aged 14, said two plain clothes policemen visited him before the trial and warned him not to talk. In February, lawyers for the victims told the High Court in Belfast that MI5 was aware of the abuse but allowed it to continue to protect those responsible from prosecution. Home Secretary Theresa May said last month that Justice Goddard’s abuse inquiry would share information with a separate review being held in Northern Ireland.","Richard Kerr says he was taken from the Belfast home to London in 1970s .

"A 103-year-old deckchair  recovered from the wreck of the Titanic  is expected to fetch around £80,000 at auction. The chair was on the first class promenade deck when the liner sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912. It was found bobbing on the surface of the Atlantic by the crew of the Mackay-Bennett, who were sent to recover the bodies of the victims after the tragedy. A 103-year-old deckchair recovered from the wreck of the Titanic is expected to fetch around £80,000 at auction . The ship's log records six or seven deckchairs being picked up and taken back to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia. One was given by a crew member to Captain Julien Lemarteleur, who had previously worked on board the Mackay-Bennett. It has since been owned for 15 years by an English Titanic collector who kept it by a large window overlooking the sea at his home on the south coast. The anonymous owner has never sat on it due to its fragile state and instead used it as a display item. Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, described the piece as one of 'the most important [bits] of Titanic memorabilia around'. He said: 'It is incredibly rare to find something of that size that was on Titanic, was salvaged and that still exists today. Six or seven recovered deckchairs were stacked on the deck of the Mackay-Bennett as it arrived in Nova Scotia . Titanic (above) sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14 . 'You would not use it for practical purposes but have it on display. It would make a great conversation piece. 'There were a couple of thousand deckchairs on board Titanic and many of them were found floating on the wreck site. 'We have been able to access the Mackay-Bennett's log book, which confirmed the crew not only picked up deckchairs but that the ship's carpenter spent time repairing some of them on the way back to Halifax.' The chair is made of teak wood and has an adjustable footrest at the front. It is 57 inches long, 23 inches wide and 35 inches tall. It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic . It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic. Upon his death in 1973, Capt Lemarteleur gave the chair to colleague Captain Robin Lee. The current owner acquired it in 2001. Being sold with the chair is an in depth 'provenance package' that authenticates history and association with Titanic. Captain Julien Lemarteleur (above), who collected the chair from the Mackay-Bennett more than 100 years ago . It includes a signed affidavit from Margarete Pennington, who was Mr Lemarteleur's housekeeper in the 1960s. In it she states: 'I personally saw the deckchair that Captain Lemarteleur told me about on many occasions. He said that various pieces of debris taken from the ocean including this Titanic deckchair he acquired. 'I recognise the chair as the same chair I saw in the captain's garage and of which the captain identified as coming from the Titanic.' Craig Sopin, 57, a lawyer from Philadelphia, owns one of the world's largest collections of Titanic memorabilia. He also authenticated the chair and said: 'It isn't often that one has the opportunity to acquire such an important part of Titanic's story. 'For such a significant item to have such a meticulous chain of custody is nothing short of astonishing. Its history can be traced from the auction house back to Titanic itself.' Titanic sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14. A ship, the Carpathia, picked up more than 700 survivors in lifeboats hours later and took them back to New York. White Star Line chartered four ships, including the Halifax-based cable-laying vessel the Mackay-Bennett, to recover the bodies. The deckchair is being sold in Devizes, Wiltshire on April 18.

"It's not every day two senior barristers in the nation's highest court go head to head over the fate of a pooch on death row. But on Tuesday in Canberra that's exactly what happened. Condemned Staffordshire terrier Izzy is set to be destroyed after she bit a woman in August 2012 after escaping from her owner Tania Isbester's backyard in The Basin, east Melbourne, Victoria. Lawyers for Victorian woman Tania Isbester appealed to the High Court hoping to have her Staffordshire terrier, deemed aggressive by Knox City Council, saved from being put down. The woman who Izzy bit suffered a 1.5cm to her finger on August 4 in 2012, which is deemed as a 'serious injury' under the Domestic Animal Act in Victorian law, and Izzy was seized by the council in June 2013. This is the first time a dog on death row is having its case heard in Australia's highest court. Condemned Staffordshire terrier Izzy is set to be destroyed but could be saved by a final High Court bid . Richard Kendall QC, representing Ms Isbester, argued a member of the panel which determined Izzy's fate had a conflict of interest. Kirsten Hughes investigated the attack Izzy made in August 2012 and presented evidence at a later Magistrates Court hearing in which Ms Isbester pleaded guilty. Ms Hughes then informed her about a panel hearing to determine the dog's fate, before participating in it and helping to draw up the final reasons, Mr Kendall said. 'Ms Hughes had a fundamental part in the process of decision making,' he told the court, claiming she was both the accuser and acting as judge. Justice Patrick Keane took exception to that characterisation criticising the lawyer for 'sliding into personal attacks'. 'Well, I'll desist,' Mr Kendall conceded. Lawyers for the council argued there was no judge in the case, but rather an administrator making an administrative decision. Stephen Donaghue QC acknowledged Ms Hughes played a role on the panel, but said the final decision was made by another member. Ms Isbester had three Staffordshire terriers, including Izzy, which were involved in attacks on other dogs after escaping from her backyard in The Basin, a suburb in Melbourne's east. In 2013 she pleaded guilty to a charge relating to an 1.5cm cut allegedly caused by Izzy on the middle finger of a woman trying to pull the dog away from her daughters. A dog on death row will for the first time in history have its case heard in the High Court of Australia . The dog has been housed by the RSPCA since it was seized two years ago, sparking a lengthy legal battle. Lawyers representing the dog at no cost to the client say the local council that is fighting for Izzy's destruction in the High Court is wasting public money by perusing the case. City of Knox council has refused RSPCA South Australia's offer to rehabilitate the pet and assume all liability for her at no extra cost from the time of collection. 'The council is prepared to spend a six figure sum fighting to kill a dog when they might lose in the High Court,' barrister Graeme Mcewen, founder of the Barristers Animal Welfare Panel told Daily Mail Australia. 'No dog should be allowed to be killed by a council expect by court order,' Mr Mcewen argued. In normal circumstances Izzy's case would never have made it to the High Court but her fate has taken an unusual twist due to the manner in which the local council made in administrative decision  for her to be put down. In a letter to the City of Knox council, the CEO of RSPCA SA Tim Vasudeva, wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome Izzy at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed. The letter, seen by Daily Mail Australia and written on September 9, 2014, said: . 'As discussed late last week, I can confirm that RSPCA South Australia would be happy to transport the dog known as Izzy (owned by Tania Isbester) to our Lonsdale Animal Shelter here in Adelaide in order for her to undergo an extensive behavioural assessment under the guidance of our qualified behaviourists.' 'This would involve a wide variety of behavioural interactions and analysis both inside and outside kennels, in our indoor behavioural centre and our outdoor fenced enclosures. The purpose of this would be to determine, in as thorough a manner as possible, the rehabilitation prospects of this dog. 'We are able to arrange collection and transport at no expense to Knox City Council. RSPCA South Australia are prepared to take Izzy into our care and custody and assume all liability for this dog from the time of collection.' In September 2013, Izzy's owner Ms Isbester pleaded guilty to charges of her dog causing 'serious injury' at Ringwood Magistrates Court but the local council, the City of Knox, did not apply for a destruction order on Izzy from the magistrate at that time. If they had applied for the order from the magistrate, the question of whether the penalty (death) was proportionate to the injury caused (a 1.5 centimetre cut) would have been raised on appeal to a judge at the county court. Instead, the council ruled that the dog should be destroyed during a council panel meeting. During the panel hearing, which took place on 30 September, 2013, at Knox Civil Centre, one of the people on the panel was the same council officer who brought the charges against Izzy's owner Ms Isbester. The team of barristers fighting Izzy's case from the Barristers Animal Welfare Panel, including Richard Kendall QC and Andrew Felkel, is now challenging the decision that the panel came to  based on administrative law grounds. 'The council officer who brought the charges then sat as a member of the three person panel which decided to put the dog down,' Mr Mcewen told Daily Mail Australia. 'The question of law is whether a fair minded observer might think that the accuser sitting on a panel is a) a conflict of interest or b) with a disposition of pre judgement.' Izzy has been living in a cage at the RSPCA centre in Victoria for more than 21 months while the legal battle has played out. Victoria's highest court first upheld the decision to destroy her on September 10, 2014, but the barristers have now been granted Special Leave permission to appeal to the High Court of Australia. Mr Mcewen admitted: 'It's a bit of a story.' 'Only one in ten cases get through on special leave application.' In a letter to the City of Knox council, the CEO of RSPCA SA Tim Vasudeva, wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome her at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed. But the council knocked back the offer. 'Rather than accept the offer and bring the matter to an end - avoiding legal proceedings at cost and removing her from their municipal boundaries of City of Knox - and not leaving a family heartbroken… the City of Knox refuses and now they have got to fight in the high court,' Mr Mcewen said. The hearing continues.","The City of Knox council made an 'administrative decision' to kill Izzy .

"Creeping  through the Australian bush, Prince Harry proves he has lost none of his military skills on what are expected to be the last manoeuvres of his ten-year military career. With a Steyr assault rifle pulled tight into his shoulder, the Prince is pictured taking part in exercises with Royal Australian Artillery troops in Darwin. Harry’s participation in the exercises follows his visit to the remote Kununurra region of Western Australia where he met village elders and children, camped in the Outback and was taught how to survive a bushfire. Scroll down for video . 'Delightful chap': Prince Harry takes time out from his tough training programme to play with local children at the Wuggubun community in a remote area hundreds of miles away from the nearest city, Darwin . As well as demonstrating his weapons handling and first aid skills, the 30-year-old took to the air in the Royal Australian Air Force’s Tiger assault helicopter, which is similar to the Apache the Prince flew in combat sorties against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2012. At the end of the exercises in the Northern Territory, Prince Harry will hang up his fatigues and, after attending official functions in Perth and Sydney, is expected to return to Britain. In July, the Prince is scheduled to spend several weeks on a conservation project in Africa before finally deciding on a fulltime job, most probably in the charity or public service sectors. Harry may choose to continue his work with the MoD’s Recovery Capability Programme, which helps wounded troops rebuild their lives and find new jobs. A source close to the Prince said his employment options were ‘wide and varied’ but he will not have to do Royal duties on a full-time basis. Put through his paces: The Prince patrols during Exercise Thunder Observer, a Joint Fire Team exercise with the 8th/12th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, at Robertson Barracks in Darwin, Northern Territory . Bowing out: Prince Harry started his army career in 2005 when he began training at Sandhurst, and has completed two tours of Afghanistan . Harry, affectionately dubbed Captain Wales by his fellow soldiers, has completed the first two weeks of a month-long attachment with the Australian 1st Brigade - but he is due to leave the British military in June after 10 years' service . Harry has been participating in day-to-day soldiering activities and physical training sessions as well as undertaking flight simulation training. His itinerary also included time in an armed reconnaissance helicopter. After meeting with some of the army's wounded, injured and ill members, the royal joined in a game of wheelchair Australian Football League with soldiers from the recovery centre and the 1st Brigade. During his time in the Kununurra region he was briefed on operations and trained in bush survival lessons, including how to source food and water. After receiving his orders, Harry headed out on patrol with members of the force, spending two nights camping out in the remote outback. His attachment with the Australian Defence Force will continue after Gallipoli commemorations in Turkey, when he will return to Australia to spend time with Australian Army units in Perth and Sydney.

Its area of operations covers 1.8million square kilometres, encompassing the entire Northern Territory and the Kimberley region of Western Australia; the largest of any military unit in the world today. Locals who live in one of the most remote places on earth got the surprise of their lives when Prince Harry turned up unannounced. 'He just rocked up,' said delighted Barry Trust, a resident of the tiny township which sits 600 miles away from the nearest city - Darwin. Mr Trust, who was speaking to ABC News, described the royal visitor as 'a real delightful chap' and revealed that Harry is enjoying the Outback so much, he's contemplating a move there. 'We've invited him back again some time,' said Mr Trust. 'He'd love to - he said he'd love to live out this way, to get away from the media.

Prince Harry spent his first day on the placement paying his respects at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Canberra before reporting for duty. He also found time to meet some of the locals and hit the headlines when he revealed his true feelings about selfie photos. 'Selfies are bad,' he said, when asked to strike a pose by a teenage fan. He added: 'I know you're young but just take a normal photograph.' He will also briefly travel back to Europe for a visit to Turkey alongside the Prince of Wales later this month where he will take part in a memorial service for the men who fought and died at Gallipoli. Striking a pose: Prince Harry poses with members of the local community, including Mr Trust. Locals described him as a 'delightful chap' Warm welcome: Prince Harry arrived in Australia earlier this month for his four week-long secondment . Agreed! He struck a pose next to a Redheads Rule sign but refused to pose for a selfie. He was visiting the Australian War Memorial in Canberra . The World War I battle, which pitted British forces against the Ottoman Empire, claimed the lives of 34,000 British soldiers, 8,700 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders. Harry has served with the Australian Armed Forces in the past, most notably during his two tours of Afghanistan. 'He met [Australian troops] during the Invictus Games and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,' said an aide. 'Those experiences reinforced the huge admiration and respect he already had for Australian servicemen and women and has stoked his enthusiasm even more to build on those relationships in the next four weeks. 'He knows he will learn a huge amount from his Australian colleagues during this attachment and he is grateful to the ADF for producing such a varied and interesting programme for him. Saying hello: Harry's winning ways have endeared him to Australian locals from the start . All smiles: His first act upon arriving in Australia was to visit the tomb of the Unknown Soldier . Clown Prince! He was happy to pull funny faces for the amusement of one little girl while meeting wellwishers . 'He is also looking forward to learning how wounded, injured and ill servicemen and women are supported here in Australia and hopes to pass on some of his experience from his current role in the UK. 'Prince Harry has been to Australia twice before, so he knows he is in for a great experience. He particularly appreciates the opportunity to pay his respects to the fallen and fully appreciates the significance of commemoration in this centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign.' Harry entered military service in 2005, training at The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as an officer cadet and was commissioned as an Army officer on Wednesday, 12th April 2006. He then joined the the Blues and Royals, and in early 2007 began secretly serving in the Helmand region of Afghanistan before his deployment was uncovered by an American newspaper, and he was brought back home. He was promoted to Captain, his current rank, in 2011 when he also went to America to learn to fly an Apache helicopter, before returning to fly missions in Afghanistan between September 2012 and January 2013.","Prince Harry visited one of the most remote areas in the world as part of his tour with the Australian Army .

"Reaching out: Third-grade teacher Kyle Schwartz devised a lesson plan last month, which has spread to classrooms across the nation via Twitter . A third-grade teacher in Denver, Colorado has sparked a sensation on Twitter, after asking her students to open up about their personal struggles. Kyle Schwartz has been a teacher for three years, and says that many of her students at Doull Elementary School come from underprivileged backgrounds, with 92 per cent of the student body qualifying for free or reduced lunch. Seeking to understand a bit more about their lives, Schwartz last month thought up a lesson plan called 'I wish my teacher knew...' She asked all for he children to write down one thing they wanted to tell her, but wouldn't normally in the classroom situation and the results were heartbreaking. The first note that Schwartz shared on twitter was from a student who said they didn't have pencils at home to do their homework. That note especially touched Schwartz. 'I care deeply about each and every one of my students and I don't want any of them to have to suffer the consequences of living in poverty, which is my main motivation for teaching,' Schwartz told ABC News. Another, spoke about missing her father, who was deported back to Mexico six years ago. Hoping to learn more about her students' personal struggles, Schwartz asked them to answer the qestion 'I wish my teacher knew...' on a piece of paper and turn it in to her anonymously or share it with the class. Schwartz sais she found the above note from a student who didn't have pencils at home to do homework especially heartbreaking . Alone: After trying out the lesson plan, Schwartz says she not only learned more about her students, she saw a change in how they interacted with each other. For example,  a group of girls invited one student to play at recess after hearing in class that they felt they had no friends . Heartbreak at home: One student wrote about missing her father, who was deported six years ago back to Mexico . Language barrier: Another student in Schwartz's class wrote about a challenging aspect of being bi-lingual . Busy parents: Schwartz shared many of these notes on Twitter, and soon teachers across the nation started trying out the lesson themselves and posting their own results online . 'I wish my teacher knew I don't have [a] friend to [play] with me,' another note read. Schwartz said that she gave her children the option to answer the question anonymously, but found that most signed their name and were even willing to share their story with the class. After sharing some of the notes on Twitter, Schwartz said she started getting responses from teachers across the nation who tried out the lesson. 'It's hard to stay asleep at night': Rebecca Shoniker, a middle school teacher in North Carolina, shared these responses from her class on Twitter . 'I think it caught on so fast because teachers are highly collaborative and freely share and explore resources,' Schwartz said. 'In the end, all teachers want to support their students, and #iwishmyteacherknew is a simple and powerful way to do that.' Since trying out the lesson plan, Schwartz has not only learned more about her students, she has seen a change in how they interact with each other. 'After one student shared that she had no one to play with at recess, the rest of the class chimed in and said, 'we got your back.' The next day during recess, I noticed she was playing with a group of girls,' Schwartz said. Stressful: Dawn King, a fourth grade teacher, shared this letter from a student who was worried about a sick parent . Sadness: Another student in King's class wrote about a fear of having depression. That student was open enough to share those fears with a parent . Bullied: Mary Lou Shuster in South Portland, Maine, shared this note about a student who is being bullied .","Kyle Schwartz, a third-grade teacher in Denver, Colorado, devised a new lesson plan last month .
Hoping to learn about her students' struggles outside the classroom, Schwartz had them answer the question 'I wish my teacher knew...'

"An Arizona man who suffers from an extreme case of a tumor disorder in which his body is covered in noncancerous lumps said he finally has a feeling of belonging. Bob Heslip, 50, suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, which is caused by a gene malfunction that causes the bubble-like bumps to appear all over his body. However, he says he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life now that he has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow  where he has met performers including a bearded lady and America's smallest couple. 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . Bob Heslip (pictured), 50, who suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow and said for the first time in his life he feels comfortable in his skin . The noncancerous lumps began appearing on his body around puberty and became more severe as he aged . Heslip, who works at a Dollar Tree in Tuscon, said around eight months ago he was on vacation with his family in Los Angeles when they saw the Freakshow, as his daughter is a fan of the TV show. Todd Ray, the owner, saw Heslip and recognized his condition as NF-1 and began talking to him. 'I went to the front, took off my shirt and the crowd went crazy,' Heslip told the Huffington Post. He accepted Ray's offer to join the show as the 'Bubble Boy' a few weeks ago and said it gives him the platform to talk about his condition to people who otherwise just stare. For Heslip, the tumors on his body began appearing around puberty but became more severe as he aged. He noted that when he got married 25 years ago he did not have any bumps on his face, but now he does. 'I don't feel a lot of pain from the bumps,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. 'I have a large bump on the side of my body that used to be very sensitive, but not so much now.' To have the tumors surgically removed is not an option for him as he said it is not guaranteed that they will not grow back or possibly grow back larger than before. Heslip said: 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home' Staying in hiding from the public is also not an option as he has a family including his wife and children to support. Ray said that some people will see Heslip's hands and will not want him to touch their items while he is working because they think he is contagious. As Heslip manages his job in Tuscon and his new role as a performer, he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life because of the Venice Beach Freakshow. The job which he works on the weekends is also making it possible for him to talk to others about NF-1. 'I want to teach people that it's not taboo to ask questions. I'm OK talking about it,' he told the Huffington Post. 'My son and oldest daughter also have this condition and my speaking out about it gets them excited. They know my attitude is positive.' Heslip joins performers including Asia Ray, Morgue, Jessa the Bearded Lady, Larry the Wolf Boy and Miss Sunshine as part of the Venice Beach Freakshow (pictured above) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders affecting around one in every 3,000 people. NF-1 ranges from mild to severe and can cause more symptoms in some people than in others. The condition primarily affects the skin, the nervous system and the eyes, and most people with NF-1 have recognizable signs before the age of 10. The most common symptoms include six or more light brown skin spots (café au lait spots), freckles in unusual places, such as under the arms and in the groin, colored bumps on the iris (Lisch nodules) and Neurofibromas. Regardless if the NF-1 gene change was inherited from a parent or is newly affected, every person who has an NF-1 gene change has a 50 per cent chance of passing it on every time they have a child. Genetic testing for the NF-1 gene is available and can be coordinated for families in which testing would be appropriate.

"Smartly dressed in a bowler hat and waistcoat, these civilians may look like respectable members of society in Edwardian England. In fact, they were the drunkards banned from every boozer in Birmingham for a string of crimes including drink-driving a steam engine, riding a horse while drunk and being intoxicated to the point of 'complete incompetence'. They were all placed on the 1904 blacklist after four convictions under the Inebriates Act of 1898. The list was then sent to landlords who were not allowed to sell them alcohol. Scroll down for video . Boozy: Kitted out in a bowler hat and waistcoat, he may appear to be a right-thinking member of Edwardian England, but Matthew Moran was banned from every pub in Birmingham at the turn of the century . Black listed: Alice Tatlow was also banned from every Birmingham boozer for being 'drunk and disorderly'; publicans were told they could recognise her by a tattoo of the Prince of Wales's feathers . Barred: 46-year-old Mary Bayliss was one of the many respectable-looking women barred from drinking in Birmingham after being found drunk and disorderly . On the blacklist, each drunkard’s entry includes photographs, their name, alias, residence, employment, physical description, distinguishing marks, nature of conviction and the sentence received for booze-related crimes. Offenders who were caught drunk and disorderly were ordered to work up to 21 days of 'hard labour' in comparison to today's fixed penalty or fine. They form part of the UK Midlands Collection, which covers a 400 year period and contains more than 21 million records detailing the good, the bad and the famous who have shaped the history of the city. Unearthed by Ancestry, the world's largest online family history resource, the records are available for all to see. Ladette: Elizabeth Thompson was a 29-year-old prostitute when she was arrested for drunkenness and sentenced to two weeks' hard labour . Rowdy: Charwoman Susannah Booton was arrested for drunken behaviour in February 1906 . Criminal: Each notice bore a mugshot of the criminal, as well as a description of their nose and face; Annie Hodgkins was said to have a 'fresh complexion' despite being sentenced to three weeks' hard labour . Poster: Unemployed Kate Kibble, another woman convicted of being drunk and disorderly, was described as having a 'broad' build, as well as losing her right eye and having 'both little fingers crooked' Some of the bizarre offences committed by past Birmingham residents include theft of a dead duck and riding a horse while drunk. Nearly 10,000 Edwardian felons are listed in the UK Midlands criminal registers providing fascinating insight into the murky underworld of Birmingham's metropolis more than a century ago. Among those on the blacklist are Henry Bonus, 40, who was sentenced to a year's hard labour and three months' police supervision after stealing eight pounds of ham. Elsewhere, 18-year-old William Handley was sentenced to eight months' hard labour and one-year's police supervision for stealing a 'dead duck' and a teapot. Careers: Sarah Henson combined her job as a dressmaker with an extra source of income as a prostitute, before being banned from pubs for being drunk and disorderly . Haggard: Just 38, Eliza Fallon looked a lot older than her years when she was arrested for drunkenness . Distinctive: Sarah Evans, left, and Ellen Heaton, right, could be recognised by their scars, according to the Birmingham archives . Records reveal how offenders came from a variety of backgrounds, such as metal cutters, grease merchants, labourers and hawkers. Many had aliases - suggesting criminal careers - while others had scars or physical handicaps, ranging from Kate Kibble's one eye to cut marks on faces, broken noses and missing fingers. Some, however, lived perfectly respectable lives - until they walked through the door of their local watering hole. It shows how those living in Edwardian England were just as likely to get half-cut and troublesome on a night out as boozy Brits in today's binge drinking culture.","Archives reveal list of drunkards banned from every pub in Birmingham .

"Condemned Bali Nine pair's ongoing battle to spare their lives has moved to Indonesia's constitutional court, a challenge that has been labelled as a delay tactic. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran lost a bid to challenge their clemency rejections in the state administrative court, which upheld its earlier decision that presidential decrees were outside its jurisdiction on Monday . As Jakarta waits on the legal efforts of a few other prisoners before setting an execution date, the two Australian's lawyers sought a constitutional court review to make clear the president's obligations on considering clemency on Thursday - a process that could take several months. Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) are now appealing to Indonesia's constitutional court . Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has declared the move by the pair's lawyers as a delay tactic . They also intend to challenge the barrier preventing foreign citizens from constitutional court appeals. However, Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has dismissed the challenge as delaying tactics and says he won't recognise it. Indonesian lawyer for the death row pair, Inneke Kusuma, told reporters the effort was not aimed at delaying the executions, but clarifying a prisoner's rights. The president's obligations when assessing a prisoner's life were unclear, she argued, such as the weight that should be given to rehabilitation. 'This judicial review won't delay the executions but we will tell the government please hold on until this process is done, because if the constitutional court accepts what we lodge, the documents, maybe there will be a new mechanism to consider their clemency,' she said. The pair's lawyers also intend to challenge the barrier preventing foreign citizens from constitutional court appeals . Sukumaran (left) and Chan (right) are now imprisoned on Central Java's Nusakambangan island where they face the prospect of death by firing squad . The lawyers' argument is that President Joko Widodo breached his responsibilities to treat the applications for mercy on their merits, instead rejecting them because he wishes to deny clemency to all death row drug offenders. Mr Prasetyo says the pair have already had their appeals and any constitutional court decision would only apply to future cases anyway - not that of the condemned duo. Meanwhile, his spokesman Tony Spontana said an execution date that avoids the Asia-Africa Conference was still being considered, when Indonesia plays host to various heads of state from April 18 - 24. Mr Spontana said although it was legal - it would not be ethical to carry out the executions while hosting the international event but they would continue to look for a 'good day' during this month for the prisoners to face death row. The Sydney men are now imprisoned on Central Java's Nusakambangan island where they face the prospect of death by firing squad. Two of the other eight prisoners in line for execution with the Australians have applied for Supreme Court judicial reviews, while another is also pursuing an administrative court case.","Bali Nine lawyers appeal to Indonesia's constitutional court for review .

"She has a reputation for being a ‘pushy parent’ and with some newly acquired dance moves under her belt, she might have been expected to muscle in. But it emerged yesterday that when Andy Murray and his new bride had their first dance on Saturday night, Judy Murray was strictly on the sidelines. The former star of Strictly Come Dancing – who frequently failed to impress the judges with her efforts – left the newlyweds to it as they took to the floor at their reception in Cromlix House Hotel, following their wedding at Dunblane Cathedral in the afternoon. Scroll down for video . Love match: Andy and Kim after the ceremony at Dunblane Cathedral (left). Judy Murray (pictured right during Strictly Come Dancing) says she is 'terrible' at dancing . As Judy’s mother, Shirley Erskine, 80, left the venue, she admitted the wedding of Andy, 27, to his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears, also 27, had been ‘fantastic’ and ‘wonderful’. She added: ‘We’ve just all been up there together and everybody’s parting in dribs and drabs, so we’re on the way home.’ But neither she, nor Andy’s grandfather Roy, were able to recall what the couple’s first dance was. Mr Erskine, 83, said: ‘It was something with music anyway. They actually did go out for the first dance.’ They also confirmed that Mrs Murray did not take to the dance floor first and let the bride and groom lead the evening’s festivities at Cromlix, the luxury hotel bought by Andy in 2013 for £1.8million, and where his brother had also held his wedding reception. Mrs Erskine also said that the newlyweds would not be going on honeymoon ‘until later’ in the year. The bride dazzled in a pretty flowing silk chiffon gown by designer Jenny Packham, while her husband opted for traditional Scots dress to tie the knot. And as for the mother-of-the-groom, 55-year-old Mrs Murray wore a white dress coat, which was belted at the waist. Just a few hours earlier, she was resplendent in a stunning white dress coat and eye-catching hat. But the morning after her younger son’s wedding, Judy Murray had slipped into something more comfortable – her favoured old blue tracksuit. The morning after her younger son’s wedding, Judy Murray had slipped into something more comfortable – her favoured old blue tracksuit . After admitting to focusing more on her outfits following her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing last year, Mrs Murray, 55, broke with tradition on Saturday by wearing a white coat, the same colour, as the stunning Jenny Packham gown worn by bride, Kim Sears. But it was back into the sports gear when she left Cromlix House yesterday. Beneath, Mrs Murray opted for a nude pencil skirt and lace top as well as a hat by Scottish milliner William Chambers that resembled an oversized fascinator. In an interview last year to promote her appearance on the hit BBC show Strictly, Mrs Murray said that despite raising two tennis stars – her son, Jamie, 28, is a Wimbledon doubles champion – she is not a pushy parent. She said: ‘I’ve definitely been pigeon-holed as pushy and overbearing but if you ask any of my friends or family, I’m all about having fun. ‘My children would tell you exactly the same.’ And although she admitted to being a terrible dancer, she said she ‘absolutely loved’ the programme and being part of the competition.She added: ‘I’m terrible, I don’t know if it’s my age but I just can’t remember the steps.’ Mrs Murray, 55 (pictured left with Will Murray) broke with tradition on Saturday by wearing a white coat, the same colour as the stunning Jenny Packham gown worn by bride, Kim Sears (right) The bride and groom were cheered and showered with confetti as the left the cathedral in Andy’s hometown after the 45-minute ceremony, which went ahead smoothly despite earlier showers of hail and snow. Hundreds of well-wishers had gathered outside to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. Clearly unable to contain his excitement in the run-up to his love match, Andy had posted a tweet to his 2.98million followers which showed his plans for the day – through the use of emojis. He tweeted an umbrella, a picture of a church, a ring, a kiss, cake, drinks including beer, cocktails and wine and ending with hearts, a face blowing a kiss and several Zzzz icons for sleep. Meanwhile, Judy earlier expressed some apprehension over the weather, initially tweeting, ‘Hailstones. Marvellous,’ and then: ‘Snowing. White wedding.’","Judy Murray left newlyweds to it as they took to floor for their first dance .

"Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, has been struck off after a hearing heard that he punched a patient in the face ten times to fix a broken cheekbone . A groundbreaking facial surgeon has been struck off after repeatedly punching a patient in the face 'like a boxer' to fix his broken cheekbone. Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, claimed he was attempting to reduce the fracture when he hit the patient up to ten times while a colleague held his head, a medical hearing heard. The patient, known as Patient A, had come to Ipswich Hospital in February 2012 after an industrial accident and been operated on by Prof Peckitt, who is a world-renowned facial surgeon. But he required a second procedure after falling off the bed in hospital which displaced his cheekbone. That's when Prof Peckitt struck the patient while he was under anesthetic. Prof Peckitt, an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo-facial surgery at Ipswich Hospital, claimed he 'digitally manipulated' the patient's face and denied any wrongdoing. But he was 'erased' from the medical register after the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel found that his fitness to practice was impaired. The hearing heard that Patient A could have been blinded by the force of the punches from Professor Peckitt. Chair Dr Ian Spafford said 'under no circumstances' would it be appropriate to apply enough force to potentially damage to the optic nerve. Erica Rapaport, a dental surgeon with more than 30 years experience, said she was told to hold the patient's head before the first punch. She said she was left in 'total shock' and there were gasps from colleagues in the operating theatre as she gave a harrowing account of the procedure. 'He made his hand into a fist and he hit the patient in the face on the left side of his cheek. 'His hand was about six inches away. I think the first time he punched the patient I wasn't holding him and it was then that I was instructed to do so by Prof Peckitt. 'He said that when the patient fell out of bed, the cheekbone which was already fractured was moved outwards so he was trying to re-position it without having to make further cuts to the face. 'He said this at least after the first punch. 'He applied about ten punches like a boxer. He took aim and then punched. 'The first punch was unexpected and then he explained what he was doing. He spoke as he punched again and again.' After graduating in medicine from the University of Sheffield in 1979, Mr Peckitt completed further training with the Royal College of Surgeons of England and became a Fellow of the Australasian College of Cosmetic Surgery in 2009. He has lectured on titanium implants and been published in medical journals so Miss Rapaport said she came into the hospital on her day off to take part in surgery and learn about his renowned techniques. Christopher Hamlet, representing the General Medical Council, previously told the hearing that the case wasn't based on the outcome of the procedure but the method. Professor Peckitt didn't seek advice from colleagues and quit his post days later. He was also alleged to have failed to check the medical records of a second patient, Patient B, which led to him attempting an unnecessary procedure on her, and to have treated another, Patient C, for a complex facial deformity without seeking the advice of another surgeon. At the tribunal in Manchester, Miss Rapaport was asked to clarify the analogy by panel member Dr Shazad Amin who suggested it implied Prof Pickett took a 'larger swing'. Asked if the punch was more 'of a jab', she added: 'I meant he was looking to take aim. Professor Ninian Peckitt had been an Honorary locum consultant at Ipswich Hospital when he punched a patient to correct a broken cheekbone. He later wrote the patient's face had been 'digitally manipulated' 'When I said it was like a boxer I meant he was carefully aiming where he wanted to hit. 'Then he pulled his hand back to get the maximum hit as he touched the patient's face. 'I can remember a feeling of total shock the first time he hit the patient because I wasn't expecting it and I think anyone who saw what happened was reacting in a similar way and then he asked me to assist by holding the patient's head. '[The punches] were his fist aimed at the side of the patient's face. 'He was looking himself and inspecting it and asked if anybody thought the fracture had moved. 'I understand generally it is nice not to have to make an incision but I do not understand the uncontrolled nature of hitting someone. 'I didn't challenge him at the time. I was too shocked.' Miss Rapaport added that following the operation, Prof Peckitt told her to write that the cheek had been adjusted by 'external pressure' in her operating notes. She said: 'Prof Peckitt asked me to write up the note and I felt very challenged by what he had just done. I asked him if he would write it and he said he would dictate the exact words for me to write down. 'He said ""the left malar was adjusted by external pressure"". They were precisely his words. 'I particularly [didn't want to] write the note because accurately I would have had to write ""Prof Peckitt punched the patient to try and move the left zygoma"" and that's not something I would have wanted to do. 'I didn't challenge him. Partly because he is a consultant and partly because I was so shocked that I didn't have the strength to argue. 'I didn't see any damage, I just thought it was a very unusual technique. 'I was holding his head very still. It must have moved a little [when he punched] but not much. 'Prof Peckitt is much stronger than I am so I could only give as much support as I could so it might have moved a little. 'If I asked you to hold something still then I punched it, you don't know how hard someone is going to punch so you don't know how much resistance to apply.' Prof Peckitt has pioneered 'engineering-assisted' surgery techniques and written extensively on the subject, as well as cosmetic surgery. He is now believed to be working as a consultant surgeon in Dubai and elected not to attend the hearing but issued an email in which he 'emphatically denied' the allegations. He claimed he was being 'victimised' but the panel ignored these claims and the professor was struck off. Panel chair Ian Spafford said: 'The Panel has determined that Mr Peckitt's misconduct is fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to practise medicine. 'Therefore, it has determined that, in the particular circumstances of this case, it would not be sufficient nor proportionate to suspend his registration. 'The Panel is of the view that the public interest requires that it be made clear that Mr Peckitt's behaviour is unacceptable in a member of the medical profession. 'The Panel has determined to direct that Mr Peckitt's name be erased from the Medical Register. 'In the light of all the evidence presented to it, it is satisfied that erasure is a proportionate sanction in his case.'","Patient came to Ipswich Hospital after industrial accident in July 2012 .

"A lobster restaurant in Canada has issued a detailed and sincere apology after it was attacked by online commenters for a ban on 'small screaming children'. Lobster Pound and Moore, in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, had posted 'effective as of now, we will no longer allow small screaming children', saying that it 'caters to those who enjoy food and are out to enjoy themselves'. The message, posted last Sunday night, was deleted by Monday morning after a torrent of online abuse came from disgruntled parents. Scroll down for video . Lobster Pound and Moore in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, kicked off a Internet debate when it announced that it would no longer allow 'small screaming children' into its dining room . The Canadian seafood restaurant had said that it was 'an adult themed restaurant that caters to those who enjoy food and are out to enjoy themselves' Commenters began giving the restaurant's Facebook page one-star reviews and said that they would never again set foot in his restaurant. 'Wouldn't grace their doors if they paid me. Their lack of compassion to even post in a professional manner leaves such a bad taste who would bother to try the food!' Sarah Valley said on a poor review. Others said that some adults were far more annoying at restaurants than children and said they took particular offense because children can have tantrums due to special needs conditions such as autism. The restaurant later posted an apology on the page, saying that the 'hate and threats' the owner had received had prompted him to reconsider his policy. It said that it chose the 'wrong words' for its post and that it 'will take any belly that is hungry'. Abuse targeting his restaurant, as well as 'hate and threats' aimed at his family, prompted chef and owner Richard Moore to reverse his policy and make a detailed apology on Facebook . Moore said that he always tries his best to provide for his customers but made an unfortunate choice of words when he called his youngest patrons 'small screaming children' instead of 'Lil diners having a moment' The restaurateur said that he sympathized with parents whose children have tantrums because of special needs conditions such as autism, saying he understands it 'first hand' 'I love kids and would have them if I could. I shouldnt have used the word screaming but should have said something like 'Lil diners having a moment',  the owner Richard Moore said. He continued that he tries to accommodate everyone's dietary needs and 'understands first hand conditions such as autism'. 'I never considered the hate and threats it would bring against not only me but those I love and for that I'm truly sorry . 'I know some may find this silly but I love Cape Breton and moved home to give back. I've disappointed you and myself. 'I will do better even if you don't give me the chance. I was trying to be different and the 'go to ' happening place.' After the owner's heartfelt apology, other Nova Scotia residents and Facebook users voiced support for the no screaming child policy, which is no longer in effect. Some parents took offense at the idea of their children not being allowed to eat at a restaurant because of bad behavior. Others said they would enjoy the peace and quiet of an adult-oriented atmosphere (file photo) The seaside establishment experienced a flurry of reviews both positive and negative after its previous policy got media attention from those for and against small children at restaurants . 'You may have lost some people...but there are plenty who will greatly appreciate such a policy....We just don't whine...

Others said they would appreciate such as policy as a means to get a peaceful, relaxing dinner. 'As a mother of 3 screaming children I support you!!! We never take our children out to restaurants unless it is geared specifically to children and families for that reason. And when my husband and I get out together for a date I don't particularly want to hear kids screaming and parents yelling,' Gina Ledwich said.

"A 19-year-old girl was forced to relearn basic functional skills such as walking, swallowing food and getting dressed after she fell out a fraternity house's window and suffered a traumatic brain injury. Summer Elbardissy was partying at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, last year when she reportedly tried to reach a makeshift roof deck. But instead of making it onto the deck, where students often gathered, she fell out of a third-story window, according to newly-released police reports and a lawsuit filed in the city's Superior Court. Moments later, another teenager heard what 'sounded like a thud hitting the ground'. Miss Elbardissy was discovered lying unconscious on the floor, with her face covered in blood. Scroll down for video . Recovering: Summer Elbardissy (pictured) had to relearn basic functional skills such as walking, swallowing food and getting dressed after she fell out a fraternity house's window and suffered a traumatic brain injury . Frat house: The 19-year-old was reportedly partying at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house (pictured) at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, last year when she tried to reach a makeshift roof desk . The intoxicated sophomore was rushed to St Francis Hospital with serious injuries, including a brain injury and swelling, a broken skull and pelvis, and lung bruising, the Hartford Courant reported. She was forced to undergo intubation and had to relearn how to walk, according to a GoFundMe page that was set up by  Miss Elbardissy's mother, Inas Morsi, after last September's accident. She also had to be taught by a therapist how to swallow food, brush her teeth, get dressed and wash herself, it is reported. Seven months on, she is apparently still recovering from the fall. On the fundraising page, which has raised more than $44,000 for the teenager, Ms Morsi has described her daughter as a 'fighter', adding: 'this is just another battle that she will overcome.' In November, she wrote: 'This is a special Thanksgiving for our family. We are thankful for so many things. We are especially thankful for all of the support you have shown us for Summer.' And Miss Elbardissy herself appears to be in good spirits - over the past few months, she has posted smiling photos and positive messages on her Facebook and Instagram pages on a regular basis. Injured: Instead of making it onto the deck, where students often gathered, Miss Elbardissy (pictured with a companion in a Facebook photo) fell out of a third-story window, according to newly-released police reports . Sophomore: Miss Elbardissy (pictured, left and right, in Facebook photos) was rushed to St Francis Hospital with serious injuries, including brain swelling, a broken skull, hip and pelvis and bruising on her lung . The fall was not the first notable incident to have occurred at Beta Theta Pi, which is not recognized by Wesleyan University as a fraternity and was once dubbed 'the rape factory' in a lawsuit. In 2010, a student alleged that she was sexually assaulted at the fraternity house, while another claimed to have been raped by a non-student on the premises in 2013, according to WFSB. In Miss Elbardissy's case, police were apparently already at the house investigating a noise complaint when she fell. They were alerted to her fate at around 1.15am on September 7. Miss Elbardissy was reportedly drunk at the time. As the officers waited for medics to arrive at the scene, they had beer poured over them out of a window by fraternity members, it is alleged. Fall: She was forced to undergo intubation and had to relearn how to walk, swallow food and get dressed, it is reported. Above, a clip from a news report at the time. Miss Elbardissy fell out of one of these windows . 'A really nice girl': The fall was not the first notable incident to have occurred at Beta Theta Pi, which is not recognized by Wesleyan University as a fraternity. Above,  Miss Elbardissy is seen in a Facebook photo . Following the incident, Wesleyan ordered students to stay away from the fraternity house, saying it had 'lost confidence in the ability of the fraternity members to manage social activities at the house'. Meanwhile, the national Beta Theta Pi fraternity suspended the Wesleyan Mu Epsilon chapter. It is believed that the fraternity is still out of bounds for students at the private liberal arts college. Now, Miss Elbardissy has filed a lawsuit against the fraternity and Wesleyan via her lawyer. The 24-page document accuses the university of failing to protect her from the dangers at the frat house. It alleges the college turned a blind eye to a number of safety violations at the house - including the roof deck, which the fraternity used 'openly and obviously' - despite warnings from city officials, . University: Now, Miss Elbardissy has filed a lawsuit against the fraternity and Wesleyan (pictured) via her lawyer. The document accuses the university of failing to protect her from the dangers at the frat house. Fundraising: A GoFundMe page (pictured), set up by Miss Elbardissy's mother, has raised more than $44,000 . This deck, featuring 'unsecured plywood', was negligent, created a public nuisance and led to Miss Elbardissy's fall, claims the lawsuit, which is seeking an unspecified amount of money in damages. Last year, police ruled that the fall was an accident. At the time, Wesleyan said: 'Our thoughts are with the injured student, who is improving, and we hope for a full and speedy recovery.' Eyewitnesses described the incident as 'pretty terrifying' and Miss Elbardissy, 'a really nice girl'. No one has been charged in the incident. Miss Elbardissy's lawyer declined to comment to the Courant.","Summer Elbardissy was partying at the Beta Theta Pi frat house last year .

"An elderly couple has spent four years living in the shadows after being forced to board up their windows because of constant anti-social behaviour. Charles Kingham, 86, and partner Pauline Moore, 68, have been together for 40 years and bought their home in the quiet Lincolnshire seaside resort of Mablethorpe for £35,000 in 1987. They spent two years converting it into their dream home, but it became a 'living hell' after it was converted into an integrated offender management centre, which deals with persistent criminals. Scroll down for video . Board stiff: The couple have been forced to board up every window in their home for protection . The pair have both suffered health problems as a result of the stress the ordeal has put them under. Mr Kingham, who served in the Merchant Navy and ran his own timber company before retiring, said: 'The biggest fear for me is going to bed and wondering if we are going to wake up if something is thrown through the letter box. 'We sit here sometimes and think how we have had such a wonderful life. 'But this is misery, absolute misery and nobody wants to do anything. That is the modern world.' Ms Moore claimed the problems started when people started selling drugs nearby and would walk up their garden path 'high'. Incidents intensified when the couple reported anti-social behaviour in the area. They were targeted on an almost weekly basis, with vandals smashing windows with stones and pelting their home with eggs and golf balls. The thugs even splashed cooking fat across the walls and path, urinated on their flowers and keyed their car. At least they have each other: The couple have been together for 40 years despite 'misery' caused by thugs . Every single window of their home has been smashed and the couple eventually got so sick of having to spend time and money replacing them that they took drastic measures. The pair spent £700 on wood and boarded up the house for protection. They have been living in the shadows ever since. And although the house should be worth £100,000, the couple believe they would have to sell for a knock-down price of £60,000 to escape the darkness. Retired office worker Ms Moore sobbed: 'This house was a dream home but our life has been made a living hell. 'We can't sell and are just stuck here so we've barricaded ourselves in. It's the only thing we could think of doing to stop the abuse. 'We have both got so low. I have developed a heart condition through anxiety. 'When they were banging on the windows, Charles went down with a chest infection because of the stress. I thought he was going to die. Dark days: Mr Kingham has to perform normal daily tasks in constant gloom since boarding up his home . 'The trouble started four years ago when the old lady who lived next door died and the house was turned into an integrated offender management centre. 'It was basically for offenders coming out of prison. We didn't have a problem with that at first but suddenly people in the area started selling drugs and coming up our garden path high and even urinating on it. 'We reported it to the police and ever since then we have been plagued with problems. 'The police have been down and seen the damage caused. We've had a pan of chip fat put on the wall of the house and we had our little red Ford Fiesta completely keyed down both sides. Keen reader Mr Kingham (left) has been forced to read in a dark room since they boarded up the windows (right) 'In November there was a big party nearby and at 3am people were banging on our windows and shouting. 'We've had eggs and golf balls thrown at our bungalow and three of our windows are still chipped. 'We didn't report every incident to the police because we thought we'd just sell up and we hoped it would all stop but it has just got worse. 'We decided enough was enough and got the windows boarded up because it's the only thing we could think of to do to protect ourselves. 'We have boarded up the two windows in the lounge, the two in the bedroom and the kitchen. The only ones that aren't boarded are the dining room and bathroom. 'It is quite dark inside and not nice sitting in total darkness when the weather is lovely but it was the only alternative and we do feel safer. Better days: The couple enjoying life on a holiday to the USA in the 1990s before the problems started . 'We could sell our bungalow which is not what we want to do. 'By law you have to declare anti-social behaviour so even though it is worth £100,000 we would probably only be able to sell it for £60,000.' Mr Kingham added: 'We are compiling a full report of incidents against our home but I fear it won't make much difference. Boarding the windows seemed the most common sense thing to do.' Lincolnshire Police and East Lindsey District Council confirmed they were aware of the attacks on the couple's home. Jon Challen, community safety team leader at East Lindsey District Council, said: 'Both the council and police take all reports of antisocial behaviour very seriously. 'Both agencies are working closely together on this matter but at this time there is no evidence that any offence has been committed.' A spokesperson for Lincolnshire Police added: 'The local neighbourhood policing team are aware of the couple and the allegations of anti-social behaviour. 'Lincolnshire Police take all reports of ASB seriously and, together with partners at other agencies, have robust systems in place to assist those affected and identify the most vulnerable. 'To date in this case, no offences have been identified but police and ASB officers from East Lindsey District Council continue to offer support to Ms Moore and will investigate each reported allegation.'","Charles Kingham, 86, and Pauline Moore, 68, had their home pelted with eggs, stones and even cooking fat on a weekly basis .

"She typically commands attention. But on Tuesday, Kim Kardashian was cropped out of a photo for what may be the first time ever. The 34-year-old reality TV star was captured dining in a non-kosher restaurant in the Holy Land alongside her husband, rapper Kanye West, 37, and Jerusalem's mayor, Nir Barkat, on Monday. Following the outing, Mr Barkat posted a photo of him and the famous couple on his Twitter page, writing that he had joined Kanye and Kim 'to toast and celebrate hosting them in our beautiful city.' However, the next day, only Kanye and Mr Barkat were pictured in the photo, reprinted in an article on the ultra-Orthodox news site, Hakikar. Kim, meanwhile, was obscured by a copy of the $692 bill. Scroll down for video .

The article itself - which condemned Mr Barkat for dining at a non-kosher venue and for the pricey bill (including tip) - referred to Kim as  'the wife' of singer Kanye,  the Washington Post reported. Ultra-conservative Jewish news organizations typically avoid printing photos of women because they deem them sexual in nature - and have cropped other famous females out of photos in the past. Kim and Kanye were visiting the Israeli capital on Monday with their 22-month-old daughter, North, and Kim's sister, Khloe, in order to baptize their little girl at the site of Jesus Christ's crucifixion. Although they were perhaps not portrayed favorably in the Hakikar article - which was headlined 'Barkat hosts famous couple in non-kosher restaurant' - not all of the press shared the same view. Other photographers enthusiastically followed reality TV's first family as they visited Jerusalem's Old City - the reputed location of Jesus's death - to go to the Armenian church, St James Cathedral.

Above, Mr Barkat's initial tweet . Clearly overwhelmed and honored by the pilgrimage, Kim took to Instagram to share a couple of pictures from inside the holy building, revealing the family had had an early start to visit the site. 'Good morning Jerusalem! We woke up really early to see the site where the crucifixion of Jesus Christ took place,' she wrote. The image showed the ornate interior of the 12th century church. A second shot posted on the star's Instagram page showed herself and Kanye crouching under the statue of Jesus Christ on the crucifix. But as it was heavily filtered, the couple were hard to see. The centuries-old church in the Holy Land was the location of choice for the Kardashian-Wests for the baptism of their toddler daughter. And as they approached the  building, they fended off fans. Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, an Armenian church official who appeared slightly perplexed by all the commotion over the high-profile couple, revealed the family had arrived for a baptism ceremony.

'Kim Kardashian's daughter will be baptized and become a Christian officially and a member of the Armenian church,' Shirvanian said, adding: 'All I know is that she's a famous personality.' A source told E! that Khloe, who attended the ceremony in sneakers and ripped jeans, is North's godmother while the priest acted as her godfather (which is an option where there isn't one). The insider described the ceremony as 'so special'. North was dressed in a white gown and her father was wearing the same colour. Kim opted for a striped wrap-around dress and flat sandals. Afterwards, the family dined with Mr Barkat at Mona Restaurant. Members of the family had touched down Monday in the Holy Land via private jet for what was described as a private two-day visit.

At the time, it was reported that the women were likely removed from the historic image, taken on January 11, so the newspaper would not offend its highly devout Orthodox readers. Swiss President, Simonetta Sommaru, was left as a blur behind a crowd of faces, while the EU's foreign affairs and security chief, Frederica Mogherini, was left out entirely.

"It is easy to be envious of celebrities who upload luxurious photos on Instagram from their private planes or VIP lounges. But a life spent criss-crossing the globe isn't always as exciting and glamorous as we may think. Proving that stars aren't immune to the everyday problems the average traveller faces, professional golfer Russell Henley received a lot of sympathy when United Airlines - the official carrier of the PGA - apparently 'lost' his clubs. He is not the only one to have had a less-than-ideal experience, with Kim Kardashian, Colleen Rooney and Maisie Williams joining the ranks of irritated travellers. Pro-golfer Russell Henley flew to Georgia last Sunday - sadly his golf clubs did not . Russell Henley tweeted his frustration to United Airlines, who misplaced his golf clubs when he was en route to the Master's tournament this week . RUSSELL HENLEY . Starring in the Master's golf tournament in Georgia this week is one of the highlights of a pro-golfer's professional years. Russell Henley flew in for the prestigious competition last Sunday to prepare - however his golf clubs did not. But, ever the professional, the sportsman didn't have a meltdown on Twitter, he simply used his social media site to point out that he had a 'tourney' to play in this week. Clearly, his cool-headed response paid off and just six hours later, United returned his clubs to him. Henley was quick to thank the airline and even apologised 'for the mix-up'. Naomi Campbell at the airport from a flight from London. The model flew into a rage when her suitcases were not loaded onto her plane and demanded the captain find them and personally show them to her . NAOMI CAMPBELL . The jetsetting model is infamous for her temper and it seems she was not impressed when informed she was among passengers whose bags had failed to be loaded on a British Airways flight from London to Los Angeles in April 2008. The captain made the decision to personally speak to her to apologise for the error, but the model flew into a rage at the mishap, which happened shortly after the disastrous opening of BA's Terminal 5 at Heathrow - when problems with baggage systems meant many passengers were forced to fly without their luggage. Uxbridge Magistrates' Court heard how the model shouted at the captain saying: 'I can't believe you have lost my f****** bag. Bring me my f****** bags now.' When he walked off she was reported to shout after him claiming: 'You are a racist. You wouldn't be doing this if I was white.' She was later forcibly removed from the plane by police with whom she had a further confrontation. She later pleaded guilty to two counts of assaulting a police officer, one count of disorderly conduct likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress and using threatening, abusive words or behaviour. The star was fined £2,300, ordered to pay £200 in compensation to the police officers she attacked, £150 to the BA captain and complete 200 hours of community service. Stark reality of flying: The Game of Thrones star was banned from the British Airways business lounge for not being 18 . Maisie Williams, who plays the sword-wielding Arya Stark, hit back at British Airways for their no under-18s rule . MAISIE WILLIAMS . Despite holding her own in Westeros, it appears Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams, who plays the feisty Arya Stark, cannot be trusted in the British Airways business lounge. As she was under the age of 18, the actress and business class traveller was forced to spend her time at the airport away from the comforts of the lounge, which includes meals, drinks and even exclusive spa treatments. Although she was adamant she did not want special treatment and it was more the principle that she was old enough to travel, but not old enough to sit in the lounge, the airline did not budge on the rules. BA simply tweeted back with the reply: 'Hi Maisie. We're sorry if you were disappointed, lounge guests must be 18 or older. We look forward to welcoming you soon.' The reply was not enough for Maisie: 'Yes.. @British_Airways fully understand that, my question is why? Why can we travel alone but not use the lounge? It makes no sense.' British Airways then explained it was because the business class lounges offer a self-service complimentary bar stocked with alcohol which is not monitored by staff round the clock. Pro-golfer Rory Mcilroy also had his clubs lost by United Airlines when he flew into the Dublin ahead of the Irish Open . A similar twitter complaint query from the golfer saw his clubs swiftly returned to him for the competition . RORY MCILROY . Russell Henley was not the only golfer to have lost his prized possession. Rory McIlroy, who won both the PGA and the Open Championships last year, similarly had his golf clubs lost by United Airlines as he flew into Dublin ahead of the Irish Open last year. Once again, the sporting world proved just how polite its stars could be. McIlroy simply tweeted: 'Hey @United landed in Dublin yesterday morning from Newark and still no golf clubs... sort of need them this week... can someone help!?' Following the plea, they were returned to him, and he even managed a United related pun with his follow-up tweet showing his gratitude. No special treatment for the Rooneys: Last year Coleen and her family received their bags two days late, with items missing, after their flight to Las Vegas from London Heathrow . Coleen expressed her horror over twitter that many items were missing from her cases . COLEEN ROONEY . Coleen Rooney accused British Airways staff of 'ransacking' her designer luggage as she flew with the airline to Sin City in June last year for a family holiday. The wife of famous footballer Wayne Rooney, received her suitcase two days late and then reportedly found that items had been stolen from her belongings. She tweeted: 'Bags, shoes, bikinis, clothes, toiletries, underwear, pj's, make up, toiletries taken. Disgusting & the customer service getting is terrible.' The issue was a result of a computer glitch at Heathrow Terminal 5, which caused conveyor belts which loaded bags onto planes to shut down. Staff were left having to load the bags manually, but were not able to keep up with the busy flight schedules, resulting in many planes departing without bags being loaded. Heathrow declined to comment on Mrs Rooney's situation but British Airways said they had contacted Mrs Rooney to begin an investigation into the incident. Mrs Rooney faced a string of sarcastic comments from some of her followers who commented that she could probably afford to replace the items. But she angrily replied that the money wasn't the issue, tweeting: 'And you can stick all the sarcastic comments about money. It's not all about money it's about people going through my personal stuff and taking stuff that I need for my holiday'. Black and blue: Kelly Osbourne received a black eye on her Delta flight to LA as someone reclined their chair too far back . The daughter of Ozzy Osbourne expressed her anger over twitter to her followers . KELLY OSBOURNE . The Fashion Police star suffered an altogether more unusual plane nightmare when she received a black eye on her Delta flight to Los Angeles back in 2012. The star tweeted saying:' Really?The asshole infront of me almost knocked me out putting her seat back Might get a black eye Im going2 kick her seat all the way to LA.' It turns out her prediction was correct as she later tweeted the result of the rogue action, which appeared to show a bruise forming under on eye. The star continued to document her displeasure and the result of her 'seat kicking' payback. She wrote: 'After kicking her seat form giving me a black she confronted me and laughed at the fact she gave me a black eye!' And it seems Osbourne wasn't happy with the airline either - although she did praise the staff. She later tweeted: 'Thank you so much Delta 4 this wonderful black eye Fix your f****** seats Getting smashed in the face w/ a tv is so fun' 'Regardless to how s*** @delta is the stewardess really looked after me! She was amazing!' Kim Kardashian had her luggage opened and items taken on her flight to Cannes with British Airways . The star, who now has 30 million followers on Twitter said some of the missing items were irreplaceable . KIM KARDASHIAN . It seems even the Kardashians suffer from airport woes as they jet-set around the world. Kim Kardashian accused British Airways of searching her bags and 'removing' items when flying to Cannes three years ago. Kim tweeted her frustration to her millions of fans saying she wished we could return to the days of locking suitcases on flight. 'Very disappointed in British Airways for opening my luggage & taking some special items of mine!Some things are sentimental &not replaceable.' The star went on to claim staff at the airport may have taken several handbags and 'priceless' sunglasses she inherited from her late father. A spokesman for BA said at the time: 'We are continuing to investigate this matter. 'Our customer travelled from Nice to Heathrow Terminal 5 to Los Angeles. 'Terminal 5 has some of the most sophisticated automated baggage systems in the world, which are able to monitor bags every minute of their time in the terminal. 'At this stage, we have discovered no evidence to suggest that the bag in question was interfered with at Heathrow. 'Our investigation is also seeking to establish details of the bag's passage through Nice and Los Angeles airports.' Alyssa Milano found fame on the series Who's The Boss, before starring in ABC series Mistresses . TV actress Alyssa Milano was told that she had to abide to the . ALYSSA MILANO . Mistresses and Charmed actress Alyssa Milano was banned from taking her breast milk on a flight on Thursday. Security staff said the amount was over the regulatory liquid amount, but it would have been permitted had her baby been with her. The 42-year-old mum took to twitter to call Heathrow Airport out on their actions, querying why this was the case, as she wouldn't even need to pump if her baby was there. The airport replied that there was not an exception to the rule and each individual container within the bag must have a maximum capacity no greater than 100ml.","Celebrities can make travel seem effortless and glamorous on social media .

They've been taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. Shortly after, a 27-year-old woman with arm injuries and a six-year-old girl suffering from abdominal pain were also being flown out. The three car pileup happened at on the Brisbane Valley Highway, near Fernvale . Six others - including an infant and two young girls - have been taken to Ipswich Hospital with minor injuries or for further assessment. A man has also suffered hand lacerations and two females escaped injuries. The affected stretch of the highway has been closed off, with diversions in place south of Fernvale. The Courier-Mail reports that earlier emergency crews found one person trapped inside their vehicle and Queensland Fire and Rescue crews used hydraulic cutting gear to free them.

"The boat that sank in the Mediterranean killing 400 migrants capsized when desperate passengers surged to one side because they thought they were about to be rescued, it emerged yesterday. Survivors said the two-deck vessel ‘flipped’ after a commercial ship was spotted and men on the deck ran to one side, the sudden movement and weight pitching them into the sea. Hundreds of terrified women and children sheltering from the cold in the hull were trapped and died as water surged in and the boat turned upside down. Saved: Dozens of migrants are brought ashore at Corigliano harbor in Italy after they were rescued from a shipwreck which killed 400 others . The trauma of their ordeal is clear to see as the African migrants wait to be assess by medics after disembarking from their coastguard vessel . Survivors told charity workers that as many as 400 others perished and Italian coastguards said today that no more had been found alive . The commercial ship was unaware of the unfolding disaster and went on its journey, leaving men, women and children in the water before an Italian naval vessel arrived at the site some 80 miles south of the island of Lampedusa. Dazed, scared and exhausted survivors, including several children, were taken to Lampedusa and ports in Sicily, Calabria and Tunisia. Two babies on the harbour side were wrapped in blankets – one in a makeshift cot – and carried in the arms of aid workers. As searches continued for survivors yesterday, Federico Fossi, a UN refugee agency spokesman in Italy, said 145 people had been rescued, all from sub-Saharan countries, and nine bodies had been recovered. Joel Millman, from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said: ‘According to testimonies, at least one-third of the passengers were women and children. At the time of the shipwreck, they were staying in the hull of the boat to be better protected from the cold. ‘When the men on the deck became restless and started moving about because a rescue boat was beginning to approach them, the boat capsized and water flooded the hull. Women and children died immediately.’ The death toll is the largest in the region since October 2013 and came as 42 boats, coming mainly from Libya and North Africa and carrying 5,110 migrants – including 317 unaccompanied children – were rescued in just 48 hours trying to make the hazardous crossing to Europe. Perilous journey: In a tragic twist, the boat appears to have overturned because of the excitement caused by the sighting of rescuers . Lucky few: Coastguard spokesman Filippo Marini said they had not found any more 'survivors or anything else to indicate more victims' Shell-shocked: A man is escorted by an Italian Financial police from the tanker Maria Bottiglieri at the port of Corigliano Calabro . As the survivors were brought ashore, Amnesty International accused the EU for scrapping rescue operations in the Mediterranean . Health checks: Rescued men, women and children are processed after arriving at the southern Italian port of Corigliano in Italy . The disaster has focused attention on the controversial decision to stop Italian naval patrols – which last year rescued 170,000 migrants – and replace them with a smaller European policing and surveillance mission. Yesterday the British-based Save the Children called on the leaders of UK political parties to commit to ‘restart the rescue’ operations. Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth said: ‘Our political leaders cannot ignore the fact that without search and rescue we are allowing thousands of innocent children and their families to drown off the coast of Europe. ‘How many thousands must die this summer before Europe acts?’ Recent good weather in the Mediterranean and renewed violence in Libya have prompted a big increase in the numbers trying to reach Italy. Many who make it have told horrific stories of their barbaric exploitation by people smugglers, who they accuse of rape, murder and torture. One 17-year-old Eritrean boy told Save the Children officials: ‘In Libya we only ate once a day. ‘We were continuously beaten up, in some cases with iron bars. I saw people cut off the heads of Christian people.’ Officials say the disaster has taken the number of migrants lost at sea in the area this year to 900, compared with 17 in the same period last year. An increasingly violent and chaotic situation in Libya has added to the problem, with unpoliced ports allowing people smugglers a free hand .

"They’re the ultimate status symbol for the ultra-rich, but superyacht owners or charter clients aren’t content to just sip margaritas in the sun or watch films in their on-board cinemas. They spare no expense or detail when they throw extravagant parties and they go to great lengths to one-up fellow members of the world’s one per cent or impress their celebrity guests. Money is no object to those who like to flaunt their massive wealth at sea, and that means sales and charter brokerages are kept busy with outrageous requests for everything from high-end food and entertainment to luxurious decor and special guests. Scroll down for video . Superyachts can sell for more than £50million, while others cost more than £400,000 a week to charter . Henry Smith, a sales broker with Cecil Wright, a boutique yacht brokerage with offices in Monaco and London, said: ‘You do get some pretty unusual requests. The strange ones are demanding, particularly when food has to be sent from one place to another at the last minute. ‘When you’re doing requests like this you’re paying considerably more than if you were to organise it in advance. But then again, as people say, this is yachting.’ In a fast-pace world where brokers expect the unexpected, these are some of the most outrageous requests from superyacht owners and charter clients. One superyacht owner threw a party with two live tigers, allowing guests to pose for photos with the animals . Two caged tigers . A Life of Pi situation was avoided when an owner from Europe threw a party with two live Siberian tigers on board. Under the care of trained professionals, the tigers were held in glass cages on the aft deck, allowing partygoers to pose for selfies with the animals in the background. Mr Smith said the biggest challenges were sorting out the insurance and paperwork, and lifting the tigers onto the superyacht. Hoisting caged tigers onto a yacht isn’t covered by the normal premiums. Mr Smith said: ‘Getting them physically onto the yacht was an issue because they had to lift them using cranes. ‘The people who owned the tigers were wary to allow other people to operate the machinery, and it took several weeks of paperwork once we found a specialist insurer.’ Mr Smith said the tigers were rented from a circus and were taken off the yacht after the party ended. He said: ‘It went off without a hitch in the end, but it was an awful lot of work on our end. But that’s what we do, that’s what we’re paid for.’ Cecil Wright arranged for fresh fruit and vegetables to be flown from the French Riviera to the Maldives . Special delivery – from France to the Maldives . It’s the comforts of home that people miss the most when they travel for long periods, but that isn’t a problem for the world’s super-rich. One client had a week’s worth of fruit and vegetables sent from their favourite shop in the South of France straight to their superyacht in the Maldives. Of course, the container had a travel experience that most people will never have – it was flown from France to the island nation in the Indian Ocean by private jet. Once it arrived in the Maldives it was loaded into a helicopter and delivered to the superyacht, where it landed on one of its decks. Mr Smith said there was ‘nothing fancy’ about the food, which arrived undamaged and fresh. The owner just wanted a familiar taste from back home. He said: ‘The value of the food on the flight was significant less than the value of the flight.’ Three 'A-list' musical acts were hired to perform at a private party that took four months to plan . Party on a desert island . One client wanted to have a huge party on a deserted island for 80 friends and family members, so a team of engineers had to be flown out to set up a stage and other amenities. The private party featured performances by three ‘A-list’ musical acts from the UK and US (Mr Smith wasn’t at liberty to reveal their identities), who were flown in by private jet and helicopter. Mr Smith said it took four months of planning and three weeks to build the venue. This included flying in generators to power the sound and lighting systems, a professional grade kitchen and living accommodation for the construction crew. Some owners have built classrooms on board and hired teachers for around-the-world voyages . Sailing around the world in a floating classroom . Superyacht owners don’t let their children’s education get in the way of their ambitious plans for an around-the-world family holiday. They bring the classroom – and the teacher – with them. Mr Smith said some owners have had small classrooms built within their superyachts so their children can keep up with their studies. They have also hired teachers to deliver lessons while travelling to some of the most exotic places on Earth. For the teachers, it is an incredible way to see the world while getting paid and not having to pay for a home or utility bills. Mr Smith said: ‘[Salary] varies enormously on things such as age and the amount of holiday they get, but you’d be looking at certainly a minimum of £50,000.’ Great French Bake Off . Baking an eight-tier cake is a very complex and time-consuming process, and a boulangerie in the South of France had just 24 hours to prepare one after a ‘last-minute’ request. The cake, decorated with edible flowers, was prepared in a hurry for a guest’s birthday party in Saint-Tropez in the French Riviera. Mr Smith said: ‘They were working flat-out to make this thing, and it required a lot of convincing on our part to convince them to do it. ‘This eight-tier monster cake looked like a bouquet almost, with lots of very intricately designed and hand-cut edible flowers. It was impressive to say the least.’ One crew had just two hours to blow up 2,500 pink and silver balloons for a girl's birthday party . ‘A sea of pink and silver’ Sticking with the birthday theme, Cecil Wright once received a request to organise a surprise birthday party for an owner’s granddaughter. The crew had just two hours to blow up 2,500 pink and silver balloons, using compressed air tanks, as it was the only time the youngster was off the vessel. Mr Smith said: ‘They finished just in time. It was a huge panic and a rush, and they had to bring in a few guys to help from other yachts. It was just a sea of pink and silver.’ Two owners exchanged a Steinway grand piano, but it had to be dismantled and transported across Europe . The world's toughest piano move? When one owner (let’s call him Mr X) purchased a €70million (£50million) superyacht it had a Steinway grand piano on board. But he was not a fan, so he gifted the beautiful piano to his friend (who we’ll call Mr Y). The only problem was that Mr X’s yacht was in Spain and Mr Y’s was in Germany. Instead of waiting until the yachts were in the same port, a team from Steinway was brought in to dismantle the piano, package it and transport it across Europe to Mr Y’s yacht, where they put it together. The cost of dismantling and moving the piano was nearly the same as purchasing a new one. Cecil Wright arranged the installation of a squash court on a helipad that lowers with the press of a button . Squash at sea . Cecil Wright was responsible for installing the world’s first squash court on a superyacht. The full-size court was set up on a helipad that can be lowered with the press of a button when it’s not in use. It is a permanent fixture on the ship, and doubles as a helicopter hangar. New destination, new wardrobe . One couple hated travelling with luggage so much that they don’t bother anymore, and they get a new wardrobe delivered every time they embark on a new voyage. Mr Smith said: ‘Whenever they arrive all their clothes from the previous time are removed and new clothes are added.’ In addition to the latest fashions, the couple travels with an entourage that includes a hair stylist, nail technician, a doctor and maid.","Superyacht owners spare no expense when they throw extravagant parties .

"David Cameron's manifesto pledge to dramatically extend Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy was this morning attacked as a 'deeply unfair' bribe which will cost taxpayers billions of pounds. In a bold pitch to working class voters, the Prime Minister said the Tories would offer discounts of up to 70 per cent to  1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home. But the National Housing Federation said the subsidy - which will be funded by forcing councils to sell off their most expensive properties - will cost taxpayers £5.8billion and was effectively worth £100,000 to each family who benefited. Scroll down for video . Thatcher's plan: Prime Minister David Cameron will announce an extension of the right-to-buy scheme which will allow all 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home . The Chartered Institute of Housing, meanwhile, said the move would do nothing to tackle the housing crisis - and could even make it worse by cutting the number of low-cost social homes available for poor families. Labour jumped on the remarks this morning, claiming the policy had 'unravelled' and pointed to figures showing that last year just 479 council homes were sold off – raising £100million, or 2 per cent of the funds promised by the Tories. But the Home Secretary Theresa May defended the policy on the BBC this morning – insisting it was affordable and would give families the opportunity  to live in a home that they owned. She said: 'It is a very important policy because it shows what sort of government a Conservative government would be. It shows that we're a government that's on the side of working people who want to get on a build a better future for themselves and their families.' Unveiling the Conservative manifesto this morning, Mr Cameron declared the 'dream of a property-owning democracy is alive'. He said: 'The next Conservative government will extend the right-to-buy to all housing association tenants in this country – 1.3million extra families – a new generation given the security of a home of their own.' Original plan: The right-to-buy scheme became Lady Thatcher's most famous single policy . The pledge to extend right-to-buy, which was introduced in 1980 but has now been stopped in its tracks by Labour in Wales and the SNP in Scotland, will delight the Tory faithful, who were buoyed last night by a six-point poll lead over Labour. But the policy was branded 'deeply unfair' by housing associations and industry experts today. National Housing Federation director Ruth Davison said the extension of Right to Buy to housing association properties was 'the wrong solution to our housing crisis'. She said: 'A very conservative estimate of this policy puts the cost to the taxpayer of at least £5.8billion. 'Following 40 years of successive governments' failure to build the homes the country needs, soaring rents and house prices and the biggest baby boom since the 1950s, ensuring that there enough homes today and tomorrow must be our nation's top priority.' She added: 'Halfway through a programme of austerity and in the grips of a housing crisis, if you had £20 billion of taxpayers' money, would you just give it away as a gift to some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents?' Gavin Smart, deputy chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said the move would do nothing to tackle the housing crisis. He said: 'In fact it could make things worse for people on lower incomes who are already struggling to access a decent home at a price they can afford. 'Individual tenants might benefit from the opportunity to own a home, but we would be very concerned that it would result in a dramatic loss of vital social and affordable housing. 'The Conservatives say that forcing councils to sell off their most valuable properties would fund this extension plus 400,000 new homes over five years – we fear the figures simply won't stack up.' Samantha Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne listen to Prime Minister David Cameron as he unveils the Conservative party manifesto in Swindon this morning . He added: 'And it could have a huge impact on councils' ability to build new homes, particularly in more expensive areas like London and the south east, where it might actually make more sense for them to borrow against the value of these properties so they can fund more homes.' Senior Tory figures, including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson and David Davis, have been calling for the measure to be at the heart of the party's manifesto. The original right-to-buy saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates. Leading to a surge in home ownership, it became Lady Thatcher's most famous single policy. Labour's shadow housing minister attacked the Tory policy today . The Coalition government has already increased right-to-buy discounts for council homes, meaning more are moving into the private sector. But most tenants living in homes provided by housing associations – not-for-profit bodies that have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing – do not qualify. Enabling them to buy their homes is expected to require major changes to the 1996 Housing Act, and is likely to be fiercely opposed by housing associations themselves. As well as promoting home ownership, the scheme could also dramatically reduce the vast housing benefit bill. Currently, taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in housing association properties. The 1.3million housing association homes are occupied by 2.75million people. Mr Cameron said: 'At the heart of this manifesto is a simple proposition. We are the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your life. 'If you're a young person looking for training, if you're looking for a decent job, if you want to buy your own home, if you're raising a family and need help with childcare, if you fall ill, and need to rely on our NHS, if you are reaching retirement, and want real security. We are there for you – offering security at every stage of your life.' Some Labour figures, including former welfare minister Frank Field and former Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, have previously championed the idea of extending the right-to-buy to housing associations. How does right-to-buy work? Introduced in 1980, it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home. Labour dropped its opposition to the policy but, in 1999, Tony Blair's government cut the top discount from £50,000 to £38,000 and sales slowed. What has the Coalition done? It has sought to reinvigorate the scheme, cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of £77,000 for most areas. Are housing association tenants covered? Housing associations – autonomous, not-for-profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low-cost homes – are largely exempt. However, around 800,000 HA tenants have a limited 'right to acquire' with discounts capped at between £9,000 to £16,000. The other 500,000 tenants lack any right to buy. What are the Tory proposals? They would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right-to-buy. Tenants in houses would get a 35 per cent discount, increasing by 1 per cent for every extra year they have been a tenant. Those in flats will get a 50 per cent discount, going up 2 per cent every year. Discounts for houses and flats would be capped at the lower of 70 per cent or £102,700 in London and £77,000 across the rest of England. How will this be paid for? The Tories say they will make councils sell off expensive properties when they become vacant. Council homes that rank in the most costly third of all properties of that type in their area will be sold off. Around 15,000 such properties become vacant each year, because tenants die or move. The sell-off could net £4.5billion a year. What about the proceeds? They will be split, with a proportion used to replace on a 'one-to-one' basis the council homes sold off. The new properties would be more affordable, probably in less expensive locations, and could be built either by a council or housing association. Another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right-to-buy discounts for housing association tenants. The rest would go to create a £1billion fund, enabling councils to bid for cash to develop brownfield land for housing. It would enable them to clean up derelict or contaminated land, and could lead to 400,000 new homes in five years, Tories say.","David Cameron announces extension to right-to-buy housing policy .

"A huge Marine Corps helicopter made an emergency landing on a Southern California beach on Wednesday, bringing no damages or injuries but leaving an unforgettable spectacle for surrounding swimmers and sunbathers. The CH-53E Super Stallion landed on the shore of this northern San Diego County town shortly after 11:30am after a low oil-pressure indicator light went on in the cockpit, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar said in a statement. The 100-foot copter is twice the size of the humpback whales that sometimes wash up on surrounding shores. It crouched on the sand below a bluff and only a few yards from the surf line, dwarfing surfboard-topped lifeguard vehicles parked nearby. Scroll down for video . Makeshift airport: A Marine Corps helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing on a Southern California beach Wednesday morning . Emergency light: The CH-53E Super Stallion's crew landed on the beach in northern San Diego County after a low oil-pressure indicator light came on the in the cockpit . Clean up: The crew and other local authorities cleaned up oil on the beach which dripped from the plane after the landing on Wednesday around 11:30am . Bing Bush and his wife, Julie, who live in a cliffside complex overlooking the beach, were in for a surprise when they stepped out their front door. 'We were just coming down for a beach walk - we come down here quite a bit - and lo and behold there's a chopper on the beach,' Bing said, after posing for a photo in front of the chopper with his wife. 'We thought maybe it was a movie shot or a movie set or something like that.' The precautionary landing came during routine training, Gunnery Sgt. Donald Bohanner said.  The Marines and a local hazardous materials team removed oil that leaked from the copter to the beach, Bohanner said. All good: No one was injured in the landing and the helicopter was fine to later take off and return to Miramar Air Station . Mammouth: The CH-53E Super Stallion is the largest and heaviest helicopter currently being used by the U.S. military . 'There was no injuries, no damage to any property, no injuries to any civilians, which was an awesome, awesome thing right there,' Bohanner said. J.D. Kalt, a 10-year-old who came to the beach with his mother and some friends to check out the helicopter, was amazed by its size. He had his mother take a cellphone photo of him with his two friends in front of the massive aircraft and then bounced around in the sand staring as Marine mechanics wearing flight suits and helmets scrambled atop the chopper. 'It's huge! I like military and Navy, so I might fly one of those someday,' he said. Four hours after the landing, gawkers gathered to watch it take off again and head back to the Miramar base amid a storm of sand and a deafening roar. The helicopter is the largest and heaviest in the U.S. military. It has three engines, can travel at more than 170 mph and can carry a crew of four.

"Researchers have discovered that the brain can remember 'neutral' or boring events more easily when they are tied to an emotion . From what we eat to what we see, we constantly take in details about our environment. And while there is no need to remember many of them, our brain has the remarkable ability to store information that seems inconsequential at the time in case it becomes useful later on. Given new and relevant information, human beings have the capacity to strengthen weak memories using emotions - and researchers have said this points to the adaptive nature of human memory. Psychologists at New York University have been trying to gain an understanding about how the brain stores memories for 'emotionally neutral events' that gain significance through subsequent experience. 'How does the brain store all of this information? And how does emotion strengthen mundane memories?' post-doctoral fellows Joseph Dunsmoor and Vishnu Murty wrote on The Conversation. This study largely focused on how our brains remember emotionally arousing stimuli, such as evocative imagery or traumatic events . In particular, the study has looked into how the September 11 terrorist attacks in the the US affect memory retention. The researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events better than we remember neutral events, like a lunch date. Emotion increases our ability to remember by affecting activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - particularly the amygdala and striatum - and also the regions involved in encoding new experiences, like the hippocampus. Scroll down for video . Emotion also increases the strength of our memory over time - a process called consolidation. Strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events, such as a surprise birthday party thrown by close friends, and for negative events, such as making an embarrassing faux pas at the office holiday party. Researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events, like 9/11, better than we remember neutral events, like a lunch date. This is because emotion affects activity in certain brain regions. A view over the Hudson River towards the September 11th memorial lights is shown . A power nap of just 45 minutes can boost memory by five times, research has found. A short doze helps you to retain information you have learned and 'significantly' improves recall, scientists said – meaning naps really could help students revising for exams. Participants in the study learned 90 single words and 120 unconnected word pairs such as 'milk taxi'. Some then watched a DVD while others slept. When they were then retested, those who had slept remembered more word pairs, the journal Neurobiology of Learning and Memory reported last month. Scientists from Saarland University in Germany, said that during sleep, bursts of brain activity known as sleep spindles play an important role in consolidating newly learned information. Professor Axel Mecklinger said a nap of just 45 minutes to an hour 'produces a five-fold improvement in information retrieval from memory'. 'The memory performance of the participants who had a power nap was just as good as it was before sleeping, that is, immediately after completing the learning phase.' While many details are not intrinsically emotionally arousing, they can gain emotional significance through our experiences. For example, the memory of a surprise birthday party includes details like what people were wearing and who was there. On the face of it, these details are not emotionally significant but we remember them because of the context in which they were experienced. Dr Dunsmoor and Dr Murty’s research has shown that people have better memory for boring information when it’s presented in an emotional context, regardless of if it is rewarding or negative. ‘In some of our earlier studies, we found that people selectively remember neutral pictures if the pictures had been associated with an electrical shock the previous day, even when the volunteers were unaware that we would later test their memory, they wrote. ‘We have also shown that people remember neutral pictures if they are warned that if they forget them, they will receive a shock the next day. ‘Likewise, being rewarded with money for remembering certain pictures the next day can boost memory for those pictures as well.’ These experiments focus on emotional factors at the time the original memory is created and the findings show how seemingly trivial information associated with a meaningful event can be selectively preserved in memory. Emotion also increases the strength of our memory over time - a process called consolidation. Strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events, such as a surprise birthday party (stock image), and for negative events, such as making an embarrassing faux pas at an office party . Emotion affects activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - such as the amygdala (pictured) and regions involved in encoding new experiences, like the hippocampus (also marked) But what happens when the emotional event happens after the original memories were formed? ‘In a recent study, we found that an emotional experience can enhance memory for neutral information encountered previously,’ the researchers continued. Volunteers viewed a series of trivial pictures from two categories, either animals or tools. After a delay, volunteers were presented with a new set of animal and tool pictures – only this time, when the volunteer saw the pictures they received an electrical shock to the wrist. ‘We already knew that memory would be strengthened for the pictures paired with the electrical shock. But here we found that if we paired shocks with pictures of animals, memory was strengthened for pictures of animals volunteers saw before any shocks were delivered. ‘If we shocked volunteers when they where shown pictures of tools, memory for the earlier pictures of tools was strengthened.’ The negative experience selectively increased memory for related information that was completely trivial when it was originally experienced. We use our memory not only to remember the past, but to guide our decisions in the future. Emotion helps us remember relevant information to determine our choices, but without the ability to strengthen seemingly trivial past experiences with new important information, we might end up missing out on future rewards or repeating the same mistakes.","New York University psychologists studied how the brain stores memories .

"A doctor who ploughed into an elderly couple in a 50mph head on crash while rushing to work has escaped prosecution after the police officer investigating the case went off sick. The female driver in a Toyota Aygo pulled in front of Colin Kay as he was driving his Citroen Picasso on the A586 in Great Eccleston in Lancashire last year. The collision was captured on film as Mr Kay had fitted a camera to his dashboard and revealed how he had no time to react and avoid the crash. Scroll down for video . Colin Kay captured the collision on a dashcam which showed how the Toyota Aygo driver veered across the road . The incident happened on the A586 in Great Eccleston in Lancashire last year and Mr Kay provided Lancashire Police with the footage . After the incident last year, the doctor driving the Toyota also had to be cut from her vehicle and was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital by air ambulance . The 72-year-old was left with bruises after the crash and his wife Krysia suffered a whiplash injury to her shoulder. But despite having evidence recorded on his dashcam, Mr Kay has now been told there will be no further action because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time. The retired engineer from Bacup in Lancashire, said: 'I contacted the police because I was keen to see a full prosecution to stop more careless driving. 'But nothing has been done because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time. Mr Kay has taken his case to the IPCC after the driver who ploughed into his car will not face any further action after the investigating officer went off sick . 'I think it is disgusting. If I was off sick somebody picked up my work. She has just got away with it and that's that.' The pensioner has now contacted the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and sent them a copy of the footage after learning there would be no further action. He added: 'I have written to the IPCC and put my points across - it's not only my case not acted upon, how many others have not been acted upon?"" 'The only way our roads are going to become safer is when motorists driving carelessly like this are punished. Mr Kay with the footage on his computer. He says it is disgusting that there will be no action due the case not being picked up by another officer .

After the incident last year, the doctor driving the Toyota also had to be cut from her vehicle and was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital by air ambulance. It is understood she did not have serious injuries. The grandfather-of-seven explained: 'We were extremely lucky. I have a pacemaker and I thought my chest was going to explode. 'We were both bruised right across where the seatbelts were. 'It is a miracle that no one was more seriously hurt given that it was a serious head-on smash at 50mph. 'I had very little time to brake because she turned right in front of me due to a lapse in concentration. ""I feared the worst afterwards because she was trapped in her vehicle but thankfully she was not badly hurt, and was cut out by the Lancashire Fire and Rescue.' A spokesman for Lancashire Police explained that there is a six-month period in which a prosecution would have to take place. This is the time limit set for summary offences, which are heard in a magistrates court to come to court. They also added that it was unfortunate that another officer failed to pick up the case instead. He said: 'Officers attended the scene and carried out a thorough investigation.

"Just 8p in every £10 spent looking after dementia patients goes on research into the causes, shocking figures reveal. The outlay on stroke research is little better, with 19p allocated from each £10 spent on the health and social needs of patients. A study says the amount spent by the Government and charities studying dementia and strokes is ‘still way too low’. Just 11 per cent of research funding from he Government and charities into the UK’s leading causes of death and disability was allocated to dementia, research has found . Despite extra cash pumped into the two diseases recently by government bodies, they remain underfunded given the economic and personal impact felt by millions of sufferers and their families, say researchers. In comparison to cancer and coronary heart disease they are still poor relations, according to calculations by Oxford University academics. The amount spent on cancer research is around 13 times higher than dementia, and almost six times more than stroke. The spend on heart disease is eight times that of dementia and triple the amount spent on stroke research, says the study published in the online journal BMJ Open. Researchers assessed central government and charity research expenditure in 2012 into the UK’s leading causes of death and disability – cancer, coronary heart disease, dementia and stroke which together accounted for over half of all deaths. The combined amount of research funding allocated by the Government and charities to the four conditions came to £856million in 2012, almost two-thirds of which was allocated to cancer. Around one-fifth was devoted to coronary heart disease, while just 11 per cent was allocated to dementia and 7 per cent to stroke research. The study found a significant shift in funding since 2008, particularly after a commitment by the Coalition to new money for dementia research. But the sums allocated by charities have scarcely budged since 2008, possibly because they rely on public donations which may be affected by ‘a form of ageism’ where dementia and stroke are seen as inevitable only in the elderly. Research leader Professor Alastair Gray, of the Health Economic Research Centre at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, Oxford University, said overall research funding has not been cut but priorities had shifted. Almost two-thirds of research funding allocated by to the four conditions was allocated to cancer . Overall research spending by government bodies went up 20 per cent over the period, but there was a change in diseases that benefited. In 2012, £157million was spent on cancer research by government bodies, down from £267million in 2008. Prof Gray said: ‘There was increasing recognition that expenditure on dementia should rise and this was reflected in the Coalition agreement. ‘As a consequence less was spent on cancer because of the increasing emphasis on dementia and stroke, but these areas remain underfunded when compared with the burden of disease.’ He said research funding was ‘still way too low’ in both diseases, especially for stroke. There are at least 800,000 dementia patients and 1.2million stroke victims needing health and social care each year in the UK, compared with 2.3million cases of cancer and the same number of heart disease cases. Costs of healthcare were highest for cancer at £4.4billion and lowest for dementia at £1.4billion and stroke at £1.8billion. But social care costs of dementia outweighed social care costs of the other three conditions combined. Health and social care for dementia cost £11.6billion in 2012 – more than double the equivalent bill for cancer. This means that for every £10 of health and social care costs attributable to each condition, £1.08 in research funding was spent on cancer, 65p on coronary heart disease, 19p on stroke, and just 8p on dementia, the researchers calculated. Hilary Evans, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said the charity has more than doubled its annual commitment to research since 2008. She added: ‘It will be vital for the next government to make dementia research a priority if we are to defeat the condition.’ Dr Doug Brown, of Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Alzheimer’s Society has pledged to spend at least £100million on dementia research over the next decade – more than ever before – but if we’re going to improve the quality of care, develop better treatments and ultimately cure dementia we need politicians to pledge continued commitment and set out an ambition to create a step change in research funding.’ Dr Dale Webb, of the Stroke Association, said that if the ‘wholly inadequate’ level of research funding into stroke remains the same, ‘we will not be ready for the challenges a growing and ageing population will bring’.","Just 11 per cent of research funding is allocated to dementia .

"More than 2,200 Walmart employees are now unemployed after the retail corporation announced it was temporarily closing five stores for 'extensive' plumbing repairs. Workers at two Texas stores, as well as in California, Florida and Oklahoma, were notified only a couple of hours before they lost their jobs. Almost 550 people lost their job at the Pico Rivera store in California alone. Scroll down for video . More than 2,200 Walmart employees are now unemployed after the retail corporation announced it was temporarily closing five stores for 'extensive' plumbing repairs . 'Everybody just panicked and started crying,' deli department manager Venanzi Luna told CNN Money. Walmart will put both the full-time and part-time workers affected by the closures on paid leave for two months as they  try to transfer to another Walmart location. Full-time workers who aren't able to secure another job at the corporation by June could be eligible for a severance package, but part-time workers will not be eligible. Pico Rivera City Manager Rene Bobadilla said this was the 'first time' he was hearing of Walmart's sewer problems and that store's sudden closure was 'abnormal', he told Reuters. Walmart has not yet requested any building or city plumbing permits, according to employees and city officials. Some employees of the Pico Rivera location believe the store is being closed because it has recently become a center for protests by workers who are demanding better wages and benefits. The Pico Rivera location was one of the first to stage a Black Friday protest in 2012. Some employees of the Pico Rivera location (pictured during a 2013 protest) believe the store is being closed because it has  become a center for protests by workers demanding better wages and benefits . Walmart recently announced it will raise the store's minimum hourly wage to $9 an hour. Store representatives have met with city officials in Livingston, Texas, where 422 employees lost their jobs. Livingston City Manager Marilyn Sutton said the corporation claimed the plumbing problems were 'ongoing and pervasive' and that permits will not be requested until Walmart determines what specific repairs need to be made. In a statement, Walmart said it aims to 'reopen' the stores 'as soon as these issues are resolved and improvements are made.' A spokesman said the five affected stores have nothing else in common except that they have been plagued with plumbing problems for the past two years.","Five stores in Texas, California, Florida and Oklahoma have been closed .

"A leading bank official has been fired after being exposed as a Nazi-themed dominatrix. The 46-year-old had worked at the central bank of the Netherlands for eight years. However, for the past six of them, she has also been offering her sexual services at more than £300 an hour. Identified only by her ‘professional’ name, Conchita van der Waal, she asked clients for requests, saying ‘the kinkier the better’. Conchita van der Waal, pictured, offered a range of 'kinky' sexual services to clients from €450 an hour . Van der Waal’s website, which has been taken offline, shows a range of provocative images, including one of her wearing an SS cap. She advises prospective clients: ‘I have a challenging career in international finance. It takes me to many places (mainly western Europe and America). ‘Business meetings, elegant suits, lace stockings, garter belts, hold-ups, stiletto heels. If only my colleagues, clients or boss knew that at night I enjoy my hobby of being a hooker.’ Her online advert advises that she is a native Dutch blonde who is a ‘high-class nymphomaniac and prostitute’. She describes her greatest passion as ‘raunchy kinky sex with wild strangers and naughty men’. Quote, a Dutch magazine, reported that van der Waal had a ‘supervisory’ role at her country’s central bank while specialising in sadomasochism in her spare time. After the magazine broke the story, the bank confirmed it had fired her over ‘integrity issues’. Prostitution in Holland is legal although workers at the Dutch central bank are not allowed to engage in any activities which could bring the institution into disrepute, such as ‘indecent behaviour’. Van der Waal hinted at her real professional life on her website which has since been removed from the web . The Dutch Central Bank, pictured, told a magazine that van der Waal had been fired over 'integrity issues' It is claimed that van der Waal previously worked with ABN-AMRO, a state-owned bank based in Amsterdam. She is also understood to have worked for Dutch bank ING, which was fined £417million in 2012 for violating US economic sanctions. It is not clear when she was employed by either institution. According to her website, van der Waal’s work outside the financial sector was far more exciting. A picture from one of her online adverts shows the blonde sex worker sprawled across a zebra-print double bed. She wears a revealing leopard-print dress, surrounded by lit candles, champagne flutes and an ice bucket. The picture and the online advert vanished from the internet soon after her identity was exposed. But the images were captured and reproduced by Quote magazine before they were taken down. According to the Irish Times, van der Waal could face further action from Dutch authorities because she failed to register officially as a prostitute or abide by tax rules. Sex workers in the Netherlands must ensure they have a VAT number and pay income tax, none of which the woman has reportedly done so far. And she may also face difficulties because her ‘S&M studio’ is reportedly in a building where ‘immoral’ behaviour is specifically outlawed under the terms of the contract under which it was bought in 2012. Following the revelations, the Dutch central bank said it would review screening procedures for new employees. It said that of the 5,469 prospective staff who had been screened since 2011, 614 had been rejected. But the firm has been criticised by some in the Netherlands for treating the woman unfairly by firing her. Prostitution in the country was legalised in 2000 in order to protect women through better regulation and employment rights.","Conchita van der Waal offered a range of 'kinky' services for €450 an hour .

"Scottish Nationalists threatened to paralyse the UK government by blocking ‘any bit of spending’ they do not agree with. The threat came as Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow leader of the Commons, revealed it was prepared to speak to any other party in a hung Parliament – including the SNP – to ‘try to build a majority’. But the SNP, forecast to hold the balance of power with 50 or more MPs, suggested it would hold Ed Miliband to ransom if he refuses to scrap the Trident nuclear defence programme. The Scottish Nationalists, led by Nicola Sturgeon, have threatened to paralyse the UK government by blocking ‘any bit of spending’ they do not agree with . The SNP’s deputy leader Stewart Hosie told the BBC’s Daily Politics that in the absence of a formal deal with Labour, the SNP would be ‘entitled to vote against any bit of legislation’ and ‘any bit of spending’ it does not agree with. He said that the SNP could vote against so-called ‘Parliamentary estimates’, which authorise Government departments’ spending commitments. ‘If we didn’t agree with a bit of spending then of course we could vote against that. I certainly wouldn’t be happy if Trident was renewed,’ he said. Senior Conservatives warned that the SNP’s threat to veto public spending across entire departments unless it gets its way could even lead to a US-style government shutdown. The threat came as Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow leader of the Commons, revealed it was prepared to speak to any other party in a hung Parliament – including the SNP – to ‘try to build a majority’ As Scotland moved to the centre of the election campaign: . ■ Mr Cameron pledged a controversial annual review of the fairness of Scottish government policies on the rest of the UK. ■ Nick Clegg questioned the ‘legitimacy’ of a government led by a party that finishes second. ■ Tory HQ prepared to deploy Boris Johnson and Sir John Major to energise its campaign. ■ George Osborne unveiled plans for a £10billion shares bonanza by selling off discounted shares in Lloyds Bank. ■ Ed Balls prompted fears of tax increases on businesses and middle earners if Labour regains power. ■ Labour prepared to step up warnings about Tory ‘privatisation’ of the NHS. David Cameron warned the idea of Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon holding sway over a ‘weak’ Labour leader in a hung Parliament was a ‘frightening prospect’. The Prime Minister insisted the SNP ‘wouldn’t care’ about slashing services for voters in England and Wales – and insisted the only way to stop the party was to return a Conservative government. He issued a plea to Ukip and Lib Dem voters to lend their support to the Tories to prevent ‘Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon, demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes’. David Cameron warned the idea of Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon holding sway over a ‘weak’ Labour leader in a hung Parliament was a ‘frightening prospect’ ‘A group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country and I think that is a frightening prospect,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘For people thinking in their own constituencies “is that bypass going to be built, will my hospital get the money it needs?” – frankly, this is a group of people that wouldn’t care about what happened in the rest of the country.’ Miss Sturgeon said yesterday she expected the SNP to be in a ‘very powerful’ position after May 7. She insisted SNP MPs would be prepared to vote on English matters, such as the NHS and education – breaking the party’s previous commitment not to vote on issues which are controlled by the Scottish Parliament. Miss Sturgeon insisted she would never support the Conservatives in government, but indicated that she is ready to put Mr Miliband in Number Ten even if Labour wins fewer seats at the election. Labour has ruled out a formal deal with the SNP, but repeatedly refused to rule out a looser arrangement. Outlining an ‘alternative vision’ for Britain that could be implemented in co-operation with Labour, Miss Sturgeon will today unveil a manifesto to ‘end austerity’ with a £180billion debt-fuelled spending spree. On the prospect of negotiating with the SNP, Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow leader of the Commons, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘We’ll speak to any party that has got representation in the House of Commons in order to try and build a majority for a Queen’s Speech that the country desperately needs for a change of government.’ A senior Labour source sought to downplay Miss Eagle’s remarks, saying there would be a ‘clear majority’ for Trident renewal in any circumstances because of the support of almost all Conservative MPs. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The SNP are threatening to hold Britain to ransom to guarantee an Ed Miliband government gives them what they want – weaker defences, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes.’","SNP will vote against 'any bit of spending' it disagrees with after election .

"The British Veterinary Association has withdrawn its support for the shooting of free-running badgers in controversial pilot culls. The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA. It concluded that the first two years of culling had not demonstrated conclusively that ‘controlled shooting’ of free-running badgers could be effective and humane. The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA . The BVA said it still supported badger culling to tackle tuberculosis in cattle. Animal welfare campaigners welcomed the news but said the BVA’s ongoing support for cage-trapping and shooting was ‘regrettable’. It comes after the Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election. Addressing the National Farmers Union conference in February, Liz Truss said 'any future Conservative government' would push ahead with 'a wider roll-out of the culls', which have been fiercely criticised by wildlife groups. Her comments came as NFU president Meurig Raymond said the incidence of TB had decreased on farms in two pilot areas in Somerset and Gloucestershire where culling of badgers has taken place over the last two years. The Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election . He urged politicians not to make the controversial cull 'a party political issue' in the run-up to the general election, and criticised Labour for pledging to give up on culling. Ms Truss pledged that any future Conservative government would 'take the difficult decisions to deal with this disease'. She told the conference: 'It is shameful that under the previous government bovine TB increased nine-fold and we ended up with the highest levels of the disease in Europe. 'It is incredible that they would like to make the same mistake again.' She said the Government's strategy included cattle movement controls, vaccination in 'edge' areas around disease hotspots, and culling where the disease is rife. 'We will not let up, whatever complaints we get from protest groups. We're in it for the long haul. We will not walk away,' she said to the conference, to applause from farmers. In Gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot, falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB in livestock, leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there. The Government claimed the low numbers in Gloucestershire reflected the 'challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation' by anti-cull campaigners.

"Questions have again been raised about Tony Blair's money-making since leaving Downing Street in 2007 . Tony Blair's global money-making projects face fresh scrutiny today after publication of a bizarre deal to sell the theory of 'deliverology' to Colombia. Questions have also been raised about why the fees for the former Labour Prime Minister – who last week denied being in the 'league of the super-rich - are being paid by the United Arab Emirates, and not the Colombian government. The contract sets out in great detail Mr Blair's demands for confidentiality, and includes a requirement that his wife Cherie join him on trips to South America. Mr Blair last week defended earning money since leaving Downing Street, claiming it pays for the 'infrastructure' around him. But critics have questioned the role of a former Prime Minister working for other sovereign states, and claimed there could be a conflict of interest between his role as the Middle East envoy and earning money from governments in the region. Today the Sunday Telegraph revealed details of a contract signed between Mr Blair and the Colombian government in 2013. Fees paid to Tony Blair Associates for the work advising Colombia on its mining industry, which brings in £2billion-a-year in royalties. The 34page contract for a year was signed between Columbia's department of national planning, and Windrush No 3 LP, an arm of Mr Blair's business network. It included carrying out a 'stocktake' of mining deals and contains at least 10 clauses on confidentiality. It also boasts that Tony Blair Associates outperforms rival consultancy firms because it works with 'founders of deliverology' – jargon for the way governments can get things done. 'All our team members will have expertise in ... deliverology or mining induced growth strategies,' it says. The business proposal states: 'Mr Blair, with his extensive on-the-job experience and politician instincts, will personally lead this project. 'Typically his contribution will go beyond the narrow focus of the specific project, and our growing understanding of the situation on the ground will allow Mr Blair to serve as an adviser to the government in several other areas, be it in domestic matters or questions of international politics.' Tory MP Andrew Bridgen today called for curbs on former Prime Minister's working for other governments. He told MailOnline: 'Anyone who has been Prime Minister and privy to the secrets of this nation should hold should never work for another sovereign government.' Mr Bridgen says ex-PMs should be bound for life by the seven principles of public life, known as the Nolan principles, which include accountability and openness.' He added: 'People have got the right to earn money but it is how it is done. At the end of the day I think a lot of the disillusion with politics began in the Blair years. The fall of politicians' standing seriously began in the Blair years when people felt they had been deceived.' Mr Blair defended his money making, telling Newsweek last week said: 'I could not do what I do unless I was also able to generate income'. He added: 'Am I better off than most people? Yeah, I'm very lucky. Am I in the league of the super-rich? Absolutely not, though you will have to make up your own mind about that.' The Colombia contract includes a clause stating that Mr Blair would make two trips a year to Colombia, and he gets to choose who joins him. It specifically includes a statement that this could be his wife Cherie. The Colombia contract also includes a clause stating that Mr Blair would make two trips a year to Colombia, and he gets to choose who joins him. It specifically includes a statement that this could be his wife Cherie. The Columbian government announced at the time that that 'the United Arab Emirates through the Office of Tony Blair [Windrush Ventures No 3 LP] domiciled in the UK' had signed an agreement 'to support the implementation' of the new laws on spending money raised from mining deals. Another deal was signed in 2014, for offering advice on project management, according to the newspaper. Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, told the Telegraph: 'This raises serious questions of a conflict of interest over Mr Blair's roles as businessman and Middle East envoy. 'The UAE is supposed to be a leading donor government on the issue of Gaza and the West Bank, so what does Tony Blair put first, his role as Quartet envoy or his role as a businessman when dealing with them? What is the nature of all these contracts? There is still a lack of transparency about it.' Mr Blair is working with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, for whom he once a foreword for a political book on The Third Way . But Mr Blair's office rejected the claims, and insisted the details of the work had been released in a press statement in 2013. 'There is absolutely nothing improper in this project being funded by UAE… on the contrary the sole objective is to support the Colombian Government's reform programme which aims to modernise public services and increase prosperity for its people. 'The TBA team works exclusively in the interest of and for the benefit of the Government of Colombia. As with any project, we maintain the strict confidentiality requirements of our contract. 'TBA has also been helping establishing a Delivery Unit, so that the government can better deliver services which will increase jobs, reduce poverty and transform the lives of people in Colombia. The work being undertaken is solely for the benefit of Colombia and is at no cost to the government and provided close to cost. 'We have no knowledge let alone involvement in the mining deal you refer to and any suggestion that we have been involved is false, neither were TBA involved in any laws relating to mining fees or royalties. 'And as we have repeatedly made clear, there are no conflicts of interests with any of Mr Blair's work, including his role with the OQR.'","Former Prime Minister struck deal in 2013 to advise on mining industry .

"NHS finances are so dire that patients could soon be forced to pay to use basic services such as GPs, doctors leaders warned last night. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges. All three major parties have denied there will be any end to the principle that the NHS should be free at the point of use. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges . Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around. In an interview with the Guardian, Dr Porter said of the parties fighting the election: ‘I think they will be tempted. They said in 1950 that a Labour government wouldn’t introduce charging and it did.’ The introduction of prescription charges prompted NHS founder Nye Bevan to resign from Clement Attlee’s government in April 1951. Dr Porter said it was ‘inescapable’ that the next government would consider introducing fees as a way of tackling the £30billion budget gap that NHS England has forecast will open by 2020 unless it achieves its target of £22billion in efficiency savings and receives £8billion of extra annual funding. He said: ‘Could a future government be tempted? Yes, they could, but they must resist that temptation.’ Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around .","Dr Mark Porter said election winner will be tempted to bring in charges .

"Nestled in eastern Long Island is a sleepy little town called Yaphank where the streets have cozy names like Oak and Park, names that hide a dark past: they once bore signs like Hitler and Goebbels Streets. Yaphank, in the 1930s, appeared as a haven for Americans--most of them of German heritage--who sympathized with the causes of the Third Reich. In fact, it was largely founded as a Nazi camp, one of several scattered across the U.S., where the children in the German American Bund (AKA American Nazis) could fish, swim, hunt and learn about things like eugenics. Scroll down for video . Nazi camp: Yaphank, Long Island was once home to a camp for Nazis where like-minded individuals could drink beer and learn about eugenics . Camp Siegfried was founded by the American Nazi group, the German American Bund. The group set up pro-Nazi camps where they could put on military demonstrations, teach their children about fascism and enjoy the outdoors . Today, Yaphank is still a town on Long Island. Missing now, though, are the homes with swastikas built into the brick work and hedges, pro-Hitler parades and, of course, the Nazi camp. That camp was founded in 1935 by Friends of New Germany, writes Dangerousminds.net. That group went on to become the German American Bund. The Bund in Yaphank, as it did in similar communities in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and New Jersey, organized military demonstrations where they waved both the American and Nazi flags. In an article published in the Long Island History Journal, Stony Brook University historian Ryan Shaffer describes a typical day at Camp Siegfried thusly: . 'Locals from Yaphank, Jamesport, Aquebogue, and Riverhead visited the camp to drink beer, join in the festive atmosphere walking or driving down Hitler Street to salute American and Nazi flags.' Shaffer writes that 'support for Nazi Germany in the United States was a unique blend of German and American ideology rather than just a foreign import.' However, members had to be Aryan and were united in their belief that those with German blood would lead America into a 'new era.' Adolf Hitler Street: Yaphank once had streets named Adolf Hitler, Goebbels and Goering as well as Berliner and Hamberger. Most of the names have since been changed, but the county still retains the original maps . Swastika hedge: Gone now, too, are the swastikas that once adorned the lawns and buildings of the camp and town . 'Locals from Yaphank, Jamesport, Aquebogue, and Riverhead visited the camp to drink beer, join in the festive atmosphere walking or driving down Hitler Street to salute American and Nazi flags,' notes Stony Brook University historian Ryan Shaffer . In the years leading to America joining the Allies, the FBI and New York police started to keep an eye on the Bund in Yaphank. Photos that only recently became available were mainly taken by New York police and can be viewed here. The FBI once noted that Yaphank contained 150 to 300 children who 'used to wear a uniform like that of the Hitler Youth in Germany.' Things fell apart for the Bund in 1941 after the U.S. declared war on Germany and open support of Hitler became criminal. The bund's leader Fritz Julius Kuhn was imprisoned for tax evasion and embezzling and the group faded into obscurity. In Yaphank, Camp Siegfried was shut down and taken over by the German-American Settlement league, which still runs it today, according to untappedcities.com. The park is apparently for private use only. A German American Settlement League sign reads 'Private community -- members and guests only.' The street names like Hitler, Goebbels and Goering have gone. Adolf Hitler Street is now Park Street, Goering is now Oak and Goebbels is Northside Avenue. Nazi salute: In the run-up to 1941, the FBI and NYPD kept close tabs on the Bun.

"Eight years after their son was brutally murdered by the man he loved, Sue and Charlie MacDonald are still wondering what they could have done differently to prevent his death. The couple raised Gareth and his three brothers in the tiny isolated welsh village of Rhewl-Mostyn and now regret that they didn't teach him to be more 'streetwise.' 'Gareth wasn't street wise, he was too trusting and as a parent, that's where you think maybe I've failed him,' Sue reveals on the latest episode of TV show Britain's Darkest Taboos. Scroll down for video . Charlie MacDonald is still grieving for the son he lost eight years ago at the hands of his conman lover . Gareth met Glen Rycroft, 37, of Salford, Manchester, in a gay online chat room and they started a dating in 2005. Over the course of their relationship, Rycroft conned Gareth out of thousands of pounds and when his lover finally got wind of his theft and deceit and threatened to go to the police, he murdered him. Gareth was only 30 when he was killed in 2007. Rycroft had lured him to a Travelodge at Heston services on the M4 near Heathrow airport on September 15, 2007, where he fatally hit him over the head with a fire extinguisher. When Gareth's body was discovered, Rycroft claimed he had not been with Gareth that evening and said a rent boy was to blame. But police were able to gather enough evidence to prove Rycroft was involved - including internet searches on his computer on the best way to kill a man by striking him on the head. Gareth, pictured, was killed at the age of 30 after he discovered his boyfriend was conning him and his family out of money . Rycroft was found guilty of murder in 2009 and sentenced to life in prison, serving a minimum of 25 years. Eight years later, Sue and Charlie and still dealing with their grief and are still blaming themselves for failing to see Rycroft's true colours before it was too late. Sue said he seemed like a 'caring man' when Gareth first brought him home to meet them. 'He just came over as a caring person and nothing was too much trouble. He was a charmer,' she said. Gareth and his parents weren't the first to have been taken in by Rycroft. When he met Gareth, he was actually on probation having been released from prison for committing fraud. In his twenties, he had scammed friends and family out of thousands of pounds by pretending to have cancer and organising fundraising events where the money for 'charity' went straight into his pocket. He worked as an air steward for British Airways and also conned strangers and colleagues by telling them he could make them money through an investment opportunity he had been given by the company. Through his fictitious investment opportunity and cancer con he made thousands of pounds which he used to fund a lavish lifestyle, going on exotic holidays and driving expensive sports cars. Such was his love of the high life and charming manner - which hid his true deceitful personality - he was dubbed 'the real Talented Mr Ripley' when he appeared in court after the character made famous by Matt Damon. Debbie Henley, a former colleague of Rycroft explains: 'Glen had forged a letter head from British Airways, saying that British Airways were offering employees and friends and family the opportunity to invest in British Airways, whatever they invested they would get three times back within six months. 'Glen went around the local community offering this investment, to whoever he could. They didn't have a lot of money themselves they were vulnerable. 'He was going on holiday in Barbados and running around in soft top cars, he lived the high life with other people's money.' It was Debbie who eventually suspected Rycroft's investment opportunity was not all it seemed after she became embroiled in his cancer con. She and other friends believed he was dying of the disease as he had been shaving his own head and cracking blood capsules in his ears to make it appear he was having seizures. When Debbie realised Rycroft wasn't a cancer victim and was conning his friends into donating money, she reported him to the police. This lead to his four year imprisonment for the cancer and British Airways investment scams. A friend who fell victim to Rycroft at this time said: 'The effects of Glen’s callous acts will impact on us for a long time to come. Glen Rycroft was jailed for life for murdering Gareth by striking him round the head with a fire extinguisher . She continued: 'Glen systematically targeted friends and family who were more than willing to help and support a friend in need. For our loyalty and trust, we were rewarded with betrayal and a lot of heartache.' But these victims were luckier than Gareth, who paid with his life after being conned by Rycroft. While the conman was committing his crimes in Salford, back in Wales, Gareth had started a relationship with a woman and had two daughters. However, he struggled with his sexuality and the couple separated when Gareth realised he was gay. He started seeking a relationship with a man at the same time Rycroft was released from prison and they began their relationship with Gareth oblivious of his lover's criminal past. Rycroft began to con Gareth out of money and convinced Sue and Charlie to also give him money. Charlie said he promised them a 'holiday of a lifetime' and they gave him hundreds of pounds towards a deposit as they had no reason to suspect their son's boyfriend wasn't honest. 'He told me he was with the airline business and he was quite wealthy,' Charlie said. The couple were told he said he could get a luxury holiday on the cheap through his connections and discounts but they'd have to pay a deposit. During the course of his relationship with his son, they paid Rycroft thousands and Charlie admits that after a while he began to think 'this fella has taken us for a ride.' It was a conclusion Gareth also eventually came to and when he confronted his lover and threatened to go to the police, he was murdered. Sue said they were stunned when they were told their son's body had been discovered with fatal head wounds. 'You feel as though it’s not happening, that it’s in a book or a film or something and somebody is going to come along and say, you know it's not real. And you think like that for a long time, that it’s not real,' she said. Now Rycroft has been brought to justice and jailed, the parents are trying to move on and keep their son's memory alive for their grandchildren. Charlie said: 'It doesn't get any easier, you just learn to cope differently with it. Gareth would say life's for living and that's what he did - he lived life to the full, he enjoyed life, he loved people.'

"An Italian ice cream man pursued his older rival in his van and then punched him through the driver's window in a turf war over 'stealing' customers from a new housing development. The row broke out between Andrea Trunfio, 36, and Mario Bretti, 64, after the former allegedly tried to muscle in on Mr Bretti's patch. A court heard how the pair clashed as they drove their vans away from the site on a scorching day in July last year. Mr Bretti said his competitor chased him along a busy road before cutting him off at a junction and blocking him with his van. He then got out and threw a flurry of punches at the 64-year-old through the driver's window. Pursued: Mr Bretti, 64, was chased by his younger rival Andrea Trunfio over an argument over a disputed site . The incident took place around the new Ridgeway Farm housing development on July 22 last year, when temperatures reached 25 degrees during a spell of sunny weather. Describing what happened, Mr Bretti said: 'I have been doing this for 45 years, since I was just 18 years old. On July 22, I got beaten up by another ice cream man. 'He decided to follow me on Thamesdown Drive in the middle of the road. He was going fast through the traffic lights, and when they went red I had to stop. He blocked me with his van so I couldn’t get away. 'He came up to the van and punching me threatened to kill me, saying he had claimed the building site as his area. 'I was selling there because Sparcells is my area. He was very aggressive and started punching me several times and said he would come to my home. In the end I drove away to get away from him.' Mr Bretti said he felt very dizzy and frightened after the altercation and went straight to the police station, while Trunfio did a U-turn and sped off. Dispute: Mr Bretti said he felt very dizzy and frightened after the altercation and went straight to the police . Trunfio denied common assault and claimed Mr Bretti had threatened to kill his family and burn his van if he went back to the disputed site. Speaking through an intepreter, he claimed he had seen Mr Bretti at the site that day and his older rival had beckoned him to follow afterwards. He said when they pulled up at the traffic lights, Mr Bretti grabbed his arm before rolling up the window to trap it. He also told the court had sold ice creams in Swindon for ten years and had been at the housing development for two or three months before the incident. He also claimed there had been prior arrangements which meant Mr Bretti would no longer sell at the building site. Trunfio, from Swindon, told the magistrates' court in Chippenham, Wiltshire: 'In our community, usually each person has an area. There is no law to say you can't go to certain places. 'I am not a violent person, but when you have an agreement and someone breaks it, it is like you are being taken for a ride. 'I am an easy person and do not argue with people. If I had hit him it would have been like hitting my own father.' Disputed site: The two ice cream men argued about who had ownership of the new Ridgeway Farm housing development (pictured above), in Swindon . Blocked: Mr Bretti was stopped on his way out of the housing development by Trunfio, who then hit him . But witnesses to the incident said Trunfio got out and attacked his older rival after driving madly after him. Sarah Miller, who saw the confrontation from her car, said: 'I saw him (Trunfio) getting out and coming to the one at the back. 'He didn't look particularly angry until he tried to open the door of the second van. 'He was jumping up and down and trying to go after the other ice cream man. I could see his fists going in and out of the window. 'He got back into his van and carried on shouting through his serving hatch.' She added: 'I was quite shocked, and very disappointed. I thought if my children had seen that they would have been scared to go to an ice cream van again.' Magistrates found Trunfio guilty and he was given a 12-month community order with 80 hours of unpaid work and £650 costs and ordered to pay £75 compensation to Mr Bretti.","Row broke out between Andrea Trunfio, 36, and Mario Bretti, 64, last July .

"Today it's the norm to order taxis using an app, but now a service lets its users schedule a delivery of drugs to their door. The app, called Eaze, has been dubbed ‘Uber for weed’ and enables people to choose medical grade marijuana and have it delivered by a vetted driver – providing they live in one of the US states where the drug is legal. The Californian start-up, which is rumoured to be backed by rapper Snoop Dogg, has just raised $10 million (£6.7 million) so that users can ‘find the perfect medicine’ in more states.

A screenshot from Eaze's website is shown . The sale and possession of marijuana for medical and recreational use is legal in Alaska, Colorado, and Washington, with legalised personal use pending in Oregon and Washington DC.

The Californian start-up, which is rumoured to be backed by rapper Snoop Dogg (pictured), has just raised $10 million so that users can ‘find the perfect medicine’ in more states . An app called High There! which is officially described as the world’s first global social network for cannabis enthusiasts has rolled out globally. The network is designed to let users meet one another online to make friends and form relationships without being judged for their habit or views. At launch two months ago, the app was only available to users in US states that legalised cannabis. Users swipe to choose to connect to people - like in the popular dating app Tinder. Denver-based Founder and CEO of High There! Todd Mitchem, said that the app doesn’t encourage the sale of marijuana but is simply a social network for people who consider it part of their lifestyle. Denver-based Founder and CEO of High There! Todd Mitchem, had a personal motivation for extending the reach of his app, because his mother used the drug to battle cancer, which Mr Mitchem claims saved her life. ‘To you, that mother just like mine, fighting cancer in a state where the stigma still exists around weed, High There! is here for you,' he said. Users can scroll through cannabis on sale to choose the type they like, whether it claims to ‘stimulate appetite and relieve pain’ or have a ‘fruity, resinous flavour’. The listings contain descriptions and lab results to help people ‘find the perfect medicine. For example, it lists the percentage of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the drug, which is the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high, as well as the percentage of Cannabidiol (CBD) which has been claimed to combat a range of conditions including depression, nausea, psychosis and even cancer. ‘Eaze will dispatch the nearest driver to hand deliver your medicine in minutes,’ the company said. Users can see an estimated time for their delivery and can receive messages as it approaches. They pay by cash upon receipt of the drugs and can review the quality of the cannabis and delivery by rating the driver, who has been verified by the company thanks to background checks. ‘Eaze will use this information to recommend future products and improve the customer experience,’ the start-up said. The app and website launched in July last year as the ‘first on-demand application in the newly emerging “Cannabis Technology” category – the intersection between the traditional high-tech and legal marijuana industries,’ according to the company. Eaze users pay by cash upon receipt of the drugs and can review the quality of the cannabis and delivery by rating the driver, who has been verified by the company thanks to background checks (illustrated above) It quickly became popular in San Francisco, enabling more than 30,000 people who use the drug medically to buy it easily. Keith McCarty, founder and CEO, of Eaze said: ‘The new funding enables us to expand rapidly by further developing our technology, building new dispensary partnerships and scaling our team for hyper-growth as we expand nationwide where marijuana is legal.’ David Chao, general partner with DCM Ventures, which invested in Eaze in November, said: ‘With public sentiment and public policy aligning to broaden access and the cannabis market surging toward $100 billion, we believe there is a huge opportunity as the fast moving technology and cannabis industries intersect.’ The medicinal properties of hemp are being used by pet owners to treat their cats and dogs.  A box of hemp treats for canines is shown . The medicinal properties of hemp are being used by pet owners to treat their cats and dogs. Hemp is legal and unlike cannabis, contains little tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high. There are a rising number of firms in the US that sell biscuits containing cannabidiol extracted from hemp, believed to alleviate joint pains, treat mood disorders and even help animals lose weight. Research has also suggested that CBD can relieve pain and discomfort in dying pets and calm animals down. Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits for both cats and dogs.

"Former Prime Minister Sir John Major (left) will today ignore warnings from his former Scottish Secretary against talking up the threat posed by the SNP . David Cameron's campaign attacks on the SNP risk undermining the future of the United Kingdom, senior Conservative peer Lord Forsyth has claimed. The former Scottish Secretary said talking up the threat posed by the Scottish nationalists was 'short-term and dangerous'. The stark warning came as the former prime minister John Major launched a stinging attack on the threat posed by an SNP. Sir John will say a Labour deal with the separatists would mean higher taxes, more debt and fewer jobs - as well as another independence referendum. David Cameron yesterday warned that the prospect of a deal between Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon was 'a match made in hell for the British economy' after the SNP unveiled its manifesto in Edinburgh yesterday. The extraordinary manifesto launch by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon included massive spending increases, new taxes, more welfare and the end of Britain's nuclear deterrent. Treasury analysis suggests the package would cost taxpayers £148billion over five years. Sir John, who is the last Tory to win an election outright, warned that Ed Miliband would face a 'daily dose of blackmail' from Miss Sturgeon, whose party may win 50 Commons seats. The former PM said: 'If Labour were to accept an offer of support from the SNP, it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote-by-vote basis. 'Labour would be in hock to a party that – slowly but surely – will push them ever further to the left. And who would pay the price for this? We all would. We would all pay for the SNP's ransom in our daily lives – through higher taxes, fewer jobs, and more and more debt.' Sir John (pictured at a Tory campaign rally today), who is the last Tory to win an election outright, said Ed Miliband would face a 'daily dose of blackmail' from the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon . Senior figures in Ed Miliband's (right) Labour party have appeared to soften their stance on a potential deal with the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon (left) in a hung parliament. It comes after Miss Sturgeon vowed to end austerity . Ed Miliband today accused David Cameron of 'playing fast and loose' with the future of the Union by talking up the threat posed by the SNP. The Labour leader said the Prime Minster was 'threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom' for his own political gain. He insisted there would be no coalition with the SNP and denied Nicola Sturgeon's party would hold the whip hand on policy. He told BBC1's Breakfast: 'A Labour government led by me, what happens in that Labour government will be decided by me, not by the SNP.' Labour had 'fundamental differences' with the SNP, such as the nationalist party's desire for a second independence referendum within five years, he said, adding: 'I'm not having that.' Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had been 'talking up' the SNP in the hope that it would take votes and seats from Labour north of the border and allow him to 'crawl back' into 10 Downing Street. 'I think David Cameron is playing fast and loose with the United Kingdom,' said the Labour leader. 'This is somebody who has given up hope of winning a majority. He is trying to boost the SNP. 'I think David Cameron is now threatening the integrity of the UK with the games he is playing. And I think Conservatives are now ashamed of what he is doing.' Sir John added: 'The SNP's driving ambition is an independent Scotland and – as the price for their support – they will demand policies that favour Scotland. That is no way to run a country, and nor is it remotely fair to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. 'This is a recipe for mayhem. At the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government, we risk a weak and unstable one – pushed to the left by its allies, and open to a daily dose of political blackmail.' But the Tory tactic of talking up the threat posed by the SNP was slammed by Sir John's former Scottish Secretary Lord Forsyth last night. The Tory peer said: 'We've had the dilemma for Conservatives, which is they want to be the largest party at Westminster and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in Scotland will be helpful. 'But that is a short-term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country.' He said Mr Cameron's call for 'English votes for English laws' in the aftermath of last year's Scottish independence referendum vote had 'shattered the unionist alliance against the break-up of the United Kingdom'. Yesterday, senior Labour figures appeared to soften their stance on a potential deal with the SNP in a hung parliament. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and health spokesman Andy Burnham said the party would be prepared to talk to Miss Sturgeon to try to win backing for a legislative programme. Asked to rule out any arrangement with the SNP after May 7, Mr Balls replied: 'We'll have to wait and see what the election result is going to be.' In a BBC interview, Mr Miliband denied the SNP would dictate policy but again refused to rule out negotiating for support in major Commons votes. Asked if the SNP would be calling the shots, Mr Miliband said: 'That ain't gonna happen. That ain't gonna happen.' Miss Sturgeon used her manifesto launch in Edinburgh to seek to assuage the fears of voters in the rest of the UK about her party being involved in the next government. 'I hold out the hand of friendship,' she declared. Miss Sturgeon said her number one priority would be an end to austerity, vowing to make Scotland's voice heard 'more loudly than it has ever been before'. She said she wanted a 'modest' increase in Government spending to 'make life better for ordinary people across these islands'. She also backed Labour's proposed tax rises. Spending spree wishlist... paid for by England! The Scottish Nationalists yesterday listed their demands for propping up a minority Labour government. JAMES SLACK examines the consequences for the rest of the UK: . DEBT . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is pictured launching the Scottish National Party manifesto at the Edinburgh International Climbing Arena yesterday . DEMAND: The SNP's key demand is an end to austerity. Cuts would be replaced with a minimum increase of 0.5 per cent above inflation for five years. NHS spending would rise by £24billion across the UK to deliver a £2billion increase in Scotland. COST: The additional borrowing, which will fall overwhelmingly on English taxpayers, will be £148billion over five years, according to Treasury analysis. HIGHER TAXES . DEMAND: The SNP wants a 50p top rate of tax, a mansion tax and a new tax on bank bonuses. This wish list is identical to Labour's and would form the basis of any post-election deal. Ominously, the manifesto talks of releasing 'additional resources by backing a series of revenue raising measures'. COST: Even though Scotland has very few £2million-plus homes, the SNP still wants a large chunk of mansion tax proceeds to go north. Alex Salmond warns the SNP would try to amend a Labour budget to introduce 'progressive tax measures' that would further clobber the middle classes. THE UNION . DEMAND: The SNP would end the convention under which its MPs do not vote on English-only matters in order to limit private sector involvement in the NHS, repeal Tory health reforms and help Labour force through tuition fee changes. COST: The damage to the Union caused by Scottish Nationalists foisting policies on the English which have no impact on their constituents (the Scots NHS is Scottish-run) could be irreparable. MORE BENEFITS . DEMAND: Reinstate subsidy paid to housing benefit recipients with a spare room. Increase handouts at least in line with the higher CPI rate of inflation. Scrap Universal Credit. Block plans to cut Disability Living Allowance by £3billion. COST: Scrapping the spare room subsidy will cost £470million. Axing Universal Credit would reverse a reform intended to break the culture of welfare dependency that became entrenched under Labour. TRIDENT . DEMAND: Scrap Britain's nuclear deterrent, saving £100billion over the next 35 years. COST: Failing to renew Trident would leave Britain's defences – and standing in the world – hugely diminished at a time of great global insecurity. VERDICT: . For all the bluster and denials, shared policies on tax and benefits provide the basis for a messy and hugely expensive deal between Labour and the SNP on a vote-by-vote basis. Key question is just how much extra borrowing Ed Miliband would be prepared to offer. Expect the markets to go into fright and the pound to slump. He may have been snubbed by his party for its manifesto launch but Alex Salmond has clearly been making an impression elsewhere during the campaign. The former SNP leader, 60, still hopes to emerge as one of the most powerful figures at Westminster in the next Parliament and has been busily electioneering in Gordon – the Aberdeenshire seat he is favourite to prise from the Liberal Democrats. And he gave his profile a boost by taking time out for this bizarre photo opportunity, which involved jumping up and down on a mattress in Port Elphinstone, Inverurie. Mr Salmond was joined by teenager Lewis Wilson. The oddly dressed 16-year-old had been planning a stunt leap on to the mattress from his bedroom window.

"A former New York City investment banker faces trial in eastern Long Island on charges he raped a woman he took home after celebrating his birthday at a Hamptons nightclub. Jason Lee, 38, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, was arrested in August 2013 after the woman accused him of attacking her in a bathroom at the home he had rented with his wife in the summer resort town of East Hampton. Lee has pleaded not guilty and is free on $100,000 bail. He has opted for a non-jury trial before Suffolk County Court Judge Barbara Kahn. Charged: Former Goldman Sachs managing director Jason Lee, 38, faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old Irish woman in the Hamptons in August 2013 . Lee's attorney, Manhattan lawyer Andrew Lankler, did not respond to email and telephone messages seeking comment. A lawyer who represented Lee at his arraignment in 2013 said his client was innocent and that the sex was consensual. Prosecutors said Lee was celebrating his birthday at Georgica restaurant and lounge in Wainscott when he invited the woman and her friends back to his rental home for a pool party. The woman, a then-20-year-old Irish student said that once at the house, Lee undressed, forced his way into a bathroom and pinned her to the floor. Scene: This is the house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred . Restaurant: The group met at Georgica's restaurant and lounge, pictured, popular with the jetset summer crowd of East Hampton . Suffolk County District Attorney Tom Spota said the woman was treated at a hospital following the assault. A nurse, who was trained in sexual assault cases, examined the woman after the alleged incident and said her injuries, including bruises, were consistent with her allegations, according to the Irish Times. At the time of the incident, police who arrived at the house reportedly found the banker cowering in his Range Rover. It also emerged Lee's own friend, Rene Duncan, called the police, believing one of the alleged victim's friends had stolen a car from Lee's rental home. Accused: Lee was a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. A representative from the company said he left the firm last year . But when police arrived, the young woman's brother drew a female officer aside and led her into the house where his sobbing sister reported she had been raped, according to The East Hampton Star. A source told the newspaper that Lee then went to the driveway of the $33,000-a-month summer home he was renting, got into his late model Range Rover, which was dark with tinted windows, and hid. But officers soon found him cowering inside, the source said. One of the other foreign students borrowed Duncan's car to drive home another friend and did not return, prompting Duncan to call the cops. However, the car was found the next day. Spota said the woman was  was working in the U.S. at the time and was visiting her brother in the Hamtons. She is expected to return to the United States from Ireland to testify during the trial. Opening statement are scheduled for Wednesday morning. A Goldman Sachs spokesman said Lee left the firm sometime last year; he had worked in the equity capital markets department.","Jason Lee, 38, was arrested in August 2013 after a woman accused him of attacking her at the home he and his wife rented in East Hampton .

Denise Fedyszyn, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, tipped the scales at 20 stone 4lb - and wore dress size 26 - when she was left feeling mortified while on a family day out with her daughters Anya and Isla. A fairground worker told the 37-year-old: 'You're too fat to ride, I can't fasten the seatbelt' as she tried to go on a swing ride with her children. Denise dressed as a troll in a charity parade before (l) and Ms Fedyszyn after having shed more than 10st (r) It left the mother-of-two embarrassed, upset - and determined to do something about it, so she joined Weightwaters, and changed her diet, as well as taking up exercise.

Denise said: 'It was all down to that; down to the kids and down to the fact that my dad - who lives at Hepworth - was ill, and because of the stress I resorted to eating all the time. 'That first day I joined Katie's group I decided to go out for a run. It was more of a walk but I persevered and now I run regularly, as well as watch what I eat. 'I knew I had to change my lifestyle and I'm so glad I did.

"Wolf Hall writer Hilary Mantel's award-winning second novel Bring Up The Bodies has been renamed for the American stage. The bestselling author, who once pledged not to dumb down her work ahead of its BBC debut, has revised the theatrical adaptation of her Tudor novels for a run on Broadway. In preparation, the title of her second book Bring Up the Bodies has been ditched in favour of the simpler 'Wolf Hall II'. Booker Prize award-winner Mantel, who has been reworking Mike Poulton's stage version, has also cut 'a lot of repetition' to create a tighter, better play. Scroll down for video . The bestselling author has revised the theatrical adaptation of her Tudor novels for a run on Broadway (pictured is Ben Miles as Thomas Cromwell and Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn) With more than 1,000 pages of historical drama, the story of the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell - who goes from a Blacksmith's son to one of the most powerful men in Tudor court - was never a simple read. The plays, produced by the Royal Shakespeare company and London's Playful Productions, will open at the Winter Garden Theatre in Times Square tomorrow and features the original British cast as well as director Jermey Herrin. And Mantel is convinced it will be a hit on Broadway. Warning: Hilary Mantel said she believed that the Broadway version of her books will be a hit . The British cast, including Miles as Thomas Cromwell and Paul Jesson as Cardinal Wolsey, will be going over to the U.S. as they prepare for the Broadway adaption which opens tomorrow . Nathaniel Parker, who won an Olivier award for his role as Henry VIII in the stage version of Wall Hall, told the Evening Standard: 'The play is better now than it was in London. 'Hilary has had a go at re-working it and she's cut a lot of repetition out and brought in her own words. 'I think audiences will love it.' The story was recently brought to the small screen in the BBC adaption starring  Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Mark Rylance as his adviror Thomas Cromwell. The mini-series received rave reviews when it aired earlier this year, and was dubbed BBC 2's most successful drama in a decade after drawing in four million viewers. Critics praised its story, acting and historical accuracy as makers went to such great lengths to recreate the Tudor period they used only candlelight to illuminate night-time scenes, filmed on location using special cameras. Actor Damian Lewis played Henry VIII in the hit television adaptation on  BBC of Mantel's award-winning story . Mantel, who saw sales of her books boosted by the adaptation, had said ahead of the BBC version that she refused to 'dumb down' to suit a broad television audience. The author had warned the adaption was 'complex', and she would not reduce it to 'clichés and over-simplifications'. The plays, written by Mike Poulton, sold out at Stratford-upon-Avon and quickly transferred to London, where they received critical raves, broke box office records and triumphed as the West End's biggest hit plays. Reprising their performances from the London production, Ben Miles as Cromwell, Nathaniel Parker as Henry VIII and Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn will be going over to Broadway. Mantel is currently writing her third novel in the Cromwell trilogy titled The Mirror and The Light.","Hilary Mantel has been tweaking stage version of Wolf Hall for Broadway .

"An architect who arranged to meet a woman on a blind date raped her several hours later while telling her 'girls say no but they don't really mean it,' a court has heard. Adam Leheup, 34, allegedly  insisted on having sex with the 25-year-old woman despite her shouting: 'No, no.' Leheup met the woman on July 9, 2013 after arranging to meet on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Adam Leheup met with his alleged victim after making contact with her through the 'Let's Date App' They arranged to meet under the clock on Waterloo Station before crossing the bridge over to the Embankment where they went to Gordon's Wine Bar. Leheup, who is a University of Greenwich graduate and technical co-ordinator on the £500m Nine Elms Point development, denies raping the woman. Blackfriars Crown Court heard that Leheup missed his last train home to Hersham, Walton-on-Thames, so the alleged victim allowed him to come home with her to her flat in Camden during the early hours of July 10, 2013. He said they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. In a statement to police, the alleged victim said: 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked. He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: ""No"" a lot, but he was not listening. 'I was saying: ""No"", but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: ""Girl’s say: No, but they don’t mean it."" I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Prosecutor Mr Ish Sheikh told the court the couple met on dating app ‘Let’s Date’ - which connects users who mutually find each other attractive - and had two bottles of wine at Gordons Wine Bar, Embankment after meeting and walking across Waterloo Bridge. It was so late Leheup had missed his last train and his date agreed to put him up for the night. 'She made it clear nothing would happen and they went to a second bar, ""Joe’s"", in Camden where they had mojitos. Leheup went to Gordon's Wine Bar, pictured, with his alleged victim before going back to Camden together . Leheup has pleaded not guilty to raping the 25-year-old girl at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured . 'He started kissing my neck and it made me a bit uncomfortable, but it wasn’t vicious or nasty and later I did kiss him back. We were getting on well,' the woman told police in a video interview. 'The kissing had got a bit more aggressive, stuff I did not like, his hand on my throat, which makes me vulnerable. 'I said: ""Nothing is going to happen."" I’m not that kind of girl. Mr Sheikh added: 'The defendant was also a bit funny towards her when she was talking to other men at the bar.' They returned to the complainant’s flat in the early hours. 'She shares it with two others and when they got into the bedroom she changed into jogging bottoms and a top and got into bed, where the defendant joined her without any clothes on at all. 'He started kissing her and got on top of her and she was shouting: ""No, no,"" and to stop, but he did not take any heed of these cries and touched her with his fingers.' Partial intercourse occurred for a very short time and the young woman managed to get away and told Leheup: 'Why did you do that when I said no?' Mr Sheikh explained: 'One of the flatmates was woken because of the shouting and told Mr Leheup to leave, but he wouldn’t because he said he had work the next day and wanted to wait until the trains started running . The flatmate threatened to call the police and Leheup clambered down scaffolding outside the balcony door, but was arrested on the way to the underground station. When questioned by police the defendant said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. 'He said he was fondling her breasts and there was no talk of sex one way or the other. 'When they arrived at the bedroom he said she said words to the effect of: ""Welcome to my crack den."" 'He said he took her bra off because she wanted a back massage with some oil and they began kissing. 'He said he got on top of her her and she then freaked out and as soon as she did he got off her,' explained Mr. Sheikh. 'He said he climbed down the scaffolding to avoid a confrontation. 'When she was shouting: ""No"" he should have known she was not consenting. He was not going to take no for an answer that night.' The young woman admits she was under the influence of alcohol. 'I was probably more drunk than I should have been. I was feeling a bit giddy, a bit tipsy, but I was not falling over.' The trial continues.

"The leader of a gang that attacked young girls in Sydney's southwest has been attacked by fellow inmates inside one of Australia's toughest prisons. Bilal Skaf was assaulted by three other inmates in the yard of Goulburn Correctional Centre on Friday. A Corrective Services statement confirmed a '33-year-old inmate' sustained minor head injuries and was treated in hospital before returning the same day. Sydney rape gang leader Bilal Skaf has been attacked by fellow inmates at Goulburn Correctional Ccomplex in NSW. He is pictured (in orange overalls) with his mother, Baria (right) inside Goulburn's Supermax prison on internal prison CCTV in 2002 when he tried to smuggle letters to his girlfriend out through Mrs Skaf . Bilal Skaf (left and right) was the leader of the rape gang which terrorised Sydney teenage girls on a four-week rampage before the 2000 Sydney Olympics for which he received a 46 year sentence and will be eligible for parole, if he behaves himself in prison and admits his crime, in 2033 . Gang rape leader Bilal Skaf pictured in the living room of his family home in Sydney's western suburbs posing with a firearm next to a photograph of his parents and siblings, including his younger brother Mohammed who was also convicted for the  rapes and is serving 32 years in a cell shared with Bilal . 'Three inmates have been segregated while the investigation continues,' Corrective Services said. In 2002, Skaf was sentenced to 55 years' jail for his part in a series of gang rapes in Sydney's southwest. Skaf was one of 14 mostly Muslim Lebanese Australians who went on a four-week rampage of raping Australian women and teenage girls in Sydney in the lead-up to the 2000 Olympics. The gang members, aged between 13 and 18 years, lured the girls from shopping centres and train stations and took them to parks and public toilet blocks. Daily Mail Australia previously reported that one of the victims was raped 25 times by a total of 14 men at Bankstown, in Sydney's west, in an ordeal that lasted six hours, during which the attackers subjected her to racist taunts. Skaf was aged 18 at the time of his rapes and is not eligible for parole until February 11, 2033. During the sentencing, Judge Michael Finnane described the rapes as events 'you hear about or read about only in the context of wartime atrocities'. In August that year, Skaf was moved from Sydney's Long Bay after fellow inmates threatened to inject him with HIV-infected blood they were planning to take from another prisoner. He spent time in the High Risk Management Correctional Centre inside the Goulburn prison complex, where he was caught in 2002 trying to smuggle letters out via his visiting mother, Baria, to his then girlfriend. They were caught and Mrs Skaf was banned from visiting her son for a time. Skaf was later moved to a secure section of the main prison at Goulburn and into a cell he shared with his brother Mohammed, who was also convicted of the 2000 gang rapes, and sentenced to 32 years.","Bilal Skaf has reportedly been attacked by inmates in Goulburn prison yard .

"Samantha Cameron showcased another election campaign outfit this morning, firming up her position as the most stylish of the politician's partners. The Prime Minister's wife showed her support of UK business by sporting a thoroughly British outfit at the Conservative Party's manifesto launch in Swindon. Wearing a simple but elegant £185 emerald green wrap dress by London-based designer The Fold, Mrs Cameron looked every inch the First Lady of British politics as she arrived at the town's University Technical Colleges. Winning in the style stakes: Samantha Cameron, wearing an £185 Hampton dress in emerald green from The Fold, supports husband David as he launches the Conservative Party's manifesto in Swindon . A vision in green: Sam Cam (centre) adds a dash of glamour as she applauds her husband while seated between George Osborne (right) and William Hague (left) All smiles: Samantha laughs at one of the Prime Minister's more jovial points . Sam Cam, 43, a huge fan of British designers, showed her commitment to UK brands once again by plumping for the Hampton dress. The midi dress with cap sleeves and narrow V-neck is made from a non-crease poly twill fabric, perfect for a woman travelling a lot - and a busy mother-of-four. The look was finished with a slim white belt to accentuate Samantha's enviable waistline and a pair of black heels. The company behind the frock has a flagship store in Clerkenwell and was founded by Polly McMaster. The label specialises in contemporary work-wear. Their collection is designed with 'modern, professional women in mind' which makes them an ideal fit for Sam Cam. Other celebrity fans include Davina McCall and Amanda Holden. Liking what they hear: George and Samantha look happy with their man . Wearing green but thinking blue: Samantha stands out against the Tory suits . Sam, who appeared to have caught some Easter sun, showed off tanned legs and arms, but kept her make-up simple with some subtle berry lipstick. Jewellery was a pair of gold hoops and a slim gold chain bracelet. The Prime Minister's wife recently showcased another element of her style - her taste in interiors, as a series of pictures of the Cameron's kitchen dining room were released, along with their 1950s retro-chic sofas and chairs and a funky steel lamp stretching over the table. Promises: Mr Cameron took to the lectern to talk about the Tory party's intentions including doubling free childcare for working parents . Listening intently: Samantha looked comfortable in her emerald green wrap dress . Today, she sat, the proverbial rose between two thorns, next to George Osborne and William Hague, listening intently as her husband took to the stage to outline his party's key policies ahead of the general election on May 7. In launching his manifesto, Mr Cameron promised voters 'the good life' as he vowed to double free childcare for working parents and guarantee workers on the minimum wage will never pay income tax. David had Sam's full attention and she only paused to smile, exchange some knowing looks with the Chancellor and to applaud. She also laughed heartily to the PM's jokes and smiled broadly at other times, although occasionally pausing to adjust her long bob. After the speech was over she and her husband left hand in hand, with Sam almost appearing to lead Dave. View from the back: David and Samantha make their way out of the venue .

A wave to the crowds: David and Samantha look happy after launching the manifesto . A helping hand: The PM shows his chivalrous side as he helped his wife get into a waiting car . During the speech, Cameron claimed Britain is 'on the brink of something special' as he unveiled a cradle-to-grave Conservative manifesto, promising voters 'security at every stage of your life'. The Prime Minister warned there is 'almost nothing without economic security' as he set out an extension of Margaret Thatcher's hugely popular Right to Buy scheme, vowed to scrap inheritance tax on homes worth up to £1million and promised to freeze rail fares for five years. While the audience cheered these plans, Samantha's sartorial choices were also a clear success. Her latest appearance on the campaign trail comes after a MailOnline poll found that if the electorate were voting for wives of politicians, they'd put her at the top of the tree. The latest Populus survey saw the Conservatives and Labour tied on 33 per cent, but if Mrs Cameron went up against Justine Miliband she surges to 38 per cent with Labour on 30 per cent. A new Populus poll for MailOnline asked how people would vote if (left to right) Samantha Cameron, Miriam Clegg, Justine Miliband and Kirsten Farage were leaders instead of their husbands . If wives ruled the world: The Tories would have an 8-point lead over Labour if the women replaced their husbands as leader, a Populus poll for MailOnline reveals . Senior Tories have described Mrs Cameron as their ‘secret weapon’ and her appearances on the campaign trail dominated coverage in the days after the election was called. The poll asked voters which party they would vote for if the women were the leaders instead of their husbands. Mrs Cameron came out on top with 38 per cent, with Mrs Miliband on 30 per cent. Some 21 per cent said they would back Miriam Clegg, much higher than 8 per cent currently enjoyed by husband Nick in the same survey. Just 11 per cent of people said they would vote for Ukip if Nigel Farage’s wife Kirsten was leader. Mrs Farage keeps a much lower profile that the other leaders’ wives, with both Mrs Clegg and Mrs Miliband making regular appearances in the media and on the campaign trail.","Sam Cam accompanied the PM to the launch of his party's manifesto .

"This is the 24-year-old mother who was allegedly shot dead by her Marine veteran husband in an Alabama doctor's office after he wrote a chilling Facebook post saying he was going to 'die today'. Leaj Jarvis Price was reportedly gunned down by Eric Heath Price, the 25-year-old father of her six-year-old son, on Monday after she ran into the surgery in Jemison screaming 'call the police'. Price then returned to their nearby home and staged a standoff with around 40 police officers for several hours, authorities said. When police fired tear gas into the house, he came outside. He was taken to hospital  with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head. His condition remains unknown. He has since been charged with the murder of Mrs Price, who was a nursing student.

Shot dead: Leaj Jarvis Price (right), a nursing student, was allegedly shot dead by her Marine veteran husband, Eric Heath Price (pictured, left, kissing Mrs Price) in an Alabama doctor's office on Monday . Tragic: Mrs Price (pictured with the couple's six-year-old son) was reportedly gunned down by her spouse, 25, after she ran into the office in Jemison screaming 'call the police'. Price then had a stand-off with police . On the day of the shooting, Price apparently posted on his Facebook page: 'I'm sorry everyone, its been real, good bye and i love you all' and 'I dei [sic] today.' The page was taken down shortly after. Mrs Price, who lived next door to the doctor's office with her family, is believed to have got into an argument with her husband, before running to the center, run by Dr Jay Patel, in a bid to get help. Court records show that the couple had been in a long-running custody battle over their son, who was at school at the time of the shooting and features in many of Mrs Price's Facebook photos. When Mrs Price arrived at the doctor's office, she screamed for help. Six or seven doctors rushed out to help, but when the suspect got inside, he allegedly pulled the gun and shot her in the head. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Jemison police chief Shane Fulmer said: 'There never was an active shooter, no hostages. The individual was shot inside the doctor's office.' He added: 'The first thing [Mrs Price] said when she came in was, ""Call the police"".'

He has since been charged with the murder of Mrs Price (pictured, right, in a Facebook photo) Chilling post: After the shooting, Price (believed to be be pictured being taken to hospital) apparently posted on his Facebook page: 'I'm sorry everyone, its been real, good bye and i love you all' and 'I dei [sic] today' After shooting his wife, Price then returned to the home and staged the lengthy standoff. At the scene, there was a series of loud pops near the house. Within moments an ambulance pulled up. Emergency workers could be seen loading a person into the back of the ambulance. The ambulance then left with its siren on. Police, however, confirmed that no shots were fired. Price remains in hospital under police guard. The house, meanwhile, has been cordoned off. A relative of the gunman confirmed to AL.com that Price was ex-military but insisted he did not have a history of violence. However, Price had experienced 'issues' in the past, the relative said. 'I don't know that there were any diagnosed issues or anything like that,' they said. A relative of the gunman confirmed Price was ex-military but insisted he did not have a history of violence.

"Sipping a glass of glorious red wine which has been carefully aged in a hand-crafted oak barrel is my idea of heaven. But until now the only way to enjoy a tipple with that gorgeous authentic taste that can only develop through spending years in a special wooden cask has been to pay through the nose. The second I see the word ‘spicy’ on a bottle label (which suggests an oaky flavouring), I instantly know the price will be much higher. A £5 bottle has suddenly become £12 because the wine has lingered in an oak barrel before bottling. So when I read this week about a new gadget that claims to be able to ‘oak age’ wine in hours rather than years, my curiosity was seriously roused. The Oak Bottle promises to impart an authentic aged flavour — a process that can take up to two years — in just a day or two. Who wouldn’t drink to that? Scroll down for video . TV wine expert Oz Clarke puts to the test this oak bottle that claims to 'oak age' wine in hours rather than years . The product, which retails at £50, is the brainchild of 30-year-old entrepreneur Joel Paglione. Growing up on his parents’ vineyard in Canada, Joel became fascinated by the process of ageing wine. Watching his dad painstakingly filling small barrels of wine for oaking, he wondered why the wine couldn’t be stored in the same huge vats that had been used to ferment it. When Mr Paglione Snr explained that the smaller the oak barrel, the faster the oak infusion, Joel got his Eureka moment. How about a bottle made out of oak which will ‘oak age’ a single bottle in a fraction of the time? Now, after three years of experimenting, Joel has developed what he claims is the ‘smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made.’ The idea is you decant a bottle of wine into the oak bottle, leave for up to 48 hours (depending on the strength of the oak flavour you fancy) and — hey presto! — your supermarket bottle of plonk fresh from last year’s grape harvest should suddenly taste like a posh wine from a world-class vineyard that has had years to mature and develop oaky flavours. Ageing a wine overnight is the holy grail of wine lovers. It’s like finding the elixir of eternal youth — in reverse. But can a simple gizmo really mimic such a time-honoured process? Can I turn a cheap plonk into a lovingly aged wine? I’m eager to try. When it arrives, the Oak Bottle looks like a wooden version of the thermos flask I take on picnics. It’s plain and reassuringly sturdy. For my test I choose a Bulgarian Merlot (Simply Merlot, Tesco £4.20). It’s an unpretentious, fruity wine, great for glugging, but it’s hardly stellar quality. However, as with the French wines such as Bordeaux and Burgundy, Argentinian Melbecs, Australian Shirazes and, of course, the Spanish Rioja, once you add oak to a Merlot you are entering a whole new world — and price bracket. Merlots benefit hugely from being oak aged. I’m itching to start my test. But first I have to fill the Oak Bottle with water. Oak shrinks when dried out, so the instructions warn me the Oak Bottle is inclined to leak until it is sealed using lukewarm water to swell and close up any open wood grain. Sure enough, water drips out over the next two hours — enough to saturate the kitchen towel I put underneath. Eventually, the wood ready and the drips stop. Now I can start. I pour out the water, decant my Merlot, pop the stopper on and wait. Joel suggests the whole process can take anything from 24 to 48 hours. That’s a drop in the ocean compared to the 12-to-18 month ageing process in a proper barrel. The Celts weren’t wine drinkers but apparently were the first to use oak barrels to store and transport their beer and mead. The wine-loving Romans leapt at the invention — they were sick of their ceramic jugs crashing and breaking on long sea voyages. The Oak Bottle promises to impart an authentic aged flavour . They quickly discovered the wooden barrels not only added flavours to the wine but, because wood is porous, also allowed air (specifically, what we know as oxygen) to permeate the contents slowly, removing harsh flavours. In fact, that’s the other reason we pay such a premium for barrel-aged wines — the oxygen changes the molecules in the wine, sweetens the acids, softens the bitter bits and lets the tannins (or sediment) drop to the bottom, giving it a gorgeous rich mellowness. Great European winemakers have been using the same technique ever since. It’s still all done by hand. Barrels, which hold up to 300 bottles of wine, can cost well over £1,000, with the price determined by the quality of the oak that’s been used and the skill of the cooper making them. While the overwhelming aroma you get from oak is vanilla, if the wood is toasted a bit over a fire, you also get nutty flavours of hazelnuts and almonds. Toast even longer and you add chocolatey flavours and, later, coffee and burnt toast. The skill of the winemaker is deciding just how much flavour he wants in his barrel. All these flavours infuse the wine. And it takes months. Can the Oak Bottle — which apparently has a ‘medium toast’ flavour — do the same in just one day? And, just as important — can it turn a young fruity wine into a vintage quaff? If it can, I’ll be the first to splash out £50. The length of time you leave your wine in the Oak Bottle depends how oaky you like it — but it’s advisable to sample the contents regularly. Therefore, 14 hours into the experiment, I decide to see how the magic is working. Pulling out the stopper, sadly, has none of the heady satisfaction of uncorking a bottle. But I’m prepared to overlook the disappointment if the taste is right. As I take my first sniff, I immediately get a delicious aroma of vanilla. My spirits rise, but after the first sip they crash. It’s wine — with a hint of furniture polish. Even though the wine has been in the Oak Bottle for less than 24 hours, the taste of wood is overpowering. All the natural freshness of the fruity young Merlot has disappeared. I feel like I’m licking a plank of wood. Oz Clarke said the Oak Bottle is a fun product that would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff . In a traditionally oak-aged wine, the woody flavours would integrate over many months to give a rich, mellow taste. But this has been forced. This might be remedied by leaving the wine in the bottle for less time. In fact, the Oak Bottle’s developers say you can taste the wine every hour until you reach a level of oakiness appropriate for that particular bottle. I also think the Oak Bottle might actually improve the more times you use it. With each use, I imagine the strong oak flavour will fade. This is because alcohol, which is solvent, dissolves the flavours from inside the bottle. The Oak Bottle is the result of three years of experiments . For example, in winemaking a producer might empty his oak barrel after 18 months. At this point some 80 per cent of the flavours created by the barrel will have disappeared. Reuse the barrel, and there should be only 20 per cent of the oak-lined flavour left. By the third time you use the barrel, you might only have 5 per cent of the original flavour. I suspect it will be the same with the Oak Bottle, so those overpowering notes of beeswax furniture polish would mellow. The Oak Bottle is a fun product, and would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff. But there is another trick you can use to improve wine. Simply open your bottle of wine, pour half a glass, screw the top back on (or put in a stopper) and give the bottle a good shake. This forces oxygen into the wine, loosening the flavours and making it more drinkable. Leave for five minutes before you enjoy. Perfect — and it won’t cost you a penny.","The Oak Bottle claims to 'oak age' wine in hours rather than years .

"The company which owns the Hogwarts Express and offers steam train excursions across some of Britain’s most picturesque routes has been temporarily banned from operating following the ‘most serious’ case of a near collision so far this year. Services by West Coast Railways have been suspended following the incident on March 7 in which a train failed to stop at a signal. According to reports, a 100mph collision between a steam excursion and a First Great Western high speed train was missed by barely a minute. Scroll down for video . Fanfare: Actor Mark Williams aka Arthur Weasley in Harry Potter films, unveils the Hogwarts Express train at The Harry Potter Studio tour at Leavesden, where it is business as usual this Easter. But West Coast Railways, which own the train that was used in the films, have had services suspended after near miss . The nationwide ban by Network Rail is the first since privatisation, indicating the gravity of the incident. WCR, based in Carnforth, Lancashire, owns a fleet of steam locomotives including Olton Hall, the train used as the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The 78-year-old steam train that operated throughout the film franchise was installed at a new extension of the Harry Potter tour at Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden last month. Platform 9 ¾, which gives Harry Potter fans the chance to climb aboard the train’s carriage and to pose with a luggage trolley as it disappears through the platform wall, is operating as normal. The Network Rail ban means chartered services, including those on the West Highland Line taking in Fort William, and Settle to Carlisle line in the Yorkshire Dales, cannot run until May 15. In the meantime WCR needs to take a number of steps to address Network Rail’s concerns. The suspension notice states: ‘Network Rail has had concerns about WCR’s performance of its safety obligations for some time, and recent events lead Network Rail to believe that the operations of WCR are a threat to the safe operation of the railway.’ Network Rail told RAIL magazine that WCR had ‘demonstrated that its controls, communication and commitment following the recent [incident] were inadequate’. 'This ranked as the most serious Signal Passed at Danger SPAD that has taken place this year when the industry risk ranking methodology was applied.'","West Coast Railways services suspended after train failed to stop at signal .

"A 20-year-old British tourist has claimed she was molested by a taxi driver in Jaipur, who has now been arrested (pictured posed by model) A taxi driver in India has been arrested after being accused of molesting a British tourist. The driver, known as Salim, is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in Jaipur on Friday evening. The man, from Todabhim in Karauli district of Rajasthan, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody. A spokesman for Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend, India Times reported. 'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man. 'He was arrested under Section 354 of IPC (Indian Penal Code). He was sent to judicial custody,' His arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in India against tourists and locals, which have led to widespread protests. On February 8 a Japanese tourist filed a complaint accusing a tout of raping her in Dudu, around 60km away from Jaipur. The woman had been on a tour when the man allegedly approached her and offered his service as a guide. In March a 75-year-old Indian nun was gang raped by a group of eight robbers when she confronted them after they broke in to the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal state's Nadia district. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women . One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent.","Taxi driver has been arrested on suspicion of molesting a British woman .

"Cyril Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib-Dem grandee in the years before he died . Nick Clegg made a desperate bid to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith yesterday by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician'. He claimed the obese sexual predator did not belong to the Liberal Democrats at the time he was abusing scores of young boys. In fact Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib Dem grandee in the years before he died. Mr Clegg was accused on a radio phone-in of having 'washed his hands' of the issue by refusing to order a party investigation into Smith. He insisted there would be no inquiry despite revelations in Saturday's Daily Mail that the Liberal party – a forerunner to the Lib Dems – offered hush money equivalent to a month's wages to an activist after she complained about Smith molesting a teenage boy in 1979. Mr Clegg was confronted over the Smith scandal during a phone-in show on LBC radio yesterday. He was asked by 'John from Bexleyheath' why the Lib Dems had not investigated despite new details of Smith's prolific paedophilia exposed in this paper's serialisation of Labour politician Simon Danczuk's book about the late Rochdale MP. Mr Clegg attempted to distance the Lib Dems from Smith and said 'any political party' should co-operate with the police inquiry. He said: 'As it happens, Cyril Smith, as you may know, the allegations surrounding him, actually go right back to the time when he was a Labour politician, back, well before I was even born, I think.' Mr Clegg accused Mr Danczuk of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. He added: 'Cyril Smith was active in politics, by the way, in a party which no longer exists – the Liberal party. 'So he was a Labour politician, and then he was a politician for most of his career, for a Liberal party, which no longer exists. All this happened well before the Liberal Democrats were even formed.' Mr Clegg said the only way to get justice was for the police to investigate and blamed them for not having done so. Mr Danczuk, the Labour candidate for Rochdale, said his book made it clear that Smith had started out as a member of the Labour party. Nick Clegg made a desperate attempt to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith today by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician' He added: 'Nobody will be surprised to hear that Nick Clegg is being disingenuous in his comments. Mr Clegg accused Labour's Simon Danczuk (pictured) of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that actually Cyril Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. 'I urge him to face up to the fact that one of his colleagues – somebody who he and other members of his party celebrated for very many years – was a paedophile. 'I think it is a disgrace to try to avoid tackling this issue and to try to politicise this issue in the way that he is doing.' Smith was elected as a Liberal MP in 1972, but after the Lib Dems were formed in 1988 took the whip of the new party until his retirement from Parliament in 1992. He remained a Liberal Democrat grandee up to his death in 2010 at the age of 82. A gushing video tribute from Mr Clegg was played at Smith's 80th birthday party at Rochdale town hall in 2008. The Lib Dem leader told him: 'I'm a great admirer of you personally, but also owe you a great debt of gratitude politically too.' The Daily Mail's serialisation of Mr Danczuk's book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith, revealed that senior Liberals were made aware of the paedophile MP's abuse. Lord Steel, who as David Steel was Liberal leader from 1976 until 1988 and nominated Smith for a knighthood, was alerted in 1979 to claims that Smith had subjected boys to humiliating spankings but Smith denied any wrongdoing. Senior Lib Dems including the Business Secretary Vince Cable and the former leader Charles Kennedy have insisted they heard nothing. The party has been accused of 'squirming' over the issue.","Lib Dem leader makes desperate attempt to distance party from allegations .

"A Michigan family have been left devastated after a state Department of Natural Resources officer shot dead their beloved pet potbelly pig, claiming little 'Caesar' made him feel threatened while on the loose. Brandy Savelle and Tony Gervasi had Caesar for two years and were recently trying to teach him to an outside animal. When Caesar went missing from their home in Ispheming on the weekend, the family tried to find him, and followed some tracks in the soft grass. 'When I followed the prints ... it was like a puddle of blood, at first I didn't believe it,' Savelle told WLUC-TV. Killed: Little Caesar was shot dead at the weekend after wandering off from his family's home in Ispheming in northern Michigan. He was killed by a DNR officer, who believed he was feral .

BFFs: Caesar and the family's pet dog got along famously, the couple said . Savelle continued: 'I just started screaming for him.' The incident became quite a big deal in the area, with announcements on Facebook quickly spreading and a page set up on Go Fund Me. A day later, a Natural Resources officer showed up at the couple's door. 'We figured he had information so with excitement, Brandy answered the door asking if he knew anything about the pig,' Mr Gervasi said. 'The man responded ''Actually, I am responsible for the missing pig…'' The officer explained that Caesar 'came out of the woods at me running at a trotting pace'. He said he 'felt threatened' so shot him. The officer maintained he believed the animal was feral. Scene: Mr Gervasi took this photo of the blood they found after following Caesar's tracks and put the photo on Facebook when the pig was still missing, which quickly spread . Shot dead: The officer explained that Caesar 'came out of the woods at me running at a trotting pace' and that he shot the pig, believing he was a feral animal . Harmless: The state is defending a Department of Natural Resources conservation officer who shot Caesar on the belief the pig was wild . The shooting also happened on state land. In such circumstances officers are permitted to shoot animals that can carry disease and/or damage property. Peter Wright, a law supervisor for the DNR, told WLUC-TV that the officer was just doing his job. He said the officer believed it was a feral pig, since it had no identifying marks to distinguish him as a pet. 'I want to make it very clear that it's never ever, ever the department's position that we want to shoot people's pets,' said Wright. 'If he had any inkling it was a pet, he absolutely wouldn't have shot it.' Upsetting: The family are now trying to get Caesar's body in order to bury him, but have been told they can only take possession of his ashes . Brandy Savelle and Tony Gervasi are now trying to get Caesar's body back. However they have been told they can only take possession of ashes. Ms Savelle is demanding that some sort of recourse comes out of the situation. 'If it was that big of a mistake then we would like to see better training,' she said. 'Let's learn to identify not just pigs, but all pets.'","Caesar went missing at the weekend from his owner's home in Ispheming .

"Remembering passwords can be a struggle. While Apple offers touch ID to use your fingerprint to unlock a handset, Google has now released an update to its Android software allowing owners to unlock their phone with their voice. Known as trusted voice, it can unlock a phone simply by hearing its owner say 'OK, Google'. Google has released an update to its Android software allowing owners to unlock their phone with their voice . 'We've heard from multiple users that the fully formed feature is rolling out,' said Android Police. 'Tapping the option under smart lock will take users to the Google app's settings.

The popup when you enable 'Trusted Voice' warns that the feature is not as secure as a traditional lock screen and that 'Someone with a similar voice could unlock your device.' Google also offers an alternative way to unlock an Android phone - and it involves using your face. The Face Unlock feature was originally introduced in 2011 as part of Android 4.0, also known as Ice Cream Sandwich, but despite this, it is still a relatively unknown tool. It can recognise a person's face and recent updates mean it can even establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real, or is a photograph. The voice unlock feature has not been officially announced by Google, but has begun to appear on some Android Handsets . To set up Face Unlock, people with Android phones running Ice Cream Sandwich or higher can go to Settings, Security, click on Screen Lock and select Face Unlock. The set-up wizard will then ask the user to take a photo of their face, using the device's front-facing camera. It will also advise if the lighting or positioning isn't clear enough. Once a photograph is taken it is stored in an encrypted file and each time a person wants to unlock their phone with their face, the Android system will cross-reference the image with this original photograph.

When Google launched Face Unlock it was criticised by security experts because it could be bypassed by holding static photos up to the phone or tablet's camera. In the update to Android Jelly Bean in July 2012, Google added a 'liveness' check in an attempt to prevent these static images being used to gain access to devices. This meant a user would have to blink while using Face Unlock to prove they were alive. Google already lets its users enable two-step verification for their online accounts, and offers Face Unlock on Android. With Face Unlock, pictured, Android users can use their face to unlock their smartphone or tablet, in place of a PIN or a pattern . A number of Nexus 5 users reported problems with the Face Unlock feature when the phone  launched earlier this year, but Google has said that these bugs should be fixed with the introduction of Android 4.4 KitKat. The expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user's identity. The patent explains there would be a small margin of error but the user's expression would have to match the original photo as closely as possible.

"A size six woman who was determined to keep in shape during pregnancy revealed she exercised twice a day and ate 30 pieces of fruit - including eight mangoes and ten bananas - every day. Yulia Tarbath, 33, who is originally from Surrey but moved to Bali with her husband Paul in 2009, led a raw vegan diet - consisting of massive quantities of fruit, vegetables and juice, as well as hours of running, cycling and lifting weights. The mother-of-one revealed she gained less than a stone in weight during her first pregnancy - and took less than two weeks to get back to her starting weight of 8 stone after giving both to daughter Elaine, who weighed a healthy 7lb 5oz when born. Scroll down for video . Yulia, who stuck to a vegan diet consisting of massive quantities of fruit, vegetables and juice, as well as hours of running, cycling and lifting weights, at 39.5 weeks pregnant with her husband Paul . Every morning, Yulia, pictured with Paul and daughter, Elanie, started the day with eight mangoes. For lunch, she ate her way through ten bananas and entire bunches of spinach . Life coach Yulia said she believes there's 'no excuse to be fat in pregnancy' adding that carrying a child 'is no excuse to pig out'. Every morning, Yulia started the day with  eight mangoes. For lunch, she ate her way through ten bananas and entire bunches of spinach. For dinner, she ate huge avocado salads - washed down with the juice of a dozen oranges. She said: 'There's no excuse to be fat in pregnancy. I exercised throughout my entire pregnancy and ate a healthy vegan diet. 'I didn't want to be eating for two - being pregnant is no excuse to pig out.' Yulia added: 'My midwife thought I was crazy and urged me to eat more. People in the gym would come up to me and ask if I was okay - people thought I was crazy but I did what I wanted. Yulia Tarbath, 33, pictured after she had her daughter, retained her size six figure throughout the nine-month term with regular work outs and a raw vegan diet . Yulia, pictured before falling pregnant, decided to research alternative options to battle her chronic tiredness, fertility problems, dry skin, dark circles and deep depression and discovered a raw vegan diet . 'I never exerted myself, did too much exercise or tried lifting weights that were too heavy for me. 'If anything, I took things a bit easy.' Yulia moved to the Indonesian island of Bali in 2009 with husband Paul, 41, to set up a healthy life-coaching business. When Yulia was 27, she decided to research alternative options to battle her chronic tiredness, fertility problems, dry skin, dark circles and deep depression. She said: 'I read up on the benefits of being vegan. I had such a desire to become pregnant, but experienced issues. I was heavily depressed and suffered from chronic tiredness. 'Suddenly my life started to change when Paul and I became completely vegan. We threw ourselves into it and started working out twice a day.' Yulia, at 31.5 weeks pregnant, moved to the Indonesian island of Bali in 2009 with her husband to set up a healthy life-coaching business . While Yulia, pictured at two months pregnant, may have had some funny looks from people in her local gym, she says she wouldn't change a thing about her pregnancy and will do the same if she has another child . Yulia, pictured with Paul after giving birth, says her midwife was concerned, especially with her diet. 'She wanted me to get more protein but I knew what I was doing,' she said . In June 2013, she fell pregnant, and in April the following year, the proud parents welcomed little Elanie into the world. She said: 'I was not about to stop my lifestyle. I continued working out and two weeks after finding out, I completed a triathlon. 'As the pregnancy developed I continued to work out twice a day and eat a vegan diet. Even five months into the pregnancy you couldn't tell. From behind I just looked normal. 'I continued to exercise once in the morning with a job and light weights and then yoga, swim and cycle in the afternoon.' While Yulia may have had some funny looks from people in her local gym, she said she wouldn't change a thing about her pregnancy. She said her life started to change when she and Paul became completely vegan. 'We threw ourselves into it and started working out twice a day,' she said of their new lifestyle . Yulia  retained her svelte size six figure throughout the nine-month term by exercising  - and eating 30 pieces of fruit every day . She said: 'I felt such a connection to my child. I would be working out and feel her kick - I think she liked it - she was just as active as her mummy. 'My midwife was concerned, especially with my diet. She wanted me to get more protein but I knew what I was doing. 'Two weeks after birth I had already dropped to 8.5st. My weight gain was purely the baby, and now I am back in the gym and breastfeeding my baby. 'When I fall pregnant again I wouldn't change a thing. I'd run a marathon whilst carrying a child if I could.' Speaking to FEMAIL about Yulia's eating and exercise regime, Dr Eva Detko Nutritionist said: 'A vegan diet is potentially dangerous during pregnancy and definitely not recommended. Yulia, pictured with Paul after giving birth, gained less than a stone during her first pregnancy, and took less than two weeks to get back to her starting weight of 8st . Life coach Yulia stuck to a vegan diet consisting of massive quantities of fruit, vegetables and juice . 'I would never advise anyone to stay vegan during pregnancy, it's not only about you - it's about the baby. 'You obviously don’t need to eat twice as much - don’t eat for two! - around 300 extra calories is fine, but you need quality protein, which is hard to get on a vegan diet. 'As a vegan (pregnant or not), you must really know your stuff. 'It's important to combine proteins to get all of the amino acids. You also need vitamins, including B12, which you can only get from animal sources; without good quality B12 you may have a baby with poor immunity. 'There are no vegan sources of B12, so they would need supplementation. 'Then there’s essential fatty acids such as omega 3, which is found in animal sources (or masses of seaweed). 'On the plus side, vegans have a lot of green leafy vegetables, which are packed with iron, folic acid and calcium, which are all great during pregnancy.' On top of her healthy diet, she endured hours of running, cycling and lifting weights . As Dr PhD Marilyn Glenville (www.marilynglenville.com) explains: 'Eating healthily means eating regular meals of freshly prepared whole foods. Buy organically grown produce wherever possible as this reduces the toxic load on the body. Eat a good proportion of raw fruits and vegetables. Do not eat raw meat or raw fish. Steam rather than boil, stir fry rather than deep fry and grill or stew rather than roast or fry. Make sure your diet is balanced with adequate protein, complex carbohydrates and high in essential fats but low in saturated fats and drink plenty of filtered or mineral water.' Foods to include . • Complex Carbohydrates Good sources: fresh fruit and vegetables (raw or lightly cooked), wholegrain breads, brown rice, wild rice, millet, oats, barley, buckwheat, rye and Quinoa. • Protein Good sources: Organic poultry (1 or 2 pieces per week), fish, goat milk, sheep milk, organic eggs, vegetarian cheese, nuts, soya, seeds and pulses. Some grains are better sources than others, for example Quinoa and millet; the rest have a small amount and should be combined with other protein sources. • Fats Good sources: Oily fish such as wild organic salmon, sardines, mackerel and herring. Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, walnuts, almonds, evening primrose oil, olive oil, hemp oil, starflower / borage oil and flax seed oil. • Water: Many of us do not drink enough water. It is thought to be essential in providing the medium in which many chemical reactions within the body take place. Sadly much of our tap water does not measure up to safety standards required. It is advisable to drink only bottled or filtered water whilst pregnant. • Fibre Good sources: Whole grains, fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds. You can also soak a tablespoon of whole linseeds in a glass of water overnight and swallow with an extra glass of water to help with the bowel.","Yulia Tarbath, 33, continued regular workouts and raw vegan diet .

"Scientists hoping to see 13 billion light years away, giving them a look into the early years of the universe, are facing opposition from Native Hawaiian groups looking to preserve their past. Demonstrators including Game of Thrones actor Jason Momoa demanded the state and University of Hawaii stop construction of a new $1.4 billion telescope on sacred land. Dozens of protesters were arrested on Thursday at the Mauna Kea site, a mountain burial ground said to be visited by the snow goddess Poli'Ahu and a Native Hawaiian leader has called for a 30-day moratorium on construction. Thirty-one people were arrested during protests blocking access to the construction site for the $1.4billion Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii . Protesters say that the mountaintop, where scientists are building the facility to see 13billlion years into the past, is on top of sacred burial ground land . The Thirty Meter Telescope will be one of the largest space observation facilities in the world when its scheduled construction is completed (artist's rendering) Peter Apo, a trustee for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, said he's asking Governor David Ige and University of Hawaii President David Lassner to bring people together to work out a long-term solution. 'Hawaiians absolutely believe in science. How that plays out on this mountain is going to be a matter of getting the right set of people in the room to negotiate some sort of compromise that everyone can live with,' Apo said. However, he stated that stopping construction of the 18-story facility is key before progress is made. 'You can't even get to the discussion point until they stop construction,' he said. Apo said the state should revisit how it manages the summit, which belonged to the Hawaiian monarchy until the US-backed overthrow of the island kingdom in 1893. The state holds former kingdom lands in trust for the Hawaiian people, who see the site as sacred. 'It is the burial grounds of some of our most sacred and revered ancestors,' said Kealoha Pisciotta, a project opponent. 'It is a place where we go for sanctuary and release from the world around us, and it is also the home of our god.' The governor's chief of staff, Mike McCartney, said his office is involved in discussions about the controversy but must decline comment to allow productive conversations to continue. University spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said the school welcomes all calls for more dialogue and is actively meeting and addressing the issue at the highest levels. Game of Thrones actor Jason Momoa, who is native Hawaiian, attended protests and posted pictures of himself thrusting his staff in the direction of current Mauna Kea telescopes . The future Aquaman star said that no more dynamite should be used on top of the mountain, which is sacred to Kanaka Maoli . The dispute has pitted Native Hawaiians, who believe the telescope site is sacred because it is where their creation story begins, against scientists, who believe it's an ideal location for one of the world's largest telescopes. The land is in a  remote and sheltered position, nestled in the crater of a dormant volcano. About 300 protesters gathered at the mountain Thursday, and police and state law enforcement arrested 20 people who tried to block a road leading to the summit of Mauna Kea on Hawaii's Big Island. Eleven more were arrested atop the peak of the dormant volcano, the highest point in the state, for alleged trespassing. Visitors to the protests have included Game of Thrones actor and native Hawaiian Jason Momoa, who said that the demonstrators were 'protectors not protesters'. The future Aquaman star, who is Kanaka Maoli, posted pictures on his Instagram thrusting a staff into the air in the direction of current Mauna Kea telescopes. He said no more dynamite should be used at the mountaintop. Poli'Ahu, the native Hawaiian snow goddess of Mauna Kea, is said to often descend to the mountain's summit . The mountain, which already holds 13 telescope facilities, is also the burial ground for previous generations of native Hawaiians . Numbers are expected to swell ahead of an upcoming cultural festival in nearby Hilo, according to Hawaii News Now. The demonstrations have now drawn in Native Hawaiian leaders from other islands. Project opponents question whether land appraisals were done correctly and whether Native Hawaiian groups were consulted, so they have tried to prevent construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope. Project leaders say they regret the arrests but safe access to the site needs to be preserved. While the Native Hawaiian groups do not oppose the telescope itself, they disagree with constructing it on Mauna Kea. All of the highest points in the islands are considered the home of deities, Pisciotta said. The snow goddess Poli´ahu is said to often descend on the mountain top, according to the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy. The mountain also hosts her sister goddesses Lilinoe, Waiau, and Kahoupokane, who are sometimes compared to Christian and Muslim angels. Scientists hope that building the Thirty Meter Telescope will allow them to answer fundamental questions about the universe . The project includes a thirty meter segmented mirror and scientists say it will drastically increase the ability of scientists to see images from light years away and detect Earth-like planets . Researchers, who have already built 13 telescopes atop Mauna Kea, picked the site for their new project because of its remoteness and ideal observation conditions . Protests against the alleged incursion onto sacred land also disrupted a groundbreaking ceremony last year. Construction was delayed early last month because of blizzard conditions at the top of the sometimes snowy mountain. Gary Sanders, the Thirty Meter Telescope project manager, said Friday his organization appreciates the support it's received from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, including in 2009 when the agency endorsed the selection of Mauna Kea as the site for the observatory. Sanders said the telescope has been communicating with the governor's office and the university president. He stressed the telescope has been discussing the project with the public since 2008, when it filed a notice for an environmental impact statement. There are currently still lawsuits pending against the construction challenging its land use claims. The university leases the land at Mauna Kea from the state and then subleases it to the Thirty Meter Telescope project. A partnership of Canadian and US universities plans to build the observatory along with institutions in China, India and Japan. There are currently 13 telescopes at the summit, including some of the world's most advanced. The first was built in the late 1960s. Protesters apprehended Thursday paid $250 in bail and were released. Office of Hawaiian Affairs trustee Peter said that the demonstrators are sometimes viewed with 'intellectual snobbery' (File photo, March 30) Apo (right) has asked the governor and the University of Hawaii to bring both sides of the conflict together during a moratorium . Apo said that Hawaii leases the land for $1 a year and the university gives it to the observatory for $1 a year. However, the trustee said that the observatories generate millions of dollars in revenue by selling viewing time and that 'monetary value of Mauna Kea viewing time is astronomical'. He said Native Hawaiians have a profound interest in science but that they are 'viewed through a lens of intellectual snobbery,' he wrote in Honolulu Civil Beat. Scientists, who picked the site because of its remoteness and ideal observation conditions, hope that building the bigger telescope will allow them to answer fundamental questions about the universe. It will feature a segmented mirror thirty meters in diameter and researchers say it will be able to detect Earth-like planets close to other stars as well as revealing more information about dark matter. The Hubble Space Telescope has a two and a half meter mirror. The people arrested Thursday were trying to block trucks heading to the peak. Work got underway after the protesters were arrested and the path to the summit was cleared. Police said they warned protesters who formed a roadblock Monday that anyone who obstructed the street would be arrested. Those apprehended Thursday were released after each posting bail of $250. The observatory is expected to be operational by 2024, the same year a 39-meter telescope is expected to be completed in Chile.","Manua Kea mountain was burial ground for Native Hawaiians and is sacred .

"Brisbane's Anglican Archbishop has joined a local Catholic priest in calling for Queensland's controversial 'gay panic' homicide defence to be scrapped. Speaking after his Easter Sunday mass, Archbishop of Brisbane Phillip Aspinall said he supported Father Paul Kelly in his calls for the Homosexual Advance Defence to be removed from Queensland common law. The defence means a murder charge may be reduced to manslaughter if the defendant establishes their victim 'came on' to them, and the killing was in self-defence. Brisbane's Anglican Archbishop has supported calls for Queensland's controversial 'gay panic' homicide defence to be scrapped . 'I think Father Paul Kelly is on the right track, well and truly,' Dr Aspinall said. 'I don't think it's reasonable to murder someone who approaches you sexually. Violence is never a constructive response.' Dr Aspinall also appealed to those who resorted to violence at recent anti-Islam rallies, as well as a individuals behind an apparent spate of church vandalism in Melbourne. 'Whenever people feel threatened, there is a natural human tendency to react out of fear,' he said. 'That's exactly what we have to resist.' Archbishop Phillip Aspinall said he supported the calls for the Homosexual Advance Defence to be removed . Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane Phillip Aspinall baptises an infant at an Easter Sunday mass in Brisbane . Scores of worshippers congregated at Brisbane's St John's Cathedral to mark the most important date on the Christian calendar. Incense mingled in the warm Queensland air as Dr Aspinall urged followers to honour the spirit of resurrection in their everyday lives. 'When mistakes we make bring things off the rails and it looks like were going to land in a mess of guilt and shame - there is life beyond all that,' Dr Aspinall said.","A Catholic priest has called for the 'gay panic' laws to be removed .

"It's not just your imagination: most American teenagers are online or on their smartphones every day, and many are almost continually connected. A Pew Research Center survey found that 92 percent of US teens go online daily - and 24% admit they are online constantly. It also household incomes can influence which social network children use - with Instagram and Snapchat being popular with children from wealthier families. A Pew Research Center survey found that 92 percent of US teens go online daily - and 25% admit they are online constantly. The Pew researcher revealed household incomes can influence which social network children use. That includes 56 percent who are online several times a day and 24 percent who say they are connected to the Internet and social networks 'almost constantly.' A key factor is the growing prevalence of smartphones. The survey of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 found that 73 percent had a smartphone and 30 percent had at least a basic cellphone. Even though 87 percent of teens have access to a computer, 91 percent went online daily using a mobile device at least occasionally, Pew found. The survey found that African-American and Hispanic youth are among the most active Internet users. Among African-American teens, 34 percent reported going online 'almost constantly' as did 32 percent of Hispanic youth and 19 percent of white teens. 'American teens, especially African-American youth, have embraced smartphones and the 24/7 access to people and information that they offer,' said Amanda Lenhart, a Pew researcher and the lead author of the report. Some 90 percent of teens with phones exchange text messages, with a typical teenager receiving 30 texts per day, Pew found. And one-third of those with smartphones use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Kik. The researchers found Facebook remains the dominant social media network for young Americans despite the rise of new platforms. Among the teens surveyed, 71 percent said they used Facebook, with Instagram -- owned by Facebook -- the number two social media service used by 52 percent. Among the teens surveyed, Facebook was still the most popular . Asked about other social media, 41 percent of teens said they use Snapchat, 33 percent named Twitter and Google Plus, 24 percent were on Twitter-owned Vine and 14 percent used Yahoo-owned Tumblr. The figures appear to allay concerns that Facebook is being abandoned by youth as more older Internet users join the world's biggest social network. 'Even as Facebook remains an important platform for a majority of teens, Instagram is commanding the attention of half of teens, and Snapchat nearly that number,' said Lenhart. 'There are some interesting differentials in the most frequently used social platforms, with lower income teens using Facebook more often, while wealthier teens -- while still using Facebook -- are more likely than less wealthy teens to report that they use Snapchat or Twitter most often.' More than two-thirds of the teens surveyed said they use more than one social network. But of those who use only one, 66 percent said they opted for Facebook, with Google Plus and Instagram tied for second place with 13 percent each. The report was based on an online survey of 1,060 teens from September 25 to October 9, 2014 and February 10 to March 16, 2015. The margin of error was estimated at 3.7 percentage points.

"Like any mother with an eight-month-old baby, Today show host Savannah Guthrie is ready and willing to try any top parenting tricks which will help her precious baby girl Vale drift off. When the 43-year-old mother-of-one discussed an Australian father's tip for getting his baby to sleep less than a minute with her co-hosts on yesterday's show, she vowed to try the method, which involves gently gliding a piece of tissue papers over a baby's face until the tot nods off. But Savannah soon learned learned that the trick didn't have a calming effect on her energetic infant. 'Not only did it not make her quiet,' she revealed on the show this morning, 'It got her so excited she started screaming and squealing with joy.' All smiles: Savannah Guthrie's eight-month-old daughter Vale giggled with glee when her mom tried to get her to sleep using tissue paper . Savannah, who had the experiment filmed by the Today show cameras, showed a clip of baby Vale ready for bed in a light blue onesie printed with pink birds – but as soon as she started caressing her daughter's face with the tissue, the infant broke out into a wide smile. Vale was soon cooing and laughing with delight - but she wasn't any closer to going to sleep. Last month, Nathan Dailo, a father from Sydney, posted a video to his YouTube channel demonstrating how he gets his three-month-old son Seth to fall asleep in just 42 seconds with a single piece of white tissue paper. The clip of his son drifting off has since received more than 1.7 million views, with one mom commenting on Wednesday that the trick worked for her baby five times already. Full of energy: The 43-year-old watched as her daughter grabbed at the white tissue paper she was using to try and calm her down before bed . Looking confused: Vale, who wore light blue onesie with pink birds, stared at her mom, who was trying to get her ready for bed . Although the tip didn't quite work on Savannah's smiley daughter, she noted that Vale 'really loved it'. And the adorable footage was definitely worth watching. 'Could we cancel the rest of the show and watch this? Today show co-host Willie Geist asked of the precious video. Savannah also revealed that the trick wasn't a total failure in her home. Riled up: Savannah gently glided the tissue over Vale's face, but the trick didn't calm her down at all . Happy girl: Vale soon started laughing and squealing with delight . 'It worked on Mike [Feldman],' she said jokingly of her husband. 'He was out in 30 seconds.' Before they moved on to the next segment, Willie couldn't help but gush over Vale one last time, saying: 'She is the cutest.' In February, Savannah threw an impromptu party for her daughter live on air in celebration of baby Vale’s six-month birthday. Viewers watched as the adorably little girl met the team’s yellow Labrador puppy Wrangler, hung out with Sesame Street's Cookie Monster and palled around with her mom's co-hosts Tamron Hall, Matt Lauer and Al Roker during her special visit to the studio in New York City.","Nathan Dailo, from Sydney, posted a video to his YouTube channel demonstrating how he gets his three-month-old son Seth to fall asleep in just 42 seconds with a single piece of white tissue paper .

"North Sea cod stocks are bouncing back after being heavily overfished for decades and could even be sustainable in five years, new research has found. The population was deemed healthy in hundreds of the northern European fisheries analysed and experts say the fish is closer to being certified as a sustainable species. Consumers were previously told to eat gurnard instead of cod after stocks plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s, but the industry has steadily recovered since regulations were put in place in 2006. North Sea cod stocks are on the rise after being heavily overfished and could be sustainable in five years . However the findings by Seafish and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) revealed that one in nine fisheries operate sustainably, with 400 suffering from serious failings in data management. The exact cod stock figures remain unknown due to a severe lack of scientific data on the number of fish caught every year, according to the Guardian. Dr Tom Pickerell, technical director at industry-funded Seafish, which represents the seafood industry, told the paper he was surprised at how close the North Sea cod is to being certified. He said: 'I would like to think within a decade we will have MSC-certified North Sea cod. I would like to put it closer – where within five years it could look at entering the system.' Cod stocks plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s, but the industry has steadily recovered since regulations were put in place in 2006 . The findings by Seafish and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) did reveal however that one in nine fisheries operate sustainably, with 400 suffering from serious failings in data management . Although eight out of nine fisheries fell short Dr Pickerell remains optimistic, adding: 'It's a question of glass half full or half empty. Trawling in the North Sea saw catches grow each year until the 1980s, with figures for cod peaking at 300,000 tonnes in the 1970s. Various regulations were put in place to protect the stocks of fish, including limited fishing times and limited numbers of fishing boats. But these rules were never systematically enforced and did not bring much relief. After the UK joined the EU, which introduced the Common Fisheries Policy, the problem of overfishing was steadily brought under control. Numbers fell to below 70,000 tonnes for the first time in 1999 and reached its lowest level of 28,900 tonnes in 2006. A report in 2012 suggested that there were only 100 adult cod, which become more fertile as they age, left in the North Sea. Researchers warned a lower life expectancy meant a lower birth rate and a faster decline. But in 2013 the first signs of recovery started to show as the Marine Stewardship Council recognised cod could be on track for certification. 'We are looking at it as glass half full because we now have an action plan. We would have been in the dark without this research.' The research included 450 inshore fisheries, which were assessed against the criteria set out by the MSC to be considered for its 'blue flash' logo. This logo is seen as an indicator for consumers that the seafood comes from sustainable fisheries. Toby Middleton, country manager at the MSC, said the report highlights a 'lack of clarity' on who was responsible for maintaining the fisheries as too many fell between different authorities. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said it recognises stocks are recovering and that there are 'positive signs' but still regards it as a species to avoid. The MCS still lists cod caught in the North Sea as 'fish to avoid', rating it at level 5. It explains that stock levels in the North Sea have declined from a peak of 250,000 tonnes in the early 1970s to their current level of around 70,000 tonnes. Atlantic cod is listed by OSPAR (The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) as a threatened and declining species and by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Sea. 'The efforts of fishers and managers through the Conservation Credits Scheme, and the fact that there is a long term management plan in place, are very positive moves and will hopefully see the fishery continue to recover in the coming years,' it says. The Marine Conservation Society puts forward a recommended list of fish we can eat... The MCS list of fish to avoid: .","North Sea cod populations are healthy in hundreds of fisheries analysed .

"In 1982, Hollywood-born chanteuse Charlene had a surprise worldwide hit with I've Never Been To Me. 'I've moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo,' she sang, 'and showed 'em what I got…' (Actually, when the song became a hit she was in straitened financial circumstances and working in a sweetshop in Ilford, Essex, so instead of moving like Harlow she could have been singing about moving to Harlow.) One of the most irritating lyrics in the song - it has many - is when she sings about the 'Isle of Greece', as if she were discussing the Isle of Man or the Isle of Wight. Don't take this the wrong way, America, but is there anybody in your country with a geography O-level to their name? This may come as a surprise to our transatlantic cousins but Greece has rather more islands in its portfolio than one - in fact there are more than 6,000, most of them uninhabited. The number of inhabited islands is counted at anything from 166 to 227 (depending on the definition of 'inhabited' I suppose). The view of the blue waters of Lourdas Bay, Kefalonia, a stunning Greek island untainted by the masses . I often wonder why Greece doesn't sort out its economic problems by selling off some prime Mediterranean real estate - how many uninhabited islands does one country really need? Out of the six biggest Greek islands, even Americans will recognise two: Crete - the biggest - and Rhodes (fourth biggest). I'm guessing two will be unknown to us all: Euboea (second biggest) and Chios (fifth); and two will sound familiar Lesbos (third) and Kefalonia (sixth). You will probably know Kefalonia because this was the setting for Louis de Bernières's novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin and, in direct contravention of usual Hollywood policy, was where the movie was actually filmed. Kefalonia, it has to be said, has been a little bit reluctant to play the Captain Corelli card too freely in the cause of attracting tourists. Great book, reasonable film (despite the fact Nicolas Cage, who played Corelli, was woefully miscast) but you can see why the Kefalonians were not wholly thrilled to bits by either. It took probably the two worst events in the island's history - the brutal massacre of Italian troops in 1943 and the awful earthquake of 1953 - and used them as grist to the story's romantic mill. Kefalonia is perhaps best known as the setting for Louis de Bernières's novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin . The 2001 film adaptation starred Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz but focussed on negative events . Kefalonia, however, is simply stunning - an absolute gem. I had visited Zante, the neighbouring island, and wasn't impressed. It has some nice beaches but it has been tarnished by tourism of the cheap and nasty sort - lots of scuzzy booze clubs where young Brits go to behave badly. Kefalonia, on the other hand, has remained relatively pristine. This has probably much to do with the fact that its airport is of a size that would find it difficult to cope with the modest level of air traffic arriving on the Isle of Lewis. It's a large island, about a quarter of the size of Majorca, but with just a 20th of the number of tourists of the Spanish hotspot. On arrival, I found myself gaping at the sublime beauty of the place. In parts it reminded me of Tuscany with its gently wooded rolling slopes dotted with trees. Kefalonia is by no means perfect: the roads are sub B-road standard and signposting is practically nonexistent or, for obvious but unhelpful reasons, in Greek letters (a big problem when your satnav starts shrugging its digital shoulders and goes into sulk mode). In a rare case for Hollywood the film was actually shot in Kefalonia where the book's events took place . The sheer sublime beauty of Kefalonia recalls elements of Tuscany but it's by no means perfect . The instructions that told us how to get from the airport to our villa had lots of details like: 'Turn right after the yellow sign near the olive oil shop halfway up the hill from the bakers.' The drive south should have taken 30 minutes but proved much longer with the complicated route. It was a relief, however, to find that tourism had made only limited progress, with just one or two modest-sized hotels in evidence. Eventually we discovered our glorious property - the Villa Zeus - with an 'oh my God' view over Lourdas beach. While unpacking, I decided to take my ease on the hammock. And so it was I had my You've Been Framed moment, toppling straight off and landing on my head. I rose groggily from the dust to find myself being stared at by part-time resident cat Arthur. Arthur the cat was reliable company when food was on offer ... or when he thought it should be . I'm pretty sure 'Barrett' is a name near the top of every stray cat 'watch list' around the world. Wherever we travel, we barely have time to unpack before some flea-ridden derelict is attempting to wrest food from our table. Arthur joined us at the table whenever he was aware that food was on the go. He also made his presence felt when he considered that food ought to be on the go. He was around, therefore, most of the daylight hours - and as he was getting so well fed (we ended up getting him proper cat food from the supermarket) he often stuck around all night. I often found myself giving him bits of cheese at 3am (in fairness, he would eat almost anything). The one moment that Arthur noticeably made himself scarce was the night of the fire. At 2am one night towards the end of our stay, we became aware that a huge wild fire had broken out about a mile away. In these situations it's hard to know at what point you need to get out; too soon you look foolish, too late you look dead. The fire grew in sudden bursts, the flames fanned by strong winds; but it was not obviously coming in our direction… yet. We sat watchful on our balcony with our bags packed ready to escape. We eventually went back to bed. At 6am, I was awoken by a helicopter and a plane which began scooping up water from the sea and then headed over the fire zone to dump it - a laborious process that went on for hours. Later in the day we walked down to examine the site, expecting to see acres consumed by the conflagration. In fact the fire-damaged area was surprisingly small. The one must-do outing in Kefalonia is to Fiskardo, a lovely harbour, and Tassia, an excellent waterfront restaurant that seems to attract an A-list crowd. Booked for that evening, we heard, were Mr and Mrs Tom Hanks whose annual yacht trip normally brings them here. The lovely harbour of Fiskardo is a must-visit place for anyone staying on Kefalonia . Unique Villas offers villas from €699 (£520) per week. Seven nights at Villa Zeus costs from €2,159 (£1,600). easyJet flies from Gatwick to Kefalonia from £36.99pp one way. Norwegian launched a new route from Gatwick to Kefalonia in April. For further information on Greece go to visitgreece.gr. On our way back we passed by the monastery where the body of Kefalonia's patron Saint Gerasimos is kept in a glass case. On his holy day the body is passed over the ill and the sick in the hope of curing them. Also worth a visit is the harbour of Argostoli, where big turtles cruise up and down the waterfront looking for food. Like Arthur, I imagine, they'll eat anything. Back at the Villa Zeus, even though it was still just 3pm, Arthur had convinced himself it was teatime. We didn't disappoint him. We had a glass of the lovely local Gentilini wine as we soaked up the glorious afternoon sun. Arthur had a tin of Felix.","Kefalonia is stunning and doesn't play the Captain Corelli's Mandolin card .

"A drag queen who was friends with Robert Durst when he was living as deaf, mute woman has revealed how fascinated the scion was with wigs and make-up. The 71-year-old real estate tycoon used to live on Galveston Island, on the Texas Gulf Coast and went by the name of Dorothy in the early 2000s. Clair Schuler, who goes by the stage name Cici Ryder, told Click 2 Houston that when he met Durst he was pretending to be a deaf, mute woman. Clair Schuler, who goes by the stage name Cici Ryder, (pictured) is a drag queen who was friends with Robert Durst when he was living as deaf, mute woman . Clair Schuler told Click 2 Houston Durst was 'very infatuated with the drag queens that performed, and their hair and their make-up, especially the hair and the make-up' Schuler said Durst even carried around a tablet to communicate his thoughts at Garza's Kon-Tiki. He said he was not fooled by Durst's apparent deafness and just thought he was an older divorcee coming to grips with his sexuality. 'He was very infatuated with the drag queens that performed, and their hair and their make-up, especially the hair and the make-up,' said Schuler. ""When you saw him in drag honey, eww, it was not pretty. It was blue eye-shadow and red lips, not pretty,"" said Schuler. He said that Durst was shy and never let anyone touch him or take photos. Schuler (pictured at Garza's Kon-Tiki) said Durst even carried around a tablet to communicate his thoughts.He said he was not fooled by Durst's apparent deafness and just thought he was an older divorcee coming to grips with his sexuality . Schuler said Durst was a generous tipper and although there were some strange things about his nature he did not think of him as a threat. A few months later Durst was arrested for allegedly killing and dismembering his neighbor, Morris Black - he was found not guilty. Last week Durst's first court date culminated in a shouting match after none of his lawyers' witnesses showed up. He is awaiting extradition to face murder charges in California appeared in New Orleans accused of illegal gun possession. Controversial: Robert Durst, 71, (file image pictured) is now facing the death penalty in California, where he is accused of murdering his longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000 . His defense team was expected to challenge the case by accusing police of searching Durst's hotel room in the city without a proper arrest warrant. However, as a shackled Durst appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom, the judge raged at his attorneys for being unprepared as they requested to delay the hearing. Durst was arrested on March 14 on charges of possession of a weapon by a felon and possession of a gun with a controlled substance, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, but has yet to be formally charged. It was the day before the final HBO episode aired of The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst. Authorities who searched the room, where Durst stayed under an alias, claim to have found over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask that could fit over his neck and head. FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the country, the agency has said. On Thursday, the judge eventually agreed to postpone the hearing until next week, when the witnesses - two FBI agents and a state trooper - could be charged with contempt of court for failing to appear. Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. He is now facing the death penalty in California, where he is accused of murdering his longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000. The real estate heir was temporarily placed on suicide watch soon after his arrest. His lawyers claim his Asperger's Syndrome led him to erroneously trust the HBO producers, who screened semi-confessional interviews that will now be used against him in trial. Durst, who prosecutors have said is worth up to $100 million, has long been estranged from his powerful family, which has major New York real estate holdings. He has been held without bail at a facility for mentally ill inmates about 70 miles (110 km) from New Orleans, with local authorities having labeled him a suicide risk.","71-year-old tycoon used to live in Texas and went by name of Dorothy .

"They have long claimed to be the only genuine political party – fighting the manipulated PR of the main Westminster parties. But Ukip’s reputation for telling it straight was left in tatters this morning after the party’s deputy leader was caught posing for a photograph to make him look more educated – in front of a photoshopped library clutching a picture book. Mr Nuttall, Ukip’s education spokesman, appeared in the party’s manifesto in thick-rimmed glasses holding a book called ‘British Rebels and Reformers’. The vintage hardback is listed on Amazon as a 48-page illustrated history book from 1942. Scroll down for video . Paul Nuttall, Ukip’s education spokesman, appeared in the party’s manifesto in thick-rimmed glasses holding a book called ‘British Rebels and Reformers’ - a vintage hard-back picture book . Mr Nuttall stands in front of shelves stacked full of books – many of which, on closer inspection, are the same and have been photoshopped to make the library look bigger. After being ridiculed on Twitter, the MEP joked that the photoshop allegations were not true: ‘I just have two copies of every book.’ The bizarre row capped a day of confusion for Ukip after the party's immigration spokesman appeared to contradict her own border policies. Suzanne Evans appeared to contradict a flagship policy on banning non-skilled workers after telling the manifesto launch that the party did not want to 'pull up the drawbridge' but only 'control who walks over it'. Mr Farage hoped to get Ukip's election campaign back on track, promising help for first-time buyers, military veterans, small businesses and hospital patients. The books behind Mr Nuttall were clearly photoshopped, appearing in mirror image next to each other . The Ukip deputy leader later took to Twitter to joke about the allegations, insisting he just had 'two copies of every book' But the attempt to present a more professional image risks being over-shadowed by falling poll ratings, rivals openly vying for the Ukip leadership and chaos over the party's flagship immigration policy. In remarks which risk angering supporters opposed to immigration, Mrs Evans said: 'Ukip is not anti-immigration. Immigrants are not the problem. It's our current immigration system that is the problem. Nigel Farage unveiled Ukip's manifesto in Thurrock, Essex, this morning . 'We will not pull up the drawbridge, we will simply start to control who walks over it.' Today it emerged Ukip has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten. The party reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls. A party strategist said 'something extraordinary' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list. In a speech in Essex, Mr Farage claimed Ukip could hold the balance of power after May 7. He said: 'We are the only party with the self-confidence and belief in this nation that we actually believe that not only could we, but that we should, govern our own country, make our own laws and negotiate our own international trade deals. 'We are the only party standing in this General Election saying we want a trade deal with Europe, we want to be good neighbours with our European friends, but we desperately seek a referendum so that we can set this country free from political union. 'There is no third way. There is no renegotiation of any value that is to be had in Brussels. Our position is perfectly clear - We want our country back.' He set out key polices he would demand as a price for supporting a Tory government. They include: . An in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership 'as soon as possible' An Australian-style points-based immigration system . More than 2 per cent of GDP to be spent on the armed forces . Guaranteed jobs in the police, prison, or border force for anyone leaving the forces after 12 years . Ukip leader Nigel Farage passes UKIP deputy chairwoman Suzanne Evans during the launch of the party's election manifesto this morning . Mr Farage set out key polices he would demand as a price for supporting a Tory government including an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership 'as soon as possible' Waive stamp duty on new homes worth up to £250,000 built on brownfield sites . No income tax on the minimum wage up to £13,000, a new 30p tax band on earnings between £45,300 and £55,000, with the 40p tax band kicking inn at £55,000 . However in the latest sign of policy chaos, the manifesto includes a pledge to limit net migration to 50,000. Mr Farage has previously warned caps and targets are 'ludicrous' and over-ruled his immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe who said the party would put a figure on the number allowed into the UK. Meanwhile Suzanne Evans, the party's deputy chairman, appeared to ditch a key policy on banning unskilled migrants in the space of just 60 seconds.","Ukip have claimed to be the only party fighting Westminster political PR .

"A Florida couple locked two of their children in a closet for days on end, forced them to eat from a bucket and never enrolled them in school, according to authorities. Quincy Hazel and Sabrina Golden-Hazel, both 44 from Riviera Beach, also allegedly never took either of the children, a 17-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, to a doctor or dentist. A 26-year-old relative told police that the family has 11 children but that the 17- and 12-year-old were the only two subjected to the cruel treatment, the Sun Sentinel reported. The conditions emerged when the older child ran away from home last month and started living on the street. Arrested: Sabrina Golden-Hazel, left, and Quincy Hazel, right, have been charged with child neglect after two of their children told investigators they had been locked in a closet and forced to sleep on the floor . When a 19-year-old woman took him in, he told her he was too scared to go home, she told authorities. Speaking to investigators, the teenager said that the couple started locking him and the girl in the closet when they were young and they would spend days on end trapped inside. They were never sure how much time had passed because they could not see sunlight from inside the closet, the boy said. After the girl pretended to be dead a few years ago, Golden-Hazel allowed them to sleep on the floor of a bedroom rather than in the closet, the 26-year-old relative told authorities. When they were let out, the boy was so hungry that he would eat trash, which sometimes made him sick, and he had to endure beatings at the hands of Hazel, he told investigators. Scene: The children, who lived at this home, picked food out of the trash to eat, they told investigators . Locked up: The couple had other children but allegedly only subjected the two children to the treatment . Investigators noticed that he had teeth missing and he said he would often cry at night because of the pain in his mouth - but that he was never once taken to a dentist. Hazel told detectives that he never noticed the children had any health problems, while Golden-Hazel said she hadn't taken them to the dentists or doctors because they had refused to go. She also accused the children of making up the stories and told investigators she home schooled the children - but police did not find any books in the house. They couple have each been charged with two counts of child neglect with great bodily harm and are now locked up the Palm Beach County Jail on $100,000 bail.","Florida couple Quincy Hazel and Sabrina Golden-Hazel 'locked up the 12-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy in a closet for days on end'

"The parents of an 11-year-old autistic boy who miraculously survived four-and-a-half-days alone in the bush after he vanished from their favourite campground have vowed to continue holidaying at the camping spot. Luke Shambrook, who went without food or water since Good Friday, has been going to the Candlebark Campground at Lake Eildon National Park, northeast of Melbourne, since he was just one year old, his parents Rachel and Tim Shambrook revealed in an emotional press conference on Thursday. A desperate search for Luke in the park was mounted after he disappeared from the campground on Friday. The hunt ended on Tuesday when a police helicopter guided on-ground searchers to Luke's location. ‘One thing in his favour is he has been going there since he was one-year-old, every year he’s been up and down the hills and visiting the lake,’ Luke’s father Tim said. Scroll down for video . Rachel and Tim Shambrook thanked everyone for their efforts in helping to find their son Luke . Luke Shambrook's doctors are amazed he is in such a good condition considering he was missing without food and water for so long . His relieved mother Rachel added: ‘He has a real sense of belonging there. I guess that gave him lots of confidence but ultimately that place gives him lots of pleasure and that’s what we are on about regarding spending time there.’ His parents believe the communities prayers and Luke’s own resilience is what saw him survive the terrifying ordeal. ‘Sometimes we don’t give our kids enough credit for their resilience - but he sure showed us,’ Rachel said. The moment Luke was found was captured on video, he was seen peering out from behind trees before a uniformed police officer reached him and took his hand to reassure him he was finally safe. Tim said: ‘We admire everyone’s professionalism, determination and commitment to finding Luke.’ The 11-year-old autistic boy was found just three kilometres away from where went missing at Lake Eildon National Park - north-east of Melbourne .

Luke's parents revealed he has been going to the Candlebark Campground at Lake Eildon National Park, where he went missing, since he was just one year old . The couple vowed to take him back to the campground for more holidays. ‘He has a real sense of belonging there,' Rachel said . ‘We were acutely aware of the thousands of prayers… we felt them,’ Rachel said. The mother-of-three admitted: ‘We found it difficult to keep our hopes up.’ ‘He’s showed a side of him that we knew was there but his resilience has just blown us away,’ Rachel said. ‘To have such an amazing outcome it’s hard to express it in words.’ The parents are still at a loss to know how their son spent his long days alone in the Victorian bushland. ‘If only we could have a snapshot of what his time out there in the bush was like… the concept of trying to understand what he did and how he survived is beyond what we can imagine,’ Rachel said. ‘We’d like to have a glimpse of what he did at night.’ Luke Shambrook was lost for four nights alone in the Victorian bushland and on Wednesday he was reunited with his rescuers at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne . Doctors said on Wednesday they are stunned with how healthy Luke appeared when he was found. Sitting up in his hospital bed, the young boy was greeted by two people from the search and rescue team who made the dramatic find on Tuesday, just three kilometres from where he went missing at Lake Eildon National Park. Luke has been comforted by his family at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and after suffering from exhaustion, dehydration and hypothermia when he was found. He is unlikely to suffer any long term effects from his traumatic ordeal. A camera on the helicopter captured the dramatic moment rescuers reached Luke on the fourth day of an increasingly desperate search . A police officer was first on the site, and he knelt down and offered Luke reassurance he was finally safe . Other rescuers quickly followed, with one wrapping the terrified boy in a foil blanket, before he was gently taken from the bush to where he could receive proper medial attention . Paediatrician Amy Gray said Luke was still a bit weak and tired, but asking for food. His parents revealed he had eaten some Weetabix on Thursday and tasted his first Easter egg after completely missing the occasion over the weekend. 'It's an amazingly happy outcome after what has clearly been an incredibly stressful, traumatic experience,' Dr Gray said on Wednesday. 'I don't know that any of us know exactly what he's been through, but ... we think he's doing fabulously for someone who has been through what we can only imagine, and certainly in much better condition than what we'd expect.' Dr Gray said he was improving with each hour and doctors did not expect him to have any ongoing physical problems from the ordeal. 'Aside from the dehydration he's tired and weak, again as you would expect, but there's no other real major physical issues at this stage,' she said. Luke Shambrook has been found alive after he went missing from the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday . He suffered from dehydration and hypothermia but has been reunited with his mother Rachel (pictured left) His parents Tim and Rachel were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance in a stretcher, with his mother giving him a kiss . Luke was found just before midday AEST on Tuesday in bushland off Skyline Road, 3km from the campsite . 'He seems very content and settled in the ward and happily interacting with the family.' Luke's autism and limited speech could mean he never reveals what happened. 'He may have been wandering around lost and clocking up the k's,' Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Rick Nugent told Fairfax Radio on Wednesday. 'I'm not sure we'll ever know.' Mr Nugent on Tuesday said Luke's survival in the cold, wet, rugged terrain was a miracle. SES spokesman Brent Sergeant said the more days that passed during the search for Luke, the harder it became for volunteers. But finding the boy's beanie on Monday and realising he had walked away from water, rather than toward it, lifted their spirits. When his parents were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance his mother gave him a big kiss. Luke gave his father Tim a 'big thumbs up' when they saw each other, the family said. 'When the rescue team found him, he was in high spirits and was walked out of the bush on his own two feet,' they said in a statement. 'The family are very happy to be reunited.'

"With his bright, inquisitive eyes and wagging tail, on first glance he looks like an ordinary pet. But this is actually a mocked-up image of Britain’s ideal dog, comprising different parts of several breeds to create the perfect furry friend. The coat of an English bulldog, the ears of a King Charles spaniel and the tail of an Irish setter help make up a set of ideal characteristics voted for by 2,000 pet owners. The perfect dog also has the body size of a border collie, the snout of a labrador and the eyes of a beagle. Scroll down for video . The dog has all the best bits from the UK's favourite breeds, the hair of an English Bulldog and a Labrador nose . The research found more than a third of owners wanted their dog to have a short, low-maintenance coat, while a similar proportion favoured soft, floppy ears. Almost half said their ideal dog would be ‘standard-sized’ like a collie, compared with 36 per cent who preferred smaller lap dogs such as chihuahuas. The ‘soft and round’ snout of a labrador was the most favourable nose, with 50 per cent of the vote, beating the elongated snout of a collie which was chosen by 24 per cent. When it came to naming their pets, 29 per cent of owners said they opted for ‘human’ choices such as Dave or Lucy.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, 41 per cent of Londoners preferred small dogs who don’t take up much room.

A quarter of owners valued their pet’s companionship so much they said the perfect dog would live for as long as they did – instead of the normal lifespan of around ten to 13 years. The survey also asked about the ideal dog’s sound, with 30 per cent opting for the ‘mid-range’ bark of a labrador as opposed to a high-pitched yap.

"A popular Virginia high school senior who passed away suddenly this week likely died from bacterial meningitis, it has emerged. Madison Small, from Ashburn, left school early on Mondayand, after she woke up in the night with a severe headache, she was rushed to hospital. By Tuesday afternoon, her father, Tim Small, had contacted the Broad Run High School to let staff know that his youngest daughter had passed away that morning. On Friday, the Loudoun County Health Department confirmed she died of meningococcal meningitis, which causes membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell, My Fox DC reported. Loss: Eighteen-year-old Madison Small, pictured, passed away suddenly on Tuesday morning after feeling ill on Monday and it has now emerged she died of meningococcal meningitis . The bacteria causes membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. It is the school system's first confirmed case in two years, the Washington Post reported. The last case in Loudoun was in January 2013. Public Health and school district officials said they do not have reason to believe her illness poses a risk to other students, particularly because last week was spring break. Loudoun County schools spokesman Wayde Byard told the Post that lockers at the school have been cleaned twice but there is no indication of an outbreak. 'It's a very tragic case... but there's no reason to panic,' he said. David Goodfriend, director of the Loudoun County Health Department, said a small number of people who had contact with Small would be watched for symptoms. Her close friend Devan Rook told the Washington Post that she had thought nothing of it when her friend went to the school nurse on Monday afternoon. Loved: Madison's family said she was otherwise healthy when her health suddenly declined on Monday . Family: Her father Tim Small, pictured center, spoke at a candle-lit vigil held for the teenager on Tuesday evening. Madison is pictured left with her older siblings and parents . Meningococcal meningitis causes membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. It is caused by a bacterium that around 10 per cent of people naturally have in the back of their nose or throat with no issue - but sometimes it can invade the body. The bacteria is passed through direct contact with body fluids, such as through kissing or sharing eating utensils or drinks. Symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and confusion. It is often diagnosed in infants, adolescents and young adults, and a vaccine is recommended for all children aged 11 to 18. The disease can be treated with effective antibiotics but it is important that treatment be started as soon as possible. Even with antibiotic treatment, people die in about 10 to 15 per cent of cases. And 11 to 19 per cent of survivors will have long-term disabilities, including loss of limbs, deafness, nervous system problems, or brain damage. 'Didn't think anything was wrong with her,' she said. 'In the middle of the night, she woke up complaining of headaches and stuff, and they took her to [Inova] Loudoun Hospital and realized it was pretty serious. 'They couldn't handle it there, so they medevac-ed her over to [Inova Fairfax Hospital]. At that point, she wasn't doing too well, and several of her organs were shutting down.' She passed away on Tuesday morning. Her father, Tim Small, also told WUSA9 that his youngest had seemed the picture of health over the weekend, when they played catch together. On Tuesday night, just hours after news of their her death, hundreds of friends, classmates and family gathered for a candle-lit vigil at the school. Friends remembered Small as a talented softball player who had happily mentored younger members of the team. She was also excited about starting Virginia Tech in the fall, they said. School Principal Dave Spage, who broke the news to parents in an email on Tuesday, said he thought there were as many as 400 or 500 people at the vigil, which he said 'speaks to her circle and her involvement here', NBC reported. Madison's father, who also has an older daughter and son with his wife, spoke to those who had gathered. Remembered: Hundreds of people gathered for a candle-lit vigil following Madison's death on Tuesday . Support: Her varsity softball teammates wear their jerseys and line 2nd base as a tribute to Madison . Vigil: Friends lit candles as they shared memories of the beloved 18-year-old on Tuesday . Memorial: Classmates places flowers on Madison's desk after she was taken fatally ill . 'Life can be short, we found that out today,' he said. 'Make the most of it: love each other. Don't get bogged down in the little nitpicky crap. Put that aside. Life's too short.' In a Facebook post shared widely between Madison's friends online, she wrote a touching post in 2011, quoting Winnie The Pooh. 'If there's a tomorrow when we're not together, there's something you must always remember,' she wrote, beneath a smiling photo of herself. 'You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is even if we're apart, I'll always be with you.'","Madison Small woke up feeling ill on Monday night so was rushed to hospital, but her organs began shutting down and she died on Tuesday .

"A family is fearing for a missing Colorado father of five who was last seen nearly two weeks ago while making a purchase of more than $350 at a Southern California Walmart. Oliver Pareece Jones, 37, was caught in a surveillance photo checking out of the Four Points Sheraton hotel on April 5 at 6.26am. He then withdrew $800 in cash out of a cash point before making a stop at a Walmart in Rancho Cucamonga, Teresa McMahon, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County sheriff’s department told Daily Mail Online. Jones then was seen in surveillance footage at the Walmart on Foothill Boulevard around 8.45am where he purchased items including clothes, a radio, backpack and camping gear, according to McMahon. After he left the store, he withdrew another $100 in cash, she told Daily Mail Online. Jones, who owns a pecan business in Chihuahua, Mexico, has not been heard from since. Scroll down for video .

Jones, who is divorced, had been with family in Las Vegas for a reunion and was meant to be attending a convention in San Francisco, but it is not clear if he attended it, McMahon told Daily Mail Online. She said he went to Los Angeles where he went partying, and as of now, said his disappearance appears to be voluntary missing. Jones was also reportedly mugged and assaulted during the trip to California while outside of The Plaza Club, and was left with a concussion before he was sent to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for treatment, according to KTLA. McMahon told Daily Mail Online Jones was in a fight at the nightclub which took place on Friday, April 3. She said there are limited details available regarding that incident and his time at the hospital. His family believes he checked himself out of the hospital. 'We're thinking that his concussion really affected his ability to reason or be able to do anything,' Jones' older brother Jared Jones told ABC 7. Jared Jones also said his cousin Travis, who investigators plan to speak to on Friday, was traveling from Los Angeles to Las Vegas when he and a friend picked Jones up on April 4. He said they then stopped at restaurant Claim Jumper in Rancho Cucamonga, according to NBC Los Angeles. His family has posted fliers near the Walmart hoping to find a lead (above investigators searching a vineyard for any traces of Jones on Thursday) A private investigator learned a homeless man said he spoke to Jones outside of the Walmart, and he was interviewed by San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies (above). Investigators do not believe the homeless man to be involved in the disappearance . It is believed Travis and a friend might have had an argument with Jones on Saturday night, as he reportedly got out of the car, and walked a half mile before checking into the Sheraton hotel where he spent the night, according to Jared Jones. The family hired a private investigator who learned a homeless man said he spoke to Jones outside of the Walmart, and he has since been interviewed by San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies. Investigators do not believe the homeless man to be involved in the disappearance. A spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said at this time, foul play is not suspected and police are investigating the case as a missing person . At this time, foul play is not suspected and police are investigating the case as a missing person, said McMahon. She said: 'We’ve not found anything that leads us to believe he is in distress.' However, private investigator Paul Huebl, suspected foul play. 'He [Jones] bought some stuff and apparently a transient wound up with some of the stuff,' Huebl told ABC 7. 'It doesn't make sense, because it's kind of expensive stuff: a cell phone, a radio, some other things.' Jones was described as a white male standing 5'8' tall and weighing 170lbs. He has blonde hair and blue eyes. 'I just want to find him,' said his brother Keith Jones. 'I don't know if I'll find him alive or dead, I just want to find him.'","Oliver Pareece Jones, 37, of Colorado was last seen at Walmart on April 5 .

"A driver was shocked to receive a £50 fine for failing to display his tax disc - despite it not becoming a legal requirement six months ago. Phil Haste, 60, was also told he had not shown a pay and display ticket in his car, even though he has a valid car parking permit on his dashboard. The businessman is now refusing to pay the fine that was issued in a Torbay council car park. Scroll down for video . 'Diabolical': Phil Haste (left) said he could not understand why he was issued with a penalty notice, as he clearly had a valid parking permit in his car and no longer required his tax disc to be shown . Mr Haste sent his appeal to the council on Saturday after being issued with the ticket last month and said it was a 'diabolical' decision to fine him. The government abolished paper tax discs on October 1 last year, meaning they no longer need to be shown on a vehicle windscreen. Mr Haste, who lives in Torquay, said: 'I would rather go to court than pay the fine. Issuing tickets of this ilk show they haven't got a clue what they are talking about. 'It's diabolical. The council employ these people to do a job for them and it's clearly not being presented clearly. 'They are obviously trying to just grab money where they can. I don't understand why I got this fine.' 'Haven't got a clue': The 60-year-old was also told he had not shown a pay and display ticket in his car, even though he has a valid car parking permit on his dashboard (pictured) The 60-year-old, who owns the yacht brokers' Quayside Marine, added: 'I don't need a tax disc so I don't know why they issued this. 'I have a car parking permit which was clearly on display on the dashboard of my car, so I just can't understand it.' Torbay Council said it was not their policy to issue fines for road tax offences and urged Mr Haste to appeal. A spokesman said: 'We do not issue parking penalty charge notices with regard to road tax and Mr Haste will have been advised on how to appeal against this ticket as it is stated on the reverse of the penalty charge notice.'","Phil Haste, 60, issued with £50 fine for not showing tax disk in his car .

"By the time he reached 17, there was no room for Geoff Johnson at home. His mother started compulsively hoarding when he was a young boy, refusing to trash anything; unable to fix anything. In his senior year, 1995, it was too much: he moved out. Now, two decades later, he and his younger sister Jennifer McShea have returned to the family home in Omaha, Nebraska  - and nothing has changed. Geoff, 37, had visited his mother but only stood outside before picking her up to spend time elsewhere. Jennifer, also 37, returned just twice, on the advice of her counselor, to confront the deeply-embedded shame she felt. But when their mother passed away following a 12-year battle with breast cancer in 2013, the house was handed to them. Finally returning to the meticulous havoc, they were inspired to create a moving photo-series with their own children to document the reality of being a hoarder's child. Scroll down for video . Life as a hoarder's child: Geoff Johnson returned to the home of his mother, a compulsive hoarder, 20 years after he left and created a moving series of images about his uneasy upbringing. He did this by superimposing shots of his son onto images of the trash-ridden home in Omaha . 'No place for a child': His younger sister Jennifer, also aged 37, joined him as they confronted their past after their mother died of breast cancer in 2013. Jennifer's four-year-old daughter is superimposed onto a shot of the bathroom which has not been touched since they left in 1993 . Geoff, a photographer, wanted to picture his son and Jennifer's daughter going about their daily lives among the trash - as they had done years before. But the crumbling house is so unsafe, and their feelings still so raw, that they opted to use Photoshop and superimpose the children onto the images. Regardless, the highly realistic results strike an uneasy feeling that Geoff says was so difficult to come to terms with. 'It is difficult to describe the feeling of shame, the fear of embarrassment that you have growing up with a hoarder,' Geoff, who is still based nearby in Omaha, tells DailyMail.com. 'People would say ""why didn't you just throw things away?"" It's just not as simple as that. Hoarders have a deep-rooted sense of attachment to things and it seems crazy but they have a sense of order. 'My sister and I would try to throw things away, but if anything even moved our mom would get very upset. 'Going back was an emotional experience. 'When we were kids, I would only ever open the door by a crack when people came by. We never had people over. 'It's a complex issue': Geoff said people have since asked him why they didn't just throw things away. He said the issue was deeper than that and his mother had a deep-rooted attachment to every little piece of the havoc. But as a child it was difficult to understand . 'Sense of perspective': Jennifer said the pictures have helped her to see that the home she felt so uncomfortable in was no place for children . Jennifer's bedroom: Jennifer made clear that she did not want the children to enter the crumbling house, which is  filled with mold, as it is unsafe and also occupies a difficult emotional space for her. She wants her daughter to know that she would never put her in that situation . Breaking point: Geoff moved out when he was 17 in 1995 when a pipe burst during the winter. 'There was no heating and I had to be responsible. It was the hardest thing I had had to do in my life up until that point and I couldn't take it any more,' he said . 'Things would break and never be fixed. We didn't have a working refrigerator - we would leave food on the back porch in the winter, and get a cooler in the summer, but that would break too. 'I had to leave in January of my senior year because the pipes broke. It was so cold, there was no heating, and I was just 17. It was the hardest thing I'd had to do in my life up until that point; to be the adult, be responsible. It was too much for me, so I left.' Jennifer was already long-gone by that point. Just 19 months younger than Geoff, she left when she was 15 in 1993, to live with their father in the same village. She didn't return until she finished college in 2001. 'I was going through counseling, and discovered that the house was a big part of the issues I was dealing with,' Jennifer, based in Florida, told DailyMail.com. 'My counselor said I should go back, and take friends to confront the feeling of embarrassment. It was that feeling that people didn't know about that side of our lives. We never let anyone in, and then we left it behind. Feeling of shame: In this image (left) Geoff is recreating the way he would hide behind the door when people came to visit, and never let people come to visit. Jennifer returned to the house when she finished college on the advice of her counselor to confront the feeling of shame . Unmoved: They photographed the scene completely untouched when they returned to clean it up after their mother passed away . The moment they returned together was important for them, they said. They both knew what each other had gone through as kids . 'The first time I stepped in there, the memories washed over me. It was hard. My mom wasn't there, but she had given me permission to go. 'My two friends came in after me, they were supportive and gracious, but I could tell they were also taken aback by it all.' A few years later, she returned again with the man that would become her husband. And finally, in 2013, she and Geoff returned together. 'It was a really important moment for both of us I think,' she told DailyMail.com. 'To be there with someone who knew what you had gone through. We could talk about memories, and now that we're both parents we could reflect on how it affected us. Placing their children in the frames was a cathartic experience that, Jennifer says, helped her fully understand how she had been affected. 'Seeing my own daughter sat there in my room, even though she wasn't actually there, was a really big thing for me. 'You see it from an outside perspective: this is no place for a child. 'I don't think we really knew at the time. For children, it is an enormous, complex, emotional concept to get your head around.' The pair made clear that they continued to have a relationship with their mother until the day she died. It was the house, however, that left them with such difficult feelings. 'My mom worked hard, she had multiple jobs and children. I don't blame her for that,' Geoff says. 'But it was difficult for us.'","Geoff Johnson and Jennifer McShea both grew up with a mother who compulsively hoarded things .

"A Long Island widow and her 14-year-old who have been missing for almost three weeks after a trip to New York City to see a play were stressed out by a legal battle, a relative said. Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were going into the city when they were last seen on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan,  but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Scroll down for video . Iona Costello, 51 (left) and her 14-year-old daughter Emily (right) have been missing for almost three weeks after last being seen on March 30 near their home in the wealthy seaside village of Greenport . The pair often go to shows and museums in New York City, but relatives have filed a missing person report after Emily did not return to her East Hampton school from Spring Break . Relatives of the 'quiet Irish family', who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork, reported them missing on Tuesday. Mrs Costello, who was her late husband George's third wife and inherited his entire estate along with her daughter, had been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. 'She can’t sell anything. She can’t do anything because everything is in court,' an unidentified relative told the New York Daily News. 'I don’t know if she’s having a nervous breakdown. I don’t know if somebody has kidnapped them,' the unidentified family member said of the Costellos' long absence from their home and farm. Costello's adult children have argued that the will granting the estate to Iona was improperly executed, according to Novick Law Group. A Long Island court sided with the adult children last year, and Iona Costello is appealing. Amanda Hurwitz, one of George's daughters who now lives in Connecticut, refused to comment to Daily Mail Online on the report or her stepmother's disappearance. The widow's trip into New York was originally only supposed to last for several days. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . Police said that they do not expect foul play and have no hard evidence suggesting that the Costellos may be in danger . Iona Costello also has family in England, though they have not heard from her, according to Southold Local. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm say it is strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online that his force does not expect any foul play. He said that he does not currently have any hard evidence to point to the mother and daughter being in danger. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones go straight to voicemail. Police still say they do not expect any foul play in the case, though workers at the Costello's North Fork farm say that she would normally be in contact about the business's affairs . Workers at the farm, which also includes cows, said that Mrs Costello told them she would be 'back on Tuesday' Mrs Costello was a well-known equestrian in eastern Long Island, according to the East Hampton Star. Iona's husband George, co-owner of construction company Costello Marine in Greenport, died at the age of 63 a heart attack in 2012 while working on one of his boats. The pair had married in 1999. It is not believed that the Costellos owned any property in New York, according to Chief Flatley, though authorities are now looking at a wider circle of relatives that may know about their movements in the city. A spokesperson for the NYPD said that city police are working in conjunction with Southold officers, but have not yet received any sightings of the mother and daughter. Southold Police said they had no further leads as of Sunday morning. They have asked anyone who sees Mrs Costello or her daughter to contact them at 631-765-2600.","Iona Costello, 51, and her daughter Emily, 14, missing since late March .

"As a spring breeze wafted into his trench French commander Georges Lamour saw something surreal drift his way - a yellow-green cloud. 'All my trenches are choked,' he cried into the field telephone to headquarters. 'I am falling myself!' Chlorine gas — carried by favourable winds over Flanders Fields from German positions — had been used for the first time. It was April 22, 1915. Scroll down for video . Chlorine gas — carried by favourable winds over Flanders Fields from German positions — sowed terror and agony for the first time on April 22, 1915. Above, German Red Cross workers carry bottles of water to help revive troops . Lamour would never be heard from again - and World War I and warfare would never be the same. 'It is a new element in warfare. It is indiscriminate,' said Piet Chielens, curator at the In Flanders Fields Museum in nearby Ypres.  'You create psychological terror.' The chlorine seeped into body fluids and ate away at eyes, throat and lungs. Some 1,200 French soldiers were killed in the chaos of that first five-minute gas attack. 'You drown in your own lungs,' Chielens added. On Tuesday the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will hold a commemorative meeting close to the fields. A century ago German forces were gathering at army headquarters in Tielt, some 30 miles (50km) behind the front line, for a momentous discussion. Commanders had already been waiting 10 days for favourable winds, huddled in a patrician mansion lined with maps and dotted with landscape models. They were bent on breaking the stalemate of trench warfare and all options were open. On Tuesday the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will hold a commemorative meeting close to the fields, pictured in December 2014 . Three World War I German soldiers stand and sit at their planning desks at an office in Tielt, Belgium. They were bent on breaking the stalemate of trench warfare and all options were open . Some soldiers, pictured in their office in Tielt, argued deploying more troops would achieve a bigger breakthrough than using gas . Fritz Haber, a chemical expert and future winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, preached for more gas for more shock and awe. Some argued that deploying more troops would achieve a bigger breakthrough. Chief of General Staff Erich von Falkenhayn decided they would use  the gas the next day or not at all. Across the line Lamour's French forces said there was nothing to report. Had they been able to peer a bit further across no-man's land they would have seen how German troops had dug in, under cover of night, more than 5,000 gas cylinders with tubes pointing their way. The next morning, German trenches were filled with soldiers ready to pounce once the gas had cleared. Gas masks in their containers are piled up (left) in Zillebeke, Belgium, as the director of the In Flanders Fields Museum Piet Chielens looks at postcards written by victims of the first gas attacks (right) Historians estimate that more than 1million soldiers were exposed to gas. Above, graves of French soldiers in Zonnebeke, Belgium . The plan was to release the chlorine in the frosty morning hours, when it would cling best to the surface and give soldiers a full day to advance. A windless morning came and went. The breeze only picked up in the afternoon - and at 5pm the gas cylinders were opened with devastating effect. Once the gas cleared, the soldiers jumped out and made more progress than they had in months. Men, horses, rats, even insects lay dead or choking before them. 'The effect of that gas was enormous,' said historian Ann Callens. 'Even the German troops and certainly the German generals were completely astonished.' But after April 22, the surprise factor evaporated and the stalemate endured. Troops needed only to look at how the prevailing westerly winds bent Flanders' stately trees toward their own positions to know that gas would come drifting their way. Laurence Cadbury, of the British chocolate dynasty, had come to Flanders to help as an ambulance driver. In 1925, 16 of the world's major nations signed the Geneva Protocol, thereby pledging never to use gas in warfare again. But it has continued to be used, even 100 years after the first attack. Seven years after signing the Protocol, Italy dropped mustard gas in bombs during the invasion of Ethiopia. Troops sprayed it from planes and spread it in powdered form on the ground. Around 150,000 chemical casualties were reported. The global chemical weapons watchdog is also investigating allegations the gas was used to carry out fatal attacks in Syrian villages. Activists have accused the Syrian regime of using chlorine - a toxic agent that can be considered a chemical weapon - on civilian areas in the past. There is also evidence to suggest ISIS is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon in its battle, Kurdish authorities have claimed. Peshmerga forces discovered '20 gas canisters' loaded on the back of a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in Iraq on January 23, officials said. In October chlorine-filled cylinders were also discovered during clashes in the towns of Balad and Duluiya. And reports from the Syrian border-town of Kobani suggested the extremist group added chlorine to an arsenal that already included heavy weapons and tanks looted from captured military bases earlier this year. Memorial stones commemorate those who lost their lives as a result of the first gas attacks. The cross marks the field where troops faced the first use of poison . Even today, farmers suffer health problems after digging up this toxic harvest. Above, a old bunker constructed by the German army stands in one of the fields . The pacifist Quaker had an immediate grasp of what the Germans' use of the gas horror meant. 'It seems pretty certain we shall retaliate,' he wrote to his parents one week after the initial German attack. 'After all, it is no use appealing to anyone.' The first use by Allied forces came in September, when the British unleashed poison gas on the Germans at the battle of Loos. Rival armies ultimately launched 146 gas attacks in Belgium, which covered only a small patch of the Western Front. More sophisticated gases were released and the improvement of gas mask designs led to more poison being deployed. The Germans used about 150 tons of gas in their first attack and around 68,000 tons in total. The Allies used even more - 82,000 tons. The last gas attack came just three days before the armistice of November 11, 1918. Historians estimate that more than 1million soldiers were exposed to gas — and 90,000 killed. 'A lot of the effects did not kill you but they were lasting. You have chronic bronchitis, pneumonia,' Chielens said. 'The veterans of the war took it with them to their graves.' Dormant shells littered farmland. Even today, farmers suffer health problems after digging up this toxic harvest. The French army told Lamour's wife Angele that he either died from gas or was taken prisoner. She kept believing her husband was alive and month after month, she wrote letters to 'Mon bien cher Georges'. On May 2, 1918, three years after his presumed death, she wrote: 'Is springtime coming so late for you as it is for us?'","German forces launched first attack using gas on April 22, 1915 .

"Kelli Jo Bauer, is accused of stealing more than $100,000 worth of women's clothing and selling these goods out of her nearly $1 million home . A woman has been accused of stealing more than $100,000 worth of women's clothing which she then advertised on Facebook to sell from her plush mansion. Kelli Jo Bauer, 45, was arrested at her Kansas City home after undercover officers visited her and were allegedly shown dozens of clothes, many still with tags of them, that she was selling. Bauer, who lives in a $900,000 home in Overland Park had advertised more than 1,000 items of high-end women's clothing on Facebook, including dozens of fake designer handbags. She has been accused of theft, according to documents filed in Johnson County District Court. Bauer, who is on house arrest as a condition of bond, is accused of showing officers clothes — many with tags still on them — hanging on a rack and folded on a bed in an upstairs bedroom, according to the Kansas City Star. It is alleged that Bauer told undercover officers there was more merchandise downstairs, including an 'armful' of purses she showed them. Bauer told the officers that she was selling the items because she was a 'compulsive shopper' and had lost weight, the court documents said. The officers bought several items, including what Bauer said was a fake Louis Vuitton bag for $50. Scroll down for video . Detectives who began following Bauer said they saw her stealing items from several stores. After her arrest, police spent two days searching her home and were seen removing several items in large black bags. Officers are continuing to catalogue the items they seized. Bauer was allegedly selling the designer goods from her sprawling mansion in Overland Park, Kansas City . Bauer was released on a $20,000 bond and ordered to stay out of retail stores. She was placed under house arrest, monitored by GPS tracking. According to state records, Bauer operates an online retail business named My Retro Baby. The site advertises everything from a $325 diaper bag to a $38 hooded baby robe. Bower had apparently told the undercover officers she was selling the clothes because she had lost weight . During her first court appearance earlier this month, Bauer was ordered to follow mental health recommendations, including taking prescribed medication. Court records show Bauer was charged in 2007 with stealing clothing and other merchandise from three stores within 72 hours and in 2013 with stealing clothing from a retailer. In the 2007 case, she pleaded guilty to two reduced charges of misdemeanor criminal deprivation of property and was placed on probation, according to court records. As a condition of probation, she was required to serve seven days in jail and receive mental health treatment, records show. She was again placed on probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge in the 2013 case.","Kelli Jo Bauer, 43, is accused of stealing fake designer clothes and bags .

"The devastated parents of a nursing student whose body was found on a farm north of Glasgow have joined hundreds of mourners at a vigil. Karen Buckley vanished after a night out in the city at the weekend, sparking a four-day police search which yesterday found her body at High Craigton Farm. About 300 people - including the 24-year-old's mother and father Marian and John, and their son Kieran - attended a memorial at Glasgow's George Square today. A man, believed to be 21-year-old Alexander Pacteau, has been arrested in connection with Miss Buckley's death. He made a brief appearance in a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.

Miss Buckley's former supervisor at the Hibernian Hotel in the town of Mallow told the Irish Independent: 'She was always smiling, no matter how hard the work. She could never do enough to help you.' Karen’s former  school principal, Susan O’Keefe, said: ‘She was a beautiful girl and she was a great pupil. 'It’s sad. We are here on a fine summer’s day but Karen is not. We’re all just the worse off for such a lovely person been taken from us, and for everyone in this community, it is a shocking tragedy.’ Karen was a ‘great all-rounder’, participating in ladies’ football with Clyda Rovers and athletics with her school in Analeetha, Ms O’Keefe added. ‘At that time we were a much smaller school then we are now, so we were just like a big family. It is a big blow.' Yvonne Bane, the principal at Miss Buckley's former school in Mallow added: 'The community in St Mary's Secondary School is united in grief at the sad news concerning Karen Buckley, a former student of our school who completed her Leaving Certificate here in 2009. 'A prayer service took place in the school this morning, with all students and staff of St. Mary's Secondary School in attendance. We offered prayers for Karen and her family at this difficult time. Police initially searched a park in Glasgow, but attention later switched to the farm six miles from her home . Floral tributes were left at the scene after her family told of their 'absolute heartbreak' at her death . A vigil will be held in Glasgow today as friends and family tell of their shock at this week's events . 'The school community have been sharing warm memories of our beautiful, former student over the last number of days.' And a spokeswoman for the University of Limerick, where Karen studied nursing, said: 'Karen was a very valued member of the UL Community as well as the wider nursing and medical communities in Limerick, having spent time working in both the University Hospital Limerick and the University Maternity Hospital. 'The thoughts of the entire UL community are with her parents and family and her wide circle of friends as well as her UL classmates and medical colleagues.' A 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with Ms Buckley's death yesterday. He made a brief appearance in a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court today. Friends of Ms Buckley raised the alarm on Sunday morning when she failed to return from a night out at The Sanctuary in the west end of Glasgow. The search led police to Dawsholm Park, where Ms Buckley's handbag was found on Tuesday, and a property in the city's Dorchester Avenue, before the farm where the discovery was made. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University. Miss Buckley's parents, Marian and John, came from Ireland to help the search for their 'cherished' daughter . Miss Buckley grew up in the town of Mallow, County Cork, whose residents expressed shock at her death . Her family, who travelled to Scotland on Tuesday, have said they are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Her father John Buckley, 62, said she was an outgoing girl who 'thoroughly enjoyed life'. He released a statement through Police Scotland which read: 'Marian and I, together with our sons Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are absolutely heartbroken. Karen was our only daughter, cherished by her family and loved by her friends. 'She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world, where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.' More than £50,000 has been raised to support the Buckley family in an online drive organised by her former classmates at Limerick University. The 24-hour appeal closed last night after reaching £50,001 - ten times the initial target of £5,000. The Go Fund Me page was set up to cover the family's travel and expenses while in Scotland and to support the upkeep of their farm in Cork. Karen went missing from the Sanctuary nightclub not far from her home. Police initially searched a park in north-west Glasgow before switching their attention to a golf course and farm outside the city .

"A senior high school in China has installed metal bars on all balconies after two pupils committed suicide in six months. Web users suggested the fence was put up by school authorities to prevent more pupils from jumping off the building, the People's Daily Online reports. Hengshui No 2 Middle School is an 'exemplary school' in Hebei Province in central China. With nearly 10,000 pupils and more than 500 teachers, the boarding school is well-known for its outstanding academic achievement. Behind bars: Hengshui No.2 Middle school is accused of making itself look like a prison in order to prevent students from committing suicide . A large number of the school's pupils are admitted by top universities every year, which inspires parents from across the country to send their children to study there in order to have a 'bright future'. Two pupils from the school plunged to death, one in October and one in March. Both were reported to be third-grade pupils, who were at their final year at Hengshui before taking the university entrance examination. Pictures of the school's new balcony fence first appeared last week on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. A Weibo user named 'Nicky Wu from the East' posted this set of images on April 16th. 'In order to prevent pupils from jumping off the building, Hengshui Middle School has spent a fortune,' wrote the user. Tragic: Two pupils from the school have plunged to death since last October, causing public outcry . Another user named Mr Chen Zonghe commented: 'This is indeed a school, but in order to stop pupils from taking their lives, it has made itself look like a prison.' Causes of the two suicides were not officially reported by Chinese media, but many suspect they were linked to the aggressive teaching style the school is famous for. The campus is run with a military-style management. All students must get up at 5:30 and study 10 hours a day. All meals must be finished within 15 minutes and toilet breaks are less than three minutes, according to Xinhua News Agency. Students are given one holiday every three weeks. Stressful: Banners are hung throughout the campus to impress pupils that only success is allowed . Various videos online also show how the school trains pupils like exam machines. Banners are hung throughout the campus, bearing inspiring slogans such as 'key to the success of the university entrance examination is to succeed in every day, every subject and every question'. In an 'oath-taking ceremony' held for the third-grade, thousands of pupils are seen standing on the playground wearing uniforms yelling 'I must succeed' unanimously and repeatedly. The education authority of Hengshui told Chinese media they have noticed the pictures of the so called 'anti-suicide bars' in No 2 Middle School  and they are currently investigating the case.","Metal bars have been fitted to close off balconies facing central court at Hengshui No 2 Middle School .

"Sales of a Burberry poncho (modelled by Cara Delevigne) carrying a personal monogram and costing more than £1,000 have helped boost profits . The poncho originated as a rather humble garment worn by South American tribes and later featured on the back of Clint Eastwood in the Spaghetti westerns. However, sales of a designer-label version carrying a personal monogram and costing more than £1,000 have been central to a sales boom at the very British prestige brand Burberry. The ponchos - together with heritage trench coats and scarves - have boosted Burberry sales by 10 per cent over the winter. The wool-and-cashmere designs, which were first modelled on the catwalk by Cara Delevingne, were a huge success among celebrities before Christmas. Famous names including Victoria Beckham, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Sienna Miller and Sarah Jessica Parker were all seen sporting the ponchos, each monogrammed with their initials. And while the original inspiration for the designs may have been a rather modest attempt to keep out harsh weather, there was nothing modest about the Burberry version. The basic asking price was £895, while 70 per cent of sales went to customers who wanted their initials monogrammed on to the weave at the cost of an extra £200. The firm said its scarves and trench coats were a hit with customers and ‘investment and innovation in ponchos drove exceptional growth’. Chief financial officer, Carol Fairweather, described the impact of the ponchos as ‘phenomenal’ and suggested new variants are in the pipeline adding: ‘There’s lots more to come from the poncho story.’ The British brand has become a global success with sales up 10 per cent for the six months to the end of March compared to the year before, taking from up to £1.42 billion. Sales were particularly strong in the UK and Europe, not least because hordes of tourists from China flocked here to buy designer clothes and bags. Currency fluctuations meant its trademark coats and scarves were up to 50 per cent cheaper in European cities than Hong Kong, where the Chinese traditionally shop for luxury merchandise. Actresses Sarah Jessica Parker (pictured left) and Sienna Miller (right) both own the Burberry poncho . Model Suki Waterhouse (pictured left) and socialite Olivia Palermo (right) both have monogrammed versions . Such was the price gap that Chinese entrepreneurs have been snapping up huge quantities of luxury label merchandise in Europe and then shipping it back to China to sell at a profit on the grey market. Today bosses at Burberry suggested they plan to follow other luxury brands, such as Chanel and Cartier, and harmonise prices around the globe to stop this happening. This could mean some price increases in Europe and falls in the Far East. Burberry’s success has leaned heavily on a marketing campaign featuring celebrity British models. Cara Delvigne starred in commercials for its trench coats and also appeared alongside Kate Moss promoting the new My Burberry fragrance. Around 70 per cent of the My Burberry bottles were monogrammed, a service the brand offers for free, suggesting personalisation of luxury products is a huge draw for consumers. Twelve-year-old Romeo Beckham featured in a popular pre-Christmas campaign and Suki Waterhouse, the English model and actress, was the face of the brand’s beauty range. Burberry saw ‘double digit’ sales growth in the United States and Europe and trading was particularly buoyant in Britain, France and Italy, from both locals and tourists. Models led by Cara Delevigne wear the poncho on the Burberry catwalk (left) while British model Rosie Rosie Huntington-Whiteley wore hers on a recent shopping trip, specially monogrammed with her initials . Richard Hunter, of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: ‘Burberry remains in fashion following a trading update which underscores its ability to capitalise on its chosen markets. ‘The overall picture is extremely healthy – the strength of the digital contribution, particular product growth in the likes of the iconic trench coats and scarves and pleasing performances from the Americas and most of Europe. ‘In addition, the company is well positioned for future, selective growth in terms of both stores and lines, such as beauty. ‘It seems that everything about Burberry is premium – its brand, its products and perhaps of late its share price – a 25 per cent increase over the last year compares to a 7.5 per cent rise for the wider FTSE100.’ Chief executive Christopher Bailey, who took over from Angela Ahrendts in May last year, said new products had helped to boost sales. ‘We are pleased to report a robust second half performance, despite an uncertain external environment,’ he said. ‘We anticipate external challenges will continue in the current year, but remain confident in our long-term strategy to build the Burberry brand and business globally.’ Chief executive Christopher Bailey (pictured) said new products have helped to boost Burberry's sales .","Sales of £1,100 poncho spotted on stars have boosted Burberry's profits .

"The Middle East crisis deepened today as the US warned it will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington would not accept foreign interference in the country in a direct criticism of Tehran's backing of Shiite Houthi fighters. It comes as a Saudi-led coalition continues to pound anti-government forces in Yemen at the start of a third week of bombing. Scroll down for video . US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that the US will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen . A member of the Saudi border guard is stationed at a look-out point on the Saudi-Yemeni border today. A Saudi-led coalition is continuing to pound anti-government forces in Yemen . Mr Kerry told PBS television: 'There have been - there are, obviously - flights coming from Iran. Every single week there are flights from Iran and we've traced it and know this. 'Iran needs to recognise that the United States is not going to stand by while the region is destabilised or while people engage in overt warfare across lines, international boundaries in other countries.' The United States has backed the Saudi-led campaign, which launched air strikes last month as the rebels advanced on Yemen's main southern city of Aden after seizing the capital Sanaa. President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled Aden for Saudi Arabia during the Houthi advance and the city has since seen heavy clashes between pro and anti-government forces. Riyadh has accused Tehran, the major Shiite power, of backing the rebels in a bid to establish a pro-Iran state on its doorstep. But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif insisted his government wanted a swift end to the fighting, which has cost more than 640 lives since March 19, according to the World Health Organization. Military force: Saudi army tanks are seen deployed near the Saudi-Yemeni border, in southwestern Saudi Arabia . Patrol: Saudi guards drive tanks and armed vehicles along the border with Yemen . Mr Kerry, fresh from world powers striking a framework agreement with Iran on its nuclear programme, said Washington was not looking for confrontation with Tehran. 'But we're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that Iran might be making.' In another sign of growing US support for the Saudi effort, the Pentagon said it had started daily aerial refuelling for warplanes in the coalition. The first refuelling flight took place on Tuesday night with a US Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker providing fuel for a F-15 fighter jet operated by Saudi Arabia and an F-16 flown by the United Arab Emirates, spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's  framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal. And President Hassan Rouhani said separately that the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day'. 'What has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement, nor its contents, nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end,' said Khamenei, who has the final word on all matters of state. After a week of gruelling last-ditch negotiations, Tehran and the six powers agreed on April 2 on the framework of a deal to be finalised by the end of June reining in Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. 'Everything is in the detail, it may be that the other side, which is unfair, wants to limit our country in the details,' Khamenei said, in his first comments on the deal. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal . Playing down expectations of a deal after the interim accord - which sparked celebrations in the streets of Iranian cities - Khamenei said he had not taken any position until now as 'there is nothing to take a stance on'. 'Officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding. I am neither for nor against.' Under the outline text agreed in the Swiss city of Lausanne between Tehran and the so-called P5+1 powers - the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany - Iran must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions. The outline was a major breakthrough in a 12-year international crisis over Iran's nuclear programme. 'I have always supported and still support the Iranian negotiating team,' Khamenei said. 'I welcome any agreement that protects the interests and greatness of the nation, but having no agreement is more honourable than an agreement in which the interests and greatness of the nation is damaged.' Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day' He said that retaining a civil nuclear industry in any agreement was vital for Iran's future development. 'The nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors,' he said. In a potential obstacle to any final deal, Rouhani said his country wanted sanctions lifted on the day of the implementation of any agreement. 'We will not sign any agreements unless on the first day of the implementation of the deal all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day,' he said. The pace at which the sanctions will be lifted is one of the outstanding issues that still has to be agreed in the final accord. Western governments, which have imposed their own sanctions over and above those adopted by the United Nations, have been pushing for it to happen only gradually. 'In return for Iran's future cooperation, we and our international partners will provide relief in phases from the sanctions that have impacted Iran's economy,' US Secretary of State John Kerry said last week. Rouhani, who was speaking on Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day, reiterated that his government remained determined to develop its civil nuclear programme. 'We will have a tanker sortie every day,' Warren said, adding that all flights will be outside of Yemeni air space. The air strikes killed at least 14 rebel fighters in Aden overnight Thursday at positions near the northern edge of the city, a source in pro-government forces told AFP. Air strikes also hit a military camp in the southern Shabwa province that was seized by the Houthis' main allies - security forces who have remained loyal to former strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, a local official said. The official had no information on casualties among the forces loyal to Saleh, who has been accused of joining with the Houthis after being ousted from power in 2012 after an Arab Spring-inspired uprising. Yemen has been wracked by conflict since Saleh's ouster, with Hadi unable to assert government authority in a deeply tribal country riven by divisions. Supporters of the Shiite Houthi militia brandish their weapons in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. Washington has said it will not accept foreign interference in the country . Conflict: Yemeni supporters of the southern seperatist movement fire towards Houthi rebels during clashes in the southern city of Aden yesterday . As well as the Houthis, who hail from Yemen's north, the government has struggled against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), considered the most dangerous of the jihadist network's branches. Authorities in Yemen had for years allowed Washington to carry out a drone war against AQAP but US forces pulled out of the country amid the latest unrest. Al-Qaeda has taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of some areas and carried out a series of deadly attacks on both government forces and the Houthis. As the fighting and air campaign drag on, concern has been growing for what aid workers say is a mounting humanitarian crisis. Some aid trickled in to Aden by ship on Wednesday but efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross to organise flights of cargo planes into Sanaa have so far failed. In Aden, witnesses have said the situation is dire, with bodies lying in the streets and mosques calling through loudspeakers for help.

A Yemeni child receives treatment at the burns unit of a hospital in Sanaa, following a reported airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition earlier this month . Diplomatic efforts have stepped up to resolve the conflict, with the Iranian and Pakistani foreign ministers pledging to work to find a negotiated solution. Zarif laid out a four-stage plan for talks, calling for an immediate ceasefire followed by humanitarian assistance, dialogue among Yemenis and the formation of an 'all-inclusive government'. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was also quoted on Thursday as calling for a regional effort to end the fighting. 'The groups in Yemen should meet and work on possible solution. Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran should be involved in efforts for a diplomatic solution,' Erdogan was quoted as saying by Turkish media.","Secretary of State John Kerry hits out at Iran's support of Houthi fighters .

"Mouldy food was discovered in a restaurant by inspectors after a diner complained of finding dog faeces on the floor - leading to £15,000 in fines for the ‘dangerous’ owner. Council inspectors found a shocking state of hygiene at The Steer Inn in Wilberfoss, East Yorkshire - and owner David Crossfield later admitted 17 charges of breaching food safety regulations. Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date. Shocking: Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy (above) and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date . In addition, raw meat was being prepared in direct contact with ready to eat salad items posing a serious risk of cross contamination, Beverley Magistrates’ Court was told. Inspectors - who first visited in January 2014 - also found kitchen equipment was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair, and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning. Meanwhile food safety systems, monitoring checks and procedures were not in place - and food handlers were found to consistently demonstrate a lack of understanding of food safety issues. Crossfield, 52, of Elvington, North Yorkshire - whom magistrates branded ‘foolish’ - also admitted failing to comply with a hygiene improvement notice requiring food hygiene training for his staff. Mouldy food and dirty floor: Inspectors found kitchen equipment at The Steer Inn was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning . Crossfield said he was the sole director of The Steer Inn (Pocklington) Ltd and had admitted he had taken over the running of the premises with no knowledge of running a kitchen or a restaurant. He said he had been worked in pubs and bars ‘with no problems before’ and he had been ‘naive’ and had been led to believe the chef had the right qualifications relating to food hygiene. Crossfield told the court that The Steer Inn had ceased trading on New Year’s Eve 2014 and that he was in the process of liquidating the company, which had no assets. Chair of the bench Graham McDonald told him: ‘These were appalling offences. People could have become seriously ill or even died as a result of salmonella. East Yorkshire restaurant: The company was fined £8,500, plus costs of £1,392 and a victim surcharge of £120. Its owner was individually fined £2,750, as well as costs of £1,392 and a £120 victim surcharge . ‘Your naivety was dangerous and the fact you relied on your chef was extremely foolish.’ The company was fined £8,500, plus costs of £1,392 and a victim surcharge of £120. Crossfield was individually fined £2,750, as well as costs of £1,392 and a £120 victim surcharge. Paul Abbott, manager for public protection at East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said: ‘The council’s food safety team had offered considerable advice to the food business operator of the premises in an attempt to produce safe food but despite being rated a zero under the food hygiene rating scheme, he had failed to make meaningful improvements. He added that the council ‘will always try to work with businesses to ensure the food they sell is safe and they are compliant with the relevant legislation'.","East Yorkshire restaurant probed after diner reported seeing dog faeces .

"You might think that you’re saving yourself some smart dollars by opting for the cheaper alternatives of everyday household items sold at two dollar stores but an environmental specialist has warned that you could actually be making your family sick. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children’s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases. A recent study of four major discount retailers  in the United States by the Ecology Centre found that 133 out of 164 products tested, including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils and silly straws, contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern'. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children’s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases (stock picture) Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies, Nicole Bijlsma, told Daily Mail Australia that an investigation into products sold at Australian two dollar stores could produce similar results. Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies Nicole Bijlsma said the chemicals in these products are easily absorbed through ingestion and skin . 'Based on the amount of products that have been recalled over the years and studies which have found the levels of industrial chemicals are rising in younger generations, there's definitely a history to indicate that they [products at discount stores] could contain chemicals that cause adverse health affect,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'It depends on the type of chemical, but a lot of these things are absorbed through ingestion and dermal exposure. Kids have a very high hand to mouth ratio and are putting things in their mouth all the time.' A set of children's necklaces examined by the study were found to have high levels of bromine, chlorine and lead. Bromine is known to permanently affect developing brains and present reproduction problems in those exposed to it, while studies have found that chlorine causes cancer as well as thyroid and kidney disease. Meanwhile, scientists have found that even the smallest amount of lead can affect a child's ability to learn. Dozens of other products were also listed as having harmful chemicals, including silly straws which were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates which have been linked to birth defects, reduced fertility, cancer, learning disabilities, diabetes, and other health issues, according to the report. She said that a recent study of four major discount retailers in the United States, which found 133 out of 164 products tested contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern', would find similar results in Australia . Additional harmful substances found in the products included polyvinyl chloride plastic (also known as PVC or vinyl) and packaging chemical bisphenol-A (also known as BPA). 1. Buy Australian made products: They are subject to rigorous regulations and Australian manufactures are not permitted to use harmful chemicals. 2. Go back to basics: Use glass and stainless steel to store food instead of plastics. 3. Less is best: If it’s not edible, it won’t be good for your skin either, as it absorbs whatever is put on it. 4. Try the natural approach against pests first: Instead of pest sprays, install fly screens and ensure no food is around before reaching for chemicals. 5. Leave your shoes outside: take them off before you go inside and trek dust and pesticides from outside into your home . Ms Bijlsma, a building biologist, who assess people's homes - including measuring chemicals in their water, air, building materials and household products - to see what's making them sick, said that while discount stores were the focus of negative attention, harmful chemicals can be found in any product which is manufactured outside of Australia. 'About 90 per cent or more of our products, including footwear, clothing and furnishings, aren't actually manufactured in Australia. They're manufactured in Asia and imported products are not regulated in the same way as they are here and that's where the problem lies,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'To use a safer alternative would cost more money and sometimes it's just easier for company's not to bother doing research - why would they? In Australia they don't have to prove that the chemicals they are using are not harmful. 'BPA is a good example because people got wind that it was affecting children's behaviour and had an increased risk of breast cancer - so the manufacturer changed it and replaced it with bisphenol-S which has shown to be worse. A non-slip bath tub mat was found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) 'It's about generating profits for industry and so they get cheap products in, but they neglect safety standards. 'It's possible because regulators don't ask for a certificate of analysis to prove there are no banned industrial chemicals  in the product and just assume that what the manufacturer overseas says is accurate.' A spokesman for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Daily Mail Australia that while 'there is always a possibility that some products on the market might not meet accepted standards of safety' the 'chance is very small'. It assured that the ACCC had an active chemical inspection program and that the products supplied to discount variety stores are 'often included in analytical surveys and surveillance activities conducted by the ACCC' and other product safety regulators. However they also put great emphasis on Australian Consumer Laws which require suppliers to 'ensure their products are safe and suitable for their intended purpose', saying: 'most suppliers have systems in place to source safe products.' Stock image: Children's stick-on earnings sold at the stores were found to contain high levels of bromine and chlorine and medium levels of tin . Latex coated gloves were found to have high levels of chlorine and medium levels of antimony while silly straws were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) Ms Bijlsma said not enough was being done by the ACCC, which she said only completes occasional spot checks, with thousands of shipping containers going unchecked. 'The system is based on just doing spot checks here and there, but it doesn't happen with every product,' she said. 'We have a mismatch of five or six organisations in Australia that are involved in chemical and manufacturing regulation and they are under-resourced, understaffed and it takes them years to regulate a chemical. 'The way chemicals are regulated here is primarily through self-regulation: it's based on a reactive approach system where if you have had a significant health complaint from a consumer, you are obliged to pass it on. 'Then they [regulators] list it as a ""priority chemical"", see what other countries do and talk to other organisations, and write a recommendation report - this takes years. Extensions chords were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates while plastic spoons were found to have low levels of chlorine and tin (stock pictures) 'That's not adequate to protect our families' safety. It's not good enough. The system needs to change and the burden of proof needs to be on the manufacturer to prove the product is safe before it's released on the market.' The ACCC stated that products found to be unsafe are removed from the market or recalled by suppliers and that any company that fails to comply with standards faces a fine of up to $1.1 million. But part of the problem lies in the average Australian's trust that anything being sold to them on a supermarket shelf is tested, according to Ms Bijlsma. 'Consumers assume someone is regulating chemicals and that's where the problem lies. In reality, even 80 - 90 per cent of all the chemicals in household products like cleaning products and personal care products, have never been tested for harmful chemicals,' she said.","Over 100 items including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils and silly straws contained either harmful plastics, metals or chemicals .

Robert Penny told the Herald Sun that he was shocked when police charged him with murdering Claire Acocks and his wife Margaret Penny at Old London Coiffure Hairdressers in Portland on May 3, 1991, about 350km west of Melbourne. The 83-year-old, of Malvern East, has spoken out since he briefly appeared at Melbourne Magistrates court on Monday. Margaret Penny was murdered in a hair salon in Portland, Victoria on May 3, 1991 . Also brutally murdered at Old London Coiffure Hairdressers was Claire Acocks . Nearly 24 years after the horrific event Margaret's husband Robert Denny, 83, has been charged with two counts of murder . 'It's been hanging over my head for a year and it's not having a very good effect on me. Not knowing anything about it, really, and to be charged with a double murder - what the hell would I want to murder someone for?' Mr Penny told the Herald Sun. 'They had some new faces in the police force that were investigating and they suddenly decided it was my problem... It's just bizarre.' Mr Penny also revealed that he called his late-wife's sister, Ann Bryden, to further plead his innocence a day after facing court. 'He rang and said, ""I didn't do it, why would I kill her? We were in love"",' Ms Bryden told the Herald Sun. Ms Bryden then said that she does not believe Mr Penny killed his wife. Penny was not required to speak during the hearing on Monday that lasted less than five minutes . Homicide police investigator Tom Hogan - the police informant in the murder hearing - leaving the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday . Lawyer Rob Starry, who is representing Robert Penny, outside court on Monday . Unsteady on his feet in the dock, Penny was not required to speak during the hearing that lasted less than five minutes on Monday. Claire Acocks and Margaret Penny were found badly beaten, repeatedly stabbed, with their throats cut and were wrapped in black hair wraps, the Herald Sun reported. His current wife was in court on the day, and the accused was seen waving at the woman - who reportedly has concerns about her elderly husband's health. Police launched a cold case investigation into the murders in 2006, and Penny resurfaced as a suspect last year, despite being cleared of any involvement during the original investigation. He was remanded in custody to appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court for a committal mention on July 6. Penny was remanded in custody to appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court for a committal mention on July 6, and is expected to apply for bail on Monday afternoon . Tim Acock, son of murder victim Claire Acocks, was also in attendance . Mr Acocks (right) was a young constable at the time of his mother's murder and one of the first at the scene . Members of Ms Acocks' family, including her son Tim - who was a young constable at the time and one of the first at the murder scene - were at the hearing on Monday. 'We are grateful for the determination of the homicide squad detectives who have continued to investigate this matter to endeavour to gain a resolution for us and justice for Claire,' they later said in a statement. The family said they were 'extremely encouraged' by the developments but would not comment further while the matter is before the courts.

"Stars have flocked to Twitter to praise Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson for revealing that she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, shared the news  through a statement published by People magazine on Tuesday. Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress as Katie Couric wrote: 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health.' Scroll down for video . By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy . Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' Actress Christina Applegate, who underwent a double mastectomy in 2008, also tweeted: ‘Sweet beautiful powerful Rita!!! Loving you so much!’ Singer Sara Bareilles wrote: ‘Beautiful Brave Friend. Thinking of you and grateful for your courage.’ While reality star Lisa Rinna wrote: ‘Sending love + light to @RitaWilson thank you for Sharing your breast cancer story of getting a second opinion your courage will help many.’ 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Best wishes: TV presenter Katie Couric, who is a spokeswoman for colon cancer awareness following the death of her first husband, John Monahan, was one of the first stars to react on social media . Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . In her statement, Rita explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Brave: The star from the TV, film and music industries all praised her brave decision . Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by Glenne Headly. Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.","Stars such as Katie Couric and Christina Applegate praised the 58-year-old actress for revealing her diagnosis in a statement on Tuesday .

"Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the United States. The new policy allows for an American traveler who has been denied boarding a commercial airliner to petition the U.S. Transportation Security Administration once to find out whether he or she is on the no-fly list and a second time for an unclassified explanation of why he or she is on the list. In some cases, the government will not be able to provide an explanation because of national security concerns. The changes partially lift a veil of secrecy enshrouding a policy that has been a centerpiece of the government's counterterrorism efforts since the September 2001 terror attacks. Grounded or not grounded? Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the U.S. Above the security line at New York John F Kennedy International Airport in October . But the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list in an ongoing federal lawsuit, said the changes don't go far enough in giving travelers the legal due process they are entitled to, including seeing the evidence held against them and getting an opportunity to challenge it. The explanations provided to six travelers so far, which were mandated by a federal judge, have been inadequate, the ACLU said. For instance, in a letter to New Jersey resident Amir Meshal, the government's explanation for his inclusion on the list was based on information the FBI obtained from Meshal when he was detained in Africa in 2007, ACLU attorney Hina Shamsi said. The ACLU considers Meshal's detention to be unlawful and said he suffered abuse. 'From the face of the letter, a neutral decision-maker would have no idea whatsoever that any of that occurred,' said Shamsi. The Justice Department declined to comment on the specific constitutionality challenges because of the ongoing lawsuit. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said, 'We are committed to a process that protects Americans from terrorist threats while respecting privacy and safeguarding civil liberties.' Last fall, there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, according to the government. Typically, less than 5 per cent of those on the list are Americans. The list fluctuates in size. Previously, the government's policy was never to confirm or deny that a person actually is on list, citing national security concerns. In most instances, travelers assume they are on the list because they are instructed to go through additional screening at airports or because they are told they can't board their flights. Travelers have been able to appeal their presumed placement on the list since 2007. Only a small percentage of appeals the government receives each year have been from travelers actually on the list, the government has said. The TSA gets between 15,000 and 20,000 requests a year, and less than 1 per cent of those are actually from people on the no-fly list, said Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron. In 2014, a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, required that the government notify 13 plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list of their status on the list, and seven were told they were not on the list. The government provided explanations to the six plaintiffs it confirmed were on the no-fly list, including Meshal. One of the explanations included just a 'single cryptic sentence about alleged travel to a foreign country,' according a court document filed earlier this year. The letters to the six plaintiffs on the no-fly list have been redacted on the public court docket to protect the plaintiffs' reputations, Shamsi said. 'The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again,' Shamsi said. The TSA will continue to handle the petitions under the new policy. The changes are not yet in effect, and have so far only been applied to the 13 plaintiffs in the Portland lawsuit, but the Homeland Security Department said it expects them be in place soon. Catron said individual requests should take months to process, not years. 'These enhancements continue to ensure that individuals who are deemed to be a threat to our aviation security are prohibited from boarding a flight within, or bound for, the United States,' Catron said.","Previously, the U.S. did not disclose whether a stopped traveler was on the list or why .
But facing legal pressure from the ACLU, the Obama administration has enacted a new policy to let Americans know if they are on the list .
Grounded Americans are also now allowed to inquire about how they got on the list .
However, the government has not promised to reveal why in all cases - citing possible national security threats .
Last fall there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, and Americans made up approximately 5 per cent ."
"An elderly couple died in a freak accident after the woman fell down the stairs in a desperate attempt to save her partner who had also tripped. Mary Murphy, 66, is thought to have tried to grab hold of John Wood, 67, when he stumbled at the top of the stairs, but slipped herself and the pair fell to their deaths. Their bodies were found by paramedics on Wednesday in the hallway of their terraced home, after concerns were raised about their welfare. Mary Murphy, 66, and her partner John Wood, 67, died after falling down the stairs at their home in Failsworth, Greater Manchester . Police initially thought the deaths may be suspicious, but after investigating they believe it was a ‘bizarre and tragic’ accident. It is understood that Miss Murphy, a retired office clerk, had lived at the property in Failsworth, near Oldham, all of her life, having looked after her elderly parents. In recent years she struck up a close friendship with Mr Wood. The retired couple were devoted to each other and attended a prayer group, though it is not known whether either pensioner had any children or close relatives. Miss Murphy had been a regular worshipper at nearby St Mary’s RC Church, where priest Father John McKeown described her as ‘very kind and well-liked’. He believes the accident occurred because the stairs at her home are very steep and she used a walking stick to get around. Both Miss Murphy and Mr Wood were also overweight and suffered from severe mobility problems. He said: ‘Mary was not very good on her feet. If one of them tripped while they were trying to get down then this could have brought the pair of them tumbling down. It’s absolutely tragic.’ The couple's home was cordoned off as police forensic investigators were seen going into the property . Residents spoke of their sadness at the couple’s deaths, with one saying: ‘It is the most shocking thing to happen – that a simple slip could cost them both their lives. They were devoted to each other. They will be really badly missed in the community because they were such a force for good.’ Another said: ‘It is very upsetting and we are in mourning. I would see them at mass on Sunday, they were always smiling and you could tell they loved each other.’ Detective Inspector Lewis Hughes from Greater Manchester Police said: ‘This is an extremely bizarre, albeit tragic incident and our thoughts are with the couple’s family and friends.’ Emergency crews were first called to the terraced house 10.50am on Wednesday and discovered two bodies at the bottom of the stairs .","Mary Murphy, 66, and John Wood,67, died falling down stairs at her home .

"This is the dramatic moment two traffic police officers were almost decapitated after a caravan sped past at speed with a window wide open. The motorway officers had been standing on the hard shoulder on the M5 in Gloucesteshire at night after pulling over a driver, who they suspected was speeding. They then spotted a caravan heading towards them in the dark and at the last minute spotted the nearside back window was open. The caravan, which sped past the two traffic police officers with its back window open, circled, and almost decapitated them . The two officers spotted that the caravan's window was open with just seconds to spare and managed to dive out of the way . The pair were forced to dive out of the way with just seconds to spare before they were severely injured. The caravan also narrowly missed a workman standing further along the carriageway and the two officers got into their patrol car to give chase. They then quickly caught up with the driver towing the caravan and stopped him between junctions 11 and 11a near Cheltenham. He told the officers that he was unaware that the window had become loose and opened and was made to close it securely. The near-miss came to light after Gloucestershire Constabulary's Road Policing unit tweeted about Sunday night's incident. They posted: 'If you look very closely, top left above the road sign you will just make out the caravan nearside window open, which we didn’t notice until we stopped the car that was in lane 2 for speeding. 'We were seconds away from being beheaded on M5. The near-miss came to light after Gloucestershire Constabulary's Road Policing unit tweeted about Sunday night's incident . 'It was the car drivers lucky night as we had to go after and stop the caravan. The window had worked it’s way loose and was open! 'And here’s the nearside view of the caravan window open, just as we closed the police car door and looked behind M5. 'A workman had a close escape as well at Jtn 11 to 11a. Driver was unaware, brackets worked loose. 'The car driver was spoken to but knowing road works ahead we needed to stop the caravan. Window was then secured.” The two policemen were not the only lucky people on the night as the speeding driver they had stopped also escaped further punishment because they could not deal with him.","Officers were on the hard shoulder of the M5 when they saw the caravan .

"A cleaner who feared a body he found was a murder victim had in fact found a  900-year-old mummy. The preserved remains were discovered in a cardboard box by street cleaners in north-western Peru. The mummy, thought to date back to 1100 AD, was found wrapped in rope and dumped inside the box in front of an archaeological dig in the city of Trujillo. Scroll down for video . Grim discovery: Street cleaners who found the remains initially feared they had stumbled across a murder victim . It is thought to have been stolen from the archaeological site known as Chan Chan which was the capital of the Chimu Empire, an urban civilisation that appeared on the Peruvian coast around 1100 AD. The discovery was made in the early hours of the morning as the cleaners swept up the streets close to the dig. Cleaner Otilio Padilla Miramontes, 54, said: 'It looked just like any other box dumped on the streets. Well preserved: It turned out the 'victim' was in fact a stolen, 915-year-old Peruvian mummy . Forensics: Police were called by the cleaners who made the discovery by an archaeological dig site in Trujillo . Wrapped up: The mummified remains were discovered in a box, wrapped in rope, by cleaners in Peru . 'But when I opened it I nearly died of heart attack as I saw this grinning skull staring up at me. 'I had no idea it was an ancient mummy, I thought it was someone who had been murdered so I immediately called the police.' A police spokesman said: 'We quickly established that this was not a recent skeleton. 'But we are now investigating how it ended up in a box outside of the main archaeological site. 'Our suspicion is that someone tried to steal it and had maybe left it in the box to collect later.' The remains were taken to the regional Directorate of Culture for examination. A spokesman there said: 'This is not a Chimu mummy and is most likely pre-Hispanic suggesting it is from another culture pre-dating the Hispanic arrival.'","The stolen Peruvian mummy was abandoned by archaeological dig site .

"This is the 'disgusting' meal that was served to an 81-year-old woman living in sheltered housing. Joan Ashton has been a resident of  Aneurin Bevan Court in Duffryn, Newport for around eight months. The elderly woman's son, Steve, visits her regularly there where he says his mother is well-looked after by carers who bring her meals. But after finding the 'terrible' serving of baked potato and corned beef in a fridge in his mother's room, Mr Ashton is calling for more to be done to improve food standards for the elderly in care. This is the 'disgusting' serving of baked potato and corned beef served to an 81-year-old woman living in sheltered housing . Another meal Mr Ashton and his mother were unhappy with was a lasagne that was 'full of oil', he said . 'This was never to pick holes in the quality of care that they’re giving, it was just about the terrible food being served to the elderly people,' Mr Ashton said. Mr Ashton took action when his mother said the meal looked so unappetising she did not want to eat it. 'I pulled that out of the fridge and it was just disgusting. It's difficult to mess up a jacket potato and corned beef but there we have it - they did it.' When Mr Ashton complained to Newport City Homes which is in charge of residents' care but says he was told: 'That's what your mother ordered.' 'She might have ordered it because there was a lack of choice - but then it comes out and the corned beef looks dry and the jacket potato looks disgusting,' he added. Other substandard meals to have been served include a lasagne 'full of oil', Mr Ashton said. Residents at Aneurin Bevan Court pay £42 a week for food. For that they are given two course-meals six days a week and and three-course meals on Sundays. Steve Ashton is now campaigning for changes to be made to ensure better food standards. His mother Joan, 81, lives alone in the sheltered housing complex . But Mr Ashton is campaigning for more to be done to ensure standards are improved. He has already met with Newport City Homes to discuss possible changes. 'I am glad they have taken this seriously but initially they didn’t seem to think there was a massive problem at the residence with regards to the food.' If you wish to share photographs or a story about food in sheltered housing which you think was under-par, email jennifer.smith@mailonline.co.uk or phone 02036150193 . Mr Ashton caught their attention after sharing the photograph of the meal on Facebook. It was shared 129,000 times under the caption: 'It is my mission to get the food at this place changed and to get them serving high-quality food and meets the needs of all residents (sic). 'I also want to raise awareness as a lot of elderly people may be hiding the fact that they are not getting a healthy meal every day. 'I want to reach the right people and I want this slop to never be served to anyone again.' A spokesman for Newport City Homes said: 'Following concerns raised regarding catering services at Aneurin Bevan Court Sheltered Housing Scheme we have held a meeting with the family concerned and apologised for the meal provided. 'We have also agreed a series of improvements which we will monitor with the family and all residents at Aneurin Bevan Court.' Mrs Ashton lives at Aneurin Bevan Court (pictured).

"Charity runners taking part in a 10km fun run at the weekend were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour. The blunder was believed to have been caused by a race marshal taking a toilet break during the event, missing 300 runners who should have been directed at a junction point. Instead they continued past the unmanned marshall point and had to run for an extra three kilometres while the other 900 competitors followed the correct route. Scroll down for video . Blunder: Charity runners taking part in yesterday's Bournemouth Bay 10K Run (pictured) were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour . The bizarre gaffe happened during yesterday's Bournemouth Bay Run and today the organisers - Bournemouth Borough Council - appealed for those who were affected by the mix-up to contact them for a 'gesture of goodwill.' A local authority spokesman said that it was investigating what happened to the marshal who should have directed runners at a turning point. It was reported that some runners were 'in tears' while one described the event's organisation as 'shambolic'. Hayley James, who is four months pregnant and from Poole, said: 'To have a race of that scale with only one marshal on a point is inexcusable. 'We saw loads of people walking at the end, some were in tears, I felt so sorry for them - I felt like crying at the 10km mark.' Andy Isaac, from Bournemouth, said the event was 'mayhem' with one point where an elderly woman managed to drive onto the route and was flashing her lights at oncoming runners. A map shows where up to 300 runners continued along the coastal path after a marshal who was meant to direct them on to a turn went to the toilet . Reaction: Two people vent their frustration at the Bournemouth Bay Run on Twitter yesterday . It also emerged that water stations ran out of supplies during the race, forcing some runners to drink from half-empty bottles that had been left on the ground as they battled against dehydration. Commenting on the Daily Echo website, one runner said: “We had a bottle of water at the three mile station, but at the six mile point they had totally ran out, so nothing. Jon Weaver, head of resort marketing and events at the council, said: 'Unfortunately there was some confusion with marshalling arrangements at one point, but it was a critical point. We apologise unreservedly to those front runners. 'In 33 years of running... this is the first time this has happened and as part of our debrief we will be analysing the arrangements carefully... to learn for 2016. 'We understand runners have trained for a long time for the event and it's hard for them and we do empathise with how they are feeling.' It was hoped that the event would have raised more than £70,000 for the British Heart Foundation. Some racers took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the blunder. Rob Kelly wrote: Really disappointed in the #BournemouthBayRun 10k that ended up 13k very poor show bad marshalling #wontbeback.' AndKim Kelly replied: 'Totally agree and never got to do a 5k as they were 45mins behind schedule :(((.'","Up to 300 runners in yesterday's Bournemouth Bay Run sent wrong way .

"When the first pictures of Kim Sears in her wedding dress surfaced yesterday, they got a mixed reaction. The Jenny Packham chiffon gown with jewelled-detailing on the arms has split opinion, with some on Twitter raving about the garment and others claiming it swamped her. Over the last few years, wedding dress choices have become so varied that they fall into very distinct camps - short, boho, quirky traditional and more. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray and Kim Sears leave Dunblane cathedral after getting married this weekend . Zeenat Sabvur from the wedding planning website Ready or Knot believes brides are thinking outside the box a lot more when it comes to their wedding dresses nowadays, instead of having their choices dictated by tradition. She said: 'Brides don't go for what they think they should go for anymore,they choose their dress more on what their personalities are like. 'Angelina always said that her children were the reason for her getting married, so she made the day very much based around them and that included the dress. 'Keira Knightley's was quirkier - she wore a dress that had worn before and that had a lot of stories to it. 'The change of attitude towards dresses is the same as with the wedding cake, brides don't necessarily get cake anymore, they might get cheese, profiteroles or cupcake. 'Weddings are now about personalities and celebrating  their relationships, which makes it more fun.' Read on to discover the different types of wedding dresses that brides are opting for nowadays... The Traditional Dress . Prince William and Kate Middleton get married in 2011 at Westminster Abbey . Many brides still opt for the traditional white gown when it comes to their wedding outfit. When Kate Middleton married Prince William in 2011, she opted for an elegant lace gown by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen. The intricate lace appliqué bodice and sleeves of Catherine's dress mirrored those on the wedding gown of Grace Kelly, who became Princess Grace of Monaco when she married Ranier III, Prince of Monaco, in 1956. Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeldsaid of the dress:' Alexander McQueen's dresses are always very elegant. 'It's very pretty, and relatively classic, but that goes with the decor, with a little touch of the 1950s that recalls Marilyn Monroe or Queen Elizabeth's dress.' The non-dress wedding dress . Solange Knowles and Alan Ferguson on their wedding day . When Solange Knowles arrived at her wedding to her video director boyfriend Alan Ferguson last November, she looked stunning in a cream jumpsuit, complete with a matching cape. Solange is known for her bold style, so she was unlikely to have opted for a traditional gown. She wore a long caped gown by Humberto Leon for Kenzo for the nuptials but arrived at the ceremony in a Stephane Rolland cream jump suit, having travelled there on a white-painted bicycle decorated with cream roses. The theme of the bash was a stylish, if unconventional affair, with all guests encouraged to wear white, including her sister Beyoncé and mother Tina. More and more women are opting for trouser suits or jumpsuits at weddings now, to give them freedom of movement. The boho dress . Kate Moss married Jamie Hince in 2011 . When Kate Moss married Jamie Hince in a village church in the Cotswolds, she looked stunning in a vintage-style cream dress and matching floor-length veil, designed by close friend John Galliano. The model showed off her slim figure in a cream bias-cut dress with sheer skirt with gold leaf embroidery and rhinestones. Her head piece featured floral detailing on either side of an off-white headband and Manolo Blahnik designed a special pair of wedding shoes that include a blue insole as Kate's 'something blue'. Zeenat said: 'Kate Moss's wedding dress was beautiful , everything from the dress to the veil and the flower girls were very boho and very unique.' The short dress . Keira Knightley marries Jamie Righton in 2013 . Keira Knightley was the epitome of laid-back cool when she got married to Jamie Righton at the town hall in Mazan, a small town around 12 miles from Marseilles in 2013. She wore a pale pink tulle Chanel dress with a pink jacket and a pair of sunglasses. The dress had actually been worn by Keira several times before - most memorably to the BAFTAs in 2008. The actress has confessed that in addition to the Chanel dress, pictured, that she wore for her civil wedding in the South of France last year, she also had a custom-made £50,000 Valentino dress for a secret second ceremony. She told Elle magazine she decided to wear the simple Chanel dress for the first ceremony because ‘every time I’ve worn that dress, I’ve had a fantastic night and if you’ve got a dress where you’ve always had a fantastic night, it’s worth having another fantastic night in it’.

So it comes as no surprise that their six-strong brood played an integral part of their wedding day on August 23 last year at their French estate Chateau Miraval. Indeed, the blushing bride took the unusual measure of letting her kids decorate her wedding dress, walking down the aisle in a gorgeous yet simple white satin gown and long veil that featured colourful drawings all over, . Created by Atelier Versace master tailor Luigi Massi, the gown featured a fitted bodice with simple thin straps, the bust complete with ruching, with a plain waist, kicking out into a flowy full skirt. Luigi then hand-sewed a number of the children's designs onto both the back of the dress and the full-length veil. 'Luigi is like family to me and I couldn't imagine anyone else making this dress,' the 39-year-old bride told People magazine. 'He knows and cares for the children and it was great fun putting it together.' The quirky wedding dress . Lady Mary Charteris married  Robbie Furze in 2012 .

"The founder of Poundland who grew up with the family motto 'if you don't work you don't eat' has revealed how he gave his parents £25million when he sold the company – but still relies on pocket money from his wife. Steve Smith, 52, grew up helping his father run a stall at Bilston market in the West Midlands, and opened his first Poundland shop in Burton-upon-Trent at the age of 18 in 1990. The venture was an overnight success and he became a self-made millionaire when he sold the company for a staggering £50million 10 years later. Scroll down for video . Steve Smith, 52, (pictured outside his £6.5million Shropshire mansion) opened his first Poundland shop in Burton-upon-Trent at the age of 18 in 1990 and sold the firm 10 years later for a staggering £50million . When he sold Poundland (pictured) in 2000, Mr Smith gave half of his profits - £25million - to his parents. He said he wanted to repay his father's initial loan of £50,000 which helped him start the company at just 18 . Today, Mr Smith lives in a 13-bedroom mansion in Shropshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool, snooker room and pub, having successfully launched poundshop.com - an online version of Poundland. Yet, he still receives 'pocket money' from his wife Tracy, with whom he has three children: Joe, Ashley and Katie. He told The Telegraph: 'On a day-to-day basis my wife gives me a little pocket money. The problem with me is that if I have any cash on me I spend it, so she'll give me about £10 or £20 a day.' His daily hand-out is a fraction of his estimated £40million worth, having successfully invested his money in other business ventures and property since making his fortune in the 1990s. With more than 500 stores in the UK - more than double the number it had five years ago – Poundland has gone from strength-to-strength selling everything from toys to toiletries, stationery to shampoo and bread to biscuits. But Mr Smith decided to sell his firm in 2000 and gave his parents half of the profit from the sale when he did so. He said he wanted to repay his father's initial loan of £50,000 which helped him start the company. He told the newspaper: 'The first thing I did was give my mum and dad half of it. My dad had lent me £50,000 to start the company so I suppose it was a good return for him. 'If it weren't for my dad learning the trade and passing it on to me then it wouldn't have happened.' He previously said he knew Poundland would be a success because 'people love a bargain'. He said: 'They love the unknown. They liked to rummage. 'In Poundland, we bought stock from all over the world — golf clubs, fantastic products. It was great value for money, and that is what motivates me. I love giving the public value for money.' As well as sharing his wealth among his family, Mr Smith also used part of his Poundland profits to snap up Hammer Hill House, a sprawling mansion near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, 14 years ago. Mr Smith, 52, lives in a 13-bedroom mansion in Shropshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool, snooker room, pub, five grand reception rooms, dancefloor, helicopter bed and 30 acres of countryside . Despite his wealth, Mr Smith has admitted that he still receives 'pocket money' from his wife Tracy, with whom he has three children: Joe, Ashley and Katie. Pictured: Inside the mansion he shares with his family . Mr Smith used part of his Poundland profits to snap up Hammer Hill House, a sprawling mansion near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, 14 years ago. He has since spent millions doubling the size of the 15,000 sq.ft house . His 13-bedroom home also features an indoor swimming pool, a helicopter pad and five reception rooms . The property was originally designed by Sir Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis, who famously created the Italianate village of Portmeirion in North Wales. But after Mr Smith moved in, he soon started to put his own spin on it and set out to double the size of the house. The mansion is now 15,000 sq.ft. with 80 windows and boasts its own indoor swimming pool, helicopter pad, indoor dancefloor with disco lights, a snooker room, five reception rooms and an 18-seat walnut dining table. Set in almost 30 acres of rolling countryside, there is also a host of expensive vehicles parked outside the property including a white Rolls-Royce. Mr Smith recently put the property on the market, having spent millions refurbishing it, as he and his wife want to downsize now their children are reaching their late teens and twenties. He said: 'The house is very special to us and it will be a real wrench for us to leave. 'We began refurbishing the home in 2000 and finally finished it in 2007. It was a real labour of love and no expense was spared. Mr Smith is particularly pleased with his full bar (pictured) in his mansion. He said: 'I especially love our home pub with a fully stocked bar. It's really unique and we've had some great parties there.' Set in almost 30 acres of rolling countryside, his mansion also boasts its own indoor swimming pool, helicopter pad, dancefloor with lights, a snooker room, reception rooms and an 18-seat walnut dining table . With more than 500 stores in the UK - more than double the number it had five years ago – Poundland has gone from strength-to-strength, making Mr Smith a self-made millionaire. Pictured: His Shropshire mansion . Mr Smith recently put his sprawling mansion on the market for £6.5million, having spent millions refurbishing it, as he and his wife want to downsize now their children are older and moving into their own homes . 'I especially love our home pub with a fully stocked bar. It's really unique and we've had some great parties there.' The multi-millionaire is selling his home via his own property investment company called Estates Direct - an online house-selling service that aims to cut out 'rip-off' estate agents and their fees. He estimates that he has saved the public over £2million, breaking it down to a saving of about £3,000 per home, with the estate agency service. 'I love hearing they have spent the money on something like a new kitchen instead,' he said. Despite his flash purchases, saving money is something which Mr Smith still does himself too. He claims to still fly economy class when he can and considers value-for-money when he is present buying. Speaking of a previous thrifty Christmas present for his wife, he said: 'My wife loves jewellery. So I bought her a lovely…Jewellery cleaner. She loves it. It was £120, very good value.'","Steve Smith became a self-made multi-millionaire with birth of Poundland .

"She wears the £450 Issa dress famously sported to announce the royal engagement in November 2010 while he sports a cosy jumper and a goofy grin. But this isn't the real Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Instead, it's their puppet likenesses - commissioned for ITV's new comedy spoof show, Newzoids. And the Duke and Duchess aren't the only royals to get a puppet makeover. Their dolls will be joined by an even more amusing version of Prince Harry, as well as a roster of celebrities. Scroll down for video . Plastic princess: The Duchess of Cambridge is about to make her debut in puppet form . The show, which has been likened to 1980s behemoth Spitting Image, starts later this month and, according to makers Citrus TV, will offer a similarly light-hearted take on current affairs. Sketches set to feature in the opening show include one that sees David Cameron slug it out with Nick Clegg on a puppet version of The Jeremy Kyle Show. Another sketch will see Ed Miliband's effigy join Ant and Dec to star in a show called 'I'm a Catastrophe... Get Me Out of Here' while a third will see Professor Brian Cox unearthing a new planet - on Kim Kardashian's backside.

Among the most memorable was the jug-eared puppet of Prince Charles, who was famously shown talking on a telephone made of roses. Charles will return to puppet form in Newzoids, this time reimagined as a version of Gogglebox's Dominic Parker. The Duchess of Cornwall will be shown as a take on Steph, with the royal couple set to chortle and booze their way through a Gogglebox-style sketch.

'We are pleased to be adding to our growing comedy portfolio with this funny and biting look at the world of politics and celebrity.' The show, which will be filmed by animation specialists Factory, will be voiced by a cast that includes impressionist Debra Stephenson and will be produced by Giles Pilbrow and Dominic Brigstocke who boast Have I Got News For You and Alan Partridge among their credits.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been turned into puppets .

"House prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace, forecasts show. Property prices soared by 10 per cent in 2014 but will grow by just 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year, it is claimed. It follows last year’s record price hike of 17.4 per cent in the capital. Economists said that the housing market had ‘got ahead of itself’ last year and would assume a much more leisurely pace in 2015. Scroll down for video . Forecasts show house prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace. File photo . Annual price growth across the country will then gradually accelerate again over the next five years, hitting 4 per cent by 2020. This year will be the first since 2009 that the UK as a whole out-performs London, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. This is because while prices in the capital stagnate, the housing market is still performing well in the East and South-East, and parts of the Midlands and North of England. But the CEBR said this victory for the provinces would be short-lived, since the London market will also recover in 2016. Prices there are set to rise by 2.7 per cent next year, above the national average of 2.3 per cent. London homes will also suffer no more price falls in the foreseeable future – and are forecast to see annual growth of an estimated 4.7 per cent by 2020. The predictions from economists at the think-tank were upgraded from their forecast in January, when they suggested average prices would fall this year. They said that radical changes to stamp duty had given the market a boost. In recent years many Britons had been deterred from moving home for fear of the punitive tax on house purchases. The tax was charged on the whole value of a property and successive governments had failed to increase thresholds, trapping growing numbers of families above a £125,000 threshold. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year. File photo . But, in December, the Coalition overhauled the system, replacing the unfair ‘slab’ structure with gradually increasing rates, which cut tax bills for the vast majority of movers. Economist Scott Corfe, of the CEBR, said: ‘House price growth in the UK will rise much slower than last year – but it will still be positive. ‘The market got a bit ahead of itself last year, and at the end of 2014 it began slowing down and plateaued. ‘It has now started to pick up again outside London. We are still not building enough houses to keep pace with population growth so, as long as we have a shortage of supply, prices will keep rising. ‘House prices will continue to grow faster than inflation.’ It was a different story in London, however, where he said interest from overseas buyers had dwindled, pushing down prices. While the stamp duty changes meant lower bills for the majority, those buying million-pound homes have been hit by higher rates – deterring international investors and many wealthy Londoners. Mr Corfe said: ‘Stamp duty reform, as well as the depreciation of the euro against the pound – making London more expensive for European buyers – has affected prices in the capital. ‘Uncertainty around the general election and fears of a mansion tax [under Labour’s plans] may have also driven down demand since the start of the year.’","Forecasts show prices will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace .

"More than 25 women have been airlifted from Royal Navy ships because of pregnancy. One ship - HMS Ocean – even had five pregnant sailors removed in emergency 'medevacs' during the last nine years, a Freedom of Information request revealed. And at least one woman was airlifted from HMS Illustrious, which was nicknamed 'HMS Lusty' by the crew before it was decommissioned last year. More than 25 women have been airlifted from Royal Navy ships because of pregnancy, including at least one woman from HMS Illustrious (above), which was nicknamed 'HMS Lusty' by the crew before it was decommissioned last year . Eighteen other ships - including HMS Dragon, HMS Enterprise and HMS Richmond - had emergency evacuations, data obtained by The Sun showed. A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed there was a strict 'no touching' rule in place at sea, which suggests the women conceived before boarding the ships or during leave. The data comes nine months after commander Sarah West, the first woman to captain a Royal Navy warship, was flown back to the UK following claims she had a sexual relationship with a member of her crew. An unnamed captain was appointed in her place and a military investigation was launched into the 42-year-old's conduct. A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed there was a strict 'no touching' rule in place at sea, which suggests the women conceived before boarding the ships or during leave (stock image above) Navy sources said Ms West left HMS Portland for ‘personal reasons’. The Ministry of Defence would not confirm what these reasons were or what action she would face. Women have been serving on Royal Navy ships since 1990 and in 2014 around 9 per cent of personnel were female. Last May three women made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy. Nearly 100 female British soldiers were sent home from Afghanistan after finding out they were pregnant. Ninety-nine servicewomen on operations were flown back to the UK between January 2006 and December 2013, a Freedom of Information request revealed. Sixteen women were removed from Afghanistan in 2013 due to pregnancy while 18 were sent home in 2011, the data showed. A further 102 women were evacuated from Iraq. Strict military rules ban mothers-to-be from serving in war zones. The women were flown back on flights usually reserved for injured troops and the true figure could be higher if others travelled via routine flights. Troops are reminded by senior officers to check they are not pregnant before they fly to the front line - but are not made to do pregnancy tests. Most of the babies would have been conceived before the mother left the UK but a small number of women may have become pregnant on tour. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said at the time: 'The small numbers of personnel who discover that they are pregnant on operations are returned at the first convenient opportunity.'","HMS Ocean had five women removed in nine years, according to new data .

"They have been married for less than a year and already there's a baby on the way. On Tuesday Jessa Duggar announced she's pregnant with her first child with husband Ben Seewald, 19. 'We're expecting!' the 22-year-old 19 Kids & Counting star told People. 'We are so excited. The due date is November first, our wedding anniversary.' Scroll down for video . A baby on the way: Jessa Duggar announced she's expecting her first child with Ben Seewald, 19. 'We're expecting!' the 22-year-old 19 Kids & Counting star announced on Tuesday . Excited for the arrival: The TLC stars also shared this image that had written on a white onesie, 'Coming soon, 11.01.2015' Something in the water! Soon after the announcement was made, Anna Duggar (middle) shared an image of Jessa (right) showing off her bump in a Twitter photo. Also in the snap is Jill (far left), who was still with child at the time the photograph was taken . A big hint: The announcement does not come as too much of a surprise to fans as in late March an image of the two was uploaded to Facebook that suggested they could be expecting - Ben was holding his wife's stomach in a pose typically struck by couples who are about to share they're planning for a little one . Jessa's baby will be the sixth grandchild for the Duggars. She is the third child to marry, and every marriage has resulted in a baby the first year of marriage. The youngest of Jim Bob and Michelle's children, Josie, seen here in Jim Bob's lap, is younger than their eldest granddaughter Mackynzie, who is seated in the front row . Soon after the announcement was made, Anna Duggar shared an image of Jessa showing off her bump in a Twitter photo. Also in the snap is Jill, who was still with child at the time the photograph was taken. 'Congrats @JessaSeewald @BenSeewald on your pregnancy! It was great to be pregnant together @jillmdillard,' she wrote in the caption. Anna, who is married to eldest Duggar Josh, is pregnant with the couple's fourth child, a baby girl due in July. The couple, who married in 2008 after a chaste courtship, already have Mackynzie, Michael and Marcus. Josh works for the Family Research Council, a pro life, anti gay marriage Christian lobbying organization in Washington DC. The whole family is famously prolife and shuns birth control. Michelle stopped taking birth control after she miscarried early in her marriage. She had gone on the pill following eldest child Josh's birth. Then she miscarried while taking birth control, she has said. Michelle then went off birth control and soon welcomed fraternal twins - and never used birth control again. Now Michelle and all her children proclaim that God does their family planning and they share their prolife beliefs on social media and the show. And lots of kids isn't all he shares with his parents. He and Anna also seems to be continuing a tradition with naming, as all 19 Duggar children have names that start with J, and his three children all have M names. Josh shared this photo of his pregnant wife and three children at the airport a few days ago. His eldest child is older than his youngest sister . The whole family is outspokenly pro-life, and josh and Anna are seen here kneeling when attending a rally earlier this year. Josh now works for the Family Research Council, a conservative prolife group . Josh shared this photo of his wife and younger brother Joseph for Joseph's birthday - wearing anti Roe v Wade t-shirts for the occasion . Jill, the fourth eldest Duggar, welcomed son Israel David earlier this month, ten months after her wedding. And now the fertility streak is continuing with daughter Jessa and her husband Ben. 'We are looking forward to being parents,' Ben told People on Tuesday. 'I am feeling pretty good,' added Jessa. 'The morning sickness was different every day. It's getting better, but I'm still hanging on to the heartburn. And I don't have any super serious food cravings.' The announcement does not come as too much of a surprise to fans as in late March an image of the two was uploaded to Facebook that suggested they could be expecting. Ben was holding his wife's stomach in a pose typically struck by couples who are about to share the good news that they're planning for a little one. The picture, in which the newlyweds are smiling and making the shape of a heart with their hands on Jessa's stomach, sparked rumors online of an impending pregnancy.

For her first pregnancy, Anna and her mother-in-law Michelle were pregnant at the same time . Making babies! They shared their passion online and the lovebirds in a romantic kiss after they married. They saved the first kiss for their wedding day and only held hands when they got engaged . Hiding her tummy: On Sunday the Duggar daughter shared this image to Instagram with the caption, 'Headed to Big Sandy, TX to meet up with my family!' The two did not make any kind of statement at the time. In her People interview, the TLC star explained that she found out she was with child when she took a pregnancy test one Sunday morning before church. 'I said, ""Hey Ben, guess what? Yeah, you're a dad."" We couldn't believe it,' the daughter of Jim Bob, 49, and Michelle Duggar, 48. She added, 'We are so excited. We have started talking baby names. It is one of those things that is so special, picking a name for a baby.' It runs in the family: Jessa's older sister Jill Dillard, 23, and her husband, Derick, 26, welcomed son Israel David on April 6 after a 70-hour labor . Ben works for Jim Bob Duggar doing odd jobs, and Jessa was always chief organizer for her younger siblings, organizing their home school and packing for trips. No doubt reality tv paychecks and assorted book and speaking fees will help the young couple afford the new addition. And both will have time to raise the little one. The Seewalds live in a house on the Duggar property, owned by Jim Bob and Michelle. Previously Josh and Anna lived their, and welcomed their two older children into the world in home births in the house. Mackynzie was born int he master bedroom, and Michael was born while Anna was on the toilet. Marcus was born at a midwifery center. It's not known if Jessa plans to homebirth in the same house as Anna or not. Jessa's older sister Jill Dillard, 23, and her husband, Derick, 26, welcomed son Israel David on April 6 after a 70-hour labor and an emergency c-section. They had planned a homebirth as well, as Jill is a midwife, but it didn't go as planned. Jill says the doctor stitched her up really well, however, and she hopes to have many more pregnancies and deliver future children vaginally.

THey also went to Paris on their honeymoon . Being pregnant has not changed Jessa and Ben's plans to adopt. 'Our hearts haven't changed on adoption,' the star said. People noted the agency the couple has contacted 'requires prospective parents to be married for two years before adopting.' 'We are still making plans,' she said. For now the two are just soaking it all in. 'We are trying to take it one day at a time,' Ben said.

The ceilings have been left exposed and the shipping container gates remained unpainted when they were converted into bedroom doors. Architect Michael Gooden, who worked with Mooney on PV14, said the designers wanted people to know what they were standing in when they stepped into the home.

"Dental kits which allow people to carry out their own fillings and repair caps and crowns at home are on the rise as patients say they can't afford a visit to the dentist. The kits, which can cost as little as £5 or even be bought in pound shops, are intended to provide a temporary solution for lost fillings or broken caps and crowns. However, more and more people are said to be buying the kits to carry out their own dental work as the price of receiving filling by a NHS dentist in England is as much as £52. More and more people suffering from dental problems are turning to DIY dentistry kits due to the price of NHS dental treatment (picture posed by model) According to the Guardian, one of the biggest sellers of first aid dental kits is DenTek, who sell around 250,000 products a year, although there is no research on how they are used. Among the items they sell are a temporary filling material as well as cap and crown cement. And although Department for Health figures show that more people than ever are receiving dental treatment on the NHS, experts are pointing to anecdotal evidence, which suggests that DIY dentistry is on the rise. John Wildman, a professor of health economics at Newcastle University told the newspaper: 'People at the lower end of the distribution curve - on big housing estates in the north-east, for instance - are effectively completely unreported. One of the DenTrek kits that can be bought to provide a temporary filling or repair a cap . 'They don't take part in surveys and they don't go to GP surgeries. Which is why you have a situation where people in the north-east have gaps in their teeth and are resorting to DIY dentistry.' Meanwhile others have pointed to the fact that in certain parts of England registering with an NHS dentist can be difficult due to huge waiting lists. An investigation last year found that some people were being forced to register with surgeries up to 40 miles from their home as nearby practices were refusing to take-on new patients. It also found that some NHS dental surgeries can have waiting lists of up to two years. The rise of the DIY kits come as British Dental Health Foundation revealed last year that one in five people admitted they would carry out DIY dentistry, including pulling out their own teeth, because they can't afford to go to the dentist. Their survey found that 17 per cent of people would remove their own tooth and that almost 80 per cent of those asked would leave a problem with their teeth until they could afford a dental appointment. The foundation also warned about 'senseless' examples of people pulling out the wrong tooth and ending up with infections after resorting to using doorknobs and string to yank out painful and infected teeth. Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, said: 'DIY dentistry is both dangerous and unnecessary. There are too many senseless examples of people either pulling out the wrong tooth or ending up with an infection. 'It is all too easy to make the problem worse, which could result in more invasive and expensive treatment.'","Kits are intended to be a temporary solution to broken fillings and crowns .

"It's a common misconception that anyone can swan into their local fast food store and pick up a job serving food, flipping burgers or even mopping up spilled soft drinks. However, as Daily Mail Australia recently discovered, it's just not that easy, with potential workers required to pass detailed psychological questionnaires before they can secure an interview. KFC's quiz contains 30 questions, which mostly ask applicants to rank their response from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree' to questions which to some, might not have an obvious answer. Scroll down for video . KFC's questionnaire contains a total of 30 questions which mostly ask applicants to rank their response from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree' Head of Human Resources, Robert Phipps, assured it was designed to rank the thousands of applicants that apply fo jobs with the company . When Daily Mail Australia selected only negative answers, they received an email notifying them that their application had been unsuccessful less than 10 hours later . The questions seek guidance as to how potential employees might react in workplace situations. How would you respond if someone yells at you? What about a change in the workplace, how would you deal with it? Another question asked if it is 'okay for an employee to take a little food if they are underpaid'. KFC's  human resources boss, Robert Phipps, claimed the test was specially designed to rank the thousands of applications which apply for a job with the company. 'We want to get the best possible candidates that we can for our organisation,' Mr Phipps (pictured) said . 'I wouldn't say it's deeply scientific, but it's reasonably scientific,' Mr Phipps told Daily Mail Australia. 'We take a norm sample of what success would look like in the output of the questions, and essentially what it does for us is it gives us a better than normal chance of predicting success around work attributes like honesty, work ethic and whether someone is a team player,' Mr Phipps told Daily Mail Australia. 'It does provide a ranking system and we tend to take those up the top end of the ranking. I wouldn't say that you can fail, unless not getting the job is failing.' Mr Phipps said that the test was not anchored to a personality type, but rather different work styles. 'In terms of personality or what have you, any personality fits in well at our company and then we teach them skills, but it's a question of their values around work ethics that will help us,' he said. 'I wouldn't say it's deeply scientific, but it's reasonably scientific. We take a norm sample of what success would look like in the output of the questions, and essentially what it does for us is it gives us a better than normal chance of predicting success around work attributes like honesty, work ethic and whether someone is a team player,' Mr Phipps said . Mr Phipps said that the test was not anchored to a personality type, but rather different work styles . He estimated that only one third of applicants make it through to the interview process, with employee referrals being 'our number one method of recruitment' - and was unable to estimate how many were hired by the end of the recruitment procedures. 'When you look at our organisation globally, we actually hire a lot of people… we find that by taking an approach like that, and it's not the most difficult of tests, but to be able to do a basic screening test and get to the point where we want to get the best possible candidates that we can for our organisation and its best practice, so we apply it.' KFC's quiz also includes a few situational questions such as: 'Your manager just told you that you need to work this weekend. You have plans this weekend that you do not want to change. What would you do?' He estimated that only one third of applicants make it through to the interview process, with employee referrals being 'our number one method of recruitment' KFC's quiz also includes a few situational questions, however these are nowhere near as difficult as  the scenario questions in McDonald's 23-question multiple choice quiz . The fast food giant has a vigorous recruitment procedure in which applicants must pass a 23 question multiple choice quiz online before their application can be submitted . Contrastingly, some of the scenario questions in McDonald's 23-question multiple choice quiz are far more complicated. While the company says that the questionnaire is designed to 'help McDonald's understand the position in our team that suits you best', Daily Mail Australia has been told that applicants can easily fail the test. 'You are approached by a group of young kids while you are relaxing in the park. They want you to join them in a game of soccer. What are you likely to do?' one question reads, with answer options ranging from 'join in for a couple of minutes just to make them happy' and 'join in with them as you really enjoy playing with kids'. Another question asks: 'You find you have some time available to cook. What do you do?' Questions range from those any job seeker would expect to be asked during an interview, to multiple choice scenarios . When asked why they have decided to apply for a job at McDonaldns s, applicants have the option of selecting 'it'll make my parents happy' or 'it's easy to get a job at Macca's' More convoluted questions are also included in what appears to be an attempt to determine an applicant's personality . Answers range from 'make a meal you are very familiar with', 'grab a cookbook or download a new recipe to follow' or 'be creative and experiment with whatever you find in the kitchen'. The possible responses listed for one question, which describes a scenario in which a man trips and spills his shopping on the floor, differ only slightly. They include immediately helping the man, asking if he needs help and 'let the man know the same thing has happened to you and offer any assistance he needs'. But Mr Phipps said there were 'other stages to the recruitment process that are far more important than the first one' such as face-to-face interviews and trials at the work place. No doubt those who are more serious about securing a position would second guess what response would make the best impression . The answers listed for this question differ only minutely .","KFC and McDonald's require job applicants to fill out a detailed quiz .

"It's the worst storm to hit the NSW coast in a decade, but what everyone in the region wants to know is why no warning was given that it was going to be this bad. Climate specialist Don White from WeatherWatch Australia confirmed that severe weather warnings were issued by the Bureau of Meteorology on Sunday. However, although they knew it would occur somewhere around the southeast coast, they did not know exactly where. 'The storm was forecast to form between Port Macquarie and Newcastle - that’s as about as accurate as they could have predicted. But it turned out to hit closer to Newcastle than Port Macquarie,' Mr White told Daily Mail Australia. 'It all depends on exactly where it forms. This one formed in the worst possible spot, which was just north of Newcastle. It then covered 150km south from Newcastle to Wollongong where a third of Australia’s population live. Scroll down for video . A tree and power lines lie across a major road in Raymond Terrace, 50km north of Sydney . A large gum tree (left) that has been uprooted on a property at Booragul, a suburb near Lake Macquarie north of Sydney in NSW. Powerful winds on Monday night and Tuesday morning also brought down scaffolding (right) in Edgecliff, in Sydney's eastern suburbs . A chart from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology shows the forecast for wind speed across New South Wales on Tuesday night . The Hunter Valley was one of the worst-hit areas in NSW and this car in the town of Blacksmiths got the brunt of the weather . 'So it was always going to be very destructive. It’s not like it hit a few small fishing villages like a storm did on the south coast a few weeks ago.' Mr White also explained that those trying to forecast the weather had an even more difficult job now as there was not as much resources for them to call on and get the specific information they need. 'Our problem now is that any information that we can get from the upper atmosphere, which is where the cold air exists that initiates these types of conditions, is reliant on predicting satellite imagery,' Mr White told Daily Mail Australia. 'We don’t send up as many weather balloons any more, because of budget cuts so it’ll affect what can be forecast. 'It’s just economics. Weather balloons can now only be used in a limited number of places because of budget cuts, so there’s not as many going up every day which means we don’t get the same data as before from the upper atmosphere.' Mr White added that this information does not normally make a big difference, but it does in the storm season, because you can forecast thunder storms more accurately and pinpoint more accurately where these storms will be. 'But basically this was fairly well forecasted 24 to 48 hours ahead. The forecast was basically wet and windy but the actual intensity of these things is impossible to predict,' he says. 'This storm has also lasted a bit longer and hasn’t moved. Normally it’s 12 hours of severe weather and then it eases off. But this severe weather is lasting from 24 to 36 hours.' Emergency services admitted on Tuesday they were shocked by the severity of the storm and that their teams were overwhelmed by a weather system that changed very rapidly. Asked on ABC’s 7.30 programme if warning systems had failed, NSW State Emergency Services deputy commissioner Steve Pearce said: 'The weather system did change very rapidly. 'This was an east coast low initially which are always historically very severe weather system however they come in and they go very quickly, this didn't. This has just stayed and tracked, again we have never seen these cyclonic winds last for 24 hours straight that's what's caused the majority of the damage.’ A huge tree blocks a road in Avalon on Sydney's Northern Beaches after being uprooted by Tuesday's storms . A radar loop (left) and a cloud map (right) show the East Coast Low weather system causing gales and storm force winds . In Avalon on Sydney's Northern Beaches fallen trees and telegraph poles blocked roads and caused significant damage to property . The cyclone strength winds currently battering the NSW coast are being caused by an intense low-pressure system known as an East Coast Low. The stormy weather system,  formed in the Tasman Sea, hasn't hit NSW this strong since 2007 and is expected to be one of the longest lasting ever. But why was everyone taken so by surprise? East Coast Lows are particularly common in June and tend to be more frequent in autumn and winter. They are characterised by gales or storm force winds that can damage buildings, fell trees and powerlines, cause powerful surf that can damage the coast and, in some cases, run ships aground. They can also dump hundreds of millimetres of rain, causing flash flooding and riverine flooding. Mr White told Daily Mail Australia: 'It forms occasionally, usually once a year. But this particular one is quite strong and close to the coast winds are up to 135kmh and rain up to 200mm.’ Fire rescue in Narrabeen, in Sydney's northern suburbs, were called to a number of properties where storms had brought down trees . Ferry services have been cancelled at Parramatta (pictured) while services between Manly and Circular Quay have also been stopped . ‘This one is probably the strongest since 2007 and it is also going to be the longest lasting one,’ Mr White said. ‘They normally move away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24- 36 hours, which is unusually long for an East Coast Low.’ East Coast Lows draw strong, moisture-laden winds across the coast, which cause heavy rain to fall when they are uplifted by the hills and ranges that run parallel to the coast. On Monday night 24 Sydney suburbs incurred 100mm of rainfall, with Blacktown hit hardest, thanks to the latest East Coast Low. An estimated 100,000 homes are without power on Tuesday morning across Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter region. Winds of at least 100km/h lashed parts of the east coast, causing this tree to fall on a car in East Gosford, on the NSW Central Coast, on Monday with a driver and passenger inside. They were treated for only minor injuries. They were treated for minor injuries by paramedics. The SES is preparing for damaging winds to hit parts of NSW over the next two days . A pedestrian is drenched while crossing  the street in the Sydney central business district during heavy rain on Monday . And a floodwater rescue operation is underway in Hunter area where there have been wind gusts of up to 125km/h - levels recorded in category two cyclones. State Emergency Services Deputy Commissioner Steve Pearce told the ABC on Tuesday the police and NSW Fire and Rescue had been called in to help the SES on the 2400 call-outs they've received so far, with many more expected in daylight when people can see the damage around their homes. 'We've had 24 hours of relentless gale-force winds. I haven't seen this wind damage for years,' Mr Pearce said. Some have speculated this week’s East Coast Low will be the worst in five years, while meteorologist with Weatherzone Rob Sharpe told the Sydney Morning Herald: ‘This is going to be our most significant east coast low since spring.’ ‘The last major one that has affected Newcastle was in 2007. East Coast Lows were common in the 1970s but became less common in the 90s,’ Mr White said. A ship makes its way out to sea in Sydney on Monday. The Bureau of Meteorology has been issued for Sydney Closed Waters, the Hunter Coast, Sydney Coast, Illawarra Coast, Batemans Coast and Eden Coast . The SES had responded to about 15 jobs on Monday morning, mainly in Sydney metro area . ‘If it is to the north of Newcastle the max effect occurs all the way down to Wollongong, which is in the vicinity of the nation where most people live so it causes the most damage.’ In June 2007 bulk carrier Pasha Bulker ran aground near Newcastle amid wind gusts up to 124km/h. Other notable east coast lows occurred in October 2004, when there were mean wave heights off Sydney of 5m with a maximum height of about 10m. In August 1998, more than 300mm of rain fell over four days in Sydney and Illawarra, 420mm at Beaumont and 401mm at Kangaroo Valley. In May 1974, 165km/h gust at the Newcastle Nobbies saw bulk carrier the Sygna run aground. And in August 1857, the Dunbar wrecked at South Head killing 121, with only one person surviving. A commuter wades through a flooded train station in Sydney's central business district on Tuesday morning amid wild weather .

"If you live in the UK or US you can expect to have already been hacked – at least according to the real life conman turned fraud prevention expert whose escapades inspired Catch Me If You Can. Frank Abagnale, whose early life on the run from the FBI was brought to life on the screen by Leonardo Di Caprio, has said the public is underestimating the extent that their details have been stolen by digital fraudsters, the Times reported. In the 2002 Steven Spielberg film Abagnale, now 66, poses as a doctor, a lecturer, a lawyer and an airline pilot over the course of a crime spree that eventually landed him in prison. Scroll down for video . Frank Abagnale (right) has said individuals in the western world have probably already had their identities stolen. He was played by Leonardo Di Caprio (right) in the film about his misspent youth as a conman . However the former conman changed his ways and has spent the rest of his career working with the FBI on fraud detection and prevention. In an interview Mr Abagnale told of how in an age of information overload, those of us living in the western world have probably already had our identities stolen. He highlighted the recent theft of details from more than 80 million Americans whose names, dates of birth, children’s details and and social security numbers were held by the US underwriter Anthem insurance. He added that there had been so many similar incidents in recent years that societies should just assume personal information had been stolen. Mr Abagnale works as a consultant to British company LexisNexis and has written three books on the nature of fraud. He has called the constant effort by security companies to stay ahead of hackers a ‘battle’, saying it is always necessary to be thinking a move ahead of the fraudsters. Abagnale, as is depitced in the 2002 film Catch Me If You Can, posed at one point as a senior medical doctor . The conman turned fraud expert also travelled the globe posing as an international airline pilot for Pan Am . Mr Abignale exaplained that while he used ink and paper to fraudulently access money, the scope for internet fraud is greater and easier for hackers . A survey by the digital consultancy Centrify shows one in four Britons know they have had their identities stolen. In 43 percent of those incidents the ensuing difficulties took more than a month to rectify. Forty-seven percent said they had to pay money to resolve the problems. Of these, 28 percent had to pay at least £60. Mr Abagnale explained these kinds of cases were not the work of some mastermind fraudster but more often than not down to employees simply not following proper procedure. Details can be lost when individuals download work files at home, insert unknown memory sticks into work terminals or open attachments on untrustworthy emails. Because fraudsters will sit on stolen information for drawn-out periods of time, people are normally hacked two or three years before their identity is stolen. However the typical reaction is to assume the theft is recent, Abagnale explained. The tools of his trade were pen, paper and charm  but Mr Abignale says what he did 50 years ago as a teenaged boy is now ‘a thousand times easier,’ adding that changes in technology always open the door to crime. As a prime example he explained that to forge a cheque in the 1960s required a special printing press. Now a coporate logo and a managing director’s signature can all be found on the web at the click of a button. Typically Abagnale will drop memory sticks with the word 'Confidential' written on them on the floor of a new client’s offices. Inevitably they will be picked up by an unwitting employee and placed in a work computer, allowing the bug he has placed on it to enter the system. Frank Abignale worked as a fraudster during his teenaged years in the 1960s - he now deeply regrets it . Frank W Abagnale Jr has become one of the world’s foremost authorities on forgery and secure documents. He has worked with the FBI, hundreds of financial intitutions and corporations and international government agencies. As well as the 2002 Steven Speilberg film made about his life, a Broadway musical also called Catch Me If You Can opened on broadway in April 2011. Between the ages of 16 and 21, he successfully posed as an airline pilot, an attorney, a college professor and a paediatrician. While doing so he cashed $2.5 million in fraudulent checks in every U.S. state and 26 foreign countries . Apprehended by the French police when he was 21 years old, he served time in the French, Swedish and U.S. prison systems. After five years he was released on the condition that he would help the U.S. federal government without remuneration. More than 14,000 financial institutions, corporations and law enforcement agencies now use his fraud prevention programs. He said the amount of money lost to fraud was ‘beyond the imagination’. Medicaid, Mr Abagnale said, and Meidcare, the two U.S. healthcare assistance programmes, pay out more than $100 billion in fraudulent claims every year. The conman turned FBI consultant insists he is not proud of his youthful adventures and said he regretted the Speilberg film. However he said he has paid back society with interest. $2 milllion of the $2.5 million he took was recovered by the U.S. Government and he has spent 40 years helping catch criminals. He stole $2.5 million dollars, $2 million of which was recovered. Mr Abagnale then spent 40 years working with the FBI .","Conman who inspired Spielberg film says personal details no longer safe .

A keen athlete, Pippa, who won a sports scholarship to Marlborough College, has previously spoken about how she likes to stay strong and healthy with plenty of exercise and protein-rich diet. Ahead of her swim in Istanbul last summer, the columnist said, 'To maintain energy I try to eat more protein, particularly fish or chicken. 'A lot of people swear by carb-loading in the run-up to an event but it doesn't really work for me, so I just up my protein intake.' Pippa Middleton was seen enjoying an early evening run in a London park earlier this week, stopping along her route to chat to a friendly fellow jogger . Pippa has also revealed that she prefers to stick to ‘wholesome carbs’ such as brown rice, lentils and quinoa, to balance her increased protein intake. On the morning of big events, she tucks into a bowl of porridge with honey, banana and nuts to provide her body with plenty of fuel. A big fan of the healthy lifestyle, Pippa has also revealed that playing tennis and taking Pilates classes helps her to keep in shape.

"A second suspect has been charged in the stabbing death of a married lawyer at an upscale Washington D.C. hotel. Jamyra Gallmon of Washington was arrested last week and charged with first-degree murder while armed for allegedly killing David Messerschmitt, 30, on February 9 at the boutique Donovan Hotel. According to a police affidavit filed in court on Thursday, she stole just $40 and the victim's Metro SmarTrip card. Her roommate - and alleged girlfriend - 19-year-old Dominique Johnson was arrested on Wednesday and is accused of being an accomplice. Scroll down for video . Jamyra Gallmon, right, has been charged in the stabbing death of a lawyer at an upscale Washington hotel stole just $40 and the victim's Metro SmarTrip card, while Dominique Johnson, left, has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery . She has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery and made an initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday during which she denied the charge against her. According to court documents, Johnson was charged because she knew Gallmon was going to rob Messerschmitt. She also allegedly accompanied Gallmon to CVS to buy the zip ties used to tie the victim up. According to documents, after Gallmon returned from the hotel, she told Johnson that the robbery 'went badly.' When Johnson was arrested on Wednesday, she had two Metro cards, including Messerschmitt's card which had been used on April 1. Gallmon has a court hearing scheduled for Friday, but that has now been rescheduled until May 8. She is being held without bond. The woman has admitted to police that she set up the lawyer using a masculine-sounding email address and went to the upscale hotel with the intention of robbing him. Gallmon, who was seen on surveillance camera entering the hotel wearing androgynous clothing, told detectives that the robbery went wrong when Messerschmitt grabbed her arm, causing a flashback to a time when she had been assaulted. The affidavit stated that the pair got into a struggle and the defendant pulled a knife from her pants and stabbed the victim repeatedly until he fell to the floor where she stabbed him several more times. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds to the back, groin and abdomen along with one wound which pierced his heart and another which hit his spinal cord. David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. An affidavit revealed that he had been soliciting sex from men through Craigslist . Gallmon was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9 . His hands had been bound with zip-ties into a pair of makeshift cuffs. His hands were covered in defensive wounds. Her attorney asserted in court that it was a case of 'imperfect self-defense.' Court documents concerning a rent dispute confirm Gallmon and Johnson as roomates. About two weeks after Messerschmitt was killed, the two were ordered by a D.C. Superior Court judge to pay $1,860 in rent owed since January. A neighbor of the two women said he was surprised that they could be mixed up in such a crime. 'They were great neighbors. They never made much noise, nothing out of the ordinary. Great people,' Tony Johnson told WUSA9. He said he believed they were also lovers. Messerschmitt had texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm on February 9 to tell her he would be home in an hour after leaving his law office. He never returned and the next day he was found dead at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. He death was declared a homicide. Jamyra Gallmon, 21, (pictured graduating from her military academy high school) has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed for allegedly stabbing to death 30-year-old David Messerschmitt on February 9 . Among the items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Investigators discovered that Messerschmitt had posted a Craigslist ad on February 9, soliciting responses from other men, using 'dcguy456'. The lawyer began an exchange with an individual, using the name 'chrissanchez0906', around 2pm which continued throughout the day. Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual.

Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago. Authorities have said they are searching for anyone else who may have e-mailed the account used by Gallmon — chrissanchez0906@yahoo.com — but have not said whether anyone has come forward.

David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. A Cincinnati native, Messerchmitt attended Ohio State University where he met his wife. He went on to study law at Boston University before working at a firm in Chicago. He then worked at two more firms in the D.C. area before transferring to DLA Piper last year, as a specialist in intellectual property law.","Dominique Johnson, 19, was arrested on Wednesday and has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery .

"Thousands of animals have died overnight at a commercial fish farm in southern China's Guangdong Province after the lake became polluted. More than 100 tonnes of dead fish were found floating in the water near Huizhou City on Friday morning by devastated farmer Mr Zhang. Workers had rushed to clear the lake, using plastic baskets and nets to scoop them out, creating a huge mountain of rotting fish on the shore. Thousands of fish, weighing 100 tonnes, have been found dead at a lake in Huizhou City in southern China's Guangdong Province . A mountain of rotting fish: A team of people have been working to clear the dead fish from the water by piling them up on the nearby shore . Others were sent to spread 2.5 tons of edible salt to try and restore the chemical imbalance of the lake which had become contaminated with ammonia, reported The People's Daily Online. It may save the few remaining live fish but Mr Zhang, who founded the business in 1996, admitted he was not optimistic. The shock death of thousands of fish means he could be facing financial ruin. Staff at a commercial fish farm based at the lake found the water had been polluted with an excessive quantity of ammonia leading to the death of the fish . Mr Zhang believes the ammonia which polluted the lake and killed his fish came from a nearby farm which which had been using the chemical as fertiliser . While some employees worked hard to remove the thousands of dead animals from the lake in Huizhou City in southern China's Guangdong Province . The farmer stands to lose over 1 million RMB (£110,000) in potential sales, and claimed he would need at least a decade to recover. 'It's the first time that my fish farming has had such a problem since I started in 1996. I'll need another ten years to make up for this loss,' said Mr Zhang. 'It has taken me years to build the fish numbers up and my one source of income has vanished almost overnight.' Mr Zhang claims the source of the ammonia may have been fertilizer being used at a nearby farm. Other workers spread 2.5 tons of edible salt to try and address the chemical imbalance and try to save the few live fish that remained .

"The head of an elite Victorian private school has resigned after a photograph of him looking at pornography on his work commuter circulated on social media. Andrew Barr, principal of The Geelong College, south-west of Melbourne, was allegedly photographed through a window as he watched pornography in his school office. The school council launched an investigation, which included a search of   Mr Barr's computer, after the photograph appeared on the social media site Snapchat. Andrew Barr, who was Principal of Melbourne's The Geelong College, has resigned after a photo taken of him watching pornography in his office went viral on the internet after being published on Snapchat . Chairman of the Geelong College council, Dr Hugh Seward, told the Geelong Advertiser yesterday the matter was a serious breach of the school's standards, even if the investigation found Mr Barr not to have broken any law. 'The matter was taken very seriously,' Dr Seward said. 'Just before Easter, The Geelong College council became aware of a matter of concern that might constitute a breach of our standards.' 'The council immediately looked into the matter and when our concerns were confirmed, Andrew Barr tendered his resignation.' In a statement, Dr Seward thanked Mr Barr for his contribution to the school since he joined the college in 2013. ‘In the two years since his appointment, Mr Barr has made an enduring contribution to the College’s educational vision and future planning. The Council is grateful for Mr Barr’s commitment and achievement,' he said. Chairman of the Geelong College council, Dr Hugh Seward, said the matter was a serious breach of the school's standards . Mr Barr is a former chairman of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia and previously served 10 years as principal of Scotch Oakburn College in Melbourne. Dr Seward told the Geelong Advertiser the investigation confirmed Mr Barr had not broken any law and 'at no point' did his actions affect the care provided to students.

"Nick Clegg today pleaded with Labour and Tory supporters to vote tactically to stop Alex Salmond in his tracks. In a highly-unusual move, the Lib Dem leader urged his rivals to help stop Mr Salmond from 'strutting his stuff' in Westminster. The former Scottish First Minister hopes to make a return to the Commons as MP for Gordon by ousting the Lib Dems who have held the seat for more than 30 years. Nick Clegg, who today visited diving equipment manufacturer Divex Global in Aberdeen, urged supporters of rival parties to help stop Alex Salmond returning to Parliament . Polls suggest the Lib Dems face near-wipeout in Scotland, with senior figures including Treasury minister Danny Alexander under threat from a surge in support for the SNP. Mr Salmond has chosen to stand in the Gordon constituency, where veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce is standing down. Today Mr Clegg was campaigning in Scotland, including a visit to a diving equipment manufacturer in Aberdeen. Alex Salmond has chosen to stand in the Gordon constituency, where veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce is standing down . He spoke out in support of new Lib Dem candidate in Gordon, Christine Jardine. He appealed 'to all those voters, they may be Labour voters, they may be Conservative voters, but voters who simply don't want to have their vote taken for granted by Alex Salmond'. He added: 'If you want to stop Alex Salmond pocketing your vote and dancing off to strut his stuff on the Westminster stage, the only way to stop him is to vote for Christine Jardine as the next MP for Gordon.' Sir Malcolm had held Gordon for the Lib Dems since 1983, but the scale of the challenge facing Mr Clegg's party was illustrated by a Lord Ashcroft poll in January which put the SNP on 43 per cent with the Lib Dems on 26 per cent. Mr Clegg warned that the SNP wanted to reopen 'old wounds' from the divisive independence referendum campaign that had strained families, friendships and communities. The Lib Dem leader said: 'That referendum was fought over months and years, it was fought with passion and vigour on all sides. 'But, let's be honest, it placed some strain on communities. Friendships were placed under strain as people differed on that fundamental thing. Even relationships within families were put under strain. 'The people of Scotland don't want to turn the clock back and reopen those wounds about that debate, they want to move forward.' Mr Clegg told reporters that the SNP offered the 'politics of division'. He said: 'When I speak to people in Gordon and elsewhere, they say 'Let's move on' - they don't want the politics of division from the nationalists, they want the politics of hope, of unity, of continuity.' Mr Clegg warned that the SNP wanted to reopen 'old wounds' from the divisive independence referendum campaign that had strained families, friendships and communities . Mr Clegg said it was 'possible' that the Lib Dems could come out of the election with more seats than Labour in Scotland . Mr Clegg dismissed as 'ludicrous' suggestions that it was hypocritical to urge supporters of other parties to back the Lib Dems to stop the SNP if he was not prepared to tell his voters to put their cross in Labour's box in seats where Ed Miliband's party is battling the nationalists. Speaking to reporters on his campaign bus, he said: 'It's not up to me to appeal to Lib Dem voters to vote for other parties, it's for other parties to make their case.' He added: 'Of course I am not going to start telling Lib Dem voters to vote for other parties. If other parties want to make a pitch to them in other parts of the country, it's a free country, they can do it. 'It's called a campaign. It's what happens in every single campaign. No party can win seats without reaching beyond their core vote.' Mr Clegg said he would 'let the SNP and Labour fight it out and talk to those voters'. 'It's not for me to start telling Lib Dem voters to do anything other than vote Lib Dem. What a ludicrous idea.' Mr Clegg dismissed as 'ludicrous' suggestions that it was hypocritical to urge supporters of other parties to back the Lib Dems to stop the SNP if he was not prepared to tell his voters to put their cross in Labour's box in seats where Ed Miliband's party is battling the nationalists . Mr Clegg said it was 'possible' that the Lib Dems could come out of the election with more seats than Labour in Scotland because of the damage the SNP surge could inflict on Mr Miliband's party. He said: 'I suppose that's theoretically possible. I try to avoid making predictions, but I'm quite seduced by that prospect.' Mr Clegg blamed Labour's failings for the current political landscape in Scotland. 'I've never in my adult political life seen a party so complacent about taking thousands of voters for granted, to the extent that when the SNP challenged them, they had no organisation,' he said. 'Particularly at campaign times, politics is the marriage of lofty ideals with gritty organisation, and you can't deliver your messages and ideas and you certainly defend them when they are being challenged, unless you have an organisation. 'And the Labour party, astonishingly, just basically let that organisation disappear, just wither on the vine...we'll see where it ends up but I suspect we'll weather the challenge from the SNP a lot better than Labour does.' Mr Clegg also took his campaign against the SNP to West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, where Sir Robert Smith is hoping to hold on to his seat.","Lib Dem leader makes highly unusual plea for help from party rivals .

"Take it away: Raymond Allen, who opened the first KFC franchise, said he thinks the restaurant is 'dreadful' and won't eat there again . The businessman who brought KFC to the UK but has only ever eaten it once, says he will not go again and branded the fast-food chain 'dreadful.' Raymond Allen - who is only a handful of people in the world to know its secret recipe - opened the first franchise in Preston, Lancashire, in 1965. He had become a personal friend of Harland 'the Colonel' Sanders after meeting during a conference in Chicago 50 years ago. Mr Allen still has a personal hand-written copy of the recipe which is believed to be made up of 11 herbs and spices - and is a closely guarded secret by the firm. But the 87-year-old, from Jersey in the Channel islands, said the company has strayed so far from its original concept it's been 'ruined' and would never set foot in one again. He said: 'We have got one where I now live, but I would not go in there. I don't use it and I think it is dreadful. The company has ruined the product. 'Instead of staying with one good thing that was sellable, they have tried to compete with the other fast food units. They should have just stuck with the chicken.' His wife Shirley, 84, said: 'We tried KFC only once about a year ago. 'We had the traditional original chicken but there were so many different products it was difficult to know what to order. I don't think we will go back.' After the chance meeting in Chicago, Mr Allen helped Sanders establish the UK side of his empire while he was still a small-time restaurant owner in Louisville, Kentucky. He also gave him valuable advice on the legal side of the business including patents and was paid to seek out suitable locations for other branches across the world. He said: 'The Colonel was a very kind man, who was very forthright. 'But at the time we met he was a small-time Southern State restaurant owner, and I knew a lot about patents or registered trademarks. 'We had heard about him before the meeting. But when we first met him, he had only one franchisee in America who sold the chicken as a menu item in his restaurant. 'We were in the fast food business and thought it would be the ideal product to sell in a takeaway. 'We had several Wimpy bars so decided to convert them into KFC. That is what we did with the first one in Preston.' Mr Allen said he has a personal hand-written copy of the secret recipe for the unique taste of KFC chicken which is believed to be made up of 11 herbs and spices. He said: 'It is a lengthy recipe. I think there are 11 herbs and spices but I can't remember it off the top of my head so I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to. 'Dreadful': A KFC restaurant like the first one opened by Mr Allen in Preston, Lancashire. He said he ate one recently and found it 'dreadful' 'But it is locked away in a safe in a bank. We don't really get asked much about it. Not many people know about our involvement in it. 'We are a low key and private family and don't often talk about it. I have no idea how much it is worth but I would never sell it.' At the peak of Mr Allen's expansion of the franchise, he was opening a new shop every week through cash flow. He said: 'We were in a race against time with McDonalds as we both wanted to get the best sites. 'We wanted to expand a bit quicker than that so I walked the streets of London to go to a bank. 'We needed £100,000 trying to raise the money - but all the banks said there was no future in the business.' His company KFC UK Ltd, was eventually able to obtain a loan from Heublein Inc, a USA company which at the time owned Smirnoff Vodka. He said: 'They saw how well we were doing and lent us the money on condition that we sold the business once we had opened 100 units. That was what we did.' Mr Sanders had started his KFC business in 1930 at a service station in Corbin, Kentucky, where he began cooking for hungry travellers who stopped there for fuel, using a secret recipe for the coating of the restaurant's fried chicken. It became so popular that by 1935 the Governor of Kentucky made Mr Sanders a Kentucky Colonel in recognition of his promotion of the American state. Following the meeting Mr Allen acquired the rights to expand the KFC franchise outside the US, and returned home with big plans. He said: 'It was slow to catch on at first because people didn't know what it was. 'In the UK in those days chicken was something you ate for Sunday dinner. It was way before its time. We had to give it away to passers-by initially. 'We would only use fresh chickens, and they had to be two and a half pounds in weight. It was initially difficult to source the chickens because of the demand.' In recognition of his achievements in business, Mr Allen was named a Freeman of the City of London in 1979 and was commissioned a Kentucky Colonel in 1965. Mr and Mrs Allen sold the business in 1973.","Raymond Allen has hand-written copy of the Colonel's secret recipe .

"It was a gruesome death that is the stuff of most people's nightmares. Now scientists have identified the unfortunate individual whose bones were found fused to the walls of a cave in Lamalunga, near Altamura, in southern Italy. Using analysis of DNA extracted from the bones sticking out from the limestone rock, researchers have found he was a Neanderthal who fell down a sinkhole around 150,000 years ago. Scroll down for video . Genetic analysis of the bones (above) of ‘Altamura Man’, found entombed in limestone in a cave in Altamura, Italy, has revealed that they belong to a Neanderthal who fell into the cave 128,000 to 187,000 years ago . Wedged in the narrow space and probably badly injured, he is thought to have starved to death. Over the thousands of years that followed, the body decayed and the remaining bones gradually became incorporated into the stalactites left behind by water dribbling down the cave walls. The DNA is the oldest to ever be extracted from a Neanderthal and the researchers now hope to further analyse the genetic information from the skeleton. They have a reputation as rather brutish creatures who chomped their way through huge hunks of meat, but it seems Neanderthals may actually have been the first masterchefs. New research is suggesting that these extinct early humans may have used wild herbs to flavour their food. Scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old Neanderthal teeth found in El Sidron, Spain. At first researchers thought they might have been using these plants as a form of self-medication, but now new findings have presented a different theory. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues suggests they may have used them to make food more palatable. First discovered in 1993, the skeleton - nicknamed 'Altamura Man' - has provoked debate among anthropologists partly due to the difficulties in studying the skeleton as it had become part of the cave walls. Examination of those bones that were exposed suggested they belonged to an adult male. However, few could agree on whether the skeleton belonged to a Neanderthal or a modern human, or how long it had been down there. But after taking a tiny part of the skeleton's shoulder bone, researchers at the Sapienza University of Rome, University of Firenze and Newcastle University have been able to answer the questions. They found mitochondrial DNA they extracted from the shoulder bone matched that of other Neanderthal skeletons. Uranium-thorium dating techniques has also revealed that the skeleton appeared there between 172,000 and 130,000 years ago, during a period when ice sheets were expanding significantly from out of Antarctica and Greenland. Giorgio Manzi, one of the palaeoanthropologists leading the study from the Sapienza University of Rome, said:  'Altamura Man is an incredible treasure for the Alta Murgia territory. 'We hope that this fossil skeleton will become a key for a virtuous combination of scientific research, protection of our heritage and its promotion and development.' Researchers have, up until now, held off from excavating the remains (above) as they believed it would cause irreparable damage to the skeleton but an early studies had suggested it had some Neanderthal features . The Lamalunga cave where the uniquely preserved Neanderthal skeleton was found is close to Altamura, Italy . Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies . The researchers now hope that further analysis of the DNA might reveal new insights into Neanderthal evolution. It is nearly 100,000 years older than other previously sequenced Neanderthal DNA. The Altamura Neanderthal is thought to have come to rest in its unusual tomb after an adult male fell down a sinkhole into a limestone karst system. Wedged in the narrow rocks, he were unable to move and probably starved to death. However, it also means no predators were able to reach his body. Over time, his bones fell where had died, with some still lodged in the cave gap and were eventually absorbed into the walls of the cave itself. Cave explorers then stumbled across the bones in 1993. Researchers eventually obtained permission to take a fragment of the shoulder bone in 2009 and have spent six years studying it. Writing in the Journal of Human Evolution, the research team said: 'Even though a number of Neanderthal traits can be seen—particularly in the face and in the occipital bone—there are features that distinguish this specimen from the more typical morphology of, such as the shape of the brow ridges, the relative dimension of the mastoids, and the general architecture of the cranial vault. 'Overall, our results concur in indicating that it belongs to Homo neanderthalensis, with some phenetic peculiarities that appear consistent with a chronology ranging from 172 ± 15 ka to 130.1 ± 1.9 ka. 'Thus, the skeleton from Altamura represents the most ancient Neanderthal from which endogenous DNA has ever been extracted.' It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. If they manage to sequence the DNA, they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the Neanderthal. It could also help shed new light on their relationship with modern humans analysis of other Neanderthal DNA has shown they interbred with our own species. Recent research has shown that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today - and this may be what killed them off. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals.","Altamura Man was discovered in a cave in Lamalunga near Altamura, Italy .

"The remains of Friedrich  Branft, 22, make the first complete skeleton to be recovered from the battle of Waterloo 200 years ago . The 200-year-old skeleton of a soldier killed at the battle of Waterloo has been discovered under a car park - just like Richard III - and identified by archaeologists. After a painstaking process historians identified the man as Friedrich Brandt, 23, a Hanoverian hunchback who trained in the East Sussex resort of Bexhill-on-Sea. Brandt, a member of George III’s German Legion, was killed by Napoleon’s forces and was found with a musket ball between his ribs, the Sunday Times reported. An archaeologist working for the Belgian government, Dominique Bosquet, called the find ‘unique,’ explaining that no complete skeleton had ever been retrieved from the battle of Waterloo. The mystery surrounding Brandt’s origins and identity was cracked by Gareth Glover, 54, a former Royal Navy officer and historian, who said Brandt would never have been allowed to serve, because of his deformity, under modern military standards. However his Hanoverian unit, loyal to the king, would have fought alongside British and Dutch troops against Napoleon . The skeleton was uncovered in June 2012 when a digger excavated a car park near the Lion’s Mound area at Waterloo battlefield just south of Brussels. It took three years of intense research and a little luck to pin-point Brandt’s identity. A piece of wood carrying the initials CB, and the date 1792 as well as 20 German and French coins amounting to a month’s wages and an iron spoon proved crucial. The team at Waterloo had to use the process of elimination to identify their unknown soldier and could not rely on DNA tests like those used by the group that discovered Richard III under a car park in Leicester in 2012. Because, unlike King Richard, none of Brandt’s relatives were known, historians had to use what little records remain from the 1815 battle at Waterloo to piece together the story. Bosque recognised the skeleton carried deformities indicating severe spinal issues. Further tests put the skeleton’s age at death between 20 and 29. The musket ball that killed the young soldier was found lodged between his ribs at the Waterloo battlefield . Killed apparently by a musket ball which was found between the recently identified soldier's rib bones . The team was ready to give up on the case until Glover, treasurer of the Waterloo Association and author of Waterloo: Myth and Reality, matched troop formations to where the body was found and was able to identify the fallen soldier as a member of the German Legion. Using the information he was able to calculate that the soldier was probably killed between 1pm and 4pm when his unit marched on a ridge at Hougoumont. Then in February an important clue was brought to light when a piece of wood originally believed to be inscribed with the initials CB actually showed FCB. The letter F had faded over time. Brandt was killed most likely between 1pm and 4pm at Lion Hill which now stands as a monument to the dead . This painting by Verker  captures the moment Wellington's Anglo-Dutch army clashed with the FRench . Using this vital piece of information Glover found that only two soldiers with the initials had been killed at the battle. He was able to rule one of the pair out after consulting payment records dating back to August 1815. Eventually the historian was left with Brandt, a private in the Legion’s second line battalion. It appears that Brandt was single as no one came forward to make a widow’s pension claim following his death. Belgian archaeologist Dominique Bosquet shows the place where he found the remains of the German soldier . While the German soldier would originally have trained in Bexhill Sussex, based there until 1814, it is likely that at the outbreak of war he was located in Holland. An estimated 50,000 died at Waterloo with a proportion of the dead burnt and then buried in mass graves. Other bodies were sold commercially as fertiliser or their teeth were sold as dentures. Brandt’s skeleton will feature in an exhibition to be unveiled at Waterloo in May.

"Bird numbers have dramatically declined in Fukushima, research has revealed. Scientists analysed 57 species in the region and found that the majority of populations had diminished as a result of the nuclear accident. They found that one breed in particular had plummeted from several hundred before the 2011 disaster to just a few dozen today. Researchers have found that bird species are continuing to drop in Fukushima (shown after the disaster in 2011). The barn swallow, for example, dropped from hundreds to dozens. This is despite radiation levels in the region starting to fall. And comparing it to Chernobyl could reveal what the future holds . The research, published in the Journal of Ornithology, was carried out by scientists at the University of South Carolina including biologist Dr Tim Mousseau. They showed that the situation has steadily worsened since the disaster on 11 March 2011. On that day, just over four years ago, Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by an earthquake and its resultant tsunami. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. This led to three of the plant’s six nuclear reactors going into meltdown and releasing radioactive materials. Reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean-up effort difficult. A total of 300,000 people evacuated the Fukushima area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami. Many populations were found to have diminished in number as a result of the accident, with several species suffering dramatic declines. One of the most hard-hit species is the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure. ‘We know that there were hundreds in a given area before the disaster, and just a couple of years later we're only able to find a few dozen left,’ said Dr Mousseau. ‘The declines have been really dramatic.’ And while background radiation has declined in the region in recent years, the negative effects of the accident on birds are actually increasing. ‘The relationship between radiation and numbers started off negative the first summer, but the strength of the relationship has actually increased each year,’ Dr Mousseau said. ‘So now we see this really striking drop-off in numbers of birds as well as numbers of species of birds. ‘So both the biodiversity and the abundance are showing dramatic impacts in these areas with higher radiation levels, even as the levels are declining.’ Dr Tim Mousseau and his team made the findings using thermoluminescent detectors, which use gamma-radiation-sensitive crystals (shown) to measure radiation doses in individual subjects living in the wild . One hard-hit species was the barn swallow (stock image shown), Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure . The team are hoping to get information on what the future holds for Fukushima from the Chernobyl site, which was the scene of a devastating release of radioactive materials in Ukraine in 1986. One difference noticed so far is that migratory birds fared worse in Chernobyl, whereas it was year-round residents that were doing worse at Fukushima. This could be due to differences in DNA repair capabilities for migratory species as a result of flapping their wings - which lowers their antioxidant levels and makes them more vulnerable to radiation. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. Shown are radiation levels immediately after the accident in 2011 .","Researchers find that bird species are continuing to drop in Fukushima .

"This week’s warm weather may have tempted you to take a dip in the UK’s usually chilly waters. And if you had, you wouldn’t have been the only one swimming around the coastline. Billions of jellyfish have appeared in our waters, apparently attracted by the higher sea temperatures. Scroll down for video . Making waves: Billions of barrel jellyfish have been spotted in water off the coast of Devon and Cornwall . Hundreds of the barrel jellyfish – each the size of a dustbin lid – have been hauled in by fishermen on the Devon and Cornish coast, with dozens of sightings reported to the authorities. Passengers aboard a sea life cruise were stunned after coming across a giant swarm of thousands of the jellyfish – the largest species found in south-west England – over a mile in length on Wednesday. The jellyfish, which can grow up to six feet and weigh 55lb, were sighted just off Pendennis Point near Falmouth, Cornwall. Keith Leeves, captain of AK Wildlife Cruises, said: ‘It was eerie and a little unnerving. ‘There were thousands of them. I’ve never seen anything like that in all the years I’ve been doing this – it was spectacular.’ Invasion: Experts believe the barrel jellyfish, which can grow up to six feet, have been attracted by the warmer waters and a lack of predators . Experts say their stings are not powerful enough to do any serious harm, but warn swimmers that it is best not to touch them. Matt Slater of the Cornwall Wildlife Trust said it was ‘difficult to say what is causing their appearance, but it could be because there is more plankton for the jellyfish to feed on because of warmer waters’. Steve Hussey, from the Devon Wildlife Trust, says the increase could be because of fewer predators in the region’s seas. ‘The leatherback turtle is struggling at the moment, which means there are less of them to eat the jellyfish.’","Creatures attracted by the higher sea temperatures .

"The price of olive oil is expected to rocket as forestry officials in southern Italy yesterday began cutting down thousands of olive trees infected with a deadly bacteria. The xylella fastidiosa bacteria has ravaged olive trees in the Puglia region and contributed to a 35 percent drop in the region's olive oil production last year. Its spread has so alarmed the EU that France announced a boycott of Puglian fruit and vegetables, while its effect on production will mean shortages in the supply of olive oil and is likely to lead to higher prices for shoppers in Britain and around the world. An Italian forestry official stands guard as workers begin chopping down an infected olive oil tree . Police officers were also on hand to maintain order after protesters attempted to stop the trees' destruction . A forestry official walks past the fenced-off remains of an olive oil tree destroyed in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease . A forestry worker cuts through the stump of a tree infected with the deadly xylella fastidiosa bacteria . Puglian growers have opposed the government's destruction plan, saying it won't stop the bacteria's spread . However, Puglian growers have opposed the government's slash-and-burn plan, saying it won't contain the bacteria's spread. Several dozen protesters tried unsuccessfully yesterday to block the first seven trees from being felled in Oria, near Brindisi, even climbing the branches and shouting 'assassins.' Eventually, the first seven trees were cut down and are to be burned today, with more to follow. Many of Italy's oldest olive groves, some dating back 500 years, have been infected by the bacterium, which causes plants to shrivel, leaving them incapable of bearing fruit. Puglia, a region in the heel of Italy, produces about 11million tons of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop, and they are used to make some of the country's best oils. The initial area to be culled is 20,000 acres – about 30 sq miles – between Lecce to Brindisi. It contains around 11million trees, according to Unaprol, the largest consortium of growers. It is feared that unless drastic action is taken to fell the groves, the bacterium will spread to other olive-producing regions of Italy such as Tuscany and Umbria, and even to other Mediterranean countries. Last month Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for Food Safety and Security, said he was 'profoundly concerned by the gravity of the situation'. He added: 'We have to take decisive measures with immediate effect. Naturally it is very painful for the growers but it is necessary to remove all the affected trees, it is the most effective measure.' The bacteria (right) causes plants to dry out, leaving shrivelled stumps that are incapable of bearing fruit. Pictured left are protesters sitting in the branches of an olive oil tree earmarked for destruction . The microbe, first identified in the Americas, has now infected 800,000 trees in Salento, the southern half of Puglia, the heel of Italy . Below is a summary of the Italian virgin olive oil market worldwide, according to Unaprol (organisation of Italian oil producers), showing the main importing countries: . USA: Italy holds a market share of 51 per cent, with exports up 2 per cent in 2013. AUSTRIA: Italy is the market leader in 2013 with a 48 per cent share. BRAZIL: Italy is the fourth-largest virgin oil supplier to Brazil with 7 per cent of the market, following Portugal, Spain and Argentina. CANADA: Italy is in pole position with a market share of 70 per cent in 2013. CHINA: Italy is the second-largest virgin oil supplier. In 2013, the market share was 21 per cent. KOREA: Italy is the second-largest virgin oil supplier. JAPAN: Italy is the market leader in 2013 with a 45 per cent share and a growth of 6 per cent.

"A university student attacked by a serial rapist confronted him in court yesterday to say he had taken away ‘every piece of joy’ in her life. Jessica Howard, 23, denounced ‘night stalker’ Clive Howard, 57, for his string of assaults on six women over 28 years. She told him that the catastrophic impact of his attack could never be put into words and has destroyed her life. Clive Howard, 57, (left)  dubbed 'every woman's living nightmare', was today jailed for life and one of his victim's, Jessica Howard, 23, (right) who has bravely waived her right to anonymity . Waiving her right to anonymity, the student – who is not related to the rapist – said he had ‘humiliated’ her and ruined precious relationships with those closest to her. ‘You have made it impossible for me to enjoy moments of happiness. Your attack literally darkens every piece of joy I have,’ she told him. ‘Because of you, my body is now worthless to me. You took away all of my control, took away all meaning to my body other than an inanimate object with no worth.’ The dramatic confrontation came as Howard was jailed for a minimum of ten years and three months after admitting seven rapes, one attempted rape and three kidnappings. Described as ‘every woman’s living nightmare’, he prowled the streets of Cambridge and Norwich looking for victims. The mechanic, a father-of-six who lives with his parents in Battisford, Suffolk, picked up some in his Volvo estate and pounced on others in parks. Yesterday detectives revealed 15 other women have come forward since Howard appeared in court last year to say he also attacked them. Norwich Crown Court heard that Miss Howard was picked up by the rapist after a night out in Norwich last May. He drove her to an isolated car park and raped her. She managed to stagger away half-naked and was rescued by a taxi driver who drove her to a friend. Police discovered CCTV footage which captured images of his car after the attack and driving around Norwich city centre earlier in the evening. A CCTV image of Howard'scar as he prowled the streets of Norwich on the night he raped Jessica Howard . Howard (his car is seen far right in this CCTV) admitted seven counts of rape, three of kidnap and one of attempted rape at an earlier hearing . Separately, a DNA sample matched the unsolved case of a woman who was the victim of an attempted rape in Cambridge almost exactly one year earlier. The woman, aged in her 30s, managed to scratch Howard as she fought him off, trapping vital forensic evidence under her fingernails. It later emerged he had tried to force another woman into his car on the same night and two other women in the city three months earlier. As their investigation widened, police traced a woman who told them Howard had raped her at least six times in Suffolk, starting in 1986. Miss Howard, who is originally from Essex and is studying history of art and literature at the University of East Anglia, sat just yards from Howard as she addressed him. Reading an open letter, she said: ‘To describe the ramifications of you raping me is impossible. I cannot put the full extent into words. I trusted you to take me home. Still, I blame myself for being raped, for getting into your car. ‘I had to see my mother’s face as she looked at her only daughter after she had been violated in the worst possible way.’ The car park where Howard took Miss Howard to rape her after picking her up and offering her a lift home . Miss Howard was able to describe his Volvo (pictured) to police, who traced him to an address in Suffolk . She added: ‘On top of this you have ruined my relationships with friends and family. Friends who do not know how to react have removed themselves from my life. Some ignore it as if it doesn’t matter. ‘How am I supposed to enter into a happy relationship, to have a happy life with the stigma of what you have done tormenting me? How am I meant to have a family if I always remember what you did, the sickening belief still stirring in my stomach that it was my fault.’ Sentencing him, Judge Stephen Holt described Miss Howard’s statement as ‘heart-rending’ and said the ‘effect you had on her life is devastating’. He added: ‘This was a campaign of sexual offences for many years. You did severe psychological harm to your victims. Two describe you spanking them – this is additional humiliation and degradation. There was clearly a significant degree of planning and targeting.’ Outside court, Detective Sergeant Chris Burgess described Howard as a ‘dangerous predatory loner’ who frequented dating websites and used prostitutes. He said: ‘There is concern there are further victims out there and we would encourage anybody who believes they were attacked by him to come forward.’","Clive Howard, 57, preyed on lone women on Norfolk and Cambridge streets .

"It was only three months ago that they realised their dream of having their first child. Now Luke Harris and Daryl Lee are celebrating the birth of their second baby. And the gay couple are due to become fathers for the third time in just a few weeks after controversially enlisting the help of three surrogate mothers. Scroll down for video . Luke Harris and Daryl Lee, from Surrey, had their first child three months ago and are now preparing to welcome their third baby into the world after enlisting the help of three surrogate mothers. Pictured (from left): Pregnant surrogate Becky Harris, Mr Lee with son Phoenix Harris and his surrogate mother Bex Harris (behind), Mr Harris holding daughter Willow-Star  and her surrogate mother Viktoria Ellis (right) The couple, who met in 1999 and became civil partners in 2012, celebrated the birth of their first child, son Phoenix Blue (left with Mr Harris), on January 14. They welcomed daughter Willow-Star (right with Mr Lee) after surrogate Viktoria Ellis gave birth on February 25 . Phoenix Blue (left) was born naturally after a 16-hour induced labour, weighing 7lb 15oz, while Willow-Star was born a healthy 7lb at surrogate Viktoria Ellis’s home after a 25-minute labour that was so quick the dads’ were woken by a text saying: ‘Your girl is here!’ Showing off baby number two for the first time, the civil partners told how their rapidly expanding brood has left them exhausted but elated. The latest addition is daughter Willow-Star Shirley Harris-Lee. She was born a healthy 7lb at surrogate mother Viktoria Ellis’s home on February 25 – after a 25-minute labour that was so quick the gay dads’ were woken by a text message saying: ‘Your little girl is here!’ First child Phoenix Blue Harris-Lee – a boy – was born naturally on January 14 after a 16-hour induced labour, weighing 7lb 15oz. His surrogate mother was Bex Harris, Viktoria’s best friend. Baby number three – known to be a boy – is being carried by Bex’s sister-in-law Becky Harris and is due in July. The birth will mean Mr Harris – who is not related to the two mothers – and Mr Lee will have completed their family of three within seven months. Mr Harris, 51, a computer programmer from Surrey, said: ‘Going from having an empty home to having two precious babies in a such a short period has been a whirlwind, but even after weeks of feeding on demand we feel overjoyed. ‘We are relishing every moment of becoming dads. We spent 15 years fearing we’d never be able to have children, so while at times, as every parent knows, you are completely knackered, the sense of elation far outweighs any negatives.’ He described becoming fathers as ‘life-affirming and life-changing’ for himself and Mr Lee, 41, a dentist. ‘We now truly understand what unconditional love means – the only downside is that we don’t go to the pub any more!’ said Mr Harris. ‘We now don’t look at ourselves as a couple, we are a family unit, and fiercely protective of our little clan.’ Mr Harris, 51, a computer programmer (pictured left holding Willow-Star), described becoming fathers as ‘life-affirming and life-changing’ for himself and Mr Lee, 41, a dentist (right with Phoenix Blue). He said: 'Having two babies in a such a short period has been a whirlwind' Happy families: Pictured from left to right, Bex Harris, Daryl Lee holding Phoenix, Luke Harris with Willow-Star and Viktoria Ellis . Phoenix (left) and Willow-Star (right) will soon be joined by another sibling when surrogate Becky Harris gives birth to a boy in July . Phoenix (right) was born using Bex Harris’s eggs and Mr Lee’s sperm while Willow-Star (left) was created using Viktoria’s eggs and Mr Harris’s sperm, meaning they are not biologically connected. The couple’s third child, yet to be born, was created using Mr Lee’s sperm . Willow-Star was delivered by Viktoria’s neighbour in Suffolk, who happens to be Bex’s mother, Karen Harris, who also runs the internet surrogacy forum where the women and fathers met. Mr Harris and Mr Lee drove there as soon as they could. ‘When we arrived at Viktoria’s house our beautiful daughter was snuggled up in blankets, looking so tiny and vulnerable and she was absolutely perfect in every way,’ Mr Harris said. After a hospital check-up, the couple took Willow home to meet Phoenix, who was born using Bex’s eggs and Mr Lee’s sperm. As Willow was created using Viktoria’s eggs and Mr Harris’s sperm, they are not biologically connected. The couple looked into adoption before deciding to have children using surrogates, after reading about Sir Elton John and David Furnish becoming fathers through surrogacy. After the birth of their third child, the couple will have become a family of three in seven months . Their most recent child is daughter Willow-Star who was born via surrogate Viktoria Ellis (centre holding Willow). Mr Lee (pictured right holding 11-week-old Phoenix) and Mr Harris said they were a little daunted by the prospect of a third child but will take it in their stride . Mr Lee (pictured left with Willow-Star) and Mr Harris (right with Phoenix), who met in 1999 before becoming civil partners in 2012, said: 'While we may not meet some people’s idea of a traditional family, all our children will be cherished in a stable, loving environment’ Mr Harris said: ‘As far as we’re concerned Phoenix (left) and Willow-Star (right) are brother and sister and that’s how they’ll be brought up' The couple’s, as yet unborn, son was created using Mr Lee’s sperm, meaning he will be Phoenix’s half-brother. But Mr Harris said: ‘As far as we’re concerned Phoenix and Willow-Star are brother and sister and that’s how they’ll be brought up. ‘While we may not meet some people’s idea of a traditional family, all our children will be cherished in a stable, loving environment.’ The couple met in 1999 and became civil partners in 2012. They looked into adoption before deciding to have children using surrogate mothers, after reading about Sir Elton John and David Furnish becoming fathers through surrogacy.

"The ‘Kate effect’ has put a bump in the profits of British fashion house Seraphine with fans flocking to snap up items worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, including this £195 collarless cashmere coat . It has been the Duchess of Cambridge’s label of choice during her two pregnancies. And now the ‘Kate effect’ has put a bump in the profits of British fashion house Seraphine. The online and high street firm has seen sales double in two years since the Duchess was first spotted in one of its outfits. Among the most popular royal choices was a £195 mist-blue collarless cashmere coat with faux pearl buttons. Kate wore the Natasha coat to a series of engagements in Kensington in January and it instantly became such a hit with women – many of whom weren’t even pregnant – that it sold out in most sizes. The firm now sells it with the tagline ‘Worn by the Duchess of Cambridge’ and markets it as suitable for before, during and after pregnancy. Other Seraphine outfits in the Duchess’s wardrobe include the £46 fuchsia wrap dress that she wore in the first official photograph of Prince George nearly two years ago. A different type of Kate effect is being seen outside the maternity unit where she is due to give birth. Fans draped in Union flags and carrying balloons and placards have already set up camp near the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, central London. Veteran royal supporter John Loughrey, 60, from Wandsworth, South West London, has been there since April 1. ‘I’m so excited I’m like a washing machine – I’m on full spin,’ the former assistant chef told the Mail yesterday. Mr Loughrey was the first to camp outside Westminster Abbey to secure a view of Kate and William’s wedding, sleeping on the pavement for a week, and he slept on a bench outside the Lindo Wing waiting for Prince George to arrive in 2013. ‘I’d like to sleep on the pavement here, but the police are gently moving us on,’ he told ITV as he held a home-made sign that read: ‘Kate, don’t keep us waiting!’ Another fan, Terry Hutt, 80, carried placards saying ‘It’s A Prince’ and ‘It’s A Princess’ ready for the announcement of the royal arrival. Although not officially confirmed, it is believed that the Duchess is due to give birth this weekend. Ahead of the birth, Seraphine is already celebrating – and not just a doubling of turnover to £11.2million from £5.2million in 2013. Fans draped in Union flags and carrying balloons and placards, including Terry Hutt (left) and John Loughrey (right), have already set up camp near the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, central London . Mr Loughrey with Maria Scott (left) and Amy Thompson keeping a royal vigil outside the London hospital . Another royal seal of approval will be announced today, with the firm given a Queen’s Award for Enterprise in international trade – one of Britain’s most prestigious business accolades. Founder Cecile Reinaud said of the Duchess’s patronage: ‘Kate has worn quite a few dresses from our range for special occasions during her second pregnancy. 'It is definitely extremely flattering when she chooses one of our dresses and makes a big impact. She has a classic style and is a fashion leader. She is a style inspiration for us as much as a customer. No one can beat her elegance.’ French-born Mrs Reinaud, 41, started the fashion house 12 years ago and as well as its HQ near Kensington Palace it has several stores in London and one in New York. Other famous names to wear the brand include Zara Phillips, Angelina Jolie, Halle Berry, Kate Hudson, Kate Winslet and model Claudia Schiffer.","The 'Kate effect' has seen rise in profits of British fashion house Seraphine .

"Ed Miliband has dismissed claims he would be held to ransom by the SNP as Prime Minister – insisting 'that ain't going to happen'. The Labour leader insisted SNP MPs would not be able to dictate policy, even if he fails to win a majority and is reliant on them to stay in Number 10. It comes after the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon this morning said Labour could only govern with the support of the SNP – and laid out what the party must do to get it. Scroll down for video . The Labour leader - interviewed by the BBC's Evan Davis - insisted SNP MPs would not be able to dictate policy, even if he fails to win a majority and is reliant on them to stay in Number 10 . Unveiling the party's manifesto in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon demanded an end to government cuts, higher welfare spending and big hikes in the minimum wage in return for propping up a Labour government. But speaking to the BBC tonight, Mr Miliband rejected claims the SNP would be 'calling the shots' if Labour did not have a majority. The Labour leader: 'That ain't gonna happen. That ain't gonna happen.' Ed Miliband has dismissed claims he would be held to ransom by the SNP as Prime Minister – insisting 'that ain't going to happen' Mr Miliband's remarks come after the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon this morning said Labour could only govern with the support of the SNP – and laid out what the party must do to get it . Ed Miliband refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs, crime and the effect of tuition fees. The Labour leader confidently predicted that austerity would see unemployment soar, crime rise and the number of poor students going to university fall. But, in each case, the opposite has happened. Mr Miliband was challenged over Mr Balls’ comment four years ago that it was fantasy to think we’d get job growth with all the cuts being made in the public sector. In fact, presenter Evan Davis pointed out that the number of jobs has increased by around two million – ‘about a thousand a day’. After at first not answering the question, the Labour leader was forced to accept: ‘The number of jobs has gone up.’ On crime, Mr Davis quoted shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper who said earlier this Parliament that the cuts are ‘risking public safety and the fight against crime’. When asked what had happened to crime, Mr Miliband eventually replied: ‘Certain areas of crime have gone down; certain areas of crime have gone up.’ In fact, Mr Davies pointed out, the crime survey of England and Wales showed it was at its lowest level since 1981. The presenter then moved on to the hike in tuition fees, quoting Chuka Umunna saying in 2010: ‘How can these proposals do other than deter people from poor backgrounds from going to university?’ In fact, the number has increased by around a third, Mr Davis said. Following repeated questioning, he admitted: ‘There are some – there are some more people going to university from different backgrounds.’ He said his party’s judgement had not been wrong on the issue, saying: ‘No, it wasn’t.’ But Mr Davis asked: ‘On issues about jobs, crime, social mobility, comments, predictions made by people in your team turn out to have been wrong. These are important areas. ‘These are not minor quibbles are they? These are huge issues that have had a large part to play in the last five years.’ The Labour leader replied: ‘I don’t think that’s a judgement that people are going to make at the election.’ When asked whether the SNP would be able to tell Labour which measures it could introduce he replied: 'They're not going to tell us, they're not going to tell us. Look, I'm very clear about that.' He refused to say whether the party with the largest number of seats should get first chance to form a government. It comes amid a flurry of polls suggesting that the Tories will finish as the largest party, but fall short of having enough MPs – even with Lib Dem support – to form a Coalition government. This would leave the Labour Party in pole position to try to form a minority government with the support of the SNP. Mr Miliband, speaking to the BBC's Evan Davis tonight, refused to be drawn on the what he would do in the event of another hung parliament where no party has enough MPs to form a majority on its own. He said: 'I'm not going to get into post election speculation.' He added: It's for people in the House of Commons to decide how they vote on measures put before the House of Common and that will be the case after the election.' In the interview Mr Miliband also took 'full responsibility' for Labour's poor polling in Scotland – with experts predicting that the party is on course to lose 40 MPs north of the border. Mr Miliband also refused to say how much a Labour-led government would be borrowing by the end of the next parliament. He said: 'The way you get credibility is not by picking out an arbitrary number today in six years' time.' But the Labour leader insisted he did not agree with Ms Sturgeon who has called for increases in government spending and an end to cuts regardless of the deficit. It came after Ms Sturgeon released her 'ransom note' of policies which she would demand in exchange for putting Mr Miliband in power. The SNP and Labour manifestos both commit to re-introducing the 50p top rate of tax, scrapping the bedroom tax and beefing up the energy regulator to drive down family bills. Ms Sturgeon also pledged to help Labour reduce tuition fees by £3,000 to £6,000 a year – even though Scotland has already scrapped student fees. However, at least one big stumbling block remains to a deal between the two parties – Britain's nuclear deterrent. Ms Sturgeon re-stated the SNP's opposition to renewing Trident. The manifesto states: 'A vote for the SNP is a vote to halt progress on Trident renewal, delivering a saving of £100 billion over the next 35 years.' However, Labour have pledged not to make any deal over nuclear weapons and are committed to maintaining a 'minimum, credible, independent nuclear capability'. The Tories said the SNP manifesto was Mr Sturgeon's 'ransom note' to Labour and would result in higher government borrowing and tax increases in England. A spokesman pointed to the SNP manifesto commitment to increase spending. Unveiling the party's manifesto in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon demanded an end to government cuts, higher welfare spending and big hikes in the minimum wage in return for propping up a Labour government . Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon this morning said Labour could only govern with the support of the SNP – and laid out what the party must do to get it . The manifesto states: 'SNP MPs will demand an end to austerity. We oppose further spending cuts and propose modest spending increases - of 0.5 per cent above inflation - in each year of the next Parliament. Under our plan, the deficit will still reduce each year, but there will be at least an additional £140 billion across the UK.' The Tories said this meant £148 billion in extra government borrowing and insisted Labour would have to bow down to the SNP demands to stay in power. Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has insisted Scotland can 'call the tune' in the next Parliament. In last week's TV debate, Ms Sturgeon said: 'The polls will show that Ed isn't strong enough to get rid of the Tories on his own. 'What I say to Ed is I want to replace the Tories with something different and something better, something more progressive.'","The Labour leader insists SNP MPs will not be able to dictate policy .

"Visitors to a metro-Detroit museum have a chance to get an up-close look at the chair Abraham Lincoln was shot in at Washington D.C.'s Ford's Theatre in 1865 next week as the museum puts it center stage. The red, worn chair will be removed from its enclosure at Dearborn's Henry Ford Museum and displayed in an open plaza on April 15 as part of the museum's observance of the assassination's 150 anniversary. Two days earlier, it will be onstage when renowned historian and Lincoln expert Doris Kearns Goodwin delivers a sold-out lecture at The Henry Ford. The chair in which Abraham Lincoln was shot has been on display at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, for 85 years. On April 15, it will be removed from its encasing to be displayed for the 150th anniversary of the assassination . Abraham Lincoln (left) was shot in Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. on April 14, 1865 by pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth (right). Lincoln died from his injuries the next day . The chair has a dark stain on the back, which many visitors believe to be blood from the shooting. But historians at the museum say that the stain is oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before Lincoln . Lincoln's chair has been part of the museum started by pioneering automaker Henry Ford - no relation to the theater-owning Ford family - since its founding 85 years ago. The government removed it from the theater and held it as evidence, and it ended up at the Smithsonian Institution. The wife of a theater co-owner petitioned to reclaim it, then sold it at auction to an agent working for Henry Ford. Henry Ford also bought the Logan County Courthouse where Lincoln practiced law in Illinois in the 1840s and moved it to the outdoor area next to his museum known as Greenfield Village. For decades, the theater chair was housed in that courthouse. Around 1980, the chair was placed inside the museum, where it's now part of the 'With Liberty and Justice for All' exhibit. 'Lincoln was one of Henry Ford's heroes - when he decided he wanted to have this village, he wanted to collect Lincoln stuff as an educational tool,' said curator Donna Braden. 'The courthouse is pretty much the first thing Henry Ford acquired related to Lincoln and the chair came soon after.' A playbill from Our American Cousin from the night President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865 is shown on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn . A copy of a hand colored 1870 lithographic print by Gibson & Co. provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows John Wilkes Booth shooting U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as he sits in the presidential box at Ford's Theatre . A copy of a 1865 lithographic print by Currier & Ives provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows the same event from a different angle . Many visitors wonder whether dark spots on the back of the chair are Lincoln's blood. Not so, say museum workers: The stains are oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before that fateful night when Lincoln was shot by a pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth. Steve Harris, a historic presenter at the museum, tells passers-by that Lincoln's head would have been positioned much higher than the stain because he was 6ft, 4in tall. Taking in objects from the final hours of two important American lives is a major draw to the museum. The Henry Ford also owns the limousine President John F. Kennedy was riding in when he was fatally shot in Dallas nearly a century later. Museum officials say the chair and car are among the most visited artifacts in the museum, along with the bus Rosa Parks rode in when she refused to give up her seat to a white rider and helped spark the civil rights movement. Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. has arranged the presidential box identically to the way it was the night Lincoln was shot through the doorway . Abraham Lincoln's iconic silk top hat, which he was wearing the night he was assassinated, is part of the museum display at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Goodwin, author of 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,' told The Associated Press that the chair will offer an extra 'dimension' to her words and the experience of those in the room. 'There's an intimacy to it that catapults you back in time,' she said. 'And hopefully, along with that, you're not just thinking of the death but the life that made it worthwhile.' Museum visitor Jeff Buczkiewicz stood before the chair, peered silently into the glass-enclosed case at the rocking chair, then snapped pictures for posterity . 'You just get drawn into these things,' said Buczkiewicz, 47, who came from suburban Chicago with his family to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. 'It is a tragic part of our history and our country. I think it's important to take it all in.' Milestone anniversaries seem to add to the impact of objects like the chair and limo. About 8,000 people visited the limo on November 22, 2013, a free-admission day marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination, so the chair is likely to draw plenty of visitors on the Lincoln anniversary, which also has free admission. The single-shot Deringer pistol John Wilkes Booth used to kill Abraham Lincoln is displayed at the Center for Education and Leadership at Ford's Theatre in Washington . 'It really is about the power of the artifact,' said Patricia Mooradian, president of The Henry Ford, as the entire history attraction is known. 'It's less about the artifact itself than the symbolic nature of the artifact that represents a great paradigm change in the history of our country,' she added. Buskiewicz has also visited Dealey Plaza in Dallas where Kennedy was assassinated. 'You just have to try to take it in when you're in those areas,' he said, but he wonders 'why we gravitate' toward places and things associated with these types of events. Goodwin, whose book helped inspire Steven Spielberg's movie, 'Lincoln,' says that standing before iconic yet everyday objects provides a deep experience that transcends the moment that made them famous. 'In some ways, it's more familiar when it's a chair, a bus or a limo,' she said. 'There's something about the tangibility of these things.' The chair in which Lincoln was show is regularly displayed in an encasing at The Henry Ford Museum. For the 150th anniversary it will be taken out of the encasing .","The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, has had chair for 85 years .

"A Russian aerospace commander has sensationally claimed that some spy satellites are masquerading as space junk in Earth orbit. The official refused to comment on how many such satellites there were, and which countries were operating them. It suggests there could be more satellites than thought monitoring different countries on Earth. The claim was made by the commander of Russian Space Command. Oleg Maidanovich said someone was hiding satellites as space junk (artist's illustration of a satellite shown). But in a film he refused to name the country behind the ruse . The claims were made by the commander of Russian Space Command, Oleg Maidanovich. He was speaking on a film called ‘Space Special Forces’ during a tour of Russia’s main centre for aerospace intelligence in Krasnoznamensk, near Moscow. ‘Very recently, specialists of the department of space intelligence centre uncovered a newly created group of space satellites... made for radio-technical reconnaissance of equipment on Russian territory,’ he said. A reconnaissance satellite is unofficially referred to as a spy satellite. They are Earth observation satellites or communications satellites traditionally used for military or intelligence purposes. Some are used to simply take images from the ground, while others relay information from one place to another. Many such satellites are used today for high-resolution photography of certain areas, for scientific or defense purposes. The film goes on to state that there ‘are cases when a space satellite pretends to be space junk for years and then wakes up and starts working at the right moment.’ The comments were made yesterday on ‘Space Day’, when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. Since then hundreds of rockets have been launched into space – and Russia itself now has about 140 satellites operating in orbit. Their Space Command is a division of the military responsible for warning of missile and air strikes and controlling Russia's defence satellites. It monitors about 20,000 objects orbiting the planet, out of a total of 100,000 significant objects. Some objects are believed to have a military purpose - but it’s not quite clear what the purpose of the satellites disguised as space junk are. MailOnline has asked the Russian space agency (Roscosmos) and Space Command for further information on the claim.

"Authorities say police officers shot and killed a suburban St. Louis black man after he charged at them with a knife. A police body camera recorded the interaction. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference on Saturday that Thaddeus McCarroll's mother reported on Friday night that her son had barricaded himself in a home in Jennings. The mother told police her son 'was talking about going on a ""journey'""and a ""mission"" and mentioned a ""black revolution,""'according to police. Scroll down for video . Dead: Thaddeus McCarroll, pictured in 2012, was killed outside his Jennings home on Friday night after he allegedly charged at police with a knife . Shooting: Police fatally shot Thaddeus McCarroll, 23, after he 'refused to listen to them and charged at them with a knife' His mother said he was walking around the house with knives and a Samurai sword. St. Louis television station KMOV reports that Belmar says the man had access to a sword and that officers tried but failed to engage him in conversation. Video shows a man emerging from the home at about 1 a.m. carrying a knife and a bible. Police say they shot him with an ' less lethal impact weapon' because they felt they had to act. The rubber bullet to the leg failed to deter the suspect. Officers then responded the 'charging' McCarroll with a lethal round of shots, reports NBC. 'The officers resorted to less lethal force to try and bring the incident to a safe conclusion with no loss of life, but this individual made the decision to refuse these attempts, and charge at officers with a deadly weapon,' Belmar said in a statement. Talking him down: Dashcam footage shows police attempting to stop Thaddeus McCarroll from charging . The encounter was recorded on officer's body camera as police asked McCarroll to drop his knife numerous times. 'Why are you carrying a knife?' an officer can be heard asking McCarroll. 'Your mom is worried about you.' An officer then told McCarroll they were 'not here to harm you' after McCarroll replied. The home: McCarroll died outside his Jennings home on Friday night after he allegedly charged at police . 'We need to know that you're going to be okay, starting right now,' an officer said. Two police officers shot McCarroll several times and the sound of the gunshots was captured by the body camera. Cops can be heard calling fro CPR and a medic. McCarroll died outside his Jennings home. 'A family lost a loved one tonight and that is tragic,' St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said during a news conference on Saturday. Police in Missouri and around the United States have been under intense pressure to be transparent about arrests and shootings ever since the death of unarmed black teen Micheal Brown.

"Nearly 500 British holidaymakers were stranded overnight on an impounded cruise ship in Lisbon harbour after its owners were served with a summons for an allegedly unpaid debt. The passengers coming towards the end of a 15 night cruise became the unwitting pawns in a legal wrangle between a former crew member and the owners of the MV Azores. The ship had been set to leave Lisbon at 7pm on Tuesday night with its 489 passengers heading back to Bristol Avonmouth after a round-trip tour that took in La Coruna in Spain, the Azores, and Madeira. But that was scuppered when lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an 'unresolved' and 'historic' financial wrangle. The harbour master then refused to let the ship leave for Bristol. Scroll down for video . Stranded: 489 British holidaymakers were stuck in Lisbon on the MV Azores (file photo) overnight after its owners were served with a summons for an allegedly unpaid debt . Stuck: They were due to leave Lisbon for Bristol at 7pm on Tuesday but lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an 'unresolved' and 'historic' financial wrangle . The ship is operated by Essex-based Cruise & Maritime Voyages. But the legal dispute was between owners Portuscale Cruise - from which they were chartering the vessel - and one of that company's former staff. The UK cruise firm, which had nothing to do with the financial wrangle, eventually came to an arrangement with Portugese authorities which allowed the ship to sail - 19 hours late - at 2pm Wednesday. It said passengers were kept informed throughout, helped with onward travel arrangements affected by the delay, and given access to a complimentary bar. One stricken passenger sent a text to a relative telling him: 'Can't believe we're stuck in Lisbon, Portugal. 'Our ship has been impounded due to an historical incident which basically means an unpaid debt.' The Madeira-registered 16,144-tonne, 525ft-long MV Azores was built in 1946. It has eight passenger decks and room for 550 passengers in its 227 cabins. Prices for the cruise range from £779 per person for a standard twin inner-cabin, to £4,159 per person for the owner's suite with an ocean view. The average price for the majority of cabins is priced at £1,500 per person. Cruise & Maritime Voyages's commercial director Chris Coates said: 'The delay of the MV Azores overnight in Lisbon related to a historic local issue with the vessel's owning company, Portuscale Cruises from whom Cruise & Maritime Voyages charter the ship using our own crew. Wrangle: The legal dispute was between owners Portuscale Cruise - from which they were chartering the vessel (file photo) - and one of that company's former staff . Going nowhere: The harbour master then refused to let the ship leave the port and passengers eventually arrived back in the UK 19 hours late . 'This dispute involved a previous crewing issue going back to 2014 and was settled first thing this morning. 'But we had to wait for the clearance documentation to be signed off by the local authorities. The ship is now heading en-route back to the UK.' He added: 'On behalf of Cruise & Maritime Voyages, I would like to extend our sincere apologises for the delay and any disruption caused.' Coates said his company, set up in 2010, carries more than 100,000 ocean and river cruise passengers a year and had 'never experienced a delay of this nature before'. Luxurious: The average price for the majority of cabins on the MV Azores is priced at £1,500 per person . The firm's online brochure says of the MV Azores: 'With her handsome profile and a traditional walk around promenade deck, the 16,144grt Portuguese registered Azores is a classic beautifully restored ocean going cruise ship carrying just 550 guests and offers a wide selection of very well appointed and comfortable public lounges and cabin accommodation spanning eight passenger decks serviced by two lifts.' It features a choice of five comfortable lounges and bars including the Calypso main show lounge, plus a nightclub, cinema, casino, shopping boutique, photo shop, library, card and bridge room, fitness and health centre with sauna and massage facilities, an unheated outdoor swimming pool and a marbled reception area. Most cabins enjoy an ocean view and all the private en-suite cabins have a bath with shower, a hairdryer and personal safe, a TV for movies and news and information channels and a fridge with a mini bar facility.","Nearly 500 British holidaymakers were stranded on the MV Azores all night .

"A new documentary about morbidly obese people has highlighted the danger of parents who enable their children’s eating habits. Susan Farmer, from Eddy, Texas, who weighs 43st (605 lbs), was told she would die unless she dropped more than half her body weight by concerned doctors. But while the 37 year old was determined to shed the weight, her mother continued to buy her daughter fatty foods. Scroll down for video . Susan Farmer, 37, from Eddy, Texas, weighs 43st (605lbs) and was told by doctors to lose half her body weight or face early death . At her heaviest, Susan weighed 43st and was unable to walk for longer than 30 seconds at a time. Speaking on the TLC show My 600lb Life, which aired at 9pm tonight, she reveals how the excess flab caused her permanent pain. She said: ‘Life is miserable, I hurt all the time.' ‘I don’t get up much with me having this big stomach, it pulls on me so bad and it feels like my skin is on fire and it’s just going to melt. ‘I have trouble breathing, especially when I’m walking and I have to take baby steps because I’m afraid of falling - if I fell, there’s nothing anybody can do for me. ‘I don’t like looking at myself so I don’t look at myself in the mirror - to me I’m fat and ugly.’ Susan regularly snacked on junk food all day to make herself feel happy . At 37 years old, Susan continues to live with her mother Nita, who dotes on her daughter and does all of her washing, cooking and cleaning. Although Nita admits that he daughter’s weight is putting her in serious danger, she appears unable to stop buying her the food that is making her fat. The pair are filmed visiting their local supermarket, where Susan says: ‘I don’t like going out much anymore. I only go out to get food or if I have to. ‘I can only walk now to get to the next place and sit down.’ After entering the store, Susan asks staff for an electric cart so she can sit on it as she browses the aisles, but is told that it is out of order. On hearing the news, she bursts into tears and says to her mother: ‘I can’t walk around this damn store. Can’t do it, I can’t walk around this f****** store.’ She heads to the nearest chair in the in-store café and sits down, refusing to move until her mother suggests putting the chair in the trolley and taking it round with them so that Susan can sit down when she needs to. But in the same breath, when Susan gets up to walk around the store, her mother asks her what type of cakes she wants to buy. In the supermarket, Susan is unable to walk for long periods of tie because of the pressure her weight puts on her knees . She is then seen piling large packets of nachos and multiple large bottles of full-fat coca cola into their shopping trolley. Back home, emotions reach breaking point and Susan is seen sobbing over how she is unable to look at herself. She says: ‘All l I see is a fat blob. I’m just disgusted at the way I look - I hate myself. ‘My weight is getting to a point where I can’t take care of myself anymore, I live with my mother and she has to take care of me most of the time.’ When the producers talk to Susan’s mother and sister it becomes clear that that a traumatic childhood was the root cause for her weight gain, but also that her mother Nita tried to make everything right in her daughter’s life by feeding her treats. Despite knowing she has an eating problem, Susan is seen piling junk food into her tolley . Nita says: ‘When Susan was about four or five years old, me and her dad started fighting a lot. ‘He was an alcoholic, he would come home drunk and somebody was going to get hit, either me or Susan. ‘When Susan would get upset, I went to the store. If she wanted candy or ice cream I’d go and buy it - food was her comfort, her way of escaping.’ The situation hit fever pitch when Susan was 17, her father came home drunk one day and started to shout at his wife, before pulling out a shotgun. Susan and her sister Stephanie stood in the middle of the pair and told their father that if he pulled the trigger, he’d end up shooting them – he left the house and her mother filed for divorce. Nita says: ‘Susan started putting on weight and she just hasn’t stopped. She just keeps getting bigger.’ In an effort to lose the pounds Susan and her mother and sister head to a hospital in Texas to try and find out if they is eligible for weight loss surgery. She is weighed for the first time in years and the scales clock in at 605 lbs. Susan is weighed at a hospital in Houston, Texas, and discovers she weights 605lbs . The Dr at the hospital tells her that she needs to lose at least 100lbs (7st) before it will be safe for her to be operated on. He tells the cameras that someone of her weight is at huge risk of respiratory failure if she goes under general anaesthetic. He adds that her mother needs to stop enabling her daughter’s food habit as it is shortening her life and recommends an extreme diet of no fat and no sugar, just fibre and protein over the next couple of months. Susan goes home and totally overhauls her diet, eating yoghurt for breakfast, eggs for lunch and salad with most meals. She also pushes herself to go outside walking around her house and reveals that after two months she is walking further than she has done in years without needing to sit down. They return to the hospital and she is told that she has lost 158lbs (11st) and now weighs 449.6 lbs (32st). Susan is approved for surgery for a gastric bypass and admitted to hospital. The surgery goes ahead successfully and Susan is told that she is expected to lose 30-40lbs in the next two months while she recuperates at home. She leaves with the use of a walking frame and head back to her home with her mother. Susan with her mother Nita, who admits she spoils her daughter too much . The next couple of months prove hard to Susan and she claims to have no strength in her legs – when she returns to the hospital to be weighed she has lost just 2lbs. She returns home under strict orders form the doctor to improve her weight loss but she collapses two weeks later and is rushed to hospital complaining of numbness in her legs. After several tests, a neurologist tells Susan that she has neuropathy – extensive nerve damage that comes from being heavily obese for an extended period of time. The symptoms are so severe that the Dr warns that she could be paralysed if she doesn’t get treatment immediately. She is admitted to rehab for a month where physiotherapists help to build up the strength in her legs. But after being discharged, her mother drives her straight to a drive-thru for some fast food. After undergoing gastric bypass surgery, Susan needs to use a walking aid . A month later she has gained 6lbs and admits to snacking on fatty foods, including chips and cupcakes. She says: ‘I cheat little but it helps me with everything going on. The key is finding balance, I just can’t overdo it.’ In an act of desperation, Susan visits a therapist to try and find out if the root cause of her inability to stop eating is her emotional damage from her childhood. During the therapy session, she asks her mother to stop babying her and allow her to cook and clean after herself. She says: ‘This is going to be hard, I’ve spent to long being dependent on others I’m afraid I can’t do it on my own, something always gives me an excuse not to. 'I just have to start doing it.' A month after the therapy visits Susan’s weight reaches 392 lbs (28st), a total loss of 215lbs (15st). Susan ends u back in hospital because of the damage her weight has done to the nerves in her legs . Susan moves out of her house and in with her brother. She does the chores around the house including the laundry, washing the dishes and tries to walk as much as possible without her walker. She says: I haven’t needed it as much as I thought. I’m slowly getting back my mobility. ‘I’ve lived so long telling myself I couldn’t’ take care of myself and living in fear and excuse. ‘For the first time in my life I feel like I’m an independent person, it has been a great feeling. ‘It feels like the whole world is opening up to me and I’m actually living life.’ After 11 months of filming she weighs 340lbs, a total weight loss of 267 lbs. She says: ‘You have to get to a place where you’re broken to be desperate enough to change.’","Susan Farmer, from Eddy, Texas, weighs 43st (605lbs)

The average Briton enjoys 884 cups of tea each year – or enough to fill two bathtubs, a survey has found . The poll also found that almost a third of women turn to a cuppa to make them feel better when they are unwell – in comparison with only 16 per cent of men. Youngsters are more likely to turn to a cuppa when they are sad, with nearly a quarter of 18 to 25s saying they put the kettle on when they are feeling down, compared with just 11 per cent of 55 and overs. And more than half of adults associated a cup of tea with ‘comfort and relaxation’ – confirming the results of a separate survey which yesterday revealed that sweet tea promotes relaxation and relieves stress. Mary Rance, chief executive of charity Contact The Elderly – which commissioned the poll and organises tea parties for older people – said: ‘This confirms that tea really is part of our national identity.

"Scientists may have captured the song of a new species of whale living in the Antarctic. The song can’t be identified and doesn’t fit the pattern of noise generated by the few known species of beaked whale, raising hopes that it could be coming from a completely new species. While beaked whales make up the second largest family of cetaceans, relatively little is known about them, mainly because they spend very little time on the water’s surface. Experts are sure the noise isn’t made by Arnoux's beaked whales or Cuvier's beaked whales (stock image), because the signal doesn’t match . There are 22 species of beaked whale and all of them are elusive deep divers, meaning that they are most often identified by their songs, which they use to navigate. The mysterious ‘Antarctic BW29 signal was recorded near the Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, and Antarctic Peninsula by scientists led by Jennifer Trickey of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, at the University of California, in La Jolla, California. They have recorded the noise more than 1,000 times to conclude that it’s unique in the composition of sounds making the signal and in timing, BBC Earth reported. ‘Given that new species of beaked whale are still being discovered, the source of these Antarctic signals might be a species that has yet to be identified,’ the study says. But the song belong to a strap-toothed whale, a southern bottlenosed whale or a Gray’s beaked whale (pictured), according to the study, despite the sound being the wrong frequency for a Gray’s beaked whale . Whale sounds are used by whales for different kinds of communication. The word 'song' is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales. Only males 'sing'. While the complex sounds of the humpback whale and some blue whales are believed to be primarily used in sexual selection, all whales use simpler sounds all year round to communicate. Whales occupying the same geographical areas, which can be vast, tend to sing similar songs with only small variations. Male humpback whales have been described as 'inveterate composers' of songs and experts have said that their songs are similar to human music in many ways. Experts are sure the noise isn’t made by Arnoux's beaked whales or Cuvier's beaked whales, because the signal doesn’t match their songs. But it could belong to a strap-toothed whale, a southern bottlenosed whale or a Gray’s beaked whale, according to the study, published in the Journal of Marine Mammal Science. It is very rare for strap-toothed wakes to be sighted as far south as the noises have been heard, while the noise is the wrong frequency for a Gray’s beaked whale, leaving the southern bottlenosed whale as the most likely match. But again there’s a problem, because the whale’s relative, the northern bottlenose whale, makes very different calls, leading experts to think that the southern species probably vocalises in a similar way – unlike the Antarctic BW29 signal. Experts have also recorded an ‘Antarctic BW37’ signal on six occasions, which is of a higher frequency. ‘It remains unknown whether this belongs to a different beaked whale species than the one producing Antarctic BW29,’ they write. Because frequency is usually linked to a whale’s size, there is a theory that the Antarctic BW29 song may be made by a southern bottlenose whale, while the higher pitched Antarctic BW37 song could be made by a smaller Gray’s beaked whale. There’s also a chance that new species of whale could sing at different frequencies, but this ability would be unique among beaked whale species. Last year, a study revealed that the shy Cuvier's beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet at 9,816ft (2,992metres) below the waves - the equivalent of just under seven Empire State Buildings - and stays below for 138 minutes . A study published last April has revealed that the shy Cuvier’s beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet. Scientists were surprised to record one of the mammal's dives, which was 9,816ft (2,992 metres) below the waves. And the whale stayed up to two miles below - around the depth of just under seven Empire State Buildings on top of one another - for 138 minutes. The New York landmark measures 1,250ft (381 metres) in height, excluding its tip. It is the first time that the diving behaviour of the species has been carefully examined and scientists are particularly interested in them because of the suspected effects of sonar - a system using transmitted and reflected underwater sound waves to detect and locate submerged objects. Marine mammal biologists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, tagged eight of the whales off San Nicholas Island in southern California and followed them for several months as they dived for food.","Antarctic song doesn't fit the pattern of noise made by beaked whales .

"A teacher who was suspended for allowing her class to write 'get well soon' letters to a convicted police killer claims the children wanted to send notes to him. Marilyn Zuniga sparked outrage for allowing her third grade class in Orange, New Jersey, to pen letters to murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal, after he collapsed in the bathroom of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. Abu-Jamal, 60, is serving a life sentence in prison after he shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in cold blood in 1981. Marilyn Zuniga apologised after she allowed her students to write to convicted police killer Mumia Abu-Jamal after he became ill while serving a life sentence in prison, but said the students wanted to write to him . Ms Zuniga has apologised for publicising the efforts of her pupils online, but said they had wanted to write to Abu-Jamal, according to philly.com. Both her pupils and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union wrote to the killer. Ms Zuniga spoke at the Orange school board after she was suspended from her position while officials investigate. She explained that she had previously asked her class to consider Abu-Jamal's quote 'So long as one just person is silenced, there is no justice.' She said when she told students the former Black Panther was ill, they had asked to write to him in prison. Ms Zuniga told the board she had made a mistake and was prepared to resign rather than be fired, to prevent damage to her career. Mumia's supporters say photos of the killer eleased this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is . Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . The letters caused many to criticize the actions of the teacher. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. He previously told Fox News: 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Abu Jamal was sentenced to life in prison after he shot Mr Faulkner in the back and then, once he was dead, in between the eyes. Abu-Jamal shot dead Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, shooting him at first in the back . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death for the killing, but this was overturned in 2012. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels which may be linked to diabetes. The killer's supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Johanna Fernandez, a professor of history at Baruch College who delivered the letters said they had made Abu-Jamal 'smile' and 'chuckle.'","Mumia Abu-Jamal was murdered Philadelphia police officer in 1981 .

"Europe's oldest McDonald's worker has celebrated his 90th birthday with colleagues. Bill Dudley is still 'lovin' it' and has no plans to quit the fast-food joint in Mold, Flintshire, north Wales. 'It helps me stay young and I just keep going,' said Bill, who has worked there for the last nine years. Bill Dudley, Europe's oldest McDonald's employee, celebrating his 90th birthday at the outlet in Mold, Flintshire, where he works two days a week . Great grandfather and Second World War veteran Bill celebrates his special with fellow employees at McDonald's in Mold. He joined the team nine years ago after growing 'bored' pottering around the house . Wife Margaret, 71, has nicknamed her hubby Old McDonald. Bill's special day on Wednesday was marked with a cake and tickets for a weekend away. McDonalds hailed the great-grandfather as 'a real asset' to the team. 'I didn't expect such a nice surprise,' Bill said. 'But I suppose it's not every day that you turn 90. 'I still enjoy working. I come here two days-a-week, which not only gets me out of the house but I honestly love it. Bill says his job 'helps me stay young and I just keep going' 'Everyone is so happy and it's nice to be part of a happy crowd. McDonald's have treated me a bit and thanks to them I will be spending a couple of nights with my wife in Beaumaris.' Prior to his current role at McDonald's, Bill, from Connah's Quay, served in the royal navy during the Second World War and was presented with the Arctic Medal by Russian premier Vladimir Putin in 2013. Having worked as a delivery boy at a bakery before war broke out, Bill went on to work at Shotton Steel, spent time as a crane driver and also ran his own taxi firm. The restaurant was adorned with balloons and decorations to mark his birthday yesterday. Stewart Williams, franchisee of McDonald's in Mold, where Bill still does six-hour shifts on Wednesdays and Thursdays each week said: 'Bill is very well respected and a real asset to us. 'He is fantastic with all the customers who love him. Some come in regularly just to see Bill. 'Bill is a great role model to our younger members of staff. He says they keep him young but he is a real character and an inspiration to everyone. 'We wouldn't want to be without him and he is welcome to work here as long as he wants.'","Bill Dudley is still 'lovin' it' working at the fast-food joint in Mold, north Wales .

"Shot dead: Carlos Manuel Perez Jr, 28, was killed by shotgun blasts from a Nevada corrections officer trying to break up a fight he was in . Nevada prison guards allegedly staged a 'gladiator-like' man-on-man fight between handcuffed inmates in the corridors of a maximum-security prison, then broke it up by opening fire with a shotgun. Carlos Manuel Perez Jr, 28, was allegedly pitted against Andrew Jay Arevalo, 24, inside High Desert State Prison in Indian Springs on November 12 of last year. After the two were left to duke it out, a lawsuit filed in state court claims, a trainee corrections officer waded in and fired off his shotgun four times in a row. The blasts killed Perez and left Arevalo with wounds to his face, according to the suit, which is seeking damages for a slew of allegations, including wrongful death and excessive force. An attorney for the Perez family said the guards knew that if they let the two prisoners - who were supposed to be kept apart - encounter one another in the halls a fight would be inevitable. Cal Potter said: 'Officers know they will see a fight if they release ad seg [administrative segregation] inmates that are supposed to be in walk-alone status.' Perez, a two-time felon, was serving a four-year sentence for hitting a man with a two-by-four, while Arevalo was serving six years for burglary. Arevalo survived the shots, despite wounds to his face. His attorney plans to file a suit soon. The suit, filed in Clark County District Court, said: 'Defendants ... refused to intervene. On the contrary (they) created a gladiator-like scenario and allowed the inmates to fight.' The lawsuit names two corrections officers and the trainee shooter by last name only. It also names as plaintiffs the state of Nevada, prisons chief Greg Cox and the warden, assistant warden and a lieutenant at High Desert State Prison. The suit alleges wrongful death; excessive force; deliberate indifference to Perez's medical needs; negligent training and supervision; and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It seeks unspecified damages, of at least $30,000. 'Gladiator fights': Pictured is High Desert State Prison in Indian Springs, Nevada, where the shooting took place . Clark County's coroner ruled Perez's death a homicide, with a March 3 finding that he died of gunshot wounds to the head, neck, chest and arms. Potter represents Perez's brother, Victor Perez, and mother, Myra Perez, both of Reno, and two children, ages 3 and 2. The lawyer said Perez's family was given conflicting statements during initial meetings with prison administrators after his death, and weren't told Perez had been shot. He said: 'They were devastated three days later when they went to the mortuary and learned that Carlos had ... multiple gunshot wounds to his face and upper body'. Deputy prisons chief Brian Connett has defended the state Department of Corrections as a responsible steward of the safety and security of guards and inmates. He said in a March 27 interview the shooting came in response to two inmates fighting at the 3,500-strong prison. He said the three corrections officers who were involved would remain on paid leave pending action by the attorney general. A statement from the prison's public information office said an investigation of the incident was in the hands of the state attorney general's office. 'The Nevada Department of Corrections does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation,' it said. Attorney General Adam Laxalt's spokeswoman, Patty Cafferata, said the attorney general was reviewing the report, received March 25. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval has said local, county and state authorities investigated the shooting, and that Laxalt will determine an appropriate course of action. His office refused further comment.","Carlos Manuel Perez, 28, allegedly made to fight Andrew Jay Arevalo, 24 .

"The slain editor of Charlie Hebdo has slammed his left-wing critics from beyond the grave for criticising publication of drawings of Mohammad. In a book Stéphane Charbonnier, known as Charb, finished just two days before being murdered by jihadist gunmen he argued that left-leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were ‘ridiculous demagogues’ for doing so. In the short book, extracts of which are to be published today in weekly magazine L'Obs, he writes: ‘The suggestion that you can laugh at everything, except certain aspects of Islam, because Muslims are much more susceptible than the rest of the population, what is that, if not discrimination? In a book Stéphane Charbonnier (pictured), known as Charb, finished just two days before being mowed down by jihadist gunmen he argued that left-leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were ‘ridiculous demagogues’ Journalists hold placards reading 'I am Charlie' as they hold a minute of silence on January 7 following the attack by gunmen in the offices of Charlie Hebdo . ‘It's time to finish with this disgusting paternalism of the white, left-wing bourgeois intellectual seeking to prove himself among the “poor unfortunate undereducated”.’ The book, Lettre Ouverte aux Escrocs de l'Islamophobie qui Font le Jeu des Racistes (Open Letter to the Fraudsters of Islamophobia who Play into Racists' Hands), which may well rock the 'Je Suis Charlie' solidarity over the massacre, argues that some intellectuals who condemned the drawings were merely attention-seekers. It says: ‘Since I am educated, I understand that Charlie Hebdo is using humour. But out of respect for you [Muslims], since you haven't yet discovered second-degree humour, I will denounce these Islamophobic drawings that I pretend not to understand. I will put myself at your level to show that I love you. ‘These ridiculous demagogues just have a huge need to be the centre of attention and want to satisfy their formidable fantasy to dominate others.’ Charb asks why Islamophobia, which technically means ‘fear of Islam’, is being used by activists, media and politicians to denounce hatred of Muslims and wonders why ‘Muslimophobia’ is not used instead, or simply ‘racism’. He argues that ‘a lot of those who campaign against Islamophobia don't actually do it to defend Muslims as individuals, but to defend Prophet Mohammad's religion’. Charlie Hebdo’s satirical attacks on Islam drove two brothers, Cherif and Said Kouachi (pictured) to mount a deadly attack on its office in Paris . Charb also takes a pop at religion, and particularly at believers. ‘The problem is not the Koran or the Bible - sleep-inducing, incoherent and badly written novels - but the faithful who read the Koran or the Bible like you read assembly instructions for Ikea shelves,’ he writes. He condemns those who are ready to ‘cut the infidel's throats along the dotted line otherwise God will deprive me of Club Med in the afterlife’, according to the Daily Telegraph. He blames the media for helping popularise the term ‘Islamophobia’ because ‘any scandal that contains the word Islam in its title sells.’ ‘A terrorist is scary, but if you add that he's an Islamist, everyone wets themselves.’ And he also takes a dig at politicians whom he accuses of seeing Muslims where they should see regular citizens, and wanting to pander to a ‘Muslim electorate’. ‘That's saying that the majority of Muslims don't decide their vote according to the candidates' political ideas but according to the degree of sympathy they display towards Muslims,’ he argues. Charb also defends Charlie Hebdo's controversial depictions of the prophet and extremism over the years, which earned it accusations of Islamophobia. Chillingly, he refers to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine which in 2013 published a list of 11 people accused of ‘crimes against Islam’ and wanted ‘dead or alive’. ‘I find my name, badly spelled but accompanied by a photo where you can recognise my alarmed face’ -- a picture he said was taken when the offices of the magazine were burnt down in 2011 shortly after a special edition was published under the title Charia Hebdo. ‘The skillful montage is titled “YES WE CAN” and below you can read: “a bullet a day keeps the infidel away”.’ Charlie Hebdo’s satirical attacks on Islam drove two brothers, Cherif and Said Kouachi to mount a deadly attack on its office in Paris. They burst into an editorial meeting on January 7, peppering Charb and nine other cartoonists with bullets before calmly leaving. They also shot dead a maintenance worker and a policeman who tried to stop them.","Stéphane Charbonnier finished a book just two days before he was killed .

"It may still be April, but Britain looks set to get an early dose of summer sun. Temperatures are due to rise throughout today peaking at 22C (72F) tomorrow. Not only will that be the warmest temperature recorded this year, but it will also surpass the average daytime temperature for August. That is 11C warmer than the UK April average and would beat the current 2015 high of 20.7C (69F) on Easter Sunday in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. The 22C (72F) predicted in the South East on Friday is also better than the 18C forecast in Marbella, 16C in Rhodes, 10C in Istanbul and 16C in Malta.

Meanwhile the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs has issued a warning to asthma sufferers of 'very high' air pollution tomorrow. Its warning for the far South East of England also states that adults and children with lung problems should avoid strenuous physical activity. Experts said locally-emitted pollution that would normally blow away will become trapped to the ground for longer, because there will be little wind. A Defra spokesman stressed the high pollution is not a direct result of the warm weather, but a mixture of factors including the arrival of Saharan dust. British Lung Foundation chief executive Penny Woods said it could 'put people living with respiratory conditions at risk of worsening symptoms'. Retailers have been stocking up on picnic food, with customers expected to head to beaches and parks for the last days of the school holidays.

Air pollution levels tomorrow are forecast to be ‘very high’ in the far South East of England - potentially putting asthma sufferers at risk. The guidance from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs affects people on the Sussex coast in towns including Hastings, Bexhill and Eastbourne. ‘Adults and children with lung problems, adults with heart problems, and older people, should avoid strenuous physical activity,' it says. Meanwhile people with asthma ‘may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often’. Defra said that conditions will see 'locally-emitted pollution become trapped to the ground, because there's not so much wind'. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'Basically we've seen local pollution and it's a mixture of that with some air coming in from the continent and a little bit of Saharan dust. It will just be on Friday that we see ""very high"" measurements, and it's due to clear up by 6am on Saturday.' Met Office meteorologist Dan Williams said: ‘We are looking at high temperatures for most days until the weekend.’ He added: ‘Friday is looking like the warmest day of the week - we may well see 21C (70F) or higher in London.’ England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each had their warmest days of 2015 over Easter, but those records could all be broken by tomorrow. The average UK temperature for April is 11.4C (52F) and for England is 12.4C (54F), according to the Met Office. Meanwhile safety charities warned people not to be tempted to swim in reservoirs or from unmonitored beaches during the warm weather. Some 400 people drown in the UK each year, the equivalent of one every 20 hours. In times of good weather drownings peak, charities said. And Morrisons said it expects barbecue essentials to fly off the shelves this weekend as the UK basks in some early spring sunshine. The Bradford-based retailer is predicting it will make and sell 1.4million fresh British beef burgers - a 30 per cent rise on last week. It also said sales of sausages made at its own manufacturing sites are expected to exceed 1million, while 1.6million burger buns will be baked. Morrisons added that this week it will sell half a million pegs and 62 miles of washing lines - enough to stretch from London to Cambridge. Waitrose said its rosé wine sales are up 24 per cent, strawberries are up 32 per cent, and a week’s worth of barbecue fuel was sold on Easter Monday. A spokesman added: ‘Shoppers are making the most of the change in temperature and stocking up on summery food and drinks.’ Reflection: A spring morning by Anish Kapoor's  Temenos sculpture, on the south bank of the Tees in Middlesbrough .

"Oklahoma introduced a law allowing it to use nitrogen gas to kill death row prisoners if lethal injections aren't available. Governor Mary Fallin signed into law a bill approving nitrogen as an alternative method of death, giving Oklahoma four different ways to enact its death penalty. The method, which involves pumping a chamber full of nitrogen and leaving a prisoner's body to die from lack of oxygen, has been touted as 'foolproof' by supporters, in the wake of the embarrassingly botched lethal injections. Scroll down for video . Gas chamber: The state of Oklahoma has legalized killing death row in-mates with nitrogen. This 1999 file photo shows an Arizona correctional officer explaining his state's execution method . Executions in the state are currently on hold while the Supreme Court ponders whether the three-drug mix now favored by Oklahoma is constitutional. The pause follows an infamous execution last ear, which saw officials struggle to administer a the poison to an inmate, who writhed on the gurney in pain for some 43 minutes before finally dying. Nitrogen - which has never been used to execute humans before - is now the state's second choice. The new bill, effective from November 2015, moves the electric chair back from second preference to third, while firing squad becomes a distant fourth choice if all other methods are unavailable. Proponents tout that nitrogen killings will be 'fast and painless' for inmates - and also say the method is 'foolproof' as it requires no medical expertise or complex procedures. In a statement issued as the bill was signed, Fallin, a Republican, said: 'Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous. 'I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard.' The bill authored by Republican Rep. Mike Christian and Republican Sen. Anthony Sykes had passed the state House on an 85-10 vote and cleared the Senate on a 41-0 vote. Christian, a former Highway Patrol trooper, said: 'The process is fast and painless - it's foolproof.' Opponents say there's no way to know whether the method is painless and effective. 'It just hasn't been tried, so we don't know,' said Rep. Emily Virgin, a Democrat from Norman who opposes the death penalty. The changes come after a botched execution last year in which Oklahoma was using a new sedative as the first in a three-drug combination. State officials tried to halt the lethal injection after the inmate writhed on the gurney and moaned. He died 43 minutes after the process began. Adam Leathers, spokesman for the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, released a statement blasting the new law. 'This is not only a grotesque waste of resources but indicative of a corrupt value system,' he said. 'It is sad to know that our State's collective bloodlust is so unabated that our leadership feels the need to spend resources to put a back up system into place so State sponsored murder can go on uninterrupted.' The problematic execution was blamed on a poorly placed intravenous line and prompted a lawsuit from Oklahoma death row inmates, who argue that the state's new drug combination presents a serious risk of pain and suffering. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments later this month. The lack of readily-available lethal injection drugs - and problems with stocks the states do have - has vexed several other states. Utah brought back the firing squad earlier this year in response to a drugs shortage, while Tennessee reinstated the electric chair.","Governor Mary Fallin signed bill allowing nitrogen execution into law .

"Thousands of people, including hundreds of school children, lined the streets of Norfolk today to wave farewell to the Light Dragoons. Around 250 men and women from the reconnaissance unit, which has most recently served in Iraq and Afghanistan, marched through the town of Dereham for the final time. They were supported by more than 4,000 well-wishers, many waving flags, who lined the streets to mark the conclusion of the regiments 15 year tenure in the county. They are set to leave Robertson Barracks in Swanton Morley this summer and move some 200 miles to their new home in Catterick, North Yorkshire. Scroll down for video .

Many of the school children who lined the streets are from military families and will be leaving their classmates to head to Yorkshire . The 250 men and women of the regiment were inspected by a number of officials, including the county's deputy lieutenant brigadier Richard Heywood . 'We've found ourselves putting some quite deep roots out here, whether it be in the local community or taking the dog for a walk on beautiful Norfolk beaches,' said Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel James Senior, according to ITV News. 'We've found a new home here so it will be a strain to leave here. But alas all good things must end and we must move onto what's next for us.' The Light Dragoons were originally mounted on fast horses and as a result were able to move quickly across the battlefield. Today, they sit on Jackal Fighting Vehicles and they are able to deploy anywhere in the world at very short notice. In 2009 the Light Dragoons were first given permission to march through Dereham with their bayonets fixed. The farewell parade through the town included military vehicles, a jet flypast and the Band of the Royal Armoured Corps. The deputy lieutenant of Norfolk, brigadier Richard Heywood, took the salute and inspected the troops. Many of the children lining the route were from military families and are also preparing to move to North Yorkshire. Showing support: Thousands of appreciative local people watched the parade, which featured more than 250 soldiers . Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel James Senior said: 'We've found a new home here so it will be a strain to leave here' The Light Dragoons will hand over their barracks to another unit in the summer after more than a decade in the town . The last parade came six years after the regiment were first given permission to march through the town with their bayonets fixed . The Light Dragoons have a proud 300 year history that has seen them take part in the Jacobite Rebellions, in the Waterloo Campaign, charge down the Valley of Death at the Battle of Balaclava, and be one of the first ashore at D Day. More recently,  the regiment was deployed to Iraq in 2003 to assist with the stabilisation of the country after Saddam Hussein's regime was toppled. They returned again in 2005 to battle counter insurgency and assist with the training of the Iraqi police force. In Afghanistan the regiment were involved in numerous operations to rid the country of the Taliban, as well as assisting with the creation and training of the Afghan Army.

"The number of hayfever sufferers in the UK is predicted to reach 20 million this summer, up a third from last year as warm weather bathes the country. For many, the glorious sunshine and promise of temperatures warmer than the Mediterranean this week will come as a welcome relief. But for millions, the  first tentative steps towards summer brings impending misery as a dreaded cloud of invisible pollen descends. Experts told MailOnline that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms  - which include streaming eyes, incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat - for the first time. Around 20 million people in the UK are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year, experts told MailOnline . And by 2030 that figure is expected to surge to 31.8 million sufferers. Dr Jean Emberlin, a leading pollen expert, told MailOnline that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hayfever this year could occur, 'depending on weather conditions'. She said: 'If we get prolonged periods of warm, dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between, which helps the grass to keep growing, we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts. 'Grass is the main culprit pollen for hayfever in the UK. 'High and very high pollen counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before. She added: 'In addition, the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution, which can make symptoms worse, and again lead them to occur in people who have been symptom free before.' In addition, she said pollen is becoming more potent, and greater numbers of plants giving off the allergens is also contributing to a rising number of sufferers. Dr Emberlin said another contributing factor is that the average hayfever season is becoming longer, typically stretching from April to the end of August. She added: 'There is substantial evidence from pollen monitoring records and from vegetation surveys to show that the timing of some of the pollen seasons has been changing in the UK and across Europe over the last few decades. Hayfever seasons in the UK are becoming longer, as warmer weather in spring and autumn means pollen is typically rife from March to the end of August . 'In addition there has been a trend to longer pollen seasons and increasing pollen loads of some types. 'Globally, average surface temperatures have increased by about 0.7°C over the past 100 years, leading to earlier plant growth in many regions. 'The trend towards warming has been more pronounced in winter months, resulting in more changes in the timing of spring pollen seasons than those of summer and autumn.' Hayfever is an allergic reaction to pollen and spores. It happens when the immune system mistakes these harmless airborne particles to be a danger and launches a defence against them. The body produces an antibody and histamine is released which causes the typical symptoms of sneezing, runny nose and eyes, an itching nose and mouth, and possibly a blocked nose. The allergy is a seasonal one, triggered by a range of different pollens ranging from tree to grass, weeds to fungal spores. By 2030, Dr Emberlin predicts there will be 31.8 million sufferers as the situation will worsen. 'As summers become warmer more photochemical smogs will occur on dry days resulting in an increased frequency of days with high concentrations of ozone, NOx and other pollutants that will make symptoms worse, and that will make people more susceptible to allergens,' she said. 'Due to climate change in the future, plant growth may be influenced in a way that more, new and altered pollens are produced, which may affect humans.' Dr Emberlin, speaking on behalf of Opticrom Hayfever Eye Drops, warned the season is expected to start suddenly with pollen counts surging from almost nothing to very high in a matter of days. Friday is set to be the hottest day of the year so far, with the mercury poised to rise steadily to reach 21°C in parts of southern England. In preparation, hayfever sufferers are being encouraged to take action, stocking up on antihistamines and other treatments to lessen the impact of their symptoms. 'It is very important to know the seasons, when it is likely to peak and the days when pollen levels will be particularly high. 'Knowing when the season is about to start means there is lots a person can do. 'If you are not sure of the best treatment you can speak to your pharmacist or GP. 'Steroids are often used to treat hayfever, but they are best taken before the onset of symptoms. Dr Jean Emberlin said: High and very high pollen (pictured under the microscope) counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before' 'Antihistamines are also commonly used and it is a good idea to get them in and ready to use when the season starts. 'If you have got a big event, like exams or a wedding coming up you can ask your GP to prescribe a short course of steroid tablets to keep symptoms at bay. 'There are lots of options available, the key is just to be organised and ensure you are prepared. 'On days you know the pollen count is high make sure you take antihistamines before you leave the house, and wear sunglasses to keep pollen out of your eyes. 'Make sure you wash your clothes regularly and don't sleep with the window open.' Dr Emberlin said pollen counts can suddenly surge if conditions are right. 'A warm day with a slight breeze can signal the perfect conditions for spores to infest the air, causing pollen levels to surge,' she warned.","Last year 15 million people fell victim to the symptoms of hayfever .
This year that number is expected to rise by a third to 20 million .
Experts told MailOnline warmer weather can result in very high pollen counts which trigger symptoms in new sufferers .
High temperatures also increase air pollution, which worsen symptoms ."
"A shocking 'resurrection ceremony' for a  two-year-old dead boy at a Texas church has been caught on camera. In the clip capturing the attempted resurrection, the boy identified by a witness as Benjamin, is being held in the arms of Texas pastor's wife Aracely Meza as others, including a man who appears to be her husband Pastor Daniel Meza, are gathered around. The witness, who said she knew Benjamin's mother since she was pregnant with him, said the child was possessed by demons, according to pastors. A shocking 'resurrection ceremony' for a two-year-old dead boy at a Texas church has been caught on camera. Aracely Meza, who is reportedly not the child's mother, was arrested on Monday and has been charged with injury to a child by omission, said police (above Meza in the video) In the video, Aracely Meza is seen next to a man who appears to be her husband Pastor Daniel Meza, as she uses oils and prays while trying to bring the boy, identified by a witness as Benjamin, back to life (above scenes from the attempted resurrection) Aracely Meza (above), has been arrested in the case involving an attempt to resurrect a two-year-old boy at a home operating also as a church . She also said he went 25 days without food before he died. In the footage, Meza apparently uses oils to try and bring him back to life while also praying and speaking in tongues during the 'rising ceremony' lasting for hours. She also invokes Jesus to give life to the child. Meza, who is reportedly not the child's mother, was taken into custody on Monday and Balch Springs police said she has been charged with injury to a child by omission, according to NBCDFW. She is currently being held on a $100,000 bond, a police spokesman told Daily Mail Online, and more information will be available on Tuesday. Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs to do a welfare check and were told by residents that a two-year-old child had died and a 'rising ceremony' was performed, according to CBS. A report from earlier this month said that services took place at the residence on Duke Drive which also operated as Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church with services presided by Daniel and Aracely Meza (both pictured above) The ceremony held at the residence on Duke Drive was an attempt to resurrect the child, police claimed, and took place on March 22. Meza and her husband are pastors who presided over the church services held at the residence  and also lives there along with other families including that of the two-year-old boy, according to WFAA. In a report earlier this month, neighbors told WFAA that cars would fill the street for services, presided by the Mezas, but that no one knew what was happening inside of the home operating also as Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church. 'When it was church hours they would set it up as a church, then when it was over, back to a home,' neighbor Bryan Cruz told WFAA who grew up with the children in the home. A witness said  Benjamin was possessed by demons, according to pastors. She also said he had went 25 days without food before he died . Members of the Igelisa Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church re-enact a scene from the crucifixion which on Facebook was titled as 'Drama Crucifixion & Resurrección Pascua 2014' The home was not registered or zoned to operate as a church, code inspectors for the city said, however its website states the national headquarters are at the home's address. In an earlier report, Lt Mark Maret told CBS: 'We don't know if this was to try and resurrect the spirit of the child and we don't know if this was to try and resurrect the child themselves or what exactly that service or ceremony encompasses.' Unconfirmed reports have suggested that the two-year-old boy, whose name is unknown and who neighbors had not seen, may have died either of starvation or of a fall from a chair. Emergency services do not appear to have called until police received an anonymous tip four days later. Police said there is no record of the child’s death being reported. The child's parents took the body to Mexico the following day. Two phone numbers for the single-story home were disconnected. Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs, Texas, (pictured) to do a wellness check and were told that a two-year-old child had died and the body returned to Mexico. Police were now investigating . A neighbor told Daily Mail Online earlier this month that five children under the age of ten, both boys and girls, were also living at the home and had been taken away by Child Protective Services. Joy Donaldson said that she once complained to the woman who lived at the home about two of the boys, who had been bothering her dogs. The woman, whose name she did not know, told her that the children did not know any better 'because they had been taken off the streets of Mexico'. A second neighbor, Jean Turnipseed, told Daily Mail Online that she had heard  that church services were taking place at the home on Saturdays and Sunday nights, where people were being charged at the door. An investigation is underway involving both state and federal authorities.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Police in upstate New York determined that a suspicious package that sparked an hours-long lockdown Monday at Hamilton College did not pose any threat. The liberal arts college in Clinton sent out four alerts in the span of an hour urging students and staff to shelter in place, lock doors, draw curtains and stay away from windows. Campus officials said a bomb threat and the threat of a shooting at the recently renovated Kirner-Johnson Building were received by phone at 9.45am. On lockown: Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, was placed on lockdown this morning in response to a bomb threat and reports of a possible shooter on campus . Red flag: Campus officials said someone called in a bomb threat and the threat of a shooting at Kirner-Johnson Building before 10am Monday .

Initially, only a part of the campus was placed on lockdown, but it was later extended to the entire school. A bomb squad from Albany arrived on campus at around 2.30pm to investigate a suspicious package that has been discovered at the Kirner-Johnson building. Katey Hopper, a student at Hamilton who is the sister of a Daily Mail Online manager, said in an email that the person who called in the threat this morning mentioned multiple bombs. The college senior told Daily Mail that police have located one suspicious package that was described as being 'larger than a purse.' By 3.30pm, officers examined the item found at the Kirner-Johnson building and found it to be harmless. They also investigated another item discovered nearby as a precaution and were conducting a second security sweep. Ms Hopper, a field hockey player at Hamilton, said the unidentified suspect allegedly told school officials he or she would shoot any student seen walking around campus, but no gunman has been seen. Police  evacuated McEwen, Milbank, Babbitt, Cafe Opus and Schambach buildings while K-9 units were brought it to search the campus. Students and staff were being asked not to use Martin's Way, but to leave campus via Green Apple Way to the Field House. Ms Hopper, who has been on lockdown on the north side of the campus for more than four hours, said her fellow students and staff were 'on edge' but did not feel an imminent threat.

"Their parents came to the U.S. for opportunities and now these four teens have them in abundance. The high-achieving high schoolers  have each been accepted to all eight Ivy League schools: Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Yale University. And as well as the Ivy League colleges, each of them has also been accepted to other top schools. While they all grew up in different cities, the students are the offspring of immigrant parents who moved to America - from Bulgaria, Somalia or Nigeria. And all four - Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana, Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and Harold Ekeh from New York - say they have their parents' hard work to thank. Now they hope to use the opportunities for good - whether its effecting positive social change, improving education across the world or becoming a neurosurgeon. The teens have one more thing in common: they don't know which school they're going to pick yet. The daughter of Somali immigrants who has already received a U.N. award and wants to improve education across the world . Star pupil: Munira Khalif, from St. Paul, Minnesota, says she has always been driven by the thought that her parents, who left Somalia during the civil war, fled to the U.S. so she would have better opportunities . Munira Khalif, who attends Mounds Park Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota, was shocked when she was accepted by eight Ivy Schools and three others - but her teachers were not. 'She is composed and she is just articulate all the time,' Randy Comfort, an upper school director at the private school, told KMSP. 'She's pretty remarkable.' The 18-year-old student, who was born and raised in Minnesota after her parents fled Somalia during the civil war, she said she was inspired to work hard because of the opportunities her family and the U.S. had given her. 'The thing is, when you come here as an immigrant, you're hoping to have opportunities not only for yourself, but for your kids,' she told the channel. 'And that's always been at the back of my mind.' As well as achieving top grades, Khalif has immersed herself in other activities both in and out of school - particularly those aimed at doing good. She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13. Incredible: Munira, pictured speaking at Malala Day at the UN, hopes to study political science at college . High achiever: She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13 . She launched a non-profit group, Lighting the Way, to make education more accessible for East African youth, especially girls, through scholarships, libraries and improving sanitation issues. And she was also appointed as A World at School Global Youth Ambassador to promote universal education. Khalif, who plans to study political science at college, said she has yet to decide where to go and plans to visit a few more campuses before she makes her final decision. As well as the Ivy League schools, she also received offers from Stanford, Georgetown and the University of Minnesota - and she's still letting the realization sink in. 'I was very surprised,' she said. 'I am humbled to even have the opportunity to choose amongst these schools because they are all incredible places to learn and grow.' The Bulgarian housekeeper's son who couldn't speak English a decade before he was accepted to 18 top schools in the U.S. Driven: Stefan Stoykov cried on his first day of school because he could not speak a word of English but he is now a straight-A student committed to helping other pupils with language barriers . When eight-year-old Stefan Stoykov moved from his family's one-bedroom apartment in Bulgaria to the U.S. after his parents won a green card lottery, he could not speak a word of English. 'I started crying on the first day of class,' Stefan recalled of his first day in the second grade. 'I was scared. I was scared. I didn't understand what was going on around me.' But now 18 and a senior at North Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, he has been accepted into some of the finest schools in the world - and he admits he can hardly believe it. 'It is an incredible feeling,' Stefan told WTHR. 'I never knew that I would have a chance to choose from possibly the best schools from the world. 'I was hoping to get into at least one of the Ivy Leagues.' But as well as getting offers from all Ivy League schools, 10 other prestigious institutions also came knocking. He has yet to decide where he will go. He revealed that hard work and the support of his mother, a housekeeper, had helped him achieve his goals. Shortly after arriving in the U.S., his parents divorced and his father took a job as a truck driver, and he has not seen him much since. Impressive: Despite his early struggles at school, he said he knew that he had to make the most of the opportunities he had been given by his parents when they moved him from Bulgaria to the U.S. 'My parents had done so much to put me in this position, to put me in the United States of America,' he said. 'And I had to take advantage of that. I had to do something with the opportunities they gave me.' Stefan's extracurricular activities include tutoring other students with language barriers, running the cycling club and Spirit Week and joining the stock market club, the Indy Star reported. He is also valedictorian and secured a perfect SAT score by borrowing test guides from the library. He also helps his mother - who spent much of his childhood working so that she could support him - with her housekeeping duties so that it takes her half the time. The son of a Nigerian immigrant who dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon . Hard worker: Victor Agbafe, 17, says he believes his Nigerian immigrant mother set a good example for him in her job as a physician. He now hopes to study microbiology  with government or economics . Victor Agbafe, a student at Cape Fear Academy in Wilmington, North Carolina, has no idea where he will attend college, but he's certain on one thing: he wants to become a neurosurgeon. The 17-year-old was accepted to 14 schools in total, including all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford and Duke. Agbafe, who plans to double major in microbiology along with government or economics, called his acceptance achievement an 'amazing opportunity', WSOC reported. Just before he played a game for his school's basketball team, he learned that Harvard had made a decision about his application - but he waited until the game was over to find out. 'I owed it my teammates to be focused there,' he said. 'I didn't want to get too low on myself if I didn't get in. I also didn't want to get too high if I was accepted.' Going places: The teenager from Wilmington, North Carolina says he plans to visit as many campuses as he can before he makes his final decision by May 1. He hopes to become a neurosurgeon . He has also been part of North Carolina's Youth and Government program, where he was chosen as Speaker of the House. He says his mother, a Nigerian immigrant and physician, set a good example for him - but she refuses to take the credit. 'For God to crown his effort with success is just something that is just beyond me,' his mother Dorothy Agbafe-Mosley said. 'I am very happy that he has all these choices to make. But then it also makes it difficult because it's a lot of good schools. A lot of good schools.' Her son will make a decision later this month after visiting as many campuses as possible. The Nigerian student who credits his Target employee parents with his success . Top student: Harold Ekeh, from Long Island, New York, has been accepted to 14 colleges in total . Ten years after his family moved him from Nigeria to the U.S., Harold Ekeh is hoping to do something for them in return. The 18-year-old Long Islander was accepted by 14 colleges - including all Ivy League schools - and now hopes to study neuroscience to cure Alzheimer's, the disease his grandmother suffers from. The straight-A student at Elmont Memorial High School secured an SAT score of 2270. He also worked as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations. But he wasn't expecting to get into so many top schools. As well as offers from the Ivy League colleges, he was also accepted by Johns Hopkins, NYU, MIT, Vanderbilt, and SUNY Stony Brook. 'It was crazy,' he told DailyMail.com. 'My mom was sat next to me and it was just letter after letter after letter. I couldn't believe it.' Afterwards 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect,' he said. Devoted: He hopes to study neuroscience and find a cure for Alzheimer's, which his grandmother suffers from . He said it was the resilience of his parents, former Target clerks Paul and Roseline Ekeh, that gave him the drive to achieve the best. 'It was such a huge thing for my parents to uproot our family, a family of six, from our home to a new country,' he said. 'I was worried as a kid about speaking with an American accent, but they had to worried about actually finding jobs. They joked that they came over for the 24-hour electricity. But I know it was so we would have opportunities as children. 'No matter how many times they got knocked down, they stayed positive, and kept telling me that the secret to success in unbridled resolve.' He said he is leaning towards going to Yale but will be visiting a few more campuses before making his decision before May 1.","Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana, Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and Harold Ekeh from New York got multiple offers .

"It sparked a hate campaign and was dubbed so terrifying, it was nicknamed Scary Lucy. And now even the sculptor of the I Love Lucy statue in Celoron, New York, has called it 'by far my most unsettling sculpture' and six years after it was unveiled has pledged to make a new one for free. But the statue of Lucille Ball - which was so offensive a Facebook page called We Love Lucy! Get Rid Of This Statue was launched - isn't the only offensive artwork that has missed the mark. Scroll down for video . Residents of Celoron, New York, were understandably disturbed when this statue of Lucille Ball was unveiled in 2009 sparking a Facebook campaign to get it removed, which attracted 600 likes . A whole host of ugly effigies have made appearances around the world in the form of waxworks, tribute statues and incredibly crude carvings. Take, for example, the Louis Tussaud's Waxwork Museum in Ontario Canada, which was bought to the world's attention in January after TV presenter Jonathan Ross posted pictures of the works online. Its website boasts: ‘Louis Tussaud's Waxworks is a collection of instantly recognizable, true-to-life wax figures crafted by recognized wax artists from around the world.’ Jennifer Garner does not seem herself in this warped wax version of her character in the television series Alias which appears at the Hollywood Waxworks in Los Angeles . This figure of Jack Sparrow seems a little polished as he shows off uncharacteristically glossy locks . However Ross seemed to be in disagreement in one tweet he wrote: ‘It's almost like Canada want to start a war. Here's the Queen...’ with a picture of a waxwork with only the faintest passing resemblance to her Majesty. And Louis Tussaud's waxwork museum in Great Yarmouth, which closed in October 2012, was described as the world's worst waxworks museum because so many of its models looked nothing like the people they were supposed to represent. His museums are not connected to his great-grandmother's Madame Tussauds waxwork museums. However, the famous Madame Tussaud's is not exempt from critisicim either. This enormous effigy of Colin Firth as Mr Darcy was erected in London's Serpentine in 2013 . However it bore little resemblance to the iconic image from Pride and Prejudice . American talks show host Jay Leno is unrecognisable as his waxwork in Louis Tussaud's Waxworks Museum, which comedian Jonathon Ross openly mocked on Twitter at the beginning of this year . This statue of Andy Murray was unveiled in Shanghai in October 2011 complete with warrior clothing, although Andy doesn't appear thrilled the stern likeness is uncanny . In November last year the house of wax in Berlin unveiled a figure of 22-year-old Selena Gomez, however fans were shocked when the museum appeared to have aged her by ten years. It took a team of 20 artists four months to create the dummy, showing the songstress dressed in a pair of leather hot pants and sheer blouse - an outfit she wore at a gig in London in September 2014. In 2011 Madame Tussaud's unveiled a Justin Bieber waxwork which was criticised for not looking anything like the pop star who was then 17. Bieber worked closely with the team . who created his waxwork, giving sittings in New York last year. And . stylists teamed up with Bieber's personal stylist to ensure his . once legendary hairstyle was the exact replica of the original cut. But after turning 17 two weeks earlier, the singer - much to the dismay of fans - had his hair cut. And the star was also taller than his wax figurine making for a far off likeness. However, Selena Gomez's figure is positively uncanny compared to some celebrity tributes. Here we showcase the very worst. Even the famous Madame Tussaud's occasionally gets it wrong with J-Lo looking a little worse for wear . In 2008 this golden statue of British model Kate Moss was unveiled by artist Marc Quinn other than the unsettling eyes, Kate isn't famed for being a contortionist... Johnny Depp seems to be unable to disguise his giggles while unveiling this statues in Serbia in 2013 . Madame Tussaud's came under fire for their depiction of singer Selena Gomez in November 2014 when their wax depiction of the 22-year-old seemed to have aged by about ten years . Fans were stunned when the 2011 waxwork was unveiled at Madame Tussauds as it bore no likeness to him . This stone statue of Princess Diana was created in India in 2004 but is hardly a chip off the old block . Julia Roberts looks anything other than a Pretty Woman in this wax work figure .","A statue of Lucille Ball in Celeron, New York was dubbed so offensive the artist has offered to fix the statue for free .

"Hilary Border, 54, stole £20,000 from her dementia-stricken mother, pictured outside Nottingham Crown Court . A 'wicked' daughter who stole £20,000 from her dementia-stricken mother and spent it on herself instead of paying care home fees has been spared jail. Hilary Border, 54, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, had power of attorney over her 83-year-old mother Dorothy's affairs when her health deteriorated. The mother-of-three was required to pay £300-a-week for the 83-year-old's care but when it doubled to £600 the money was either late or stopped being paid at all. Care home staff tried to contact Border over an outstanding £16,000 debt over two years before reporting her to police. She pleaded  guilty to fraud on the basis she took £20,000 between October 2012, and November 20 last year, despite the fact that prosecution said it was £39,500. Border was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for two years, at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday. Judge Andrew Hamilton said: 'You stole money from your mum. You were trusted to be her power of attorney to deal with her money. 'It was wicked to steal from someone who was in a care home. 'The owners of the care home seem to have taken pity on your mum. Others might not have been so charitable. 'She has dementia and doesn't appreciate the wickedness of her daughter, how you have betrayed her trust and stolen her money.' Border was also made subject of an eight-month home curfew and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. The court heard Border's mother suffered from angina, sclerosis of the liver and seriously low blood pressure. Defence attorney Ian Way said Border had taken a small amount of money to ease financial pressures in her own life and the fraud had then escalated. He added: 'She is 54, of good character. 'She is thoroughly ashamed for what she has done and full of self-loathing..' Border was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for two years, at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) yesterday .","Hilary Border, 54, pleaded guilty to fraud and has been spared jail .

"When it comes to DIY stereotypes suggest that men are more adept than women. But new research has revealed that females may actually be better at mastering the use of tools - at least among chimpanzees. Researchers have found that female chimps are more likely to use the tools to help them hunt for food while males tend to prefer capturing prey with their hands. Scroll down for video . Primatologists at Iowa State University recorded 300 hunts by chimps in Fongoli, Sénégal, and found female chimps were using tools to capture prey in 60 per cent of the observations. This female chimp has stripped a stick of leaves and uses it to flush out a bush baby from a hollow tree trunk . While the findings may provoke some to reassess their view of the opposite sex, the research may also provide tantalising hints at how humans first learned to use weapons to hunt. It suggests that early female humans were perhaps the first to begin fashioning simple tools to help them catch prey. It has been known that chimpanzees use tools like humans for more than 50 years. In 1960, Jane Goodall witnessed two chimps using twigs to fish for termites in the ground. This was the first time that an animal was observed to make a tool and use it for a specific purpose, other than humans. It was later found that the Gombe chimps use twigs, leaves and rocks in nine different ways to feed, drink, clean themselves, reach other objects and to fashion weapons. In communities outside Gombe National Park, communities make different tools. Chimpanzees make sponges by chewing leaves and dipping them into puddles of water so they can use them as drinking vessels. They have been observed using sticks and rocks to smash fruit and shells. Adult males sometimes hurl rocks and sticks like make-shift spears to intimidate rivals. This study said that chimps use  shoots from Alchornea hirtella to hunt aggressive army ants in a specific way. It is thought that the behaviour is passed from one generation to the next and is learned by young chimpanzees. Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Dr Jill Pruetz, a primatologist at Iowa State University said: 'Savannah-dwelling chimpanzees at Fongoli, Sénégal, are the only non-human population known to systematically hunt vertebrate prey with tools. 'Acquiring vertebrate prey via tool use at Fongoli supports the hypothesis that early hominins intensified their tool technology to overcome environmental pressures and that even the earliest hominins were probably sophisticated enough to fashion tools for hunting. 'The behaviour of these chimpanzees demonstrates that hunting is less adult male-biased among our closest living relatives than previously believed when tools are used. 'If tool use enabled early hominins to reduce the need for physical characteristics (i.e. greater size, strength) to achieve hunting efficiency, such sexual dimorphism ultimately becomes less important regarding prey acquisition.' Scientists first reported chimps using spear-like sticks to hunt prey at Fongoli in Senegal in 2007, and it was later filmed by the BBC in their hugely successful natural history series Life Story. Over the following years Dr Pruetz and her team have recorded 308 hunts using tools. Tools tended to be used when the chimps were hunting bush babies, called Galago. When Dr Pruetz and her colleagues analysed the hunts they had recorded, however, they found that more of them tended to be carried out by female chimps. The findings were surprising as most hunting behaviour is conducted by males and overall they account for 70 per cent of all prey captured. The chimps at Fongoli in Senegal (shown above) are the only animals to regularly hunt for prey with tools. Scientists first reported chimps using spear-like sticks to hunt prey at Fongoli in Senegal in 2007, and it was later filmed by the BBC in their hugely successful natural history series Life Story . Researchers observed more female chimps using broken sticks like above to help them capture prey. However, the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands . However, the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands. Females carried out 61 per cent of the hunts using tools. They found that even in hunts involving tools, male chimps would often capture prey driven into their hands by those wielding tools. Dr Pruetz added: 'What would often happen is the male would be in the vicinity of another chimp hunting with a tool, often a female, and the bush baby was able to escape the female and the male grabbed the bush baby as it fled.' She added: 'It's just another example of diversity in chimp behavior that we keep finding the longer we study wild chimps.' Other groups of chimpanzees have been seen to use tools in other ways to help them gather hard to reach food - such as using sticks to 'fish' for termites. Again these activities tend to be dominated by females, but Dr Pruetz said it could not be easily compared to the hunting behaviour seen at Fongoli. She said: 'Fishing for termites is a very different activity than jabbing for a bush baby.' Tool use by chimpanzees is now considered to be fairly widespread with many groups having been observed using stones or sticks to crack open nuts, fish for termites and in some cases to capture small mammals . 'With fishing, termites grab on to a twig and don't let go and the chimp eats the termites off the twig. 'When hunting, the bush baby tries to bite, escape or hide from the chimp. The chimps are really averse to being bitten by a bush baby.' Instead she believes there is something very specific about the open Savannah environment compared to forests that has driven the chimps living at Fongoli to use tools in this way. She said that hunting bush babies with tools may be a way of allowing them to get access to a highly nutritious food source without having to chase down their prey. Something similar may have happened with early humans as their environment changed to become more Savannah like. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'The Savannah environment might be viewed as the catalyst for tool-assisted hunting by Savannah chimpanzees in Sénégal in that apes here exploit prey that is largely ignored by forest-dwelling chimpanzees. 'Chimpanzees' preferred prey at other sites, the red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus badius) is absent in the dry, open Savannah-woodland at Fongoli. 'Galago hunting at Fongoli represents a high-energy, low-risk resource that members of various age–sex classes can take advantage of, similar to what is observed among tool-equipped human hunters. 'Additionally, typical adult male chimpanzee arboreal hunting behaviour was unlikely to be characteristic of early bipedal hominins given the latter's anatomical differences with living apes. 'With such anatomical changes in our lineage, tool use probably became increasingly important to hunting behaviour.'","Researchers recorded chimps hunting with tools at Fongoli in Sénégal .
Tool use was spotted on 300 occasions and 60% was by females .
Male chimps did more hunting but tended to capture prey with their hands .
The findings may provide clues as to how humans first learned to use tools ."
"A police officer feared for his life when he fired the final shots in a barrage of bullets that killed two unarmed suspects, a court has heard. Michael Brelo, 31, made his first appearance in court in Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. Brelo's attorney Patrick D'Angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that Brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' vehicle. But Brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in November 2012 had ample reason to believe that Russell and Williams were shooting at them, he said. Self defense? Michael Brelo's attorney opened the case insisting the 31-year-old (pictured today) had reason to believe he was being shot at when he jumped on the car and shot dead Timothy Russell and Melissa Williams . D'Angelo said he wasn't calling what Brelo and the other officers did that night heroic. 'They are simple, ordinary people who try to do the best they can and are put in very dangerous situations,' he said. Brelo, charged with voluntary manslaughter, is the only officer charged because prosecutors said he waited until after the initial salvo had ended to reload and discharge the last of the 49 rounds he fired that night. A judge will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Rick Bell revealed that experts have concluded that another officer fired three rounds during Brelo's 15-shot volley, something defense attorneys have argued in motions. Bell said a medical examiner has concluded that Brelo fired 'kill shots' into Russell and Williams and that they were still alive when Brelo fired from the top of a police cruiser and the trunk of the Malibu, striking Williams 11 times and Russell six times, when they were no longer a threat to anyone. Brelo fired out of a sense of rage and vengeance after he and his partner became one of the first cars to join what would be a 19-mile chase on city streets and freeways with speeds reaching 100 mph, Bell said. Cleveland officer Michael Brelo is facing charges after two unarmed suspects were killed in this Chevy Malibu . Malissa Williams (left) and Timothy Russell (right) were both unarmed when they were killed in November 2012 . The prosecutor criticized Brelo and others for violating departmental policies that required permission to chase a suspect vehicle. More than 100 Cleveland police officers in five dozen cars were involved in the chase at some point. 'His pursuit of 22 minutes described the final outcome,' Bell said of Brelo. 'He should have never been in that position to begin with.' D'Angelo argued that Officer Wilfredo Diaz, who fired the initial rounds after Russell drove the Malibu toward him, could have killed Russell and Williams. Those shots prompted other officers to begin firing because they believed Russell and Williams were shooting at them. 'These officers were scared to death,' D'Angelo said. 'They thought they were in a gun battle.' The car was strafed by police gunfire after a high-speed chase over streets and freeways in and around Cleveland. When Brelo was questioned by investigators two weeks after the shooting, he told them he didn't recall what happened. He said: 'It's possible because I was so terrified that I was going to get run over.' 'But I don't recall that, sir.' Rookie officer Brian Sabolik  who was assigned to the same district as Brelo, told investigators he stopped firing after 'someone' jumped on the hood of the Malibu. Photos released by the Office of the Ohio Attorney General show a Cleveland cruiser sitting next to the Chevy . Officer Sabolik said he later learned it was Brelo. Asked how he found out, Sabolik said: 'Because [Brelo] was talking about it.' While Brelo claimed not to remember jumping on the hood, prosecutors have evidence to show that he did. Investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation found footprints on the hood of the Malibu that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar. Brelo is currently suspended. A judge - not a jury - will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. Brelo's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful. The threat from the pair didn't end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon, according to his defense. Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times. The chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he'd lost sight of the vehicle. Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired. Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase. Brelo and his partner were two of the first officers to join the pursuit that ultimately included more than 60 police cars, 104 officers and reached at least 100mph. In this forensics picture, bullet trajectories from the deadly shooting are marked off on the Chevy Malibu . Investigators found footprints on the hood of the Malibu (left) that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car (right) that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar . After driving into a school parking lot more than 20 minutes after the chase began, Russell turned the car around and tried to flee again - sideswiping a cruiser before coming to a stop. Another officer, who said he feared for his life, opened fire, prompting others including Brelo to do the same. Brelo and his partner fired 15 rounds through their own windshield and told investigators they saw dark objects in Russell's and Williams' hands. Brelo said he left his cruiser because he said he was afraid the Malibu would hit him, even though he then crossed in front of the car to climb on top of another cruiser and open fire again. He told investigators: 'I had leapt trying to get out of the way of this car so it doesn't run me over and kill me.' Investigators eventually concluded that neither Russell nor Williams had a gun. An exhaustive search was conducted along the route of the pursuit, including the use of a dive team to look in bodies of water, but no gun was ever found. Regardless of the trial's outcome, the after-effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come. The incident helped spur a US Justice Department probe that concluded Cleveland police officers have shown a pattern and practice of using excessive force. The city and federal authorities are negotiating a consent decree to reform the police department that will cost the city millions of dollars to implement and enforce. Cleveland has already paid $3million to the families of Russell and Williams to settle a lawsuit.","Cleveland, Ohio, officer Michael Brelo is facing two counts of manslaughter .

"A former TV pitchman in Utah known for his over-the-top personality pleaded guilty to harassing a barn owl in flight while on a motorized paraglider. Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze, 45, was sentenced to one year of probation on Friday after pleading guilty to two misdemeanor counts, knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. His admission of guilt follows a plea deal that fell through on Thursday after he refused to admit to the 2011 crime which he said makes him look like an evil, horrible person. However, he returned to a federal court on Friday to plead guilty. Schanze was scheduled to go to trial on April 20 and would have faced a maximum of one year in federal prison and more than $100,000 in fines if convicted. Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze arrives for a court appearance at the federal courthouse on Thursday, April 9, 2015 in Salt Lake City where a plea deal fell through because he refused to admit to the 2011 crime. On Friday, he returned to the court to plead guilty . On Friday, Schanze pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts, knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird . 'There was no plea agreement, and federal prosecutors made no concessions to Schanze as a part of his guilty plea to both counts,' according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office, KSL reported. The charges, filed in October 2014, came after a federal investigation into a video that surfaced online in 2013. It appeared to show a paraglider near Utah Lake kicking a soaring owl and boasting about it. In a statement released from the attorney's it said Schanze will forfeit an orange parasail as a substitute asset for the paraglider involved in the illegal conduct. 'Judge Benson also ordered him not to land a paraglider in a federally designated Wilderness Area or in any area closed to motorized access by a federal agency,' the statement said. On Thursday, Schanze who is known in Utah for his shrill, hyperactive TV commercials for his Totally Awesome Computers retail chain, yet again turned a court hearing into a spectacle. It started when he arrived about five minutes late and entered court wearing dark sunglasses, a tight-fitting black turtleneck, tennis shoes and a fanny pack. When U.S. District Judge Dee Benson began reading through the plea deal, Schanze answered 'yes sir' to the first few questions but then balked after Benson asked him if it was true that he knowingly harassed the owl in 2011. Schanze was sentenced to one year of probation and has to forfeit an orange parasail as a substitute asset for the paraglider involved in the illegal conduct (above Schanze pictured in May 2006) Schanze responded 'No sir.' 'I'm going to go out on a limb here, what part isn't true?' Benson said. 'Pretty much all of it, but I'm willing to plea to it if we can finish this today,' Schanze said. The judge explained to Schanze that he could not accept a plea deal without an admission to the facts. His attorney, Kent Hart, spoke with him several times and the judge at one point brought both attorneys to the bench. 'Do you not see the conundrum?' Schanze told the judge. 'I'm not an evil, horrible guy and I'm not going to lie.' Schanze never budged refusing to accept the facts, and Benson ended the hearing and ordered the case to trial beginning on April 20 before he pleaded guilty on Friday. Thursday was also not the first time Schanze has made a sideshow out of a court hearing. At his initial appearance in December, he was handcuffed and briefly held in contempt after being disruptive and combative with a federal judge. During that hearing, he was placed in handcuffs in a Salt Lake City courtroom after he stood up and interrupted a judge at another man's hearing. U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Brooke Wells had told that man he would have to surrender any weapons as part of his release. Speaking loudly from the front row, Schanze declared it was unconstitutional to take the man's guns. Wells ordered U.S. marshals to handcuff Schanze and escort him out. Charges against Schanze came in 2014 after a federal investigation into a video that surfaced online in 2013 and appeared to show a paraglider near Utah Lake kicking a soaring owl and boasting about it . Schanze is known in Utah for his shrill, hyperactive TV commercials for his Totally Awesome Computers retail chain . In 2006, Schanze shut down his Totally Awesome Computers stores amid sinking sales and legal troubles. He has since run for political office, including a Libertarian bid for governor. Schanze's paragliding has run afoul of the law before. In 2006, he was charged with disorderly conduct after flying low near Interstate 15 at rush hour. He kissed the feet of a fan who paid his $300 fine in the case. Five years later, Schanze was arrested in Oregon after allegedly jumping off the 125-foot-tall Astoria Column. He said outside the jail the government was stifling his creativity. His other legal troubles include a 2005 conviction for lying to officers after prosecutors said he brandished a gun at Draper residents angry that he'd sped through their neighborhood. Four years later, Schanze was sentenced to ten days in jail after police stopped him for weaving in and out of traffic. Prosecutors say his children weren't wearing seatbelts, and Schanze was carrying a loaded gun in his fanny pack without a permit.

It's a well documented case, Robin's eschewing of fame to raise to her children instead. But does she have any regrets? Now that she's had another taste of on-screen success thanks to her role as power-hungry First Lady Claire Underwood, does she wish she hadn't given it all up so easily twenty years ago? Nope, not at all, the actress has revealed in an interview with Giles Hattersley for the The Sunday Times Style magazine. Talking about choosing between fame and family, when big movie offers were reportedly pouring in off the back of Forest Gump's success, Robin has said that it was an easy decision to make.

'I didn't want to work four movies in a year and be on every magazine cover. Six months away? Bullshit. Don't have kids!' The actress, who did make an arguably notable appearance in another of Costner's movies, Message In A Bottle, instead says the time she spent at home with her two children, daughter Dylan, now 24, and son Hopper, now 21, was a gift in itself. Robin Wright and Sean Penn's daughter Dylan is an aspiring actress and fashion model, enjoying her first taste of success with a recent campaign for Italian fashion designer Ermanno Scervino . 1994 tear-jerker Forest Gump earned Robin a Golden Globe nomination and a fistful of major movie role offers, but she turned her back on a high profile Hollywood career after discovering she was pregnant .

"KFC opened up their kitchens to skeptics and fans alike on Saturday and there were no mutant chickens to be seen, the deep fryer was as clean as a whistle and the salad was crisp. It was no-doubt enough to convince some critics of one of the world's biggest fast food chains that it isn't all bad, but health experts still say that no matter how hygienic the conditions of the 612 KFC outlets in Australia are, the food they make just isn't good for you. The franchise allowed hundreds of people to take a look behind the scene of 219 stores and roam from freezer to fryer while watching staff continue their daily cooking and preparation tasks, in a bid to prove their chicken is fresh and there's nothing to hide. Scroll down for video . KFC allowed hundreds of people to tour the back of 219 stores across Australia and roam from freezer to fryer on Saturday . The fast food giant hoped to dispel myths around the quality and freshness of their ingredients and prove their chicken was fresh and cooked in the kitchen of each store . 'They'll see exactly what happens, we haven't airbrushed anything,' Nikki Lawson, Chief Marketing and Development Officer for KFC, told Daily Mail Australia. 'They'll see exactly how it's done, they'll get to look in the fridges at the ingredients and the products we've got, they'll be able to watch the cooks making the chicken and the burgers being assembled and how its eventually served to the customer.' Ms Lawson said the fast food giant hoped to dispel 'blanket perceptions' of negativity around the quality and freshness of their ingredients. 'It's not something that's made in a factory offsite somewhere and it gets delivered here and we reheat it,' she said. 'If you look at the ingredients and processes we use, it's actually like fabulous home cooked food, and it's just done in a slightly bigger commercial kitchen.' Daily Mail Australia attended an earlier tour of the KFC store outside Sydney's Airport in Mascot, alongside four couples who had registered as skeptics and fans . In one of two cool rooms, selections of raw chicken were seen packed in boxes marked with use by dates and the type of cut: whole chickens, zingers cuts, wings etc. A senior cook was then seen flouring and seasoning batches of the selections by hand, before distributing them between one of the six fryers .

'Regardless of the freshness of the chicken, KFC's biggest selling products are still prepared in a manner that leaves them high in things like fat and salt,' Ms Jones told Daily Mail Australia. 'We would encourage attempts by KFC to increase the transparency of their operations and provide interested customers with an insight into how their food is prepared.

The aim of the hunt is to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation, while raising money for Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation. More than 2,500 chocolate lovers paid $5 to fill up their bucket with as many eggs as they could fit on Saturday. 'This is the fourth year we've done the event and we have problems with parents sneaking in shopping bags and filling them up to the top,' Mr Turner told Daily Mail Australia. She was told by a 13-year-old volunteer she was taking too many eggs and she told the young person to 'f*** off' The woman kept denying she was smuggling eggs into additional plastic bags she had brought in . 'Parents are the toughest ones to control. You expect the kids to go frantic and shove eggs into their pockets and shirts and pants. But when parents go past this level of gluttony, it’s not a good look.' Mr Turner said they had to create a pram parking area outside the hunting spot to stop adults from smuggling eggs out by hiding them inside baby carriages. But he said this was the first year he had security guards escort a parent off site because they were taking too many of the 250,000 eggs donated by Hillier's Chocolates. He said one of volunteers approached him on the day and told him a woman was throwing obscenities at her when they asked her to stop stuffing multiple bags full with treats. '[The woman] was saying ""I've not done it""... [but] she had definitely filled up a number of bags to the hilt, more than people paying $5 a bucket,' Mr Turner said. 'She got irate and started carrying on and started having a go at my young volunteer who was only 13 years old. 'She was using the f-word, saying ""You can't stop from f***ing doing this and f*** off"".' It was not the first time parents took more than their fair share - which is a $5 bucket full - but this is the first time organisers have had to kick someone out . The egg hunt looks to raise money for Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation, which helps bring awareness of tissue and organ donation to the forefront . It was started by Zaidee Turner's father, Allan, who wanted to honour his seven-year-old daughter who was an organ donor when she died . Mr Turner said it was a shame this woman had acted in this way as she was at a family event, which he had started in the honour of his daughter, Zaidee, who died of a brain anuerysm when she seven years old. He said Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation tried to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation. At the time of her death, Mr Turner said Zaidee was one of the youngest people in Victoria to be on the donor list, saving the lives of up to seven people. Zaidee (not pictured) died of a brain aneurysm in 2004 and she has been remembered through the hunt . Mr Turner said parents were often the most difficult to control at these hunts as they were scrambling to get as many eggs as possible . Organisers have had to stop parents bringing prams because they were using them to smuggle out eggs . 'We try to [do events] left of field for organ and tissue donation,' he said. 'We've had jockey breeches with rainbow stripes on the side, we've done that for a number of years where [jockeys] wear them at race events and we came up with the idea of Melbourne's Greatest Easter Egg Hunt. 'It's Melbourne’s biggest Easter egg hunt and it raises much needed funds in an area where there are benefits for young and old.'","Mother was at charity Easter egg hunt at Melbourne's Caulfield Racecourse .

"A Scottish castle commandeered by Winston Churchill to help prepare troops for the D-Day landings has gone on sale for £1.75million. The 19th century Castle Toward, near Dunoon, was used to ready soldiers for landing at a beach and was commissioned as HMS Brontosaurus in 1942. Overlooking the Clyde estuary and with easy access to the sloping shoreline, the castle was deemed an ideal training ground for thousands of British troops. Soldiers practised beach landings - complete with bombs, smokescreens and strafing fighters - jumping from landing craft and clambering up the beach in preparation for the events of June 6, 1944, in Normandy. For sale: Castle Toward, near Dunoon, which played a crucial but little-known role in defeating the Nazis, has gone on the market for £1.75m . Training ground: Overlooking the Clyde estuary and with easy access to the sloping shoreline, the castle was used as a training base for D-Day . Danger: The training at the grounds was very realistic and incredibly demanding - many servicemen were killing during exercises . Allied soldiers would spend a week of intensive training at the castle, which included swimming in full kit and daily exercises on the surrounding hills. Brontosaurus was visited by both Churchill and Supreme Allied Commander Lord Mountbatten during this time. The training was so realistic and demanding that many servicemen were killed in accidents. The castle's rich military history is still clear to see. One room is named after Churchill and the foundations of the huts built to accommodate visiting troops still stand in parts of the grounds. Preparations: The grounds of the 19th century castle on the Cowal Peninsula in Argyll and Bute was used to ready troops for D-Day . Deep waters: Swimming training saw the forces jump off the pier and they then had to wade to shore in full military gear . Army base: Troops were stationed at the castle, where they trained off the coast of Scotland, in preparation for the D-Day landings of 1944 . Camp: With easy access to the sloping shoreline, Castle Toward was a perfect place to train troops in amphibious warfare . Historic: The D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, led to the liberation of France from Nazi control, and contributed to an Allied victory in the war . Timings: The Normandy landings were originally scheduled to take place in May - then postponed until June and put off again at the last minute for 24 hours due to bad weather . Across the UK, troops took part in various military exercises in preparation for D-Day. In late 1943 the war cabinet had agreed to the building of an assault training centre on the south Devon coast, and 3,000 civilians in six villages were ordered to leave their homes. The first large training exercises - on the south Devon coast at Slapton Sands – revealed communications problems, lack of mission comprehension, poor crisis management abilities and a general sense of chaos. On April 28, 1944, 749 US soldiers and sailors died after three ships involved in a training exercise were ambushed by German torpedo. Exercise Tiger was one of the biggest full-scale rehearsals before D-day, involving all 23,000 US soldiers who were planning to land on the Normandy beach codenamed Utah. Slapton Sands had been chosen because of its similarity to the French beach. Apart from the Devon and Scotland coastline, training also took place at Camp Gordon Johnston near Carrabelle, Florida. Mr Jepson, of the Combined Operations Association, said the troops stationed at the castle were planning for a return to mainland Europe. He said it was essential the different branches of the forces - army, navy and air - learned to work together for the return to France. He said: 'They had to start from scratch and start planning for the return to France. They started the combined service centres where they planned the actual landings. 'Of course they had very little to start off with. They developed various crafts and weapons.' Speaking about the conditions for the troops at Brontosaurus, he explained: 'They were under a lot of pressure. Sadly there were a lot of accidents and a lot of people were killed. 'With the ramp down they would jump into what they thought was shallow water and some drowned.' 'Swimming training would see them jump off the pier and swim to shore in full kit.' He said the RAF would at times fly over the Scottish beaches dropping bombs and smoke screens. 'It had to be as realistic as possible,' he said. 'It must have been an amazing site with the landing crafts, ships and tanks coming and going.' Talking about Castle Toward he said: 'It was ideal where it was. It's a beautiful building and historically important.' Castle Toward was built in 1820 by Kirkman Finlay, a former Lord Provost of Glasgow, as his family's country house. Following its use by the Allied Forces, the estate was bought by the Corporation of Glasgow in 1946 and was used as an educational facility. Its ownership passed to Argyll and Bute Council in 1996 after local government reorganisation and the authority has been trying to sell the estate for the past few years. It has only been put on the open market after plans for a community buyout were rejected by the council after it only offered £850,000. The castle includes 25 bedrooms, six reception rooms and extensive grounds with stunning views over the Cowal peninsula near Dunoon. On the market: The castle, which is being sold by estate agents, Baird Lumsden, contains 12 shower rooms and an observation tower . Historic: The castle offers stunning views over the Cowal peninsula near Dunoon and is set within 125 acres of land . Picturesque: The property enjoys fine views over the Clydeestuary towards the Isles of Bute, Arran and Cumbrae .","19th century Castle Toward, near Dunoon, was used to ready soldiers for the D-Day landings in World War Two .

"A mother of a baby boy was arrested 27 years after his body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a Sainsbury's bag floating on a village pond. Police exhumed the boy's body from his grave in Norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review. A DNA sample eventually led them to his mother. The woman, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends. She explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter on June 5, 1988, just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a Sunday afternoon outing. Scroll down for video . Unsolved case: A police officer searches Windmill Pit, the Norfolk pond where the baby boy's body was found back in 1988 . The boy's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review, with DNA samples leading police to the boy's mother. He has now been reburied at Weasenham St Peter church, Norfolk . Police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the CPS decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial. During the original investigation, police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby's burial at 13th century St Peter's Church in the village. A report in the Eastern Daily Press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond . But after the body was exhumed in April last year, DNA taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents. Detectives examined that person's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy's mother. A police spokesman said: 'In this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation. 'Thanks to advances in DNA we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself. 'Sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play.' Det Insp Andy Guy, of Norfolk Police who led the investigation said the DNA was compared to five million samples on the national database. He said: 'It came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age. 'We went to see that individual and she told us she was mum. She was arrested on suspicion of infanticide. 'We were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her. 'The pregnancy was concealed from everybody. She didn't tell her family, her close friends, she gave birth in secret. The baby was stillborn.' The woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond, known locally as Windmill Pit, before it was found by a group of teenagers. The boy was originally buried without a name but  a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as Peter after the name of the church . A second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play. An inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death. The baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on June 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named Peter after the name of the church. Det Insp Guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time. He added: 'This has been unsolved for 27 years. By using the latest techniques, we've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time.' 'We don't ever give up. All the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they're reviewed at regular intervals.' Det Insp Guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had 'mixed feelings' after bringing the investigation to a final close. He said: 'From a police officer's perspective, it's fantastic. From a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her.' The grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross, which read: 'In loving memory of unknown baby boy. Born and died 1988.' A support group called Hana's Gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as Peter. The inscription reads: 'In loving memory of baby Peter, June 1988. A sweet little child, lost but then found, to bloom and grow in Heaven's playground. There is no foot so small that it cannot leave an imprint on the world.' Tranquil: The pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, as it is today . Karen Murray-Tye who set up Hana's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006, said: 'It was quite hard to find the right words, but I thought the 'lost but found' fitted the circumstances. 'I hope she sees we've tried to do the best for him as we have for Hana. It would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward.' Norfolk coroner's chaplain Chris Copsey said: 'When the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said 'unnamed baby boy'. 'It seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so I took the name of the church, St Peter's church.'

"Their Chipotle lunch became a media storm. But that was just the start for Hillary Clinton's most trusted aide Huma Abedin. And so, relishing her final taste of freedom before the presidential campaign kicks off, the notoriously low-profile staffer enjoyed a family day out in New York - with another Mexican bite. The 38-year-old was spotted with her husband, disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, and two-year-old son Jordan tucking into her second spicy menu of the week on Saturday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Before the campaign heats up: Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin (left) was spotted grabbing a Mexican lunch with husband Anthony Weiner and three-year-old son Jordan at quaint Tortaria in New York on Saturday . Low profile: Weiner (second left) and Adebin wore baseball caps as they enjoyed their lunch with their son. Weiner had swung his cap backwards for the dining portion . Skipping Chipotle: Their restaurant of choice was two doors down from the popular fast food Mexican diner . Abedin and Clinton were seen ordering a burrito bowl and a salad in an Iowa Chipotle this week but came under fire after staff complained Abedin did not put any change in the tip jar. Chipotle does not always have tip jars . The family was pictured inside at a table, where Weiner swung his New York Mets baseball cap backwards while he ate. It is just a few days after Abedin and Clinton were spotted, sunglasses on, in an Iowa branch of fast food favorite Chipotle. Grabbing a burrito bowl and a salad, the pair dashed back out to the 'Scooby Van' - and failed to pay a tip. This time, with her boss out of sight, Abedin side-stepped Chipotle and opted instead for a more upmarket eatery next door: Tortaría. Weiner and Abedin both wore baseball caps in the restaurant off Union Square, where tortas range from $7.50 to $11. As well as food served at the table, customers can also buyMexican fare to use at home. Weiner, a former congressman, fell from grace after sending explicit images to women over Twitter. He ordered the family's food as his wife sat with headphones in listening to a conference call. Abedin's husband Weiner is the disgraced former congressman who was caught sending explicit images to women over Twitter's private message system. The couple stayed together throughout the saga in 2011 . The family will no doubt have to ride out more storms with fierce Republican campaigns against Hillary . Classy: The restaurant also doubles as a bodega, selling Mexican-inspired pantry staples . Keen to get going: Abedin looks back as Weiener brings up the rear, holding his son's scooter and helmet in one hand . It was a quiet and relaxed day for the family as they embark on a doubtless hectic journey toward the 2016 election. Rand Paul quipped on Saturday that the Clinton campaign will require two planes wherever they go - 'one for her entourage, and one for her baggage'. 'I'm concerned that the plane with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering,' Paul said. Opinions were divided over whether the former Secretary of State nailed her attempt to woo Middle America with her tour of Iowa. Not the only one with a taste for Mexican: Marco Rubio also dipped into Chipotle for lunch the other day . In a bid to win over the everyman, she met with voters and laid out her vision for a campaign to be a champion for the average American. And, of course, visited Chipotle. Clinton is not the only presidential hopeful who has been seen tucking into Mexican fast food on the trail as they each try to court Hispanic and low-income voters. Republican hopeful Marco Rubio has also grabbed a Chipotle lunch. Jeb Bush, however, admits that is not on his to-do list - as he and his Colombian wife cook 'authentic' Mexican food at home.","Huma Abedin came under fire for not tipping at Chipotle in Iowa .

"Lawyers for jailed millionaire Robert Durst say he wants authorities to return more than $161,000 in cash taken after the real estate heir was arrested for murder. The attorneys say Durst, 72, got the money, now held by New Orleans police, legally and it is not needed for evidence or subject to forfeiture in any of his legal proceedings. Durst was arrested at the JW Marriott hotel in New Orleans on a Los Angeles County warrant that accused him of killing his friend Susan Berman in 2000 to keep her from talking to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. Scroll down for video . Murder suspect Robert Durst and his lawyers have asked for the return of $161,000 taken during his arrest in March. Above, the suspect leaves an arraignment in New Orleans on April 14 . Authorities who arrested Durst in mid-March found $44,000, marijuana and a revolver at his hotel room in New Orleans. They also found maps of Florida and Cuba, leading some to believe he was ready for a life on the run . His lawyers say the arrest in mid-March was timed to mesh with the finale of The Jinx, HBO's six-part series about Durst, his wife's disappearance, Berman's death, and the death and dismemberment of Durst's neighbor Morris Black in 2001. Authorities found more than $44,000 in Durst's hotel room, according to legal papers filed Wednesday. After his arrest, they intercepted a package containing personal items and $117,000 that was sent to the hotel for Everette Ward — the name Durst used to register there. During a hearing last month, a prosecutor said the package of $100 bills, a head-and-chest latex mask and a map folded to show Louisiana, Florida and Cuba were evidence that Durst was likely to flee if bond was set for him. Durst (right) was arrested for the murder of his friend and writer Susan Berman (left) in 2000, which some believe he may have committed to stop her from talking to authorities about the disappearance of his wife . Durst, the heir to a vast real estate fortune before becoming estranged from his family, is also connected to the 1982 disappearance of his first wife Kathy McCormack (left, with Durst) and the killing of Morris Black (right) They believe he had been gathering cash for life on the run. Durst is being held without bond on the California murder warrant and on state and federal weapons charges in Louisiana for the loaded revolver that was found in his hotel room. Investigators also found five ounces of marijuana in the room. Durst's attorneys also are making a second attempt to get the FBI agents and state trooper who arrested Durst to testify in state court. A statement filed with the court on Wednesday shows that a private investigator delivered subpoenas Monday to Agents Crystal Bender and William C. Williams and to Trooper Saunders Craine. Durst has been in custody since his mid-March arrest (pictured) and is facing federal and Louisiana state gun charges before extradition to California . The millionaire's defense team is being led by Houston litigator Dick DeGuerin (in cowboy hat) who says that his client wants to return to California to face the Berman murder charge . Federal prosecutors moved earlier subpoenas, which ordered them to testify before a Criminal District Court magistrate, to federal court. The new subpoenas call for them to testify before Judge Franz Zibilich, according to the statement. Durst's attorneys did not immediately respond to an email asking whether they expect prosecutors to move the new subpoenas, what Durst plans to do with the money if he gets it back, and the total of his legal bills so far. US Attorney's Office spokeswoman Anna Christman said she could not comment about the subpoenas.","Durst arrested in March for California murder of friend Susan Berman .

"A trim 120-pound mother-of-four set a new world record this weekend and earned $6,000 in prize money after downing three 72-ounce steak dinners in just 20 minutes. Competitive eater Mary Schuyler accomplished the stunning feat in front of hundreds at the Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday. Schuyler is such a champ that the four teams of two that competed against her didn't even come close to winning - even though they were allowed to split their dinners. Scroll down for video . Winner, winner, steak dinner: Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at the Big Texan Steack Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday . Fast eater: The 120-pound mother-of-four ate three steak dinners - complete with sides - in just 20 minutes . Worth it: For breaking the record for quickest steak dinner eaten and for finishing her three meals in under an hour, Schuyler took home a grand total of $6,000 . In addition to the three massive 72-ounce steaks, competitors also had to eat three baked potatoes, three shrimp cocktails, three salads and three rolls for a whopping 15 pounds of food. While that might sound daunting to most, Schuyler was confident that she would beat out the other competitors with her experience. 'They would have had to eat their half in like four minutes,' Schuyler told the Amarillo Globe-News. 'If you’re not used to doing this, four minutes is hard.' Filling: The dinner included three 72-ounce steaks, three shrimp cocktails, three baked potatoes, three salads and three rolls . Champion: Though her competitors were allowed to tackle the challenge in teams of two, none came close to winning the competition . She cleaned her plate: Schuyler poses with a fan after the feat, showing off her belly bloated from the competition . However, she was a bit nervous about tackling a three steak dinners since she ate just two when she competed at the restaurant last year. 'I come in thinking I'm going to fail, but you know if I win it's a lovely parting gift and that's cool,' she told KFDA-TV. 'I also get free steak so I don't really lose.' As the competition began, Schuyler covered up with a pair of sunglasses and put up her sweatshirt hood to focus on the task at hand and finished her first steak in just four minutes and 18 seconds - beating the previous record she set last year of four minutes and 48 seconds. Hundreds cheered her on below the competition table set up side the restaurant on a sunny day, as Schuyler ripped her way through the steaks. Competitors had an hour to finish their $72 dinners, in order to get them for free, but Schuyler cleaned her plates in a cool 20. And with enough time to spare, Schuyler tried attacking a fourth steak but had to stop, saying she was tired of the taste. Schuyler was born and raised in Nebraska and currently residents in Sacramento California. Before her competitive food eating life, she worked as a bartender and server at Applebee’s. In August 2012, Schuyler entered her first competitive eating competition, becoming the first woman to finish the Stellanator at Stella Bar in Omaha, Nebraska. The Stellanator includes six hamburger patties, six eggs, six pieces of cheese, six pieces of bacon topped with fried onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, two buns and mayonnaise. Another to add to the trophy cabinet: Schuyler pictured above winning the Z-Burger contest in Washington, DC last July. During the competition she ate 24 hamburgers in ten minutes . Since then, Schuyler has been competing regularly in food eating competitions - including one weekend in 2014 when she competed in FOUR food competitions. On January 31, 2014, Schuyler won Wing Bowl 22 in Philadelphia, by eating 363 wings. The next day, she competed in and won both the IHOP Pancake bowl and the bacon-eating contest at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival in Des Moines. She finished out the weekend by taking on the Adam Emmenecker Challenge at Jethro’s Barbecue. Schuyler first took on the Emmenecker challenge in December 2012, when she became the first woman to complete the meal that includes a spicy pickle, bun, pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken tenders, white cheddar sauce, fried cheese cubes, Texas brisket, applewood smoked bacon, cheeseburger and a pound of waffle fries...in just 15 minutes. Dessert: Schuyler guzzles down 12 pounds of rice pudding in three minutes to set a new world record last year . Hero: Last year Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland, Oregon . Schuyler started the competition at her normal 120 pounds, but by the time she was crowned winner, she had gained 15 pounds and her stomach noticeably filled out. Her physique was quite a contrast to the larger men who decided to take her on in the eating competition including a team of two professional wrestlers and two members of the Amarillo Venum indoor football team. For setting the record for fastest eaten steak dinner, Schuyler won $1,000 and another $5,000 for completing the challenge in less than an hour. What's more - Schuyler says she plans to come back next year and break her record, upping the ante to four steaks instead of three. Bobby Lee, the co-owner of the Big Texas, says the restaurant was floored by her performance and that they'll be submitting her record to Guinness. 'We've been doing this contest since 1960, and in all that time we've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time- so this is a first for us and after 55 years of it, it's a big deal,' Lee told ABC 7. Schuyler started competing in eating competition in August 2012, and has broken several records during her brief career. In January 2014, she set ate 363 wings in just 20 minutes, earning $22,000 prize for that competition.","Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday .

"Nigeria's new President marked the first anniversary since more than 200 schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram militants by saying he did not know if they would ever be found. Muhammadu Buhari, who won the presidential election two weeks ago, said his administration would do everything in their power to bring the students home - but said he could not promise they would find them. The announcement came as a march was held through the Nigerian capital of Abuja to mark the first anniversary since the girls were abducted from a secondary school in Chibok. Protestors marched through Abuja with red tape over their mouths, carrying a poster with pictures of some of the missing girls. It is now a year since more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants . Muhammadu Buhari said his government will do 'everything in their power' to find and return around 220 missing schoolgirls to their families, as young girl joins the rally outside the Nigerian ministry of education . Almost 300 girls were taken away in trucks on the night of April 14 to 15 2014, after the terrorists from Boko Haram - meaning 'Western education is sinful' - broke into their school by pretending to be guards. The students were forced to convert to Islam and marry group members. The attack sparked worldwide condemnation and a huge campaign called '#bringbackourgirls' - but more than 200 are still missing after others were freed or killed. In a statement, former military rule Buhari said he would take a different approach to the crisis as outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan, who was criticised for responding slowly to the kidnapping after arguing a hasty rescue would risk killing them. A rally was also held in New York, attended by congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (right), one year since the schoolgirls were kidnapped. Nigeria's new president said the whereabouts of the students is not known . 'We do not know if the Chibok girls can be rescued', Buhari said. 'Their whereabouts remain unknown. As much as I wish to, I cannot promise that we can find them.' 'My government will do everything in its power to bring them home', he added. As families mark one year since their daughters were abducted, Lawan Abana - whose two nieces were among those kidnapped - said he is still hopeful they will be found. 'It was handled in a lousy manner', he said. 'We are confident that the girls are still alive.' Amnesty International said in a report on Tuesday that Boko Haram has kidnapped at least 2,000 Nigerian women and girls since the start of 2014, many of whom were sexually abused or trained to fight. Pictured in May last year, the missing Nigerian schoolgirls were filmed wearing the full-length hijab . Boko Haram - which means 'Western education is sinful' - forced the girls to convert to Islam and marry . The document, which includes scores of victim testimonies, accuses Boko Haram of rape, forced marriages and coercing them into armed attacks, sometimes on their own villages. One 19-year-old, who asked not to be named, told Amnesty she had been repeatedly raped by gangs of up to six men. 'I was among the girls trained to shoot. I was also trained how to use bombs and how to attack a village', she said. With help from state neighbours Niger, Cameroon and especially Chad, the rebel Boko Haram force in Nigeria have been forced to retreat from an area the size of Belgium in the last few weeks.","New President says he doesn't know if 200 missing girls can be rescued .

"Photographs taken with the very first 'secret' handheld camera will go on display on Saturday at the State Library giving Sydneysiders a rare chance to take a glimpse of what life in Sydney looked like back in the 1800’s. The Crowd Source collection holds around 150 photographs taken by Arthur Syer, a 27-year-old man living in Sydney who took advantage of the very first hand held camera, the Detective Camera. 'It was the first time people really had the opportunity to take a photograph without their subjects knowing,’ said museum curator and historian Margot Riley. The detective camera gave amateur photographers the opportunity to capture the true essence of life on Sydney streets, defining it as a ‘real revolution and turning point in photography.’ ‘The word snapshot emerged from this style of photography and the photographers were called snap shooters’ She said the detective camera gave amateur photographers the opportunity to capture the true essence of life on Sydney streets, defining it as a ‘real revolution and turning point in photography.’ ‘This was really the beginning of the mass photography you see today. It parallels with the way people look at the world now, always taking images with their phones,’ she said. ‘The word snapshot emerged from this style of photography and the photographers were called snap shooters,’ Ms Riley added. She said that this was the first time people would’ve been confronted with the idea of being photographed or observed on the streets without their knowledge,  spurring on early conversations about privacy laws. This was the first time people were confronted with the idea of being photographed without their knowledge . The camera was wrapped in a small parcel so that it didn't draw attention from the photographers subjects . 'Pesky snap shooters' were the reason people initated early talks about surveillance and privacy . ‘It definitely caused some controversy,' she said. ‘There were plenty of people being annoyed by pesky snap shooters roaming the streets, taking photos of unsuspecting people going about their business.’ The Detective Camera was produced between 1883 and 1887 using a dry negative which was already loaded into the device. It was focused and ready to take a photograph from around six feet away. The camera was loaded, focused and ready to take a photograph at around six feet away . ‘These photographs are very rare and unique because they represent the missing link between the old style tripod photography and Kodak box photography.’ It was the first time individuals who weren't trained in the science and chemistry of photography had the opportunity to dabble in the art. ‘Not long after this camera was marketed the roll film and Kodak camera box were invented. ‘These photographs are very rare and unique because they represent the missing link between the old style tripod photography and Kodak box photography.’ The photos taken with the hand held camera captured more natural gestures and poses giving us a better sense of the streets and a far more accurate view of our history . ‘You get to see some really lovely scenes of youthful anticipation' Ms Riley thinks photos taken with the hand held camera captured more natural gestures and poses giving us a better sense of the streets and a far more accurate view of our history. ‘You get to see some really lovely scenes of youthful anticipation. One of the photos shows a group of girls dressed to the nines, many with bare feet- something that was quite normal for that time.’ She said it is important to share this link to our past to ‘encourage people to build a bridge between then and now.’ The candid shots give us a better look at what life was really like for Sydneysiders in the 1880's . People from the Flickr community helped identify landmarks and other details in the photos to help locate where they were taken. This shot is on the corner of Elizabeth and King Street in Sydney's CBD . The images were collected over a period of time and were originally released on the photo hosting website Flickr. They received a 'wonderful response' from the Flickr community with some members even reaching out and helping curators identify where in Sydney the photos were taken.

"A fugitive treasure hunter who took gold worth millions of dollars from a shipwreck before spending years on the run is finally facing jail. Tommy Thompson has agreed to go to prison rather than reveal details about the valuable haul he recovered from the SS Central America. In 1988 the 62-year-old led an excursion to the vessel, known as the Ship of Gold, which sank  off the Carolina coast in 1857 laden with 21 tons of gold. Tommy Thompson, 62, left, and girlfriend Alison Antekeier, 42, have both admitted contempt of court in Columbus, Ohio . Gold bars taken from the SS Central America which sank during a hurricane in 1857 . Around 400 people drowned in the 19th-Century shipwreck. Thompson, then an oceanic engineer at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, and his crew brought up thousands of bars and coins, much of them later sold to a gold marketing group in 2000 for about $50 million. He was accused of cheating his 161 investors, who paid $12.7 million to find the ship, out of the proceeds. In civil proceedings brought by a number of the backers they claimed the find was worth up to $260 million. Columbus attorney Rick Robol, who at one time defended Thompson's company, said there was no proof Thompson stole anything. Thompson and his girlfriend, Alison Antekeier, 42, failed to appear in court in 2012 and abandoned their Florida mansion. A man who had worked for the couple later discovered wads of cash hidden in the pipes and a book called How To Be Invisible at the property. Thompson and Antekeir were arrested in January after U.S. marshals tracked them down to the Boco Raton Hotel in Florida. They were said to have been staying there for more than a year and using fake names, according to U.S. marshals. 'Thompson was smart — perhaps one of the smartest fugitives ever sought by the U.S. Marshals, along with almost limitless resources and approximately a 10-year head start,' U.S. Marshal Michael Tobin said when the pair were found. The couple, both wearing orange jumpsuits and chains, admitted contempt of court at the federal courthouse in Columbus, Ohio, after reaching a plea bargains. 'This case started with willful disobedience of a judge's order to appear in court and ended when the U.S. Marshals Service got their man and woman,' prosecutors reportedly said, according to the Columbus Dispatch. An artists impression of the SS Central America sinking off the Carolina coast in 1857 . Thompson is said to be facing no more than two years in custody after he agreed to hand over $435,380 in cash that was found with the couple, the newspaper reported. But under the deal he will not have to testify about the gold haul he discovered in the historic shipwreck. Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Squires recommended Antekeier serve no prison time. Thompson was remanded into custody ahead of sentencing, but his girlfriend was released on bail.","Tommy Thompson, 62, led an 1988 expedition to the SS Central America .

"Eight-year-old schoolboy Christopher Furniss-Roe, who hanged himself in a 'tragic accident' An eight-year-old schoolboy hanged himself in a 'tragic accident'  after being sent to bed early for breaking his younger sister's beach bucket, an inquest heard. Christopher Furniss-Roe from Pontypool, South Wales, was found in his bedroom by his father just 15 minutes after the 'childish' argument with his younger sister. His father Jason desperately tried to save his son's life but he died the next day in hospital. A coroner ruled it was a tragic accident - saying the eight-year-old was probably looking for 'sympathy and forgiveness' after the row. The hearing was told Christopher was happy after being placed in a series of races at his school's sports day. But after coming home from school that afternoon, Christopher has a  'childish' row with his sister which culminated in her bucket being broken and her suffering a cut lip. Their father told his son to go to bed as a minor punishment, but after 15 minutes he found him hanging in his room. Mr Furniss-Roe cut his son down and performed first aid. But Christopher was taken to hospital and had his life support machine switched off the following day. Gwent coroner David Bowen said: 'Christopher had been naughty and as a result he had been sent to his room. 'It was far more probable that he was pretending to hang himself to get sympathy and forgiveness. 'But it all went tragically wrong. 'A heart-wrenching decision was made to turn that [life support] machine off the following day.' Dr Stephen Leadbeatter, a consultant pathologist at the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff, concluded that the youngster had died as a result of hanging after a post-mortem. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.

"A woman on trial for murder admitted in a recorded interview with police that she had shot two men and fed their bodies to her pigs, the jury heard on Tuesday. Susan Monica, a 66-year-old pig farmer and welder from southern Oregon, went on trial on Tuesday in Medford. She has been charged with killing two handymen living on her 20-acre pig ranch in a small Jackson County community and dismembering the bodies. Accused serial killer Susan Monica interrupts court in Medford, Oregon on Tuesday on the opening day of her trial for allegedly murdering two men, dismembering their bodies and feeding them to her pigs . Susan Monica, pictured left in court in January 2014, and right in an undated mugshot, has been accused of killing Robert Haney and Stephen Delicino a year apart at her pig farm and dismembering their bodies . Both victims were shot in the head and dismembered in what prosecutors allege were separate murders committed more than a year apart. Monica appeared in court dressed in skirt, blouse and short wig. In opening statements, defense lawyer Garren Pedemonte said Monica shot the first victim in self-defense, and the second as a kind of mercy killing. Stephen Frank Delicino, 59, was shot by Monica in self-defense in summer 2012. The defendant has claimed that she shot the second man, 56-year-old Robert Harry Haney, to put him out of his misery because she found her pigs already feeding on him, The Mail Tribune reported. The second killing took place in September 2013. Police searched her pig ranch last year after Monica was discovered using a food stamps card belonging to Haney, and found remains of the two men. Remains of two handymen who had been living on Monica's 20-acre pig ranch (pictured) in Jackson County, Oregon were found in 2014 after she was caught using one victim's food stamps card .","Susan Monica, from southern Oregon, allegedly killed two handymen living on her pig ranch .

"Game of Thrones fans who did not want to wait and legally watch HBO's hit series premiere its fifth season tonight have leaked the first four episodes online. Online pirates have unveiled nearly  half of the show's next season, which is scheduled to debut its first episode tonight. The episodes began appearing on torrent download sites on Saturday night, and are thought to have leaked from review copies given to the press. Fans of the show, which follows the ambitions and betrayals of competing noble factions and families in the fantasy world of Westeros, now face the daunting task of avoiding spoilers online as the first four episodes are released over the course of the month. Scroll down for video . Game of Thrones, which includes characters such as Emilia Clarke's Khaleesi (left) and Nathalie Emmanuel's Missandei (right), was pirated before its season five debut tonight . Episodes beginning this year's season are titled The Wars to Come, The House of Black and White, High Sparrow and The Sons of the Harpy. They had been downloaded more than 550,000 times as of early Sunday morning, Variety reported, citing the piracy-tracking company Excipio. 'Sadly, it seems the leaked four episodes of the upcoming season of Game of Thrones originated from within a group approved by HBO to receive them. We're actively assessing how this breach occurred,' HBO said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. The series is the most illegally downloaded program in the world. Anti-piracy company Irdeto said that episodes from Game of Thrones's first four seasons were illegally downloaded more than seven million times between February and April 2015. The astounding figure is a 45 per cent jump over the same period from 2014 for the show, which debuted in 2011. The first four episodes had been downloaded more than 550,000 times as of early Sunday morning. Above, Kit Harrington's character Jon Snow (left) and Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister (right) feature in the show . Brazil and France are the top two countries by illegal downloads of the series inspired by George R R Martin's Song of Ice and Fire novels. They are followed by the US, Canada and the UK. Walking Dead, with 5.7million illegal downloads from February to April, was the second-most pirated show. HBO planned Sunday's premier to air across 170 countries at the same time in an effort to combat international piracy of the show. US audiences are able to watch Game of Thrones on HBO Now, the company's new online streaming service.","Episodes for the next four weeks released Saturday night on pirate sites .

"If your partner snores heavily in bed, you might be tempted to give them a poke in the ribs and go back to sleep. But that irritating nocturnal drone might actually be an early warning sign of dementia, scientists have warned. Researchers have discovered that people who have breathing problems while asleep are more likely to experience an early decline in memory and other brain functions. In a worrying study, they found that people with sleep apnoea - a condition often typified by heavy snoring - saw a mental decline more than a decade earlier, on average, than those who had no sleep problems. People who have breathing problems while asleep are more likely to experience an early decline in memory and other brain functions . The US researchers’ results also suggested that the onset of Alzheimer’s might be accelerated among those with sleeping problems. At least half a million Britons suffer from sleep apnoea, which is most often found in middle-aged, overweight men. The condition causes the muscles in the airway to contract during sleep, which cuts off the air supply, usually resulting in a heavy snore. It causes disrupted sleep and daytime exhaustion, pushing up blood pressure. Study author Dr Ricardo Osorio, of New York University, said: ‘Abnormal breathing patterns during sleep such as heavy snoring and sleep apnoea are common in the elderly.’ The research team studied the medical histories of 2,470 people, aged 55 to 90. Their investigation, published in the journal Neurology, found that people with sleep breathing problems were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment at an average age of 77. Those with no breathing problems, in comparison, did not typically see a decline until age 90 - more than a decade later. Among that group, those who had sleep breathing problems also developed Alzheimer’s disease five years earlier than those who did not have sleep breathing problems, at an average age of 83 compared to 88. The onset of Alzheimer’s might be accelerated among those with sleeping problem, experts said (file photo) The scientists also found that treating the problem with a night time air mask - known as continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP - saw significant results. People treated with the machine, which pumps a steady stream of air through the mask, were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment about ten years later than people whose problems were not treated, at age 82 instead of age 72. Dr Osorio said: ‘The age of onset of mild cognitive impairment for people whose breathing problems were treated was almost identical to that of people who did not have any breathing problems at all. ‘Given that so many older adults have sleep breathing problems, these results are exciting - we need to examine whether using CPAP could possibly help prevent or delay memory and thinking problems.’ For years we have been told that the first step to staying healthy is to keep to a healthy weight - that means making sure your Body Mass Index (BMI) is within the normal range of 18 to 24. Few people are advised to gain weight, unless their BMI is below 18, but could that change? A study published last week suggests that overweight people are less likely to develop dementia. The researchers, drawn mostly from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, analysed the medical records of nearly two million people for up to ten years and found that those who were overweight (with a BMI of 25 to 29) had an 18 per cent lower risk of dementia compared to those with a healthy BMI. Remarkably the obese (with a BMI of 30 plus) did even better; they were 24 per cent less likely to develop dementia. Being underweight increased the dementia risk by 39 per cent. His team did not establish exactly why heavy snoring might cause early dementia, but previous research has established links between sleep disruption and dementia. Dr Osorio said: ‘These findings were made in an observational study and as such, do not indicate a cause-and-effect relationship. ‘However, we are now focusing our research on CPAP treatment and memory and thinking decline over decades, as well as looking specifically at markers of brain cell death and deterioration.’ British charities last night welcomed the findings. Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Most of us don’t think of snoring as something to be concerned about but frequent, loud snoring could be a sign of sleep apnoea - a disorder that affects breathing during sleep. ‘In this study, those who reported a sleep apnoea developed cognitive decline a decade earlier than those without sleep breathing problems, but the link between sleep apnoea and Alzheimer’s disease was much less clear. ‘Several earlier studies have shown that the quantity and quality of sleep we get can have an impact on our cognitive health and as sleeping disorders are common among the elderly, it is vital that we see more research into this area.’ Dr Simon Ridley of Alzheimer’s Research UK, added: ‘This study adds to evidence that disrupted breathing during sleep could be a risk factor for memory and thinking decline in older age, but it doesn’t prove that one causes the other. ‘Despite the small sample size in this study, the researchers did try to account for other factors that may have explained the link and the findings highlight the need to delve deeper into the possible biological reasons behind this association. ‘A good supply of oxygen to the brain is vital to keep it healthy and it is interesting to see that treatment of sleep apnoea was associated with a trend towards a later onset of memory and thinking problems.’","People who snore are more likely to experience an early decline in memory .

"Jailed: Paramedics found Kyle Hargreaves kissing a girl on a stretcher in the back of the ambulance . An 18-year-old who assaulted a paramedic after he was caught trying to have sex in an ambulance has been jailed. Paramedics found Kyle Hargreaves kissing a girl on a stretcher in the back of the vehicle, which had been called to an address in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. The ambulance crew had left the doors open while they collected a 92-year-old man with chest pain from inside the property. They returned to find Hargreaves and the girl, who has not been named, lying on top of each other. When confronted by paramedic Michael Newman, Hargreaves said: 'What's your problem? We are just trying to have sex'. The teenager then punched Mr Newman three times as the patient was being carried out to the vehicle. Hargreaves, of Immingham, Lincolnshire, pleaded guilty to assaulting Mr Newman and breaching his Antisocial Behaviour Order by using threatening behaviour towards him. He was jailed for two years and eight months at Grimsby Crown Court. The court was told that the ambulance responded to the call shortly after 10pm on February 15. One of the crew left the back doors of the ambulance open, which is normal practice, when he brought a chair inside for the man. In the few minutes the crew were away, Hargreaves and the girl, sneaked inside. When paramedic Michael Newman returned to the vehicle, he found Hargreaves and the girl kissing on the stretcher. He said they appeared to have been drinking. He told them to get out of the ambulance because the crew needed to take the patient to hospital. Hargreaves told him they were 'trying to have sex'. The teenager threatened the crew before punching Mr Newman three times in the face, the court heard. The 92-year-old man, who was still in the carry chair, was protected by an ambulance technician and the patient's son at the time. The panic button on the crew's radio was used to alert the police. The girl who was with Hargreaves bit ambulance technician William Heron on his hand. Mr Newman suffered a huge black eye, a cut to his nose and a nose bleed. Hargreaves spat saliva and blood into Mr Newman's face. The crew restrained Hargreaves until the police arrived by holding him down. Another crew was sent out to take the pensioner to hospital. Judge David Tremberg branded the punching and spitting assault on the paramedic 'disgusting' and 'uncivilised' behaviour towards a paramedic who was just doing his job. Craig Lowe, mitigating, said Hargreaves had a long history of offending and he faced longer custodial sentences if he did not tackle his drinking. After the hearing, Steve Pratten, of the East Midlands Ambulance Service, said: 'This was a disgraceful act, not only to attack an emergency ambulance crew while they were engaged on their duties and were trying to look after a patient, but it was also completely selfish and completely irresponsible because of what they were trying to use the ambulance for. 'We are very pleased with the sentence. We think it reflects the serious nature of the incident. 'We are also pleased that the Crown Prosecution Service has worked with us and Humberside Police in being able to get a conviction. Call out: The ambulance crew had left the doors open while they collected a 92-year-old man with chest pain from a property on Dixon Avenue, Grimsby (pictured). They returned to find Hargreaves and the girl inside . 'It sends a clear message that any form of violence and aggression to any of our staff will not be tolerated.' Mr Pratten said the pensioner needed to go to hospital but did not suffer any serious effects from being caught up in the violent incident. 'Both of our staff have been supported by East Midlands Ambulance Service through counselling and occupational health services. 'The technician who was bitten on the hand had to have a series of injections. 'Both crew members returned to work the following day for their shifts, a sign of their professionalism and dedication in returning to work and taking no sickness time. Hargreaves admitted separate matters of robbery and theft against a newsagents on the same day. The ASBO had been made at Grimsby Youth Court on February 25, 2013.","Kyle Hargreaves was caught kissing a girl on a stretcher in the ambulance .

"Carwyn Scott-Howell's death was a tragic accident, according to state prosecutor Pierre Yves Michau . The family of tragic ski boy Carwyn Scott-Howell were expected to bring his body home this weekend as an investigation into his death ruled out negligence as a factor. Carwyn, seven, plunged 160ft to his death in Flaine, France, while skiing with his mother Ceri and siblings Gerwyn and Antonia, after becoming separated from them. According to state prosecutor Pierre Yves Michau, the schoolboy’s death earlier this month was ‘a tragic accident’ with no one to blame. The family, from Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, were enjoying their last run of the holiday when Antonia fell and her mother stopped to help. Carwyn carried on skiing and then ventured into a wooded area. His mother thought he had continued to their accommodation but raised the alarm when he did not return. Mr Michau said: ‘The inquiry has found the piste was well signposted. The boy would have been aware that he was leaving the piste. The reason why is not known but it was by error. ‘Had he been with someone bigger or older, the accident wouldn’t have happened but it remains a dramatic and tragic accident.’ In a statement released to the Foreign Office, his family described Carwyn as a 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and a 'very competent skier and snowboarder'. They said they were enjoying their last ski run together when Carwyn's sister 'lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead'. 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky. 'Carwyn was a very competent skier and snowboarder who had started skiing at the age of three and spent several weeks each year skiing. We had spent the most happy ski holiday together in the French ski resort of Flaine.' The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day. 'The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead,' it said. 'The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts.

"Holmesburg Prison's 101-year history was filled with violent riots, bloody beatings and most shocking of all - the cruel chemical experimentation on its inmates. Since its construction in 1895, its high walls housed some of the country's most dangerous criminals whose uprisings ended in death and mass-injury. And haunting images published in 2011 proved that government doctors used the jail in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to test chemical substances on inmates and disabled American citizens. Nearly two decades after its closure in 1995, all that remains of one of the most notorious and violent prisons in American history is cracked paint, crumbling hallways and empty cells which once housed its human guinea pigs. Decay: The 1,200 inmates once housed inside Holmesburg Prison - where some rooms were padded with filthy mattresses (pictured) - were subjected to cruel clinical experimentation . Filthy: Since its construction in 1895, some of the country's most dangerous criminals walked the halls of Holmesburg prison (pictured) Cruel: Images which emerged in 2011 (pictured) showed the aftermath of  experiments carried out on the prisons inmates and proved the brutal tests were taking place . Ghostly: These now-empty cells inside the abandoned Philadelphia jail were once occupied by desperate inmates who underwent the cruel procedures for 'money to buy cigarettes' Command: The guards ran the cruel institution from the 'control room' where they would monitor and coordinate their response to  riots . Silence: Since its closure in 1996, one of the few things that remain in tact in Holmesburg Prison are the old books read by prisoners who were once used as human guinea pigs . 'Accidental death': Many people were killed inside Holmesburg and in one incident in 1952, an inmate found dead in a bathtub with an autopsy concluding that he was beaten to death . Abandoned: Nearly two decades after its closure in 1996, the prison's halls have fallen eerily silent as the terrifying building slowly wastes away . Urban photographer Cindy Vasko captured the eerie silence and gradual decay of the once-overcrowded prison, which has become infamous for the medical testing that took place on its inmates. Prisoners in the jail were paid to test a variety of dangerous substances such as radioactive, hallucinogenic and toxic materials according to an author who saw the intense cruelty with his own eyes. They were deliberately 'exposed to pathogens that caused skin infections' such as herpes and the fungus which causes athlete's foot, Allen Hornblum claimed in his book Acres of Skin. He claims that between 1951 and 1974, these inmates acted as lab rats for over 30 pharmaceutical companies and government agencies. Historic images now show the 'patients' covered in bandages which for their many wounds and scars. One former prisoner who featured in a book about the cruelty which took place there says he agreed to have a layer of skin peeled of his back - only to be coated with searing chemicals. During the experiment which he took part in for money to buy cigarettes in prison, he remembers screaming: 'Oh my God, my back is on fire! Take this... off me!' The man coordinating these atrocious exams was renowned dermatologist Dr Albert Kligman who wrote hundreds of scientific papers on what are now considered everyday maladies such as dandruff and acne. But Kligman's distinguished career was tarnished by accusations of human cruelty inside Holmesburg prison that inspired federal restrictions on human testing, according to the New York Times. Torture: Dissidence was dealt with severely and the men who led a hunger strike in 1938 were locked in 'the bake ovens' (not pictured) where four of them 'roasted to death' Revolt: When a warden and his deputy were mercilessly stabbed to death in July 1970, it sparked a massive uprising that left 103 people include 29 other guards severely injured . Experiments: A review of medical journals from the prison revealed that some tests were carried out with the hopes of finding lifesaving treatments . Painful: While others seemed only to quench the curiosity of the men leading the experiments - causing great pain to the patients without yielding any results . Infected: The cruelty unfolding at Holmesburg was not isolated and at Stateville prison (pictured), an army doctor watched malaria-carrying mosquitoes bite the stomach of another inmate . Tragedy: The inmates - who would eat in this now-filthy cafeteria - were deliberately exposed to pathogens that caused skin infections such as herpes and the fungus which causes athlete's foot . Dangerous: The prison was the site of hundreds of violent attacks, breakouts, corrupt guards and rape of prisoners who stayed in bare cells like this one . Regarding his factory line of human guinea pigs, Mr Hornblum said: 'He had a dozen or two experiments going at one time... He turned Holmesburg into the K-Mart of human experimentation. It was a real industry.' Holmesburg has left such a terrifying legacy that it has since been used as the set of violent prison movies such as Animal Factory in 2000 and Law Abiding Citizen starring Gerard Butler in 2009. Almost 300 former prisoners filed a lawsuit against the City of Philadelphia and Albert Kligman in 2000, alleging they were cruelly experimented on between 1961 and 1974. Partly due to the abuses at Holmesburg, federal regulations were tightened up to restrict medical studies inside prisons to those posing minimal risks to inmates. Kligman became a wealthy man and a famous name in dermatology after being credited as the inventor of Retin-A, an acne cream and wrinkle-remover. Kligman denied any wrongdoing, according to the Baltimore Sun who quote him as saying: 'My use of paid prisoners as research subjects in the 1950s and 1960s was in keeping with this nation's standard protocol for conducting scientific investigations at that time. Brutal: One former prisoner who featured in a book (not pictured) about the cruelty which took place there says he agreed to have a layer of skin peeled of his back - only to be coated with searing chemicals . Systematic: Between 1951 and 1974,  inmates housed in these now-empty cells acted as lab rats for over 30 pharmaceutical companies and government agencies . Ringleader: The man coordinating these atrocious exams was renowned dermatologist Dr Albert Kligman who would carry out tests on tables like this . Accused: Dr Kligman denied any wrongdoing and claims his use of 'paid prisoners as research subjects' was in keeping with the nation's scientific protocol . 'To the best of my knowledge, the result of those experiments advanced our knowledge of the pathogenesis skin disease, and no long-term harm was done to any person who voluntarily participated in the research program.' The prison was also the site of hundreds of violent attacks, breakouts, corrupt guards and rape of prisoners, according to Philly.com. It alleges that 25 leaders of a hunger strike in 1938 were locked up in a section of the prisons known as 'the bake ovens'. The prison guards turned the heat in the rooms up to 190 degrees Fahrenheit and when the doors were opened 58 hours later, four inmates had 'roasted to death'. In another horrific incident in 1952, an inmate named Thomas Donato was found dead in a bathtub. Officials claimed he had drowned himself but results of the autopsy concluded he was beaten to death. And when a warden and his deputy were mercilessly stabbed to death in July 1970, it sparked a massive uprising that left 103 people include 29 other guards severely injured. The prison shifted 235 of its most dangerous inmates to the equally infamous Eastern State Penitentiary following that incident.","Haunting images show the decaying ruins of Holmesburg Prison where scientists experimented on its prisoners .

"The husband of a woman who bravely battled cancer only to die of a deadly bug after being left in a filthy hospital room  has spoken of his heartbreak. Retired chief executive René Dee watched as his wife Eileen, 68, slipped away just days after catching the infection and before the couple's son had a chance to say goodbye. The 69-year-old said: 'It was such a shock, one minute everyone was telling her how well she was doing and the next moment I am watching her struggling to breathe. It happened so quickly.' René Dee had to watch as his wife Eileen, 68, died just days after catching a lethal infection. She had been battling cancer when she caught the bug while undergoing treatment at the Royal Sussex County Hospital . Eileen had received a positive prognosis while being treated for her cancer but died because of an infection at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. Several hospital rooms, including Eileen's, were found to have traces of the drug-resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa in water running from the tap and in the shower drain. Raw sewage was also discovered coming up from the shower drain in the room next door to Eileen. Doctors, concerned for her health, transferred Eileen to another hospital while an exploration of drains and an intensive clean of all side rooms, including the one the retired NHS information manager was in, was carried out. The infection was specifically detected in Eileen's room but there were no notes accompanying her transfer to say that she had been exposed to the potentially lethal infection. She died five days later. The Royal Sussex had put new measures in place after an outbreak of the same infection in 2010, it has also emerged. These included a thorough review of cleaning rounds. But it was revealed following an internal Serious Incident Investigation that only about a third of hospital housekeepers were cleaning to the required standard when Eileen died. Initially, Eileen, who was diagnosed with acute myloid leukaemia, had been intent on just receiving palliative care because she had watched her mother die of cancer. But when she was told she would respond well to chemotherapy and had a good prospect of survival, she changed her mind. Mr Dee said: 'She was very scared and very worried about going through the process of what her mother went through, which was a very long, drawn-out process and very unpleasant. Legal action: Mr Dee is now suing the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust for clinical negligence . ‘They were just about to introduce her to another lady, of a similar age, who had been through the same condition and had successfully come out the other side. ‘That was just about to happen and then suddenly she was gone.’ He added: ‘Eileen has missed out on the prospect of being a grandmother, which is something she would have loved. ‘One of the most difficult decisions I have had to make was when to get my son, Matthew, home from overseas. But by the time I was very, very sure he should, and phoned him to say ""get over here now"", it was too late.’ Healthy people are rarely affected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common bacteria, but it has become a major cause of healthcare-related infections, especially for those with compromised immune systems like Eileen’s. The 68-year-old died in August 2013. Her cause of death was recorded as pneumonia but the Royal Sussex’s report says the coroner should have been made aware of the infection. Mr Dee is now suing the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust for clinical negligence. Melanie Minter, of Sussex law firm Mayo Wynne Baxter, said: “We say there were serious errors and gross negligence in respect of cleaning the haematology oncology unit.” Last month, the Trust pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of putting patients at risk over a period of more than six years in relation to a separate outbreak of legionella. A spokesman said the Trust could not comment on Eileen’s case while legal proceedings were ongoing.","Eileen Dee was being treated for cancer when she caught the lethal bug .

"Police in Thailand opened fire on a car driven by an 'crazy' American tourist after she drove the wrong way down a busy road and crashed into 13 vehicles, injuring two people. The 29-year-old woman, named by local media as Samantha or Amanda, was chased by police through the Pattaya region for 30 minutes before they shot out three wheels of her car. After the smashed-up car came to a halt, officers broke the front passenger window of the white Toyota Innova to arrest her when she refused to open the door. The 29-year-old American tourist drove into oncoming traffic in Thailand and crashed into 13 vehicles. Officers broke the front passenger window of the vehicle to arrest her when she refused to open the door . The blonde woman was then bundled into a police car - to protect her from an angry mob that had formed in the wake of the carnage, who hurled abuse and tried to attack the American. The Bangkok Post described how the woman played 'demolition derby' through the streets of Chon Buri's Banglamung district, in a saga which began when she drove the wrong way down Soi Siam Country Club in East Pattaya and clipped a motorbike. The driver did not stop - instead carrying on driving the wrong way down Sukhumvit Road, facing into traffic. As police pursued her the car hit 12 other vehicles. 'It was a crazy bit of driving,' a police officer told the Phuket Wan Tourism News. 'The American woman struck a motorcycle going the wrong side down the road then kept going. She turned a corner and kept hitting other vehicles, 13 at last count.' The left side of the white white Toyota Innova was damaged by the 'demolition derby' - the light was broken and the bonnet crushed .

"A  woman who was addicted to energy drinks  ballooned to a size 20 after spending £11,000 on her high-sugar habit in just four years. Jade Wimsey, 24, from Goole, East Yorkshire, would down up to seven cans a day at more than £1.50 a pop and totalling more than 1,540 calories. Her fizz addiction caused her weight to rocket to 17st 6lb. She is now a slim size 12 having shed six stone in 18 months by kicking the energy fuel for good. Jade Wimsey went from a size 12 to 20 in four years as she guzzled up to seven cans of energy drinks a day . 'I never associated energy drinks with gaining weight. I didn't really consider the hidden calorie or sugar content in them,' said Jade, who runs a blog called girlupnorth.co.uk. 'In fact, some energy drinks brands say the beverage speeds up your metabolism so I figured it was alright for me!' Jade's weight made her the victim of cruel jibes by male customers at the bar she worked at. She was even humiliated for her size by bullies on Facebook. 'I would down so many cans per day without thinking about it. Ditching energy drinks - alongside a healthy eating plan - made an astonishing difference to my weight.' Growing up, Jade had always lived a healthy lifestyle, eating home-cooked meals prepared by her mother. But that changed after she started university. Living away from home, Jade soon developed a taste for fast food and became hooked on energy drinks. Jade has reached her goal weight of 11 stone 6.5lbs after losing six stone from kicking her fizzy habit . 'Like most university students when they leave home for the first time, I started eating more takeaways and ready meals. 'Around the same time, I also discovered energy drinks. I loved the sweet taste of them and the caffeine kick they gave. 'Soon, I was relying on cans of the stuff to get me through the day. It got to the point where an energy drink was the first thing I drank when I got out of bed in the morning. 'I would insist on a can with every meal and then have a few extra as a snack. 'If I was driving, I'd down an energy drink. Then when I'd stopped at the petrol station, I'd pick up two more cans of the stuff. 'I would buy a can whenever I could get hold of one. If there was an offer on energy drinks, I would stock up on them. 'I could easily spend £10.50 on cans per day.' The 24-year-old from Yorkshire became the victim of cruel jibes as she ballooned to nearly 18 stone . In September 2013, she joined Slimming World, began a healthy diet and cut out energy drinks for good . Consuming between five to seven energy drinks every day, Jade piled on the pounds. She went from being a slim size 12/14 to a size 18. 'In my head, I thought it was fine to drink so many energy drinks. I never thought it would have any impact on my weight. 'But in reality, I was slurping all these empty calories.' Jade's fizzy beverage habit continued after she left university. Her graduate job as a bar supervisor allowed her to slurp energy drinks throughout the day. 'When I was working at the bar during the weekend, I would drink about seven energy drinks in a shift. 'I could take a can from the bar whenever I wanted and it helped me get through a busy night shift.' Jade was drinking so many cans of energy drinks  that it became a running joke with friends and family. She explained: 'My mates at work were always commenting about how many cans I had. 'Most of my family knew that I was really quite addicted to them too.' By the age of 22, Jade's weight had crept up to size 20 and her shape was affecting her confidence. 'I resigned myself to being the 'fat one' in my group of slim friends. I didn't like going out because I felt uncomfortable in clothes and I couldn't find anything that fitted me. 'My size stopped me from living my life to the full and socialising as much as I would have liked to.' 'I never associated energy drinks with gaining weight. I didn't really consider the hidden calorie or sugar content in them,' said Jade . Jade's weight also made her the victim of nasty comments and jibes. 'I felt self-conscious about how big I was,' she said. 'Working at the bar, a lot of the other female staff were bought drinks by male customers. But no one ever bought me a drink because I guess people thought I was unattractive. 'There were also a few occasions when men at the bar made unpleasant remarks about my appearance. 'But the final straw was when I came across someone's cruel Facebook status about me 'never having my head out of the fridge'. 'I was hurt but I decided that I was going to make changes in my life so that nobody could ever make me feel that way again.' As she started losing the weight, Jade started to get compliments and told she smiled a lot more now . The awful incident forced Jade to face her weight gain head-on. In September 2013, she joined Slimming World, began a healthy diet and cut out energy drinks for good. She explains: 'From the get-go, I decided I would go cold turkey on energy drinks. 'Quitting was difficult at first, I experienced a dip in energy and waking up in the morning without my normal kick was tough. 'But I found ways to cope with the withdrawal symptoms. For instance, I would keep a few healthy snacks with me when I was working a long shift at the bar so I wouldn't turn to a can. 'And I also really enjoyed the Slimming World diet. I felt I was eating delicious, homemade food again.' The pounds fell away and within four months, Jade had lost 2.5 stone. 'I started getting compliments about how I looked and friends started commenting about how much more I smiled now.' Snacks and drinks . 5 to 7 cans of energy drink per day and a chocolate bar .

I actually want to go out and socialise now whereas before I'd think of any excuse to stay at home. 'I get drinks bought for me when I'm working at the bar now too!' Jade - who is married to pub landlord, Jason, 44 - wants to help others lose weight through her blog. She explains: 'I feel the sky is the limit now. I would love to travel and help others in their weight-loss journeys.

"Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.","Experts question if  packed out planes are putting passengers at risk .

"Muhammad Naviede, 60, (pictured outside the Old Bailey in 1995) was killed instantly in a plane crash . A banking fraudster with links to Cherie Blair was killed instantly in a plane crash minutes after he sent a text saying his aircraft was going down, an investigation has revealed. Muhammad Naviede, who was jailed in 1995 for nine years for a £45million fraud, died after his Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire. The 60-year-old, whose daughter is a former X-Factor contestant, sent a text to a relative shortly before the crash on August 20 last year saying: 'I'm in a plane out of control and it's going down.' An investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the message was 'unusual' as the leased plane did not enter a spin until after it was sent. The experienced pilot had also tried to call the same relative before writing 148 characters within 25 seconds in a text - something the AAIB said would require 'considerable dexterity'. The report said: 'The pilot had accumulated considerable experience in a variety of aircraft in the years that he had been flying. He was familiar with the Piper Tomahawk aircraft and was in recent flying practice. 'It was suggested in his final text message that he had lost control of the aircraft, to such an extent that he did not expect to survive. 'However, after this message was sent, the aircraft continued in flight for more than two minutes, before entering a spin from which it did not recover.' Investigators found no fault with the aircraft and said weather conditions were unlikely to have caused the crash. Mr Naviede, of Regent's Park, London, had previously undertaken aerobatic training, meaning he 'would have recognised, and been able to recover from, a spin', according to the AAIB. The investigation also revealed the father-of-two had not booked a final destination for the fatal flight. Mr Naviede, whose personal wealth was once estimated to be £117million, was the former head of trade finance company Arrows, which collapsed owing more than £100 million to overseas banks and other creditors in 1991. He was the father of model and 2007 X-Factor contestant Raquelle Gracie, who was in girl band Hope, and had a record with Pharrell Williams. The girls initially auditioned for the fourth series as solo artists but judge Louis Walsh told them to re-audition as a band and they made it to the live shows where they came fifth. His Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire in August last year . The pilot had written a 148 character text within 25 seconds - something the Air Accident Investigation Branch said would require 'considerable dexterity especially in an aircraft that may have been out of control' Ms Gracie, who is married with an 18-month-old daughter, is now a yoga teacher and continues to sing after previously hosting an online news and gossip series on website Dipdive, created by will.i.am. His brother was the former Government race advisor Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004. In 1995, a jury at the Old Bailey convicted him of seven charges of fraudulent trading, obtaining property and services by deception and making false statements to obtain bank facilities. On the day of the crash, Mr Naviede had flown the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk from Elstree, Hertfordshire, to Turweston Aerodrome before heading on to White Waltham airfield near Maidenhead, Berkshire. He was then due to return to Elstree, but at 4.55pm Mr Naviede telephoned the aerodrome to say he would not be returning that day and did not book an alternative destination. The plane took off from White Waltham shortly after 5pm, heading north, and when he was just south of Buckingham, he began to fly in a circle for almost an hour at between 2,500ft and 4,700ft. His daughter Raquelle Gracie (far right) came fifth in the 2007 series of the X Factor with girl band Hope . It was at this time he made a number of calls on his mobile telephone and at 6.31pm he unsuccessfully tried to call the relative who he then sent the final text to. Investigators suggested that two minutes later he still had 'at least control of lateral flight'. The aircraft then turned to the left as the pilot sent out a 'Mayday' distress call, saying: 'Lost control of the aircraft and it's gone into a spin.' Mr Naviede then confirmed his location to the controller before saying: 'I can't control it.' Mr Naviede's brother was former Government race advisor, Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004 . The AAIB report said: 'It was apparent, from the witness accounts and the on-site evidence, that the aircraft had entered a spin from which it did not recover. 'The time elapsed during the pilot's final radio transmissions, together with the rate of descent deduced from the NASA videos, suggested that the spin was likely to have started from a minimum height of 2,500ft, and probably higher.' The report also highlighted strange aspects of Mr Naviede's behaviour on the day, although people who spoke to him said he appeared 'chatty, friendly and relaxed'. Investigators wrote: 'There were a number of events which took place in the course of the afternoon which represented unusual actions on the part of the pilot. 'It appears the pilot made a change of intended destination prior to leaving White Waltham. 'Having booked out for Elstree he subsequently called them to advise he would not be returning there. He did not book out to any other destination. 'After departing White Waltham and flying north for about half an hour, he flew in a large circular pattern for almost an hour. 'Although somewhat unusual, this may be explained by the need to re-charge the aircraft battery.' Mr Naviede, who had more than 3,000 hours of flying experience, died instantly in the crash and a post-mortem examination carried out on his body revealed he died as a result of multiple injuries. A date has not been set for an inquest but it is likely to take place in May with a jury.","Muhammad Naviede died after his Piper Tomahawk aircraft crashed in field .

"Everyone who comes to Britain should know how to speak English, Labour Ed Miliband has warned as he admitted Labour made mistakes on immigration. The Labour leader admitted that in the past his party had been 'too timid' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language. But the Tories said there was nothing in Mr Miliband's plans to act to reduce the number of people moving to Britain, after net migration hit 298,000 in a year. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband admitted that in the past his party had been 'too timid' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language . Mr Miliband pledged a new crackdown on illegal exploitation of migrant workers, promising a Home Office task force to boost prosecutions and fines on bad employers. Speaking in Wirral West - a marginal seat held by the Tory Employment Minister Esther McVey - the Labour leader said exploitation drives low skilled migration and holds down wages for British workers. His new unit of 100 staff will bring together people from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and specialist police units, together with additional Home Office enforcement staff. The unit will be empowered to investigate abuse and be challenged to increase prosecutions and fines levelled against employers who break the rules. But he also warned that migrants must learn to speak English, especially in key services like the NHS. Mr Miliband said: 'Our communities are changing fast but we don't cope with change by closing our doors to each other and living our lives in separate worlds. 'Instead we must find a way to live together across communities. 'A Britain where people of all backgrounds, all cultures, all religions, can practise their own faiths but also come together to forge a common identity. 'But we can only build this shared society if we speak the same language.' In his speech in Pensby, northern England, Mr Miliband insisted that there was an 'epidemic of exploitation' He said his own parents had learned to speak English after arriving from Belgium in 1940. 'It is why I believe in a simple principle: Everyone in Britain should know how to speak English. 'Sometimes, we've been too timid about this but it is something we should expect from everyone who comes here. 'And it is especially important that people who work in public services in public facing roles should be required to speak English.' He said that 'nowhere is that more true' than in the health service. 'We all know the crucial contribution that people from overseas play in our NHS. Doctors, paramedics, social workers, nurses. Bringing specialist skills that we need. 'I will never demean or devalue their contribution to our country. 'But it is vital that people who come to fulfil these roles don't just have the right medical skills, but can communicate with those for whom they care. 'So in the future all healthcare professionals will be required to speak English to a sufficient standard so they can care effectively for patients.' The Labour leader, pictured greeting staff and students at Pensby High School, also used the speech to promise Labour would do more to secure the borders - with 1,000 extra staff at ports - and help integration . Mr Miliband told the audience how his 'parents came to Britain to flee the horrors of Nazi Germany'. He said: 'They found a country that welcomed them and offered them the opportunity to build a new life. To start a family. To work hard and make a contribution. 'I wouldn't be standing here today, asking you to elect me your Prime Minister, if it wasn't for the generosity of this great country. Conservative immigration minister James Brokenshire said nothing Ed Miliband is proposing would help control immigration . 'Where we are always stronger when we draw on the widest range of talents, perspectives and cultures. 'But I also know for that to happen, there have to be proper controls on immigration. We have got to have the right rules in place and with a Labour government we will.' He went on: 'I've been very clear about the mistakes the last Labour government made. 'We were wrong not to ensure there were maximum transitional controls when new countries joined the European Union in 2004. 'And the reason we were wrong is that working people were seeing dramatic changes in their communities that were not planned or properly prepared for. 'And we won't make that mistake in future.' Conservative immigration minister James Brokenshire said: 'Nothing Ed Miliband is proposing would help control immigration. Labour sent out 'search parties for people' and under them net migration increased more than five-fold. 'Since 2010, we have stripped more than 850 bogus colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students, cracked down on illegal working and sham marriages, made it harder for people to live in the UK illegally, and reduced the number of appeal routes to stop spurious attempts to remain in the country. 'And the next Conservative government will seek changes to the operation of European free movement rules as a key part of our plan to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU. 'But a vote for Ed Miliband would risk all of that with a Labour-SNP stitch up.'","Labour leader says speaking English is especially important in the NHS .

"Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full-face veil while appearing in court, Britain's most senior judge has suggested. Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, said judges and courtrooms should allow women to wear the traditional dress as they should 'show, and be seen to show' respect towards different customs. He said judges should be 'sensitive' to the fact that they usually came from 'more privileged sector of society' than many of those facing them and they should have an understanding of the 'different cultural and social habits'. Lord Neuberger said Britain's privileged judges must be aware of their 'subconscious bias' when dealing with poorer members of society . His address to the Criminal Justice Alliance came at a time of uncertainty over the place of Muslim traditional dress in the legal system. Following a controversial trial in 2003 of a Muslim woman accused of witness intimidation, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said there was a need for clear guidance on the issue. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. The 22-year-old was later sentenced to six months in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court after changing her plea. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. Here she pictured during her court hearing . Last year, the European Court of Human Rights upheld a ban by France on wearing the Muslim full-face veil, the niqab. A case was brought by a 24-year-old French woman, who argued that the ban on wearing the veil in public violated her freedom of religion and expression. In Lord Neuberger's address, he said judges and lawyers often failed to recognise how 'artificial and intimidating' courts could be for ordinary people. He said: 'I sometimes wonder whether our trial procedures really are the best way of getting at the truth. 'Would you feel that you had given of your best if you had been forced to give evidence in unfamiliar surroundings, with lots of strangers watching, in an intimidating court, with lawyers in funny clothes asking questions, often aggressively and trying to catch you out, and with no ability to tell the story as you remember it?' Dawson was later sentenced to six months in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) He said this did not mean a call for a major overhaul of court proceedings but said judges, lawyers and court staff must do as much as possible to help people feel at ease in court. He continued: 'Judges have to show, and have to be seen to show, respect to everybody equally, and that requires an understanding of different cultural and social habits. 'It is necessary to have some understanding as to how people from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave. 'Well known examples include how some religions consider it inappropriate to take the oath, how some people consider it rude to look other people in the eye, how some women find it inappropriate to appear in public with their face uncovered, and how some people deem it inappropriate to confront others or to be confronted – for instance with an outright denial. Lord Neuberger also suggested Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full face veil while appearing in court . 'More broadly, judges should be courteous and, generally, good-humoured; and, while they should be firm, they should never, however great the temptation, lose their temper.' The judge made the comments a week ago during an address to the Criminal Justice Alliance, in which he spoke of modern aspects of the British legal system. In a lengthy speech entitled 'Fairness in the courts: the best we can do', Lord Neuberger also said judges and lawyers should always keep in mind how 'intimidating' the court process can be for those involved in trials, including 'the parties, their families, the victims, the witnesses and the jurors'. Speaking in the context of legal aid cuts, he said the importance of ensuring all parties involved in a case understand the goings-on in a court is now greater because 'people are having to choose between representing themselves or not getting justice at all'. He also said: 'Judges may not appear to be neutral because they will almost always be seen, normally rightly, to come from a more privileged sector of society, in both economic and educational terms, compared with many of the parties, witnesses, jurors in court. 'A white male public school judge presiding in a trial of an unemployed traveller from Eastern Europe accused of assaulting or robbing a white female public school woman will, I hope, always be unbiased. 'However, he should always think to himself what his subconscious may be thinking or how it may be causing him to act.' Keith Porteous Wood, Executive Director of the National Secular Society, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Lord Neuberger understandably recommends judges understand the expectations of how those 'from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave' and that the judiciary should show 'respect to everybody equally'. 'It was a missed opportunity, however, not to acknowledge that occasionally – for example on a defendant wearing a full face veil – doing so might conflict with justice being seen to be done, or even justice being done. 'My concern is not theoretical; it is now 18 months since a judge at Blackfriars Magistrate Court wasted a great deal of court time dealing with the question of full-face veils, and made a heartfelt plea for central guidance to avoid this inefficient use of expensive court's resources being replicated elsewhere. 'The Lord Chief Justice's office has been dealing with this for a long time but seems disappointingly reluctant to issue any direction.'","Lord Neuberger said Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full-face veil when appearing in court to show respect to 'different customs .
He also said judges must be aware of their 'subconscious bias'
Judges are 'rightly' seen as from 'privileged' part of society, he said .

"Hillary Clinton's most trusted – and most controversial – campaign aide turned up on Wednesday near Des Moines, Iowa, where the former secretary of state sat for her second staged 'roundtable' discussion in as many days. Abedin had last surfaced on Monday at an Ohio Chipotle restaurant when she and Clinton popped in, both wearing sunglasses, for lunch. On Tuesday she was photographed leaving a Norwalk, Iowa fruit processing company and walking toward 'Scooby,' the now-famous customized black van that Secret Service agents have driven more than 1,000 miles since Sunday. HUMA, SANS BURRITO: Abedin left Capital City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa on Wednesday ahead of Hillary Clinton, and headed toward the campaign van that aides have nicknamed 'Scooby' STYLISH: Human sported a Louis Vuitton bag and walked alongside an unidentified campaign staffer . ALL DONE! Clinton had just finished a limited-access 'roundtable' discussion on small business issues . Abedin has known Clinton since 1996, when she scored a White House internship working for the then-first lady. In 2008 Clinton tapped her to be her 'body woman' when she ran for president the first time. She shadowed Hillary everywhere and anticipated her every need – from food orders and dry cleaning to lint rollers and cosmetic touch-ups. When Clinton became secretary of state a year later, Abedin became her deputy chief of staff. It was there that she became linked to most recent in a series of scandals that Clinton will carry as heavy baggage whiel she runs for the White House. Daily Mail Online confirmed in March that Abedin had a personal email address on Clinton's home-brew server, the same piece of hardware that stored Clinton's communications from her tenure at State until she deleted more than 32,000 of the records. Abedin (left), shown with then-Secretary of State Clinton during a 2010 diplomatic meeting in Vietnam, was her deputy chief of staff . Spotted: Hillary and Huma order at Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio, at lunchtime on Tuesday – the first time they had been seen all day. But nobody in the restaurant recognized them during their 45-minute meal . Abedin keeps a low profile, a choice that a Democratic Party insider said is the product of two problems. 'First, you never want to be more famous than your boss,' the source explained on Wednesday. 'And then there's the Weiner problem.' Abedin is married to disgraced former New York Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, whose spectacular fall from grace came after he was exposed for sending lurid Twitter messages to women – including one of his barely covered genitalia. She stood by him through the embarrassment and through his resignation from Congress. Weiner ran for Mayor of New York City last year, only to see his stock tumble with a second round of sexting allegations, this time confirmed by the woman he was exchanging racy messages with. 'Scooby' is a customized and armored Chevy van that Clinton and her top staffers occupied during a 1,000-mile trip from New York to Iowa this week . EMAIL-GATE: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Abedin and Weiner have a 2-year-old child together. After she returned from maternity leave in June 2012, the State Department made a special accommodation for her that is now the subject of an inspector general accommodation. Abedin was permitted to shift her employment classification from 'employee' to 'Special Government Employee,' a perk that allowed her to have a second income while drawing a government salary. That moonlight gig was at Teneo Holdings, a corporate consulting firm founded by Doug Band, a longtime Bill Clinton confidant. The State Department paid Abedin $135,000 per year to work part-time from her New York City home. Teneo paid her an additional $355,000 via an annual contract. The whopping combined income helped her household stay financially afloat in the wake of Weiner's resignation, and his loss of a congressional salary.","Abedin was Clinton's deputy chief of staff at the State Department and was her 'body woman' during the 2008 presidential campaign .

"Perched on a hotel sofa barely inches from Glynis Barber, I am trying, as covertly as possible, to scrutinise her rather lovely face. All peachy skin and thick, glossy locks, she also looks trim and toned in skinny jeans. It’s difficult to believe that in the next few months, the actress – remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of ITV’s 1980s detective duo Dempsey And Makepeace – will be collecting her bus pass. From where I’m sitting, she looks barely a day over 40. It is impossible, frankly, not to wonder whether Mother Nature has been given a, shall we say, little helping hand. There is no ‘pillow face’ here or unnaturally shaped eyebrows (a telltale sign). So has she and would she? Scroll down for video . Then and now: Tearing up the rulebook: Glynis Barber, pictured left in 1984, and right, the actress today . Glynis Barber, pictured at The Olivier Awards at The Royal Opera House in London last week . It’s a question that Glynis answers diplomatically. ‘I am a bit surgery-phobic – I am a total coward,’ she insists. ‘I don’t judge anyone for doing it – people have to do what’s right for them. But for me a healthy lifestyle is the key.’ It’s hard to argue with that sentiment. And this, indeed, is why we are meeting. For the past two years, under the tutelage of nutritional therapist Fleur Borrelli, Glynis has changed what and how she eats – and in the process, she says, transformed her health and her figure. She tore up her rulebook too: out went breakfast – instead she has just two large meals a day. Out, too, went wholegrains and she even stopped sipping water in the day, something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger. So convinced is she that what Fleur taught her is the key to long-lasting health and wellbeing that she has co-written a book with her, The In-Sync Diet, in which she shares their discoveries, backed up, she says, by credible new research. ‘I had no idea that when I met Fleur I would drop a stone in weight and a dress size, gain lean muscle, and have vastly improved energy levels, all while turning upside down the things I previously believed in,’ Glynis says. ‘But that’s what has happened and it’s why I wanted to share it with a wider audience.’ The actress (pictured with co-star Michael Brandon) is remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of ITV’s 1980s detective duo Dempsey And Makepeace . Ironically, Glynis once thought herself the last person to need a lifestyle reboot. Always fit, she went organic in her late 20s at a time when it was barely heard of. ‘This was the 1980s so everyone thought I was mad, although it made complete sense to me,’ she recalls. ‘My view was it was silly to put chemicals in your body that don’t need to be there, but that was forward-thinking at the time. It was me, Prince Charles and some hippies. But I stuck to it.’ Glynis, married to her Dempsey And Makepeace co-star Michael Brandon, has enjoyed a busy career in theatre and TV, but two years ago started to develop unexplained joint pain and was advised by her osteopath to see Fleur. ‘I was actually pretty resistant at first as I thought the one thing I know is how to eat properly,’ she explains. But Fleur thought differently. ‘One by one she busted a lot of the myths that were a cornerstone of my diet.’ First to face scrutiny was Glynis’s fondness for wholegrains. ‘I was surprised as I knew about processed grains but I thought wholewheat was fine, until Fleur explained that it creates inflammation in the gut. She told me to cut them out.’ Aging well: Glynis, pictured left in her 30s, will be celebrate turning 60 soon, but she looks barely a day over 40 . It meant a gluten-free diet – not easy for a self-confessed ‘breadaholic’. Pasta was also jettisoned, replaced by protein and vegetables. ‘At first I thought, “I can’t do this,” ’ she explains. ‘But now I don’t miss them at all. I eat salmon, eggs, nuts, organic turkey and salads.’ And it was not just what she ate but when that Fleur also changed. Glynis ate little and often in the belief it kept her blood sugar levels regulated. But Fleur told her that cutting out breakfast altogether and eating two large meals a day was a better way of regulating her metabolism. This is backed up by new research into intermittent fasting, which shows that better weight control can be achieved with long periods without eating – popularised by the 5:2 diets, in which you consume very few calories for two days of the week and eat a normal, balanced diet the rest of the time. Some studies have found the same benefits – which also include lower cholesterol and blood pressure – might be gained by daily ‘fasts’ achieved by eating dinner then nothing else until lunch the next day. Then came what Glynis drank. ‘I was one of those people who walked around clutching a water bottle and sipping at it throughout the day,’ she says. ‘But new research shows that drinking little and often actually doesn’t help the cells replenish properly. It’s far better to drink a large glass of water when you’re thirsty.’ Glynis tore up her rulebook too: out went breakfast and she even stopped sipping water in the day, something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger . Initially cynical, Glynis says she was amazed by how easy it was to adapt. ‘What I was trying to overturn were the habits of a lifetime and I thought it would be incredibly hard, but it honestly took a matter of weeks. It’s not set in stone either. If I want the odd blowout, or I really fancy breakfast, then I have it.’ Aided by her regular cardio and hot yoga sessions, she believes she is in better shape than she was 20 years ago. ‘I have always been fit but I used to get incredibly tired. Now I am bursting with energy.’ And, Glynis insists, she is less likely to scrutinise herself. ‘I actually feel less vain now than I did in my youth. I’m very comfortable in my skin and I’m really not hung up on age at all. You can’t do anything about your chronological age, but how you age is up to you.’ The In-Sync Diet, by Glynis Barber and Fleur Borrelli, is published by Autharium on Friday. The actress follows a gluten-free diet, with food like pasta jettisoned, replaced by protein and vegetables . Why hydration is key . By Barney Calman, Health Editor . We should all drink at least two litres of water a day – about eight glasses. If we do, we’ll be slimmer, have better skin, fewer health problems and the like. Right? Well, no, actually. The whole two-litres-a-day idea is based on no real scientific evidence. In fact, one of the only studies to suggest its benefits was sponsored by, you’ve guessed it, a mineral water firm. Dehydration can be fatal, and in the case of the elderly, sick children or those with other health problems, a watchful eye should be kept on water intake. But in normal, healthy adults, the body is well adapted to make sure this doesn’t happen. If you drink too little, you get thirsty, and go to the loo less. If you drink a lot, you generally pee it all out. And in fact, the best way to make sure is to check the colour of your urine. Ideally, it should be a shade of pale straw and no darker.","Glynis Barber is known as beautiful half of ITV’s 1980s detective duo .

"A year after he launched his own app and made headlines, Leo Grand is still homeless . On the night he launched his first app, a homeless man predicted that his life was going to change. 'I can work at Google, I can work at SpaceX,' Leo Grand gleefully stated minutes after his carpooling app Trees for Cars went live. 'This will change my life in a magnificent way.' It's been a year and a half since that moment led to Grand and his mentor, Patrick McConlogue, becoming media sensations. But Trees for Cars is no longer available, and Grand is still homeless, Mashable reported. In August 2013 McConlogue offered Grand, the homeless man he saw every day on his walk to work in New York City, a deal: He would either give him $100, or he would teach him how to code. Grand realized he could go through '$100 in a few days' and instead jumped at the opportunity to learn something new that he could then 'turn into something more,' he told Business Insider in 2013. McConlogue provided Grand with daily lessons, as well as a laptop, wireless hot spot, coding books, a solar charger and office space at the start-up where he worked once it got too cold to type outside. Grand, who once said he wasn't 'the average homeless person' and that he considered himself 'eco-friendly', came up with an app designed to get more cars off the road. 'When I first launched my app it was good,' Grand told Mashable this week. 'I was excited, the press was excited, it was just a great moment.' Grand and McConlogue appeared on TV shows, and he says people loved him everywhere and gave him free coffee at restaurants. Being on NBC, he said, was the highlight of his year. 'We got to stay in a nice hotel at Rockefeller Plaza. A nice, swanky hotel. We got the red carpet rolled out in front of us!' he said. But Grand is still living on the streets, and he said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless. Grand created Trees and Cars after Patrick McConlogue offered him a deal: $100 in cash on the spot or daily coding lessons. Grand picked the latter, and was also provided a laptop, office space and coding books . But Grand is still living on the streets. He said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless . Trees for Cars only made Grand between $10,000 to 15,000 dollars, he said. And McConlogue has since taken a job in San Francisco, although he still meets up with Grand every time he's back in New York. The app is no longer in online stores because Grand does not want to pay for its server space. Grand instead uses the money he made from the app to pay for his storage space. He also keeps some possessions in a shopping cart. He insists that he likes living outdoors, although he said he plans to move into an apartment after he makes his second app. Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have made a different app the first time around. 'I would've probably come up with a better idea for a mobile application that can generate a ton of revenue,' he told Mashable. For now, Grand said he does not code everyday anymore. He said 'life' is the reason for that. 'I've got the books, I've got the laptop, I've got the office space. I just haven't been able to get over there recently.' Grand, who gets by with welding jobs and worked for MetLife until he lost his job in 2011, once said the most hurtful thing someone could say to him was that he was dumb or not intelligent. 'Homelessness is not a feature of someone or a condition,' McConlogue said. 'It is something that people put a lot of people - in a lot of different situations - into one giant box.' Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have 'come up with a better ideal' that would have generated more revenue. He said he only made around $10-15,000 with Trees for Cars .","Leo Grand was offered a deal: either $100 or lessons in coding from Patrick McConlogue, who passed him on the street every day .

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation is facing accusations that it is 'whitewashing' possible Saudi Arabian involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. A commission designed to review evidence about the world-changing bombings has not delved into an FBI agent's claims that a Saudi Florida family had ties to the hijackers after the agency said that the report was 'unsubstantiated'. Relatives of homeowner Esam Ghazzawi lived in the plush Sarasota dwelling until they fled and left cars, furniture and food in their refrigerator behind right before the 9/11, prompting some to say they knew about the attacks. Scroll down for video . The FBI's handling of reports about a Saudi family fleeing Florida two weeks before the 9/11 attacks has raised suspicion that the agency is whitewashing any involvement by the Middle Eastern country . The family of Abdulaziz al-Hijji and his wife Anoud left their 3,300 square foot Florida home in August 2001, but did not take cars, furniture or food from their fridge . The daughter and son-in-law of Ghazzawi, who worked as an adviser to a member of the Saudi royal family, had stayed at the 3,300 square foot house for six years but left in late August 2001, not even leaving a forwarding address. An FBI agent who investigated the disappearance after neighbors thought it was suspicious said that the family had 'many connections to individuals associated with the terrorist attacks on 9/11/2001'. At least one 'family member' had attended the same Venice, Florida, flight school as some of the hijackers, according to a piece in the New York Post. Mohamed Atta, the leader of the hijackers, and two other terrorists on the flights, Marwan Al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah, were also reported to have visited the Sarasota house, according to Florida Bulldog. Anoud Al-Hijji, Ghazzawi's daughter, later returned to America to sell the home. The 9/11 Commission wrote that 'The FBI told the Review Commission that the [FBI report] on which the news article was based was ""poorly written"" and wholly unsubstantiated...' 'When questioned later by others in the FBI, the special agent who wrote [it] was unable to provide any basis for the contents of the document or explain why he wrote it as he did'. Esam Ghazzawi, who owned the Sarasota home, was an adviser to a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd (left). Some observers have speculated that the Middle Eastern country helped back Osama Bin Laden (right) Ziad Samir Jarrah (left) Mohamed Atta (center) and Marwan Al-Shehhi (right) all reportedly visited the Florida home owned by the Saudi advisor at points before they carried out the heinous 9/11 attacks . The Review Commission said the FBI claimed it 'found no evidence that connected the family members in the Miami Herald article to any of the 9/11 hijackers, nor was there any connection found between the family and the 9/11 plot'. The FBI's dismissal of the report has led some to question whether the agency is covering up evidence of possible Saudi backing for 9/11. Former Florida Senator Bob Graham told the Miami Herald:  'The FBI has served America through most of its history. There were stumbles by the agency before 9/11 and since the tragedy there has been a consistent effort to cover up the extent of Saudi Arabia’s involvement.' The Congressional Joint Inquiry into the attack, which Graham co-chaired, contained 28 fully  pages that are said to have spoken about who financed 9/11 that were fully redacted by the Bush administration. Senator Graham said the pages 'point a very strong finger' at the government of Saudi Arabia, rather than wealthy Saudi individuals, as the backers of the attack. They also implicate  officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington for involvement with 9/11 hijackers in San Diego, sources told Hoover Institute fellow Paul Sperry. The FBI told the 9/11 Review Commission that the original report about the Sarasota family's connections was unsubstantiated. Above, the National September 11 Memorial in New York City . Some such as former Florida senator Bob Graham (right) have said that there has been a consistent effort to cover up Saudi involvement. Left, the World Trade Center memorial . The recent Review Commission, which was created by Congress last year to look into evidence not considered by the FBI, said there was 'no evidence' that Saudi officials were involved. Information about the Sarasota family was not included in the original 2004 9/11 Commission report and the information was not shared with Congress. The agent in question was not identified. The Commission did not interview him or Senator Graham or his investigators. Review Commission officials' report said that the FBI needed to strengthen information sharing to combat further terrorist threats. Abdulaziz al-Hijji, the son-in-law who lived in Sarasota, has recently lived in London and worked for Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, according to the Telegraph. 'I love the USA. My kids were born there, I went to college and university there, I spent a good portion of my life there and I love it,' he said in 2012. Reports have claimed that al-Hijji and his father-in-law Ghazzawi were both on FBI watch lists before 9/11. The new Saudi king Salman also directed government charities in the 1990s that are thought to have funneled funds to Al Qaeda.","Al-Hijji family left cars and food behind when they fled in August 2001 .

"A union secretary has slammed supermarket chain Aldi for trying to overturn workplace laws and gain the right to force employees to work more than 38 hours a week. The Transport Workers' Union's National Secretary Tony Sheldon condemned the requested change to the Fair Work Act and accused Aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. 'Major retailers like Aldi are trying to turn the clocks back on our modern society to reintroduce serfdom,' Mr Sheldon in a statement. Aldi has requested the ability to make employees work more than 38 hours in a submission to Workplace Relations Productivity Commission . 'Their model is to keep workers employed on vulnerable part-time and casual basis, increasing and reducing their hours when they see fit.' National Secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Tony Sheldon,  accused Aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom . His comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the Workplace Relations Productivity Commission, in which it recommended that the National Employment Standards be amended to 'enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week'. Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees 'overwhelmingly supported' and 'preferred' the proposals. 'ALDI's experience is that employees are keen for the opportunity of guaranteed additional hours and commensurate income, and prefer this arrangement to a limit of 38 hours plus additional hours to be worked as needed,' David Zalunardo, Aldi's managing director, wrote. However Mr Sheldon argued that the employer had been stopped for good reason, saying the chain had tried to 'strip workers of their rights'. 'The Transport Workers' Union and its members acted against this billion-dollar company in 2012, when it tried to strip workers of their right to refuse to work unreasonably long hours,' he said. Mr Sheldon responded by saying: 'Aldi... believes the right of workers to challenge bad workplace agreements is ""not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy""' 'Aldi then failed the legal and fairness test, but now in a submission to the Productivity Commission it is seeking again to scrap the same safeguards. 'We can only hope that Aldi's dream for the Australian economy never comes true.' The grocery store also protested union's power to interfere in enterprise agreements, arguing that a recent incident, in which a union representing only 'a very small number of employees' delayed an agreement, caused 'negative consequences…in terms of uncertainty, financial costs and distraction from managing the business'. 'Based on our experience, the length of time taken for FWC consideration of enterprise agreements can be unduly prolonged, costly and disruptive to continuing business operations, which is disadvantageous to all stakeholders. This is not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy,' Mr Zalunardo wrote. Mr Sheldon responded by saying: 'Aldi... believes the right of workers to challenge bad workplace agreements is ""not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy"".'","Aldi has requested the ability to make employees work more than 38 hours in a submission to Workplace Relations Productivity Commission .

"It's a mark of popularity most politicians would give their right arm for – and proof that should Boris Johnson ever run for Tory leader, he has the female vote. The London Mayor was given a big kiss on his right cheek by a particularly enthusiastic voter yesterday as he helped colleagues campaign in Ramsgate. And as he got in his car later, he was spotted with red lipstick marks on his other cheek. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson received such a positive welcome in Ramsgate he was driven away with a lipstick mark on his cheek . Mr Johnson recieves an ethusiastic kiss - as female support for the Tory Mayor shows no sign of abating . Two young women take a selfie with Mr Johnson as he campaigned through London yesterday . Mr Johnson poses for yet another selfie with a young fan, before he took to the streets of Ramsgate, Kent . Boris Johnson yesterday fronted a major Tory push into Nigel Farage's backyard as he was mobbed – and kissed – by fans in the seat where the Ukip leader hopes to become an MP. The London Mayor took to the streets of Ramsgate, boasting that the polls were turning in the Tories' favour. After touring shops and eating icecreams, Mr Johnson said he 'profoundly and passionately' hopes to stop Mr Farage from winning the target seat of South Thanet. Mr Farage has vowed to quit as Ukip leader if he fails to win the seat, where the Tories are defending a majority of 7,600. After some polls suggested that he could struggle, Ukip has stepped up its resources in the Kent seat. But the Tories hope to appeal to people supporting other parties who want to stop Ukip that they 'can vote for us and cut the head off the snake'. On his walkabout yesterday, Mr Johnson insisted voters knew that only the Tories can secure the recovery: 'There is a real risk other parties could mistakenly persuade people there was any other option.' With Tory Craig Mackinlay at his side, Mr Johnson ate icecream in Tory party blue, chatted to locals sitting outside pubs and handed out leaflets. As he was driven away from the seat, he was pictured with a lipstick mark on his cheek. Mr Mackinlay, a former Ukip deputy leader, is locked in a tight fight with Mr Farage, with Labour's Will Scobie close behind. Mr Johnson yesterday joined Tory Craig Mackinlay, who is defending a Conservative majority of around 7,600 in the South Thanet seat . The pair ate Tory blue icecreams at at Sorbetta as they toured shops and businesses in Ramsgate, with Mr Johnson boasting that the polls are turning in the Conservatives' favour . Mr Johnson was met by the usual mob of journalists and turned heads as he walked down the main street toward's the Kent town's harbour. But the mayor - who is running his own campaign to enter Parliament as MP for Uxbridge - also drew placard-waving Ukip supporters. The high profile Conservative was not universally welcomed and was questioned by one person on why the Tories only started paying attention to the seat once Mr Farage announced he was running. Another asked Mr Johnson if he himself would vote Ukip, while the eurosceptic party ensured two of its ad vans followed the group around the town. During his visit, Mr Johnson chatted to people enjoying a drink outside in the bright sunshine at The Royal pub, visited the Rokka cafe and sampled bright blue bubblegum flavour ice cream at Sorbetta. On his walkabout yesterday, Mr Johnson insisted voters knew that only the Tories can secure the recovery . Mr Johnson denied his rare campaign stop outside the capital was an attempt to revitalise a Tory campaign criticised by some for being too negative . Mr Johnson repeatedly told passersby he and Mr Mackinlay were campaigning for 'regeneration for Ramsgate' Speaking to journalists, Mr Johnson denied his rare campaign stop outside the capital was an attempt to revitalise a Tory campaign criticised by some for being too negative. He said: 'I think that on the contrary if you look at the polls at the minute it's very, very interesting. 'You are starting to see some Tory leads but also the poll of polls is starting to put us ahead on average. 'Last week I think we were a point or so behind on average and this week we're ahead. 'I think people are slowly starting to focus on this election, on the choice that is before them and on the record of Conservative government in pulling the economy out of the mire, getting it back on the road. 'There is a real risk other parties could mistakenly persuade people there was any other option.' There was a lot of love for the Mayor when he later visited Finchley in north London . Mr Johnson, who repeatedly told passersby he and Mr Mackinlay were campaigning for 'regeneration for Ramsgate', said he was eager to see the former Ukip leader join the Tory ranks in Parliament. Constituency polling has suggested Mr Mackinlay, who was a founding member of Ukip and contested seats for the party at past general elections, is narrowly ahead of Mr Farage. The Ukip leader has waged his own high profile campaign in the constituency, which was won by the Conservatives on a narrow majority in 2010.

"Ian Gibson, a former soldier who had his kneecap blown off in combat and is suing his employer after a colleague nicknamed him Hoppy . A former soldier who had his kneecap blown off in combat more than 30 years ago is suing his employer after he was nicknamed 'Hoppy' by a colleague. Today, ex-Army tank driver Ian Gibson from Hillingdon in Middlesex told an employment tribunal that he was subjected to a tirade of 'horrible harassment' while working at H and G Contracting Services Ltd at Heathrow Airport. The 60-year-old joined the company as plane refueller in December 2007, three decades after he was medically discharged from the British Army's Parachute Regiment. His job involved kneeling down, removing a manhole cover and connecting the fuel pipe  to refuel planes. In 2010 he underwent a knee replacement and had further surgery on his other knee two years later. Mr Gibson claims that bosses failed to make his job easier after the pain in his knee became too excruciating and was overlooked for an office-based job, which was instead offered to a man he said bullied him about being disabled. He told the tribunal in Reading: 'I suffered bullying and harassment and discrimination as a result of my disability, in particular from Mike Baldwin who bullied me because of my disability and the way I walk. 'On my return to work there was no medical or risk assessment. I carried on the work without adjustments which caused further pain.' Mr Gibson added that he was offered a temporary admin role in the workshop at the firm in November 2013. However, when he lodged a grievance complaint about the bullying, he was told his admin job would not be made permanent. He also claimed he was not informed about a vacancy for a workshop/site service manager role when he was off work. He added: ' I feel the reason was because I lodged a grievance and was a hassle to the company. 'I think I was deliberately not informed of the position. Mike Baldwin told me he had already been offered the job before I was given an interview. 'He called me ""Hoppy"" because of my limp. The way I walk has been a real difficulty for me. He said to me ""they could get a tart in for £16,000 to do your job, disabled or not so watch yourself"". 'In April 2014, he called me 'Hoppy' and said ""I don't know why you joined the Army, jumping out of planes for what? This f****d up country, you must be f*****g stupid, look at you, it has left you with f***** up legs"".' Mr Gibson claimed he was subjected to the bullying and harassment while working at Heathrow Airport, pictured,  for H and G Contracting Services Ltd  (file picture) Naomi Cunningham, representing H and G Contracting Services Ltd, challenged Mr Gibson asking him if the nickname was just 'harmless'. But he added: 'To you it might be, to me it isn't I got a limp serving this country if you want to go down that route. 'My grandchildren do not like coming around as much as they used to call me grumpy granddad.' Miss Cunningham also said the company might have had no reason to think Mr Gibson was suitable for the job of a site service manager due to a lack of experience and that the office-based job was always meant to be permanent. But the grandfather replied: 'There was scores missing from my CV. I had one night to do it, I had been with H and G for years. 'It was a temporary job but I was told to keep working hard and management will try and get it permanent for me. I was under that impression.'","Ian Gibson claims he was bullied at H and G Contracting Services Ltd .

"A humble wooden deckchair recovered from the doomed Titanic has sold for £100,350 at auction. The Nantucket wooden chair, which once sat on a first-class promenade of the ill-fated ship, was salvaged by a search team from the Atlantic Ocean after the Titanic sank in 1912. Dubbed 'one of the rarest types of Titanic collectable', the chair is too fragile to sit on, but has been carefully preserved, having been owned by a British collector for the past 15 years. A 103-year-old deckchair recovered from the wreck of the Titanic is expected sold for £100,000 at auction . The ship's log records six or seven deckchairs being picked up and taken back to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia. One was given by a crew member to Captain Julien Lemarteleur, who had previously worked on board the Mackay-Bennett. The anonymous seller kept it by a large window overlooking the sea at his home on the south coast, never sat on it due to its fragile state and instead used it as a display item. It was sold yesterday at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Devizes, Wiltshire, to a UK buyer. Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, described the piece as one of 'the most important [bits] of Titanic memorabilia around'. He said: 'It is incredibly rare to find something of that size that was on Titanic, was salvaged and that still exists today. Six or seven recovered deckchairs were stacked on the deck of the Mackay-Bennett as it arrived in Nova Scotia . Titanic (above) sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14 . It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic . He said that he was 'very, very pleased' with the price. The chair is made of teak wood and has an adjustable footrest at the front. It is 57 inches long, 23 inches wide and 35 inches tall. It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic. Upon his death in 1973, Capt Lemarteleur gave the chair to colleague Captain Robin Lee. The current owner acquired it in 2001. Sold with the chair was an in depth 'provenance package' that authenticates history and association with Titanic. Captain Julien Lemarteleur (above), who collected the chair from the Mackay-Bennett more than 100 years ago . It includes a signed affidavit from Margarete Pennington, who was Mr Lemarteleur's housekeeper in the 1960s. In it she states: 'I personally saw the deckchair that Captain Lemarteleur told me about on many occasions. He said that various pieces of debris taken from the ocean including this Titanic deckchair he acquired. 'I recognise the chair as the same chair I saw in the captain's garage and of which the captain identified as coming from the Titanic.' Craig Sopin, 57, a lawyer from Philadelphia, owns one of the world's largest collections of Titanic memorabilia. He also authenticated the chair and said: 'It isn't often that one has the opportunity to acquire such an important part of Titanic's story. 'For such a significant item to have such a meticulous chain of custody is nothing short of astonishing. Its history can be traced from the auction house back to Titanic itself.' Titanic sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14. A ship, the Carpathia, picked up more than 700 survivors in lifeboats hours later and took them back to New York. White Star Line chartered four ships, including the Halifax-based cable-laying vessel the Mackay-Bennett, to recover the bodies.","Chair was on first class deck when ship hit an iceberg in April 1912 .

"For six months Chris Rowe was plagued by an irritating cough. Repeated visits to doctors were met with the same conclusion - the 31-year-old was most likely suffering a 'simple' virus. The father-of-one, whose wife Kate is expecting their second child  in June, was dismissed by doctors five times in two months - despite reporting on one visit that he was coughing up blood. But, after noticing a dull ache in his ribs, and coughing up more blood, he was taken to A&E. There, an X-ray revealed a devastating diagnosis - Mr Rowe was suffering an aggressive lung cancer that had spread to his liver and bones. Chris Rowe, pictured with his pregnant wife Kate and their three-year-old daughter, Sophia, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lung cancer that had spread to his liver and bones, in December . After suffering a persistent cough for six months, he visited doctors five times in two months. But he was sent home each time, reassured he was most likely suffering a virus. But after coughing up blood and being taken to A&E, an X-ray revealed a tumour on the 31-year-old's lung . He has been told his cancer is inoperable, but Mr Rowe is enduring gruelling rounds of chemotherapy in a bid to prolong his life, so he can create memories with his young family. His wife Kate, 28, is set to give birth to a baby boy, a little brother for the couple's three-year-old daughter, Sophia, in June. Mr Rowe, from Gloucester, said he hopes that by sharing his story, others will be aware of the symptoms of lung cancer. He is a non-smoker and lives a healthy lifestyle, he said, adding the diagnosed came as a huge shock to him and his wife. 'I went to the doctors five times in just two months because my cough wouldn't go,' he said. 'It all started after I came back from a great holiday at Center Parcs. 'I began coughing up blood which was really frightening but after visiting my doctors I felt relieved as they were adamant that I had a virus, and I was advised to keep taking ibuprofen. 'I trusted that I must be OK but when I started suffering from a dull ache in my ribs and I coughed up more blood, I ended up in A&E two months later. Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of the disease. More than 41,000 people are diagnosed with the condition every year in the UK. Often in the early stages of the disease there are no signs or symptoms. But, many people with the condition will eventually develop some symptoms, including: . Although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the main cause - in about 90 per cent of cases. The disease mainly affects older people. It is rare in people younger than 40, while rates rise sharply with age. It is most commonly diagnosed in those aged 70 to 74 years old. Due to the nature of the disease, not presenting symptoms, it often spreads before it is diagnosed. As a result, the outlook for patients with lung cancer is not as good as for those with other forms of the disease. Around one in three people with the condition will live for at least a year after their diagnosis, and one in 10 will live at least five years. Source: NHS Choices . 'It was after an X-ray while in hospital that they found I had a tumour in my lung. 'I'm trying to focus on creating as many memories with Kate and our children as possible, I want to ensure I'm in their lives for as long as possible.' In December, Mr Rowe was told his cancer had spread to his liver and bones - the tumours were inoperable and treatment would only be able to prolong his life. After an appointment with a lung cancer specialist in February, it was agreed that the 31-year-old could undergo the strongest chemotherapy available on the NHS. 'I was hoping it would be a benign tumour as I'm young, fit and healthy but sadly that wasn't the case,' said Mr Rowe. 'Kate and I were so shocked as there is no history of any type of cancer in my family.' He is facing chemotherapy in the hope it will shrink and maintain his tumours, to give him time to watch his children grow up. 'Our little girl, Sophia helps keep my spirits high,' he said. 'I'm so excited to meet our baby boy, Max, in June too and that definitely helps keep me going. 'My wife, Kate, friends and family have all been so supportive and that makes things a little easier too.' Mr Rowe, who owned his own plastering business, was forced to sell the company in its 10th year. 'It was heartbreaking to sell my business, but I had no choice,' he said. 'I knew I couldn't continue with such a physical job while going through chemotherapy. 'It has made me very tired and weak so selling it wasn't an option, I had to. 'I am in constant pain with the cancer and I feel very sick most of the time due to the chemotherapy.' Had he been older, Mr Rowe said he suspects his cough would not have been dismissed so quickly. Mr Rowe has been told his cancer is inoperable, but is undergoing the strongest chemotherapy available on the NHS to try and shrink his tumours and give him more time with his wife, daughter and their baby . 'I'm not one of those people who visit the doctor for no reason and they could see that from my medical records,' he said. 'I knew something was seriously wrong, but no-one would listen to me because I'm deemed too young for lung cancer. 'But my story proves that it can happen to anyone and maybe if I wasn't ignored for two months then my prognosis might have been better. 'I hope other people read my story and look out for the symptoms of lung cancer so they can get an earlier diagnosis.' A fundraising page has been set up for Mr Rowe by his friend of 20 years, Lee Bowtell. Dozens have since rallied to raise more than £10,000 in just two weeks. The aim is to help support the family financially after Mr Rowe was forced to sell his business. 'It's unbelievable how well the fundraising page has done already, it's amazing how many people want to help us and I can't thank Lee enough for setting it up,' said Mr Rowe. 'It has taken a huge strain off of our family and we feel like I can focus on Max's arrival in June rather than how to cope financially.' To support the family, visit Mr Rowe's GoFundMe page here.

"Gone are the days of the waif model and 'heroin chic': a new, fitter, stronger generation of women will be walking down the runway at this year's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia. We Are Handsome will  debut their first Active Swim range on Tuesday night in Sydney and break all the rules by featuring real-life fitness and social media stars, rather than professional models. The models will include Sjana Earp,  Kate Kendall, Amanda Bisk, Juliet Burnett, and Lindy Klim. Scroll down for video . Bringing sexy back: Australian designers We Are Handsome are among the fashion houses rejecting traditional skinnier models in favour of strong, fit girls . Earp, 20, is a social media sensation famous for sharing her yoga poses with her 679,000 Instagram followers, Bisk is a former Commonwealth Games pole vaulter, sprinter and yogi, Kendall is a qualified yoga instructor and Burnett is a professional Australian Ballet dancer. We Are Handsome design duo Jeremy and Katinka Somers,  are known for pushing boundaries but believe there will be only positive reaction to their unusual model choice. 'There’s a big thing about ""who should be on the runway"" so we know we’re breaking rules by having girls that have never been on a catwalk before (and who are nervous about it),' Katinka told Daily Mail Australia. Strong beats skinny: We Are Handsome will debut fit, real girls (including Instagram sensation Sjana Earp, pictured) at launch of their Active Swim range on Tuesday night in Sydney . Bolt like Bisk: Amanda Bisk, who is the ultimate fit trifecta, (yogi, pole vaulter and sprinter), will also walk the runway show today . Beach to backstage: Bisk achieves her slim frame through healthy exercise . 'But the rules are there to be broken, times have changed and girls who are active are the new shape. Strong really is the new sexy.' Casting healthy girls is crucial  to the designers who believe   largely represent their brand and  promote the active philosophy they value. 'We will not cast skinny models or skeletal frames, we look for real, active and healthy women - and  not just with the fit girls but for our catwalk models too,' says Katinka. Waif goes wayward: Australian designers ditch skeletal frames, following France's law to ban skinny models . En pointe: Ballet dancer Juliet Burnett will feature as one of the fit girls in the We Are Handsome show . Jeremy admits personality comes into it too. 'We're authentic, fun and outgoing so it's about making people feel good and having girls that purvey that.' 'A lot of the girls (fitness models) are very big on Instagram and encourage people to follow in their active foot steps, so we have chosen experienced yogis, a ballerina, a sprinter and pole vaulter and people who embody healthy eating too,' says Jeremy. On how the industry will take their bold choice, the We Are Handsome couple aren't worried. Klim-spiration: Lindy Klim, pictured wearing a We Are Handsome swimsuit, will also walk the runway . 'We have friends who are competitors, but we don’t design for other designers, we design for ourselves and the We Are Handsome woman,' says Jeremy. 'We're also not shunning skinny women,' adds Katinka. 'There are lots of women out there that no matter what they eat, won’t be a robust shape. We're just aiming for a different shape of women to other designers.' This industry first in Australia comes only days after  France passed legislation banning excessively thin models from participating in Paris Fashion Week. Aspirational athlete: Kate Kendall, co-owner of  gym Flow Athletic will host a yoga class and walk the runway . Agents and fashion houses who hire the models could  face fines under the new law, which was passed on April 3. 'We're also not shunning skinny women,' adds Katinka. 'There are lots of women out there that no matter what they eat, won’t be a robust shape. We're just aiming for a different shape of women to other designers.' This industry first in Australia comes only days after  France passed legislation banning excessively thin models from participating in Paris Fashion Week. Social media star: Sjana Earp, fitness blogger and avid yogi will star in the We Are Handsome show . This self-regulated approach has also been taken by new Australian brand Robb & Lulu who cast healthy, Instagram sensation Renee Somerfield for their debut collection. 'After the collection went live online yesterday we had great consumer and industry feedback,' says Sian Vandermuelen who represents the label. 'They loved that we were using a woman that wasn't a typical sample size and who is comfortable in her own skin.' Crave comfort: Robb & Lulu have found women like seeing models who are comfortable in their own skin . Leading the way in size range too, Robb & Lulu have chosen to make resort wear that goes from size 0 up to 26 and swimwear that includes bigger cup sizes too, with cups sizes going up to a double F. 'Lulu found there was a gap in market and she needed to design for women that are bigger and bustier and people that were able to feel empowered and comfortable in a bigger bikini or kaftan.' And the proof is in the demand, with British Vogue already catching wind of the label's range and requesting stock from them based on their fits and ability to suit all bodies and sizes. Australian designer Manning Cartell have also taken a stance, with all 39 women on their runway being size 8-10 models this season. Bikini babe: Social media star Renee Somerfield was chosen to launch Robb & Lulu's first collection . Push for plus: Australian label Robb and Lulu have had great response to 0-26 size range and FF cup sizes . 'We always try and select healthy strong girls so it’s always been a focus for us,' says Gabrielle Manning, as reported in The Daily Telegraph. Additionally Bondi Bather has refused 'too-skinny models' during castings with designer Kerry Cusack reporting back to modelling agencies that she is after healthy, Aussie girls and believes its a responsibility designers need to guard to stop young girls body image issues. As for We Are Handsome, alongside the fit models, a  yoga class held by Kate Kendall (yoga teacher and one of the models walking) will commence prior to the runway show to energise the models and instil the healthy message of the brand before the show.","Designers We Are Handsome, Manning Cartell and Bondi Bather turn away from using skinny models .

"The family of the seven-year-old British boy killed in the French Alps say his death has left a ‘vast void in their hearts’. Carwyn Scott-Howell was described as a ‘daring, outgoing and determined’ youngster whose ‘handsome smile lit up any room’. The schoolboy was skiing with his family when he became separated from his mother and headed into dense woodland where he fell over a 164ft drop. Tragedy: Carwyn Scott-Howell (left; right) fell to his death while on  holiday with his mother Ceri, nine-year-old sister Antonia and brother Gerwyn, 19, in the Alps . Footprints in the snow eventually led police to his body, investigators revealed last night. They also described how the boy’s mother Cari, 44, desperately tried to find her missing son. In a moving tribute, Carwyn’s family described how he ‘made life full of laughter with never a dull moment’. ‘Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky,’ they added. ‘Carwyn was an adorable, caring person who gave so much love. The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts.’ Carwyn, from Talybont-on-Usk in Wales, was said to have been a ‘very competent skier and snowboarder’ who had started skiing at the age of three. The family said they had spent ‘the most happy ski holiday together’ in the resort of Flaine in the days before the tragedy stuck. They were enjoying their last run of the day when the boy’s sister Antonia, nine, lost her ski on a jump and Carwyn pressed on ahead. His mother stopped to help her daughter and continued to the bottom of the piste. But Carwyn – who modelled himself on the TV adventurer Bear Grylls – was nowhere to be seen. Mrs Scott-Howell returned to their hotel believing her son had made his own way back, but returned to the mountain when she found he wasn’t there. Pierre-Yves Michau, the judge heading the investigation, said yesterday: ‘She asked everyone if they had seen him.’ It is believed Carwyn left the piste and entered woodland because he had spotted the resort through the trees. Taking off his skis, he continued on foot as he hurried to get there. Police chief Michel Ollagnon confirmed that officers had been led to the boy’s body by footprints in the snow. He said the final steps were broken up by ‘sliding marks’ where Carwyn had tackled the sharper inclines on his backside. Scene: Carwyn's family are believed to be staying in this hotel, close to the slopes where the seven-year-old died .

We think he was heading for the resort.’ Police last night said Carwyn’s body is ready to be repatriated but his family remained in the Alps. Back in Wales, his friends have written in a condolence book on display at Brecon Cathedral: ‘Miss you in class. Miss you at playtime. We will miss you always.’ Alongside the book is a picture of Carwyn dressed in his karate kit. At the youngster’s school in Brecon, head teacher Emyr Jones said pupils were devastated, adding: ‘We are all grieving.’ He described Carwyn as a ‘lively, likeable pupil who will be greatly missed’ at Ysol Y Bannau school. County councillor Liam Fitzpatrick said the community would rally behind the Scott-Howells, who are well known for their award-winning farm shop. He added: ‘It’s horrendous. A tragic, tragic accident.’ Carwyn lived with his parents at their farmhouse in the village near the Brecon Beacons. He is said to have loved the mountains and helping on the farm where he had grown up. The family often attended food fairs across the country and David Cameron was pictured buying a scotch egg from the family’s stand last year.

"A woman was arrested in China after apparently dumping her newborn baby in a rubbish bin in a fast-food restaurant. Staff heard the baby girl crying in the ladies' toilet of a burger bar in Chengdu, Sichuan province, reports People's Daily Online. Workers who found the baby, who was wrapped in a shirt but was still attached to the umbilical cord and placenta, called the police and ambulance. A baby girl was found in the bin inside the ladies' toilet at a Chinese burger bar . A woman who had been seen visiting the toilet was established to be the mother and was arrested . Staff at the restaurant said they saw the woman going into the toilet and noticed that she'd stayed there for a long time. After she came out, she went back to her seat, sitting there without speaking a word. 'After we discovered the baby girl, we checked the CCTV footage, we found this woman likely to be the mother of the baby, so we called the ambulance as well as the police,' one worker said. The woman, Yuan Yen, 34, was found to have blood on her when she was approached. She refused to look at her baby or talk to police, who discovered her identity by looking through her purse. Workers at the restaurant said Yuan Yen had returned to her table and sat 'in a trance' She was arrested after receiving medical attention and faces charges of neglect . Police insisted she have emergency treatment and took her to the same hospital as her daughter, where she refused to see doctors. A worker at the fast food outlet said: 'The mother was in shock herself and was just sitting there in a trance. 'There was blood all over her shirt and she had her head bowed in shame. I think she was just traumatised.' Cops tried to locate her relatives but were unable to contact anybody as her phone had no credit and she had no local addresses on her. She was later transferred to the police station where she is facing charges of neglect. The infant, weighing 2.6kg (5.7lb), was declared to be healthy after being checked over by doctors.","Staff at restaurant in Chengdu heard crying and found a newborn baby .

"Nigel Farage's campaigning got off to a faltering start today as he missed a Ukip event after getting stuck in traffic. The Ukip leader was expected at a farm in Staffordshire, as he prepared to attack the government over defence spending, but organisers pulled the plug while he was trapped in his chauffeur-driven car. Mr Farage faced ridicule last year when he blamed immigrants clogging up the M4 after he missed an event charging supporters £25-a-head to meet him. Nigel Farage's campaigning got off to a faltering start today as he missed a Ukip event after getting stuck in traffic. He did manage to make an appearance at an event in Carrick (pictured) Mr Farage is under pressure to show his election campaign is on track after polls showed a slump in support in Ukip and suggested he might struggle to win his own seat in South Thanet. He had hoped to use a return to the campaign trail after the bank holiday weekend to highlight Ukip's call to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence. But he missed the farm visit in Staffordshire after suffering travel delays, according to a party spokesman. In December the Ukip leader was branded 'silly and dangerous' after claiming high levels of immigration caused problems on the roads. He claimed he arrived too late for a £25-a-head drinks reception in Port Talbot because the UK's 'open door immigration' policy meant that the M4 'is not as navigable as it used to be'. He insisted the no-show was 'nothing to do with professionalism' amid claims Ukip was struggling to cope with increased scrutiny and demands on his time. 'In all these years in Ukip that's probably about the third event out of a thousand that I haven't made in time,' he said in December. Mr Farage had hoped to use a return to the campaign trail after the bank holiday weekend to highlight Ukip's call to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence . Meanwhile Mr Farage now is battling to fend off an alarming slump in the polls for Ukip - with support falling by a quarter in less than six months. The Ukip leader has seen support for his party drop from 16.75 per cent in November to just 12.25 per cent today, with voters appearing to switch to the Tories in the run up to the election. Mr Farage is also facing a fight to win his own election battle after falling behind the Tories in Thanet South, Kent - despite enjoying a 12 point lead over his Conservative rival just two months ago. He will visit the West Midlands later where he is expected to condemn rising aid budgets under David Cameron and will accuse both Labour and the Conservatives of abandoning the military covenant. Speaking ahead of a visit to the West Midlands, Mr Farage had said: 'I am really looking forward to coming again to the West Midlands. It is the heartland of England.' He is due to give a speech at the Copthorne Hotel in Brierley Hill in the Black Country this evening.

In a direct attack on the Prime Minister, the Ukip leader will add: 'No previous Conservative prime minister in history would have countenanced sanctioning continual rises in foreign aid giveaways while at the same time pursuing a programme of continual cuts in defence.' A Conservative Party spokesman said Mr Farage was 'playing politics with the military in a calculated and completely irresponsible way'. He added: 'We've balanced the defence budget after inheriting a truly enormous black hole from Labour. We have the second largest defence budget in Nato after the United States and will spend over £160 billion in the next decade on new military equipment. 'It comes down to this: you can only have strong armed forces if you have a strong economy first. That's exactly what this Government is delivering. Ukip would put that at risk - making it up as they go along and letting Ed Miliband into Downing Street by the back door.'","Jams mean Ukip leader forced to pull the plug on farm visit in Staffordshire .

"Denmark's Crown Princess Mary might have wowed in a succession of evening gowns last week but Sunday was all about low-key family time for the Australian-born royal. Mary, 43, treated her three youngest children, Princess Isabella, seven, and twins Princess Josephine and Prince Vincent, four, to a day out at a farm in Kirke Hyllinge, a village in Zealand. Making the most of the sunny weather, the quartet certainly appeared to be having fun, with all four crouching down to pet a tiny Holstein Friesian calf. Scroll down for video . Enjoying the sunshine: Denmark's Crown Princess Mary and her daughters Isabella and Josephine . Despite the potential for getting dirty, Mary was as fashionable as ever and appeared to have taken inspiration from the rural location in her tweed jacket and jeans. The three children, meanwhile, were well-wrapped up in cosy padded jackets and appeared fascinated by the cows grazing in one of the barns, with Prince Vincent even climbing a fence to get a better look. But not everyone fancied a day out at the farm, with Mary left without her husband Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and eldest son Prince Christian, nine, for the outing. The visit, which was part of Denmark's annual Eco Day celebrations, came days after royals from around Europe descended on Copenhagen for Queen Margrethe II's 75th birthday celebrations.

"As America's elite crime investigators they are more used to tackling crime. But now FBI agents have been told they have to new enemy to battle -- calories. Expanding waistlines and lack of mobility for many agents has led to the introduction of a compulsory fitness tests. Those who fail will have the marks noted on their annual performance review and could lead to being moved from assignments that involve physical activity. Compulsory fitness tests have been introduced for all FBI agents following fears over expanding waistlines . FBI chief James Coney has introduced the tests amid fears his 135,000 agents are slipping behind when it comes to personal fitness. He said the force depends on its agents ability to 'run, fight and shoot'. Coney also said he wants the people to take one look at an agent think 'there goes a special agent of the FBI' rather than a derogatory remark about being overweight. Police in America are often parodied for their love of doughnuts and few forces have any weight restrictions. New recruits to the FBI have to take a physical test but for the last 16 years have not had to undergo any other fitness exam. As part of the annual test agents aged under 30 will have to run a mile in twelve and half minutes and sprint 300 metres in 59 seconds. They will also have to perform 24 push ups without stopping and 35 sit ups in a minute. Some agents have complained about the five minute break between the exercises as they struggle to catch their breath. FBI chief James Coney said the force depends on its agents' ability to 'run, fight and shoot' Older agents are given slightly longer times to perform the tests. A man in his 50s is allowed 15.14m for the mile run and 83 seconds for the sprint. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 12,000 female agents must also take the test. According to the New York Times, who obtained an internal memo from Coney about the fitness tests, few agents have rushed to meet the October deadline to complete the physical. In the Washington DC office only 75 out of the 800 agents have taken the test. The introduction of the tests comes as America is grappling with an obesity problem with a third of adults deemed obese or overweight. Figures from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention show that almost 80million adults are obese and the cause of death of more than 120,000 people a year. First Lady Michelle Obama has been at the forefront of tackling child obesity with a nationwide 'Let's Move' campaign urging children to get more exercise. The cost to the health care system treating people with illness caused by overeating such as strokes and heart attacks has been put at $98billion a year. The concern about the fitness of FBI agents began after the 9/11 terror attacks when the agency switched its main mission from catching criminals to fighting terrorism. Rather than taking part in arrests, often involving chasing criminals, they would spend hours sat behind a desk. Much of their work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise. 'You could see that health and fitness were not the priority it used to be,' said Zachary Lowe, the chief of physical instruction at the FBI HQ in Quantico, Virginia. Much of the FBI's work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise - hence the new drive to get fit . FBI chief Comey, who took over in 2013, discovered on touring field offices that morale was low. He also notes that many agents didn't look as if they would be able to pass the physical exam they had taken on joining the force. His new regime has led to many calling the agency the 'Fit Bureau of Investigation.' J Edgar Hoover, the famed first director of the FBI, had made fitness tests compulsory while he was in charge. Its current director said the lives of people they protect depend on agents fitness and health and they were symbols of what is 'right and good' about the US. He said: 'The lives of your colleagues and those you protect may well depend upon your ability to run, fight and shoot, no matter what job you hold. 'I want you to look like the squared away object of that reverence. I want the American people to be able to take one glance at you and think ""THERE is a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"".'","Compulsory fitness tests introduced thanks to expanding waistlines .

"A London pub which survived relentless bombing during The Blitz and was the only building in its road not destroyed by Hitler's bombs has been illegally knocked down to make way for luxury flats.

She said: 'It is heart breaking. There was no warning.' The pub, which stood in Maida Vale, west London, was the only building in its road that was not destroyed by bombs during the Blitz but did not survive CLTX Ltd, which was denied planning permission to turn it into flats by Westminster City Council in January.

"A teenager had to close her mother’s shop to detain a shoplifter for three hours until police arrived – only for them to let her off with a caution. Katie Cope, 17, said she feared being assaulted by the agitated woman after police repeatedly refused to give her an estimated time for their arrival. She had to close the shop and put down the electronic shutter after the thief became abusive towards other customers and kept trying to leave. Let down: Store owner Eve Cope with assistant, Sol, who helped Katie to detain the shoplifter . When police finally got to the vintage clothing store, they said the stolen knickers, which had been reduced to £1, were not worth enough to prosecute. Yesterday, Katie and her mother Eve Cope, 60, told of their fury at the police’s response and accused officers of giving a ‘green light’ to shoplifters by merely cautioning the 66-year-old culprit. Mrs Cope, who has owned the Baklash store in Nottingham city centre for 33 years, was away when the thief struck last Thursday. She said: ‘I was really scared for the safety of my daughter. I do feel like the police let the shoplifter off. ‘This must be the fifth time I have had to deal with a shoplifter in the last few years – on one occasion I was even assaulted and hit my head on the pavement outside the shop when I tried to stop a thief. ‘The police asked me to drop the case against the girl responsible because she offered to apologise and pay for the shirt she stole.’ Katie said: ‘It is a ridiculous situation. I could have been in trouble if the woman had reacted aggressively to being held in the shop. ‘I’m really disappointed with the police. Letting this woman off just gives a green light to shoplifters.’ A male shop assistant called Sol was working with Katie when she spotted the shoplifter leaving with a pair of knickers in her handbag. Katie stopped the thief outside the shop at 2.50pm and led her back inside while Sol dialled 101 – the police non-emergency number. Katie said: ‘I was not going to let her go. She didn’t apologise and when police eventually got here she lied about her age and her name three times.’ Officers arrived within nine minutes after Mrs Cope, pictured outside her store, made a formal complaint . When Katie was still waiting for a police response three hours later, Mrs Cope rang to make a formal complaint and officers arrived nine minutes later, at 6.10pm. Mrs Cope said: ‘They told us that because the underwear was only priced at £1, they would not prosecute. ‘I told them it wasn’t just the value of the knickers at play here, but the fact we had lost three hours of trade by having to close. They just told me I would have to pursue a civil case for damages against the thief if I wanted to take it further.’ Local councillor Michael Edwards called the incident ‘concerning’. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: ‘We aim to provide the best possible service to anyone who calls to report a crime, but in periods of high demand response times can be affected.’ Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping said: ‘I am sorry that the business in question had a problem. Shoplifting is not as much of a problem as it used to be.’ However, figures from crime data analysts, UK Crime Stats, showed that in Nottingham there was a rise in shoplifting offences from 288 last February to 324 this February.","Katie Cope, 17, detained a shoplifter in her mother's vintage clothing store .

"Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of a prosecutor held during an armed siege last week. A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video . A Turkish court has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz held during an armed siege last week . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . A British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms. 'The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' He added: 'A request has been made to both Twitter and YouTube for the . removal of the images and posts but they have not accepted it . and no response has been given. 'That's why . this decision has been taken through a court in Istanbul.' Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries .

Austin, Texas has a non-discrimination ordinance that bars establishment from denying service to someone based on their sexuality. Grant believes the restaurant was discriminatory because of Grant's gender identity. 'I really believe it was transphobia-driven and I don't think it had anything to do with what I was wearing,' Grant told The Houston Chronicle.

Nigella was at the centre of a very public court case in 2013, after she and Mr Saatchi accused their former assistants of spending £685,000 on credit cards given to them for work purposes. Months earlier, the couple's marriage had come to an abrupt end after Mr Saatchi was pictured with his hand on his wife's throat in a central London restaurant. But Lisa and Francesca Grillo were acquitted of fraud by a jury. It came despite the fact that Francesca, 35, had used her family card to spend £8,000 on designer clothes in a single day. The show will see the celebrity chef focus on 'a new pared-down approach to cooking and eating'. Pictured: Nigella in the premiere of Taste, a show she co-hosted in the U.S (left) and arriving at Isleworth Crown Court in 2013 (right) before giving evidence in the fraud trial of her two assistants . It will be the first time Nigella has appeared on the BBC since the breakdown of her marriage to Charles Saatchi (with whom she is pictured) and the explosive fraud case that followed . Their defence, which involved lurid drug allegations against their former boss, was that the TV cook let them spend whatever they liked providing they kept quiet about her cocaine and cannabis use. The court case also heard Miss Lawson describe her ex-husband as a 'brilliant but brutal man' who grabbed her throat out of jealousy when she idly wished for grandchildren. She claimed he drove her to drugs with his 'intimate terrorism'. Referring to details of her doomed marriage to Mr Saatchi being revealed in court, the 54-year-old said: 'To have not only your private life but distortions of your private life put on display is mortifying'. After their acquittal, the Italian sisters – dubbed 'the greedy Grillos' by the prosecution – said they had merely won their freedom, while Miss Lawson had established herself as a public favourite. Police said at the time they would not be taking any action after Ms Lawson's admission which came after the end of her marriage to Saatchi. The show will air in autumn this year. Nigella's return to BBC2 is just one of a number of new commissions for the station, which were unveiled today. Kim Shillinglaw, director of the station, revealed that at least eight new shows would be aired on the taxpayer-funded channel during the coming season. The Great British Pottery Throw Down, to be presented by Sara Cox, is among the new shows to air on the station and is being advertised as 'the Great British Bake Off's messier cousin'. Publicised with the tagline: 'It's messy, it's hot, it's pottery,' the show will see ten amateur potters thrash it out to try and win the 'master of the wheel' title. The Hairy Bikers have been asked to host a show which attempts to tackle the issues of an ageing nation . Other commissions include the move of popular show Family Guy to the channel, which will move over from BBC3. The Hairy Bikers have also been asked to host a show which attempts to tackle the issues of an ageing population in Old School by taking pensioners into classrooms to try and improve loneliness. Gareth Malone has also been brought back to the station for new show The Naked Choir, which will see him scour the country for would-be stars, and Hair - a show designed to find the country's best hairdresser - will also return for another series. Hugo Blick, who wrote The Honourable Woman and The Shadow Line, is also currently in the process of writing a new drama for BBC2 and BAFTA award-winning Stefan Golaszewski will bring a new comedy series called Mum. Daniel Radcliffe and Bill Paxton will star in new factual drama Gamechanger while a hard-hitting documentary series will follow Greater Manchester Police's new unit investigating sex offences. Gareth Malone (left) has been brought back to the station for new show The Naked Choir, which will see him scour the country for would-be stars, while Daniel Radcliffe (right) will star in new drama Gamechanger . Announcing the new commissions, Ms Shillinglaw said: 'BBC Two is in great shape. From the critical and ratings success of Wolf Hall, BBC Two's biggest drama series in at least 13 years and Banished, which was our fourth highest drama series launch, to stand out seasons on Food, The Super Rich And Us, Taking Liberties and our Holocaust Memorial content, we've got people talking and watching the channel in significant numbers. 'The sheer range and quality of content I'm announcing today demonstrates the unique role BBC Two plays in enhancing people's lives and contributing to the creative life of the UK. 'From enabling British writing, presenting and directing talent to do their most distinctive, signature work to Factual with real purpose that tackles contemporary issues in lively, intelligent ways or encourages viewers to take their passions further, I want BBC Two to be the place to come for widest range of grown up, opinionated and entertaining content on British television.'","Chef, who last appeared on BBC in 2012, will host Simply Nigella on BBC 2 .

"Rescuers were forced to abandon their efforts to save 149 dolphins that were stranded on a beach in Japan after working tirelessly all day to help the creatures. As darkness fell on the beach in Hokota, around 60 miles northeast of Tokyo, coastguards and officials called off the rescue operation after only managing to save three of the 149 melon-headed dolphins that had beached. The rest of the animals had either died or were dying, they said. Scroll down for video . Rescuers managed to save three dolphins, but the remaining of the beached pod are 'dead or dying' A volunteer pours water on a dolphin to stop its skin drying out. Others were being carried back to the ocean . Workers use a crane to remove one of the 146 melon-headed whales that died when beached in Hokota . 'It was becoming dark and too dangerous to continue the rescue work at this beach, where we could not bring heavy equipment,' a Hokota city official said. 'Many people volunteered to rescue them but the dolphins became very, very weak.' 'Only three of them have been successfully returned to the sea, as far as we can confirm,' he added. Volunteers from local communities had joined forces with coastguards to try and save the dolphins, pouring water on them to stop their skins drying out. They also used slings to carry some back into the water, after they were seen early on Friday morning on the beach writhing in pain. But despite desperate efforts to help the melon-headed whales, some  were being pushed back onto the beach by the tide soon after being released. The creatures are usually found deep in the sea but have mysteriously beached about 60 miles northeast of Tokyo. Volunteers and residents living nearby used slings to carry the dolphins - but some were carried back to shore . Young children look at melon-headed whales beached on the shore of Hokota city, northeast of Tokyo. Scientists say they are not sure how the dolphins ended up on the beach but believe they might have got lost . The location of Hokota where the dolphins beached. It is now thought 150 creatures are on the beach in Japan . Television footage showed several animals had been badly cut, and many had deep gashes on their skin. Speaking earlier today a coastguard official said they are aware a number of the sea creatures have died. 'We see one or two whales washing ashore a year, but this may be the first time we have found over 100 of them on a beach,. he added. A Hokota city official said they had counted 149 dolphins, revising an earlier figure of 130. Three had been successfully returned to the sea by the late afternoon, he added. Coastguards covered the dolphins in blankets and put them on a boat so they could be put back in the sea . The Japanese Coast Guard worked nonestop to save the melon-headed whales, part of the dolpin family . The creatures usually live in the deep ocean, but for an unexplained reason had become beached on the shore . Dozens of volunteers and local residents turned out to help coastguards with the dolphin rescue operation . The pod of dolphins was stretched out along a roughly six mile-long stretch of beach in Hokota, Ibaraki, where they were found by locals early on Friday morning. While the reason for the beaching was unclear, Tadasu Yamadao, a researcher at the National Museum of Nature and Science, said the dolphins might have got lost. He explained: 'Sonar waves the dolphins emit might have been absorbed in the shoals, which could cause them to lose their sense of direction.' Melon-headed whales, also known as electra dolphins, are relatively common in Japanese waters and can grow to be two-to-three meters (six-to-nine feet) long. Dolphins emit sonar waves, but researches say if these are absorbed they can lose their sense of direction . The rescue operation is in stark contract with Japan's stereotypical attitude towards whales, which are hunted . In 2011, about 50 melon-headed whales beached themselves in a similar area. The dolphin rescue that took place on Friday was a stark contract to the Japan's reputation towards its sealife, as the country continues to hunt minke and pilot whales despite international criticism. It has never made any secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed. Japan also defies international opinion with the annual slaughter of hundreds of dolphins in a bay near the southern whaling town of Taiji. The killing was brought to worldwide attention with the Oscar-winning documentary 'The Cove'.","Pod of melon-headed whales beached in Hokota, 60 miles from Tokyo .

"Kent Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.","Kent Sprouse, 42, faces lethal injection at 6pm Thursday .

"Lord Stevens is to be investigated over hotly disputed allegations of a cover-up of police corruption in the bungled Step-hen Lawrence murder probe. Last night the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it will investigate claims that the former Met chief failed to hand over key information to the Macpherson Inquiry regarding the black teenager’s race hate killing. The watchdog probe stems from a complaint from Stephen’s father Neville Lawrence. Lord Stevens was deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1998 to 2000 – while the Macpherson Inquiry report was being compiled – before serving five years as the UK’s most senior policeman. 'Cover-up': Former Met Police commissioner Lord Stevens (left) is to be investigated into allegations of a cover-up over the Stephen Lawrence murder probe in the nineties . Sparked new investigation: Neville Lawrence, the father of murdered Stephen Lawrence, made a complaint last October about the failure of senior officers during the Macpherson Inquiry . The complaint concerns a letter to the Macpherson Inquiry in 1998, in which Lord Stevens stated that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption. It is alleged that the letter included misleading information. However, last night sources close to the former Scotland Yard commissioner said he was vindicated last year by Mark Ellison QC, the author of an official report into the Lawrence corruption allegations. A source said: ‘Any suggestion that anyone from the Met would seek to withhold the truth from the Macpherson Inquiry at that time is completely untrue. Last year Mark Ellison wrote to Lord Stevens to say he had done nothing wrong.’ Last night, Channel 4 News – which revealed details of the IPCC probe into Lord Stevens – quoted him as saying: ‘Step very carefully, I’m not putting up with any more c**p about this.’ Quoting from a letter he received from Mr Ellison, Lord Stevens was reported to have said: ‘No one is suggesting that you did anything that was culpable in any way.’ Baroness Lawrence, pictured taking her seat in the House of Lords in 2013, described undercover police officers as 'disgraceful' following the findings of the Ellison review last year . The IPCC said: ‘We can confirm we are independently investigating Lord Stevens following a referral from the Metropolitan Police.’ The Met said that after it received ‘a public complaint in relation to Lord Stevens’ it made a referral to the IPCC last November. The Met’s statement added: ‘The complaint has been made in relation to Lord Stevens’s role as the then deputy commissioner and disclosure to the Macpherson Inquiry. Facing probe: Lord Stevens pictured in 2001 alongside Neville Lawrence, whose complaint has sparked the latest investigation . ‘This issue was raised in the Stephen Lawrence Independent Review by Mark Ellison QC, where he concluded there were defects in the level of information that the Metropolitan Police revealed to the inquiry.’ Mr Lawrence had asked the IPCC to look into alleged failures of senior officers, including Lord Stevens, to provide ‘full, frank and truthful’ information to the inquiry as well as claims that hundreds of files on past major police corruption probes were shredded. He welcomed the IPCC’s decision to investigate, telling Channel 4 News: ‘I’m hoping that this time they’re going to come back with a result that can help us to get further into the truth of what was happening during the investigation into Stephen’s death.’ It took more than 18 years to bring two of Stephen’s killers – Gary Dobson and David Norris – to justice and they were jailed for life in 2012. Also that year, Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned Mr Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation, and whether evidence had been withheld from the Macpherson Inquiry. Last year she told Parliament that there were ‘serious concerns that… relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed’. When the Ellison review reported last year it said one former detective, John Davidson, was suspected of corruption in the Lawrence case, in which he had a key role. Mr Davidson has always denied the claims. Long battle for justice: Stephen's mother Doreen, now Baroness Lawrence, and father Neville have been campaigning for more than 20 years . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet with Baroness Lawrence, Stephen's mother, at the Stephen Lawrence Centre last month . Damning: In his 1999 report William Macpherson accused the Met Police of being institutionally racist . In 1998, five years after Stephen Lawrence was murdered in south east London, retired High Court judge Sir William Macpherson was appointed to head an inquiry into the killing. Macpherson led the review into the conduct of the Metropolitan Police during the murder investigation after the police's initial failure to apprehend the black teenager's killers. In his report, published in February 1999, Macpherson accused the Met of being institutionally racist but concluded that police corruption had not thwarted the case. However, he widely criticised the force's handling of the Lawrence case and said police did not carry out the investigation in an appropriate manner. He made over 70 recommendations, including to extend the number of offences classified as racist, make the police subject to greater public control and protect the rights for victims of crime. He also recommended that police forces increase the number of black and Asian officers, prompting the Government to pledge to increase the number of officers from minority ethnic groups from 2,500 to 8,000 by 2009. And he recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence – something which became the law in 2005 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The Macpherson Report was dubbed 'one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain' and credited with improving police attitudes to racism. Jack Straw, who was the Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 during the time of the report, has previously declared that ordering the inquiry was 'the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary'. However, Home Secretary Theresa May expressed concerns in 2012 that evidence may have been withheld from the 1999 inquiry. She commissioned Mark Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation and last year told Parliament that there were 'serious concerns that…relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed.' Lord Stevens is now accused of failing to hand information over to the Macpherson public inquiry. He originally stated in 1998 that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption.","Mr Stevens accused of not giving information over to Macpherson inquiry .
