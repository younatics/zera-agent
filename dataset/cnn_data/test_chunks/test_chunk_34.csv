"An alleged fraudster has been accused of posing as Oprah Winfrey, executives from her TV network, former Obama aide Reggie Love and Madonna's manager in an attempt to trick people into giving him jobs, clothes, free food and jewelry worth $2.4million. Justin Jackson, a Florida man, has been carrying out the bizarre schemes in the hope of cashing in on the freebies, or winning himself a job in luxurious hotels, according to court documents. Jackson is being sued by Oprah's TV network as well as Love - the college basketball star who went on to be the President's personal assistant. 'Con man': Justin Jackson, right, has been accused of pretending to be a host of celebrity-linked characters in order to score freebies and jobs. Angel Agarrat, left, is also named in a Florida lawsuit attempting to get the pair to stop posing as other people . Legal papers filed in a south Florida federal court describe Jackson waging an eight-year trail of deceit in which he variously posed as Oprah herself, Oprah's nephew, Love, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), and managers of Madonna and Johnny Depp. The earliest fraud, the papers said, saw Jackson trick a New York City jeweler into lending him items worth $2.4million by pretending to be Madonna's manager. He contacted a store in July 2007 and said she needed the lavish items for a photoshoot, the papers said. When he got the items, he reportedly sold them to another jeweler and fled. The court papers say he was convicted for grand theft over the ruse, but later dreamed up new celebrity-linked schemes. The latest claims say Jackson pretended to be Oprah and her representatives in the hope of getting more freebies - and even posed as the famous talk show host to recommend him for jobs. He allegedly sent letters on forged OWN stationery to  five different hotel groups with locations in Florida, recommending himself for work at the locations. 'Impersonator': Jackson (right) is accused of sending messages purporting to be former Obama aide Reggie Love (left), whom he said worked for Oprah. The right-hand photograph, court papers claim, was emailed from an email account allegedly belonging to Johnny Depp's manager, asking for tickets to see Oprah . The papers claim some of the notes purportedly to be directly from Oprah, while others claimed to be from Love, who was signed off as the star's 'executive assistant and personal aide'. Also named in the claims was Angel Agarrat, whom lawyers claim was also involved in the deception, and was subject of some of the bogus letters of recommendation for jobs. In one of the exchanges, Jackson allegedly suggested that if he and Agarrat were to be given work at the hotels, Oprah would make a personal appearance there. One letter even claimed Jackson was Oprah's nephew. Love has never worked for Oprah. Other schemes allegedly saw Jackson write to four different jewelry companies, as well as a clothe retailer, to get free goods allegedly meant for Oprah. Scheme: According to the claims, Jackson signed some emails off as Oprah, left, and others as Scott Garner, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network . The claims date from around September 2013 to the end of 2014. The documents also say Jackson has a history of pretending to be Love, and had tried in 2010 to trade off Love's own name to get free designer clothes, handbags and Cheesecake Factory vouchers. In a final case, Jackson . OWN, Love and Scott Garner, an executive at Oprah's company whose name was used, filed a joint suit against Jackson and Agarrat this week. It accuses the two of invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names, infringing trademarks and conspiracy. The documents ask that a judge files an injunction to stop the two using any of the false names, and also stakes a claim for financial damages. Although no figures are specified, arguments in the court papers imply that the figure will be at least $75,000.","Justin Jackson allegedly pretended to be celebrity-linked characters .

"A former Premier League striker urged a footballer at a struggling non-league club to make some 'easy money' by fixing the result of a match, a court has heard. Ex-Bolton Wanderers forward Delroy Facey, 34, is also alleged to have told a contact that some Football Conference teams would 'do' a game in return for payment. Facey, whose former clubs include Hull City and West Bromwich Albion, is accused of conspiring with non-league player Moses Swaibu and others to commit bribery. Delroy Facey (right) arrives at Birmingham Crown Court for the start of his trial on Monday. He is accused of being involved in a plot to fix lower league football matches . Facey (right) is alleged to have contacted a non-league player via WhatsApp to fix matches . Facey (right) celebrates after scoring for Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League in 2003 . On the second day of a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, prosecutor Nick Mather claimed records of online messages showed Facey had approached footballers about 'throwing' lower league matches. In one text conversation, conducted on messaging service WhatsApp in late 2013, Facey is alleged to have tried to corrupt Greater Manchester-based Hyde FC player Scott Spencer by offering him £2,000. The court heard that Facey, of Huddersfield, made contact with Mr Spencer shortly after discussing Hyde's poor run of form with a convicted match-fixer. Mr Spencer, who the court heard was not involved in any form of match-fixing, is alleged to have been messaged by Facey, who told him: 'You lot (Hyde) get rinsed out, week in, week out. Defendant Moses Swaibu (right) on the ball during an FA Cup match between Lincoln and Bolton in 2010 . 'You lot should make some money out of this lad, easy money. 'Check this out. Four goals in a game - two in either half - and you guys can get 2k each, win lose or draw. 'You guys can't win for s*** so you may as well make some peas.' During the WhatsApp conversation, which was read to jurors by Mr Mather, Facey is alleged to have added that a friend who was betting would provide the cash. Addressing the jury on the second day of his opening speech, Mr Mather claimed Facey was attempting to bribe Mr Spencer and team-mates that he trusted into fixing a match. Facey (top) in action for West Brom during a match against Norwich City in March 2004 . Mr Mather further alleged that Facey told a convicted match-fixer in another message: 'I have got (Football) Conference teams that will 'do' a game but how much?' Transcripts of messages which passed between Facey and 43-year-old Krishna Ganeshan, who was found guilty of conspiracy at an earlier trial, were also shown to the jury. In an exchange on October 28 2013, the court heard, Ganeshan used Skype to contact Facey, telling him: 'Get ready, things are about to come to life. Keep your boys on stand-by. 'If they deliver first time, me and only you are in big business for the future.' Huddersfield's Facey (left) vies with Brentford's Michael Dobson during an old Second Division match in 2002 . The Crown claims the Skype discussion - and a message sent by Facey claiming six players in the Football Conference were 'amenable' to match-fixing - could not have been part of an attempt to rip off a gambling syndicate. Mr Mather told the jury: 'It may be suggested to you that what Delroy Facey was actually up to was trying to scam people who were betting on football matches. 'The prosecution say that is not the case.' Facey and Swaibu, 25, of Bermondsey, south London, deny conspiring together and with others to commit bribery between November 1 and 27 2013.

"While pounding on the treadmill day in and day out may work for some people, for others it is a torturous task that makes exercise nearly impossible to enjoy, let alone commit to. Enter 'Retrosweat'. Founded by former NIDA graduate Shannon Dooley, 30, the aerobics classes with a twist are all about 'making fitness fabulous'. Described as 'freestyle aerobic workout,' Retrosweat is inspired by the era of old-school VHS workouts made famous by Jane Fonda, and involves choreography to match the Eighties soundtrack. Scroll down for video . Getting physical: Shannon Dooley has founded 'Retrosweat' - an Eighties-inspired aerobics class in the style of Jane Fonda's iconic workouts . Skin and pins: Typical Retrosweat attire is all about showing off your legs in skimpy Eighties leotards . Pop it like it's hot: A Retrosweat class will have you popping, squatting and grinding to a retro soundtrack . A 50-minute workout, it has 12 dance tracks and Dooley regularly mixes up the soundtrack to keep people excited each week - and on their toes. 'There's a fusion of jogging, jumping, athletic movement and dance - and a lot of huffing and puffing' says Dooley. 'Basically there's a warm up, warm down, both high and medium impact movement that targets all areas of the body. 'There will be a leg track with squats and lunges and an arm track with push ups.' Eighties alter ego: Dooley says class goers  tend to adopt a complete alter ego as their costume collection grows . Iconic: Olivia Newton-John's aerobic anthem Let's Get Physical inspired many a skimpy lycra ensemble . 'Being freestyle though, I like to change up the tracks and let people request songs, but also give people the structure of the same key moves each week.' It also promises to have you 'sweating litres, laughing loads and getting buns of steel and a core to die for.' And according to Dooley, there's nothing else like it on the market. 'What makes it different is it's theatrical - people can come into a space that’s all about the 1980s and escape 2015 for an hour,' says Dooley. 'Not to mention being physically and creatively expressive while getting exercise they need.' And it's not just for those stuck in a Eighties time warp either. Tutti Frutti - In Summer Dooley adds 'Pineapple squat challenge' a modern take on a kettlebell workout . 'The demographic is quite wide. We have girls in their early twenties that come, ladies in their thirties, ladies in their forties who used to listen to Eighties music during high school, women in early sixties who are relieved freestyle movement is back and who used to do it five times a week in the Eighties.' 'Oh and we definitely have men come along too,  they love it.' Overall Dooley says people just like to come along because they love Eighties music, want to put an amazing costume on, feel fabulous - and release endorphins - 'It’s one big healthy party!' When asked where she got her inspiration,  surprisingly it wasn't from watching her mum do Jane Fonda workouts. Diva demographic: Dooley say there's no set demographic - attendees include men and women aged from their twenties to sixties . 'No strangely. My mum was actually an amazing tap dancer so while all my friends were in aerobics classes I watched my mum do tap exams,' says Dooley. 'She is though an amazing choreographer so that’s where I get my inspiration from.' As for attire? 'I wouldn’t turn away anyone who isn’t in a leotard,' laughs Dooley. 'But as people come back, gradually each week they will start to build collection. A leotard from eBay, leg warmers from American Apparel and after a while they build this whole alter ego and when then they will come in wearing a G-string leotard and no one will even blink.' On her own wardrobe, Dooley takes her job very seriously, admitting she's never worn the same outfit twice, 'an I've been teaching for three years - so yes my lycra costumes take up a whole room now' - (65 leotards to be precise). Fit and fun: Dooley says unlike  treadmill workouts, Retrosweat is about having fun and forgetting it's fitness . 'I like to set the standards through my face, hair and body so people feel invited to be themselves,' she says. Aside from the costumes, music and theatrics, Dooley also throws in some novelty competitions and spin off Seventies and Nineties classes to mix it up for regular aerobic goers. 'In summer, we do the pineapple squat challenge - so someone in the room will hold a pineapple in the squat track (which weighs about 2kgs) and it works just like a kettlebell, except your using the resistance of pineapple. Fonda fitspo: Dooley credits Jane Fonda as one of her main sources of inspiration behind Retrosweat . 'When we do Seventies class I will mix it up with a disco ball!' Dooley says the Seventies and Nineties nights she likes to throw in for good measure and to mix up the moves, as well as give herself a break from Eighties decade for a bit. 'Nineties goes off, we dance to fresh prince and that classic song ‘Sing hallelujah!’ So with all this fun and flair, how does the fitness measure up? 'For me, other than getting people to smile, escape life for an hour and enjoy themselves, the best feedback I get is about fitness. People will say, I lost four kilos and I didn't even notice!' says Dooley. 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves': Dooley says those with two left feet won't have any difficulty . 'A lot of exercise these days is scientific, counting reps and scooping protein powder. I respect that but that’s not me. My exercise has always been jumping on my bed and having fun, and I know there is a big group out there that has brains that work the same as mine,' says Dooley. 'People want variation, they want a ballad and they want to go nuts when the chorus hits. And the great thing about using songs is they're only 3.5-4 minutes long so there’s comfort in the fact you’re jumping up and down  but there's ‘just one more chorus’ and then we’ll be done.' So for Dooley it all just boils down to getting people excited and wanting to have a 'bodacious body.' 'I love seeing people improve their quality of life through the magic of music and star jumps - as sentimental as that sounds.' As for those with two left feet, Dooley says you won't have any trouble. Baby one more time: Every now and again a Seventies or Nineties class is thrown into the mix, which Dooley says 'go off' 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves. I think it's much more enjoyable to do simple moves well and enjoy it than struggle with something complicated and not enjoy it. So whether you've never danced or are a dancer who wants to keep their skills up,  Retrosweat is all about simplicity and completely inclusive.' And it seems this 'blast from the past' class is only growing. Dooley now runs additional side business 'Dial-a-sweat' where she takes hens parties for a class, and has travelled all around Sydney from Bowral, Newport and Kirrabilli overlooking the harbour bridge. And with two current locations in Alexandria and Surry Hills that run weekly (and Bondi for a while), Dooley believes the demand is strong and she already has her eyes on even bigger things. 'I want the whole world Retrosweating, that’s the plan.' 'And if I have too much make-up on and have sweat running on my face then that’s all part of it.'","'Retrosweat' aerobics classes allow attendees to 'forget 2015 for an hour'

"Common creams used to treat athlete's foot and eczema could undo the damage of multiple sclerosis, scientists claim. The surprise discovery could pave the way to ground-breaking new therapies for the devastating auto-immune disease ,which affects around 2.5 million worldwide. Scientists found that the anti-fungal agent miconazole and the steroid clobetasol both restored movement to mice paralysed by a rodent version of multiple sclerosis (MS). In laboratory tests, they prompted inactive mouse and human stem cells to regenerate myelin, the protective insulation-like coating around nerve fibres that is destroyed by the disease. Common creams used to treat athlete's foot and eczema could cure multiple sclerosis, scientists claim . Dr Robert Miller, of the US team from Case Western Reserve University who carried out the study, said the results marked a significant breakthrough. He said: 'It was a striking reversal of disease severity in the mice. 'The drugs that we identified are able to enhance the regenerative capacity of stem cells in the adult nervous system. 'This truly represents a paradigm shift in how we think about restoring function to multiple sclerosis patients.' Miconzanole is sold over the counter in most pharmacies as a cream to treat athlete's foot, while clobetasol cream is commonly prescribed to treat eczema. Although both drugs are widely used, a way must be found to use them safely as internal human treatments rather than creams or ointments before clinical trials can be considered. The researchers are confident this problem can be solved, but have warned patients not to jump the gun by using the drugs prematurely. Lead scientist Professor Paul Tesar, from Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, said: 'We appreciate that some patients or their families feel they cannot wait for the development of specific approved medications, but off-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. 'We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use.' MS is a condition of the central nervous system, where the coating around nerve fibres (called myelin) is damaged, causing a range of symptoms. The specific symptoms that appear depend upon which part of the central nervous system is affected and the job of the damaged nerve. People with MS might suffer fatigue, vision problems and difficulties with walking, but the condition is different for everyone. Symptoms can come and go and can vary greatly in terms of severity . There may be periods of relapse of varying length and severity. At present, there is no cure for MS but  the symptoms can be treated. It is usually diagnosed in people aged 20 to 40, and it affects almost three times as many women as men. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 2.5 million people have MS. Source: Multiple Sclerosis Trust . MS occurs when the immune system attacks myelin, thereby disrupting the passage of nerve signals. As the disease progresses, it produces symptoms ranging from mild numbness or tingling to full blown paralysis. Occasionally, it can prove fatal. Although current treatments can slow progression of MS and reduce its symptoms, the disease remains incurable. One new approach is to focus on special stem cells called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) that mature into myelin-producing cells. While other scientists have looked at ways of replacing lost stem cells using transplantation techniques, the Case Western team set out to find a way of stimulating existing, but inactive, OPCs. After screening 727 potential drug candidates, they identified two - miconazole and clobetasol - that coaxed the OPCs to form oligodendrocytes and repair nerve fibres stripped of myelin. 'We know that there are stem cells throughout the adult nervous system that are capable of repairing the damage caused by multiple sclerosis, but until now, we had no way to direct them to act,' said Prof Tesar. 'Our approach was to find drugs that could catalyse the body's own stem cells to replace the cells lost in multiple sclerosis.' As well as testing the drugs on mice affected by MS, the scientists also observed their effect on human OPCs in the laboratory. The response was similar to that seen in mouse cells, with miconazole exerting the most potent effect. Co-author Dr Fadi Najm, also from Case Western Reserve University, said: 'We have pioneered technologies that enable us to generate both mouse and human OPCs in our laboratory. 'This uniquely positioned us to test if these drugs could also stimulate human OPCs to generate new myelinating cells.' Scientists said the finding was significant as it could pave the way to  new therapies for MS, which affects around 2.5 million worldwide . The drugs also hold out the promise of treatments for other diseases that involve myelin loss or dysfunction, including cerebral palsy, age-related dementia, optic neuritis and schizophrenia, the scientists believe. British immunology expert Professor Daniel Altmann, from Imperial College London, said: 'This study offers the highly attractive possibility of re-targeting existing, safe, drugs for the purpose of promoting therapeutic remyelination. 'The data appear to suggest that the drugs can to some extent limit disability in experimental models of MS, though there is clearly much more to be optimised in this area, not least as the models tried thus far do not really look at effects on chronic demyelination. 'However, particularly for patients with progressive MS - where it can be difficult to know how to impact the ongoing deterioration, these approaches offer the great advantage that these are tried, tested and safe drugs passed for use in humans. 'Some caution is clearly warranted, however, when one considers the long haul from benefits in tissue culture models of myelination to a complex and diverse human disease such as MS.' The findings were published in the journal Nature.","Active ingredients in creams were found to cure multiple sclerosis (MS)

"Nigel Farage has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten, it can be revealed. Ukip, which will today unveil its manifesto, has reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls. A party strategist said 'something extraordinary' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list. Nigel Farage has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten . South Thanet, Kent (Majority: Con 7,617) Clacton, Essex (Ukip 12,404) Rochester & Strood, Kent (Ukip 2,920) Thurrock, Essex (Con 92) Great Grimsby, Lincs (Labour 714) Boston & Skegness, Lincs (Con 12,426) Camborne & Redruth, Cornwall (Con 66) Dudley North, West Midlands (Lab 649) Castle Point, Essex (Cons 7,632) Heywood & Middleton, Greater Manchester (Lab 617) After Ukip won the Rochester and Strood by-election last November and gained its second MP, Mr Farage said the party could go on to win 'dozens of seats' in the election. But Ukip campaign chiefs have now adopted a 'shotgun' approach with a far fewer targets. Mr Farage will this morning launch the party's manifesto in Thurrock, Essex. A Ukip source said: 'It will be a broad and open offer to those on low and middle incomes. That's something which no other party is doing.' Among the seats dropped from the list of hopefuls is Folkestone and Hythe, where candidate Janice Atkinson was replaced after allegations of fraudulent expenses claims. The target list includes South Thanet, where Mr Farage is standing, along with Clacton and Rochester and Strood, where Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless won by-elections after defecting from the Tories. The party also hopes to win in Thurrock, a tight three-way marginal where the Tories are defending a majority of just 92. Another focus is Heywood and Middleton, in Greater Manchester, where it narrowly lost a by-election to Labour last October. Ukip's election co-ordinator Chris Bruni-Lowe, who masterminded last year's by-election wins, is organising campaigns in the ten targets. The party is helping write campaign literature, organising mailshots to voters and putting up billboards, while other candidates are mostly being left to their own devices. Clacton, where Tory defector Douglas Carswell (left) is standing for Ukip, is one of the few seats the party still thinks he can win . Ukip's immigration spokesman has admitted that even the leadership of the party has been left confused by its policy on foreigners moving to Britain. At an event last month Steven Woolfe said the deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, who has written Ukip's manifesto, did not understand the immigration policy even when he showed her diagrams to explain it. It is claimed that Mr Woolfe, who was speaking after a meeting in Dudley, said: 'The problem is, even within my own party, my own deputy chairman, didn't seem to understand it herself despite the fact I actually put picture graphs. 'I put the numbers on and the point is people confuse immigration. Immigration consists of loads of different numbers, the number of students, it's asylum seekers, it's family members.' Nigel Farage was earlier this month accused of 'making up his policies as he goes along' after he called for the number of arrivals to be limited at 50,000 a year, but at the same time claimed overall caps on net migration would be 'ludicrous'. Miss Evans this morning said the manifesto would include an immigration limit of 50,000 skilled workers from around the world, adding she was 'proud' of the policy. Most pollsters suggest Ukip is being squeezed, with an ICM poll suggesting the party had slipped to 7 per cent on Monday, while a poll by Opinium at the weekend put the party on a two-year low. Mr Farage has maintained that the party is not losing support but appears to have changed his rhetoric, referring to the election as a 'springboard'. In an interview at the weekend he suggested Ukip supporters should vote Tory in seats where the party has no chance of winning. A senior Ukip source last night said Mr Farage could begin discussions with the Tories about a post-election deal through 'back-channels' before the polls close. Mr Farage 'is minded to do confidence-and-supply with whoever offers an EU referendum', he said. Ukip's manifesto will include a pledge to fund 6,000 jobs in the police, prison service and Border Agency for military veterans. And Mr Farage is today expected to pledge that his party would spend 'substantially' more than Nato's target of 2 per cent of national income on defence. He has previously said that Ukip would meet the target. The Tories have refused to commit to the target beyond next year. In a bid to bolster faltering opinion poll ratings, Mr Farage said Ukip was offering 'serious, fully costed policies' aimed at voters who 'believe' in Britain. An in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership 'as soon as possible', a five-year ban on unskilled migrants coming in to the UK and a points-based system for others are among other key pledges. With the party keen to broaden its appeal after a slip in support after surging to victory in last year's European elections, the manifesto also offers boosts for first-time buyers, military veterans, small businesses and hospital patients.","EXCLUSIVE: Farage has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats .

"A would-be Lib Dem MP who describes himself as a feminist has been filmed repeatedly trying to touch a naked lap dancer. Married father-of-one Maajid Nawaz asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London. Footage shows the prospective parliamentary candidate – who calls himself an advocate of women’s rights – attempting to touch her arms and thighs, which is against the venue’s policy. Scroll down for video . Up close: Would-be MP Maajid Nawaz with a scantily-clad lap dancer in the club in east London . Seedy: The married father-of-one asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London . Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘outrageous’. In the film, Nawaz – a convicted former extremist – can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him in a private room during two £20 lap dances. Manager Jay Shah, who witnessed Nawaz’s behaviour, said he was ‘very drunk’ and bouncers threatened to throw him out several times. ‘He was asking her to touch him and he was touching her,’ he said. ‘In general he was quite persistent with her, asking to take her out and for her number.’ A rising star of the Liberal Democrats, 37-year-old Nawaz is also a leading figure in the Muslim community and head of anti-extremism charity the Quilliam Foundation, which he set up. Rising star: The prospective parliamentary candidate with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . A regular guest on BBC News programmes, he declared on Newsnight in 2013: ‘I consider myself a feminist.’ He once wrote on Twitter: ‘You don’t need to be a woman to stand for women’s rights.’ He often throws his weight behind gender issues such as the campaign against female genital mutilation and paints himself as a role model for young Muslim men at risk of radicalisation. But Abdul Malik, the club’s owner, said he wanted the video to be seen by the public because of the way Nawaz portrays himself as a feminist and a family man. ‘He’s always talking about religion on TV and I thought, what a hypocrite,’ he said. He claimed ‘arrogant’ Nawaz acts like a ‘spokesman for Islam’ – but visited the club during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘outrageous’ The full strip club footage, obtained by the Mail, clearly shows Nawaz receiving two five-minute lap dances an hour apart. He and two friends paid £10 entry to the small ‘gentleman’s club’ in Whitechapel and were seen drinking heavily. He left the club alone in the early hours of the morning. During the first session – in which the dancer gets naked – she has to repeatedly remove his hands from her body and pushes him away at one point. During the second dance with the same woman, he also spends time chatting to her – whispering into her ear and trying to touch her hair. Newlywed: Nawaz's second wife Rachel Maggart . She later informed the manager, who told security to ‘keep an eye on her’. Club boss Mr Shah claimed Nawaz had been ‘bragging’ but the dancer later told him: ‘Who does he think he is?’ Tory MP Nadine Dorries last night called for Nawaz to quit his candidacy. ‘In politics, you can’t advocate one cause or manner of behaviour then act differently in your personal life,’ she said. Labour MP Khalid Mahmood added: ‘The message this sends to women is not one of respect.’ British-born Nawaz was jailed in Egypt in 2005 for his role in radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. On his return to England in 2006, he renounced his views and quickly established himself as a spokesman on extremism issues. He has been selected by party leader Nick Clegg to fight the London marginal seat of Hampstead and Kilburn and has been married to US-born writer and artist Rachel Maggart, 29, since October. They were engaged and believed to have been living together at his West London home when he visited the club on July 9 last year. He has a young son from his previous marriage to Rabia Nawaz – who is also known to have supported Hizb ut-Tahrir. A spokesman for Nawaz said he denied touching the dancer ‘inappropriately’ and added that his reputation for advocating women’s rights was ‘in the context of Islamic extremism’. He said he had not been warned about his behaviour, and was not ‘out of control’ through drink or breaching the rules. The spokesman said: ‘The evening you refer to was our client’s stag night before his marriage. ‘His best man took him to the gentleman’s club with the full knowledge of our client’s then future wife (now his wife).’ Nawaz can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him .","Father-of-one Maajid Nawaz asked for two private sessions at a strip club .

"Many couples disagree over what to name their children — but one New York couple’s battle over their unborn baby’s moniker became so unbearable that they have asked random members of the public to help them reach a decision. Kseniya Soukeras, who is due in August, wants to name her unborn child Michael, after her late father. Her husband Nicholas prefers the Greek name Spyridon, after his own father. Because they have been unable to settle their disagreement privately, the couple has turned to the general public to help them make a decision; Nicholas, 37, has launched an online petition asking for help to sway his wife. Baby name showdown: Nicholas and Kseniya Soukeras can't agree over whether to name their child Spyridon or Michael, which Nicholas says his wife will shorten to Mischa . 'The argument is serious — it’s not a joke,' Kseniya, 33, told the New York Post. 'I don’t want to call my son something I can’t even pronounce.' According to the petition, Kseniya finds the name Spyridon 'archaic, base, bereft of elegance and unsuitable for a child living in 21st century America'. But Nicholas argues that his wife simply has not had the opportunity to grow to like the name, and that her 'Russian ear is not trained for the sweet, musical sounds of our Greek nomenclature'. Rich history: Nicholas says the name Spyridon 'has been held by the highest and most honored officials and patriots of both the U.S. and the former Soviet Union' However, the nights of 'bickering about it back and forth' may be moot: the couple does not even know for sure whether they are even having a son. 'My husband is convinced. He thinks he’s a psychic... he thinks he can see through the belly,' says Kseniya. In fact, if the couple has a girl, Nicholas is willing to let Kseniya choose the name; he also says that if they name their first born son Spyridon, his wife can choose the name of their second son.

"A white supremacist with a split tongue and 'Satan' tattooed on his face has been sentenced to life in prison for stabbing a black man to death. David Adam Pate from Lancaster, North Carolina, told his mother he enjoyed knifing 33-year-old Ricky James 39 times after luring him into some woods with wine in November 2013. The 25-year-old serial criminal, who pleaded guilty to the murder on Thursday, told police he just wanted to 'cut his dad gum head off,' and that he cut him with a butcher's knife, 'just like the one Michael Myers used in (the movie) Halloween.' During an interview after his arrest, he even blamed the victim for the murder, saying: 'It was his fault. Why would anyone go drinking and go into the woods with someone who looks like me? ' Scroll down for video . Jailed: David Adam Pate, 25, (mugshot from 2013 left and in court on Thursday right) from Lancaster, North Carolina told his mother he enjoyed knifing 33-year-old Ricky James 39 times after luring him into some woods with wine in November 2013. He was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole for the slaying . During the sentencing hearing, James's two brothers described him as the 'devil', admitting that they wanted him to suffer in prison. One of them, who spoke at his sentencing, said a man like that 'doesn't deserve to live on this earth' before storming out of the court screaming in distress. According to The Charlotte Observer, police found at least 20 knives, both store bought and homemade, and more than 20 masks in Pate's home after he was arrested, when children who were playing in the woodland found the victim's decomposing body. He was already in jail at the time, having been arrested for disorderly conduct two weeks before. As he was booked into custody, officers took a frightening mugshot of Pate. He stuck out his split tongue and revealed a 974 tattoo on his neck - the sign of the white power gang, Gangster Disciples. Emotionless: Prosecutors said Pate deserved to die in prison. He has never offered the James family an apology for the 'senseless and remorseless' act . Confession: The 25-year-old told police during a taped interview used a butcher's knife, 'just like the one Michael Myers used in (the movie) Halloween' to kill James (right) During a police interview, he described how he covered James's remains up because he wanted to kill someone in the same place. He said he tied James with a rope from neck to ankles so that he could drag the body away after the stabbing site, but was too drunk and tired to continue to try and drag James's body to a nearby creek. Prosecutors added they they thought Pate deserved to die behind bars. Solicitor Randy Newman told the court: 'This is an evil man standing before you. If anyone deserves life in prison, it's David Pate.' Judge Dan Hall sentenced Pate to life in prison with no chance for parole, calling the murder a 'senseless and remorseless' act. Pate has never spoken to the family or offered an apology. Horrifying: After he was arrested Pate even blamed the victim for the murder, saying: 'It was his fault.

"Just went you thought it was warm enough to go into the water… . Killer seals have been spotted off the British coast. On four separate occasions, grey seals have been spied feasting on harbour porpoises that they have killed. Scroll down for video . The footage (pictured) backs up a recent study that grey seals  have a penchant for young porpoises with a thick layer of energy-packed fat. And that far from scavenging on dead animals, they attack healthy creatures . Video footage of one of the attacks shows a male contentedly ripping chunks of blubber off his prey, as the water all around turns bloody. Although killer seals are known to lurk in the waters off the continent, this is the first time they have been seen around Britain. And with porpoises similar in size to grown men, it raises concerns that swimmers could be next. Tom Stringell, an ecologist for the Welsh environment agency, said that while people shouldn’t panic, they should keep their distance from seals, on land and in the water. The footage, the first in the world, was shot by a wildlife cruise company, off the coast of Pembrokeshire. Dafydd Rees, who made the recording, said: ‘I’ve been working on this stretch of the coast but have never seen anything like it before. The footage (pictured), the first in the world, was shot by a wildlife cruise company, off the coast of Wales . Ferocious: Scientists said the seals may have developed a taste for porpoises after sampling some caught in fishing nets (stock image shown) and warned that people could be next . ‘It was really surprising to see.’ Grey seals are known for being playful and friendly. Found all around Britain’s coastline, they can grow to 40 stone but normally feed on fish no bigger than salmon. However, they have recently been blamed for attacks on porpoises on the continent. Recent Dutch research concluded that hundreds of the dead porpoises bore the tell-tale marks of a seal attack. The study said that the seals seemed to have a particular penchant for young porpoises with a thick layer of energy-packed fat. The seals, which are normally prey for great white sharks, have been seen attacking and killing medium-sized blue sharks (pictured) While most people will be familiar with images of seals being violently smashed out of the water snatched in the jaws of a shark, it appears some are exacting their revenge on the ocean predators. Scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks off the coast of South Africa. The seals, which are normally prey for great white sharks, have been seen attacking and killing medium-sized blue sharks, devouring their guts before leaving the rest of the carcass. Divers also report seeing the fur seals attacking other species of shark and rays. The behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals, which normally hunt smaller fish, have turned to attacking the torpedo-shaped sharks. The blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator. It was first observed by marine photographer Chris Fallows, who runs a dive boat operation from Cape Town in South Africa. And that far from scavenging on already dead animals, they were attacking healthy creatures. The Utrecht University researchers said the seals may have developed a taste for porpoises after sampling some caught in fishing nets. And with many of the mutilated carcasses washing up on beaches popular with swimmers, they warned people could be next. Although killer seals are known to lurk in the waters off the continent, this is the first time they have been seen around Britain (Pembrokeshire marked) They said: ‘Keep on swimming and enjoying nature. However, people should be aware that the largest predator in our countries is the grey seal. ‘These animals may reach 40 stone, are related to bears and have the teeth to go with that lineage. ‘In the water, they are much more able than the most agile human swimmers and they have made the switch from eating fish to hunting porpoises, another mammal. ‘To date, there have been no reports of serious attacks or wounds inflicted, but some people have been bitten by inquisitive or provoked seals. ‘The advice would thus be to be aware that seals are not out there to cuddle and to keep some distance.’ Dr Stringell, who has done his own research for Natural Resources Wales, said that despite reports of seals eating porpoises off the coast of Belgium, France and the Netherlands, he was surprised to discover it happening here. He said: ‘We observed this happening on four separate occasions off the coast of Pembrokeshire. ‘But it is unclear how long this has been going on for, and why.’ Natural Resources Wales said that growing seal numbers may mean there is increasing competition for food. Not such a gentle giant: Grey seals (stock image pictured) were known for being playful and friendly. Found all around Britain’s coastline, they can grow to 40 stone but normally feed on fish no bigger than salmon . Bloodthirsty: Experts have warned that seals are 'not out there to cuddle and advise to keep some distance . Alternatively, the attacks may be an example of ‘opportunistic hunting’ – with porpoises too close for hungry seals to ignore. Dr Stringell, a senior marine mammal ecologist, said: ‘Adult grey seals have also been known to attack, kill and eat juvenile grey seals, so this type of activity isn’t totally surprising and is likely part of the natural cycle of life. ‘Seals are unlikely to pose any direct danger to people. However, they are wild animals that possess sharp teeth and are a protected species, so they should not be approached on land or in the water, particularly during the autumn pupping season.’ This is not the first time the seal’s cuddly image has been tarnished. In November, it emerged that Antarctic fur seals had been raping king penguins. One penguin was then killed – and eaten. Britain is home to up to 170,000 grey seals – almost half the world’s population. At up to 8ft 6in long and weighing 40st, they are the biggest and most common of the two types of seal found in the UK and can live for up to 35 years. Their thick blubber and waterproof fur insulate them from the cold, while high levels of haemoglobin – the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body – allow them to stay under water for up to 16 minutes at a time. The largest of Britain’s carnivores, they have highly sensitive whiskers and acute sense of hearing to help them locate food – normally fish – with even blind seals having no trouble catching prey. Once hunted for their skins, blubber and meat, seals were the first animals to be protected by modern wildlife laws. They can be shot under licence by fishermen if they are damaging nets.","On four occasions, grey seals were spied eating porpoises they had killed .

"A 46-year-old man was sentenced to life in prison on Monday after shooting dead a father and son because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago. Alfred Guy Vuozzo swore loudly as he was told he would not be eligible for parole for 35 years for murdering Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon, 39, on Prince Edward Island last August. As he was escorted from the courtroom, he screamed: 'You've sentenced me to life and I sent them to death', while the judge called the brutal double-murder an act of 'hatred and misdirected vengeance'. Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, later received a nine-month sentence for dangerous driving. Scroll down for video . 'Revenge': Alfred Guy Vuozzo, 46, has been sentenced to life in prison after shooting dead Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon (both pictured), 39, because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago. The defendant was told that he will not be eligible for parole for 35 years . Crash: Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, received a nine-month sentence. Above, a newspaper photo of the crash . After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home on St Mary's Road, near the town of Montague, CTV News reported. He shot them both in 'execution-style' killings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the crash that had claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago. In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. At the time, he told the court that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. He added he had needed to do something for her. 'Call me a cold-blooded killer, but I'm not,' he said. Before his sentencing on Monday, Vuozzo said Herbert's 'short' sentence 'has haunted me all my life', saying: 'That's all her life was worth. She only had nine years in this world. And nobody cared.' Shooting: After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home near Montague, Prince Edward Island, and shot them. Above, police at the scene . Emergency vehicle: He killed both in 'execution-style' slayings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the car crash that claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago . However, Crown lawyer John Diamond told the provincial Supreme Court in Charlottetown that Vuozzo was a 'cold-hearted' murderer who had shot his victims with a handgun to get 'revenge'. 'It was revenge. He was a cold-hearted and calculated individual,' he told the court, CBC reported. Mr Diamond also called the double-murder on August 20 'callous', 'pointless', and the worst crime in the Island's history, adding that it has caused life-long pain for surviving McGuigan family members. In a victim impact statement, Brent's wife and Brendon's mother, Marie McGuigan, who was home at the time but was not targeted by a hell-bent Vuozzo, said 'a part of me died with them that night'. Attack: In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. He said that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. Above, the scene of the killings . Meanwhile, Brent's only daughter, Donna, said she has been consumed by hatred. 'I feel so much anger and hatred that it scares me. I hate that they died this way and it haunts me,' she sobbed. At an earlier hearing, Gerald Quinn, prosecuting, explained how Cathy had been fatally thrown from a car being driven by her father when it was struck by Mr McGuigan, who was driving a truck, in 1970. The youngster's father and two other children also received minor injuries in the crash, but Herbert was not injured, The Eastern Graphic reported. Cathy died on the scene near Commercial Road. Mr McGuigan has since passed away. Referring to Brent and Brendon, Quinn said: 'These two men, by all accounts, were good hard-working men, had no involvement whatsoever in the motor vehicle accident years ago, at all. He added: 'This gentlemen [Vuozzo] had no familiarity with them other than knowing who they were. He walked into the home and he shot them both multiple times and killed them.' Thane MacEachern, defending, argued that the defendant had no previous criminal record and had suffered from depression and mental illness prior to the shootings, according to CBC. Vuozzo, of Lower Montague, will be 81 by the time he is eligible for parole. The first 25 years' ineligibility are for his first-degree murder charge, while the other 10 years are for killing Brendon. In 2011, federal legislation was passed allowing courts to impose consecutive periods of parole ineligibility in cases where defendants have been convicted of multiple murders.","Alfred Guy Vuozzo, 46, shot dead Brent McGuigan and his son, Brendon .

"Trillions of pounds worth of oil – as much as the entire North Sea fields – lies beneath an area of England dubbed ‘Britain’s Dallas’, it was claimed yesterday. Analysis suggests there is up to 100billion barrels of the fossil fuel under the Home Counties. The potential goldmine in the Weald Basin, across Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Kent, could meet up to a third of Britain’s oil demand within 15 years, according to the consortium exploring the area. Scroll down for video . UK Oil & Gas Investments say they have discovered 100billion barrels worth of oil reserves in the Weald Basin, near Gatwick airport (pictured, the well head at Horse Hill) A map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the Weald Basin, which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground . This could reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and Russia and could be a major boost for British industry at a time when the North Sea supply is dwindling. But industry experts remained sceptical of the claims, with one describing them as ‘overly optimistic’. Since 1975, of an estimated 100billion barrels of oil in the UK North Sea, only 45billion have been pumped out. It is believed another 20billion barrels can be recovered before extraction becomes too difficult. Experts warned last night that only a fraction of the Weald Basin oil may be accessible for extraction. They also claimed fracking could be required to retrieve significant volumes. Stephen Sanderson, the chief executive of UKOG, said the site at Horse Hill was 'world class' and had the potential for 'significant daily oil production' at this proposed drilling site . Horse Hill Developments consortium made the discovery during test drilling in a well five miles from Gatwick Airport. UK Oil & Gas Investments, which has a 30 per cent stake, said ‘cutting-edge’ data suggested the oilfield holds 158million barrels per square mile – equating to 100billion barrels across the basin. At current crude prices, this could be worth £3.7trillion. Stephen Sanderson of UKOG, which insisted it would not use fracking, said: ‘By 2030, we could produce 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the UK’s oil demand from within the Weald area.’ Neil Ritson, of fellow consortium firm Solo Oil, said it was of ‘major economic significance’. If flow tests showed oil could be extracted, the production process could begin within 18 months, he added. US firm Nutech, which conducted the tests, estimated 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the oilfield could be extracted – up to 15billion barrels. UKOG chairman David Lenigas said drilling in the Weald could create ‘many thousands’ of jobs. Although the exploration site covered 55 square miles out of 1,100, he said the consortium was confident the entire region was oil-rich. Works: The well is situated in this container on the proposed drilling site . Exploration: Experts are now trying to work out how much of the oil will be properly recoverable . Mr Lenigas dismissed suggestions it would be hard to extract from the site, saying the ground was limestone which acted ‘like a big sponge’ and that ‘you can effectively suck the oil out’. The Australian entrepreneur, who lives in Monaco, is a director of 16 British companies – and has been criticised in the past for exaggerating the success of his enterprises to jack up share prices. UKOG shares soared after the firm claimed to have discovered a ‘world-class potential resource’. However, Professor Alastair Fraser, of Imperial College London, said the claims were ‘overly optimistic’. A study by the university suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region, while the British Geological Survey estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil. Discovery: The Horse Hill site near Gatwick in Sussex, where a large amount of oil has apparently been found . Drilling: Exploratory wells have found that the ground contains 158million barrels per square mile . Development: The site is owned by a number of companies including UK Oil & Gas Investments . The professor added: ‘The question will be how much of it we can actually get out and whether it is commercially and technologically viable to do so.’ Malcolm Graham-Wood, of oil consultants HydroCarbon Capital, suggested residents might object to rows of onshore oil wells, adding: ‘The question is can it produce oil? It is extremely difficult with a very low recovery rate. This is potentially interesting but I wouldn’t attribute any value yet.’ But Mr Lenigas said: ‘To all those people who say I am hiking up the share price, I am not. I am just saying what the Nutech report says … I feel passionate that this is globally significant for Britain.’ A Department of Energy & Climate Change spokesman said: ‘The Government welcomes any new information which expands our understanding of the potential of the Weald Basin.’ There might be 100billion barrels of oil beneath the Home Counties – but residents living above it may not receive a penny of the profits. The Government owns the land under your house – meaning homeowners have no right to any oil found beneath them. Once oil has been found, oil companies pay the Government for an annual licence which gives them the right to excavate the oil and keep the profits. The Government also gains money from the tax it receives on the oil extracted. The only way an oil company would pay the surface landowner is if it wanted to base its drilling site on their land. However, firms that undertake fracking, which is seen as a more intrusive and controversial method of extracting oil than simply drilling, must sometimes agree to provide ‘community benefits’. This could include building a playground or school nearby the fracking site, and is seen as compensation for residents. Oil companies need to consult communities if they plan to undertake fracking in their area, as well as gaining planning permission from the local council.

The alarm clock, called Wakē (pictured) rouses individuals from their slumber one at a time using a focused beam of light and sound. The wall-mounted device creates a ‘personal sunrise’ and emits focused ultrasonic waves to wake up each person in bed individually without disturbing their partner . It uses a white LED to slowly illuminate the area around a sleeper’s face to gently wake them up, with the aim of making them feel alert faster. Instead of relying on cameras, the device uses a sensor to pick out individuals using body heat. It also has built in rechargeable batteries and a Wi-Fi connected processor so it works with a phone app that's used to differentiate between sleepers. Mounted on a wall, the gadget pivots to send a focused beam of sound towards one sleeper that is emitted by a parametric speaker. Parametric speakers use ultrasonic waves to create a very narrow, audible beam, which should only be heard by one sleeper, allowing their partner to continue to doze. The alarm clock  pivots (pictured) to make sure it targets a person accurately, even if a couple are cuddled up . The Wakē alarm is affixed to the wall behind the bed. It has an inbuilt sensor to detect sleepers' body heat. The device pivots and sends a directed beam of light and sound to rouse an individual. It partners with an app so that users can tell the device which side of the bed they sleep on and when they want to wake up. At the same time, an LED light grows brighter to simulate sunlight, encouraging a sleeper to wake up more naturally. ‘Wakē uses a parametric speaker (like a laser beam of sound) to deliver focused, soothing sounds that start quietly, and grow louder slowly as the light beam grows brighter,’ according to the device’s Kickstarter page. ‘Since Wakē’s light and sound is aimed at you, your partner can rest peacefully while you wake up energised.’ The device has been invented by Los Angeles-based firm Lucera Labs. It is hoping to raise $100,000 (£66,934) on the crowdfunding site to put the alarm clock into production.

"Ryan Wray, 26, was formally charged with second-degree felony forcible sexual abuse on Friday . A former Utah State University fraternity president who was arrested in March on suspicion of sexual assault was officially charged in First District Court on Friday. Ryan Wray, 26, was charged with second-degree felony forcible sexual abuse in relation to a series of alleged assaults that occurred between last October and his March 24 arrest. Wray, who served as the 2013 and 2014 Pi Kappa Alpha president, was tasked with keeping safe women who 'could no longer take care of themselves' at parties at the off-campus frat house, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. A woman who went to a party at the 'Pike House' told police she awoke to find Wray 'touching her inappropriately without her approval' according to KSL. The woman, who said she was drunk at the time, discussed the incident with other women who then reported having similar experiences. When Wray was brought in by the Logan City Police Department for questioning, he confessed to groping the victim while she was passed out, the Herald Journal reported. He also admitted to groping two other women. So far only the first alleged victim filed a statement with police. All of the women were under 21. Wray was released on $10,000 bail after his arrest. Wray posted this picture on Facebook and wrote: 'Feel like being the new pres requires at least 1 frat selfie' A woman who went to a party at the 'Pike House' said she awoke to find Wray 'touching her inappropriately' The Pi Kappa Alpha chapter at USU decided to suspend Wray after his arrest and then also ceased operations .

"Siblings will no longer be given priority for school places amid soaring competition because of a booming population, it has emerged. Wandsworth council in London has announced that it is set to remove the rule giving an automatic place to a pupil's brothers and sisters even if the family has moved out of the catchment area. This comes after it was revealed that 80,000 children face missing out on their preferred primary school, with more than 20,000 at risk of being denied any of their preferred choices. In the most oversubscribed areas, four in ten pupils are expected not to get a place at their favourite school amid an escalating crisis over places fuelled by a baby boom and immigration. Wandsworth council has announced that it is set to remove the rule giving priority to pupils' siblings, pictured is Honeywell School which has a catchment area of just 182 metres . Wansdworth, which is an affluent borough, has decided to remove sibling priority from September 2016 in a bid to make the process fairer and give priority to children who live closest to schools. The change was also considered in Leeds and is expected to spread to more local authorities within the next few years, according to The Times. Families who move more than 800 metres from their preferred school in Wandsworth will lose their automatic entitlement to a place for younger brothers and sisters. A spokesman for the council said: 'A lot of people are getting school places then moving miles away, in some cases cashing in on house prices while retaining the school place. Siblings then get priority over children living closer to the school. The consultation was drawn up because parents were getting upset about this.' Honeywell, which is one of the most popular schools in Wandsworth, has a catchment area of just 182 metres, despite taking 90 children. None of the appeals for places at the schools were successful. Justine Roberts, Mumsnet CEO said: 'Giving priority to siblings is tricky; as one Mumsnet user says, 'it's lovely until the kids who live next door to the school can't get in'. 'For parents of two or more, having children at two different primaries can be a logistics nightmare; but for parents of only children, or to those whose children can't get in to nearby schools, it can feel pretty unfair. More than 80,000 children face missing out on their preferred primary school, with 20,000 at risk of being denied any of their preferred choices . 'On balance, most seem to think it would be sensible to restrict sibling priority to those families still living close to the school.' Wandsworth council announced the decision to consult parents  on the changes in September last year. Speaking at the time, education spokesman Cllr Kathy Tracey said: 'There has been a growing clamour from parents asking us to look at this rule because of mounting evidence that local school places are being offered to children living some distance away simply because they have an older sibling already enrolled there.' Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education at the University of Buckingham, said: 'It's possible this could set a precedent. Canny parents, in order to get into a school, rent a property very close to the school gates then move back to their old property and siblings automatically get aplace. That's very annoying for people who genuinely live near the school. 'I'm sure the sibling rule will come under greater scrutiny if it continues to be abused in the way that it is.' Rachel Burrows from the UK's biggest parenting site Netmums said: 'Changing admission rules so siblings are no longer guaranteed a place at the same school will split parents' opinions. 'On the one hand, many parents will view the move as fairer as it will stamp out the practice of families renting a home near a good school to secure a place then moving out of the area. This has become commonplace near schools rated outstanding by Oftsed and can see kids that live close to a school denied a place in favour of siblings of children already at the school but who don't live locally. 'However, for parents who already have a child at one school but lose out on a place at the same establishment, it will cause chaos. They will face two or more school runs to different schools adding to traffic problems, more school administration and will be forced to buy extra uniforms and school kit. 'The proposals show starkly that the on-going baby boom has put unprecedented pressure on school places and local authorities are struggling to cope.' A surge of appeals is anticipated as families oppose their allocated schools, some of which will be up to two miles from their homes. Labour has released figures showing the number of young children being taught in classes of more than 30 pupils has more than tripled in five years. Data from councils shows that 102,615 pupils aged between five and seven are being taught in so-called supersize classes – compared with 31,265 in 2010. Councils are due to send out offers to more than 600,000 children for primary school places this September. Early figures obtained by the Daily Mail show that in East Sussex, 15 per cent did not get their first choice – up from 14 per cent last year. Just over 6 per cent got none of their choices. In Solihull, West Midlands, 13 per cent missed out on their first choice and 4 per cent got none. One school, Oak Cottage Primary School, had six applicants for every place. The figures are repeated in other areas.","Councils in London facing unprecedented pressure on primary places .

"A nine-year-old girl is pregnant after suffering horrific sexual abuse at the hands of Isis militants in northern Iraq, aid workers report. The Yazidi girl has recently been released after nearly a year as a prisoner in the Islamic State, where women and young girls from the religious minority are known to be kept as 'sex slaves'. Earlier this week, more than 200 Yazidi women, children and elderly were released near Kirkuk, northern Iraq after being taken by Isis militants last June. Scroll down for video . Released: An elderly Yazidi man is being cared for by peshmerga troops while a young girl cries as she is being offered water by a Kurdish soldier after their release near Kirkuk, northern Iraq . Fear: The 216 prisoners, including 40 children, believed they were being led to their execution, but instead, were piled onto minibuses that drove them to a handover southwest of Kirkuk . Relief: A newly released Yazidi woman reacts upon her arrival in the village of Himera, southwest of Kirkuk, after she and hundreds of other Yazidis had been held captive since last summer . Around 40,000 people were kidnapped at gunpoint when Islamic State fighters attacked Yazidi villages last summer. Hundreds have been able to return, either by fleeing or being set free by ISIS, and the nine-year-old is among them. According to aid workers, she was 'sexually abused by no fewer than ten men', while in captivity inside the self-proclaimed caliphate. 'Most of them were front-line fighters or suicide bombers who are given girls as a reward,' Yousif Daoud, a Canadian-based aid worker told the Toronto Star. 'This girl is so young she could die if she delivers a baby,' he added. 'Even a caesarian section is dangerous. The abuse she has suffered left her mentally and physically traumatized.' Free at last: A mother hugs here young child in celebration at being released. The freed Yazidis were taken away by ambulances and buses to receive treatment and care . Yazidi families embrace after ISIS let them go. About 40 children were among those released . The United Nations said last month that the Islamic State may have committed genocide against the minority . The nine-year-old was taken to Germany by a Kurdish charity earlier this week, where she is receiving medical care, the newspaper reported. This comes after the release of 216 Yazidi prisoners who had been held captive since last summer when ISIS militants attacked their villages in the area around Sinjar in northwestern Iraq. The freed prisoners said that they had been led to believe they were being led to their execution, but instead, were piled onto a minibus that drove them to peshmerga positions. The Yazidis, made up of women, children and the elderly, are said to be in poor health and bearing signs of abuse and neglect. General Hiwa Abdullah, a peshmerga commander in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, said that about 40 children are among those released, some of whom were too exhausted and disoriented to speak. No reason was given for the release of the prisoners, which took place in Himera just southwest of Kirkuk, 180 miles north of Baghdad. Emotional scenes: Once the Yazidi prisoners, made up of women, children and the elderly, realised they were not being executed but freed, many broke down by the roadside . Newly released members of the Yazidi minority, including one girl with an injured leg, wait for medical help after being set free by ISIS . Saved: An officer from the Kurdish forces carries an elderly Yazidi woman at the checkpoint in near Kirkuk . The freed Yazidis were taken away by ambulances and buses to receive treatment and care. One elderly woman said she had been captured by the insurgents last August when they overpowered Kurdish forces in the Sinjar area and proceeded to purge its Yazidi population, killing hundreds and taking thousands captive. The woman, who asked not to be named, said she had told her son and two young daughters to run away as the militants closed in, but stayed behind herself because she was unwell and did not want to slow them down. 'I had lost hope of seeing my children again, but today it has happened,' she said as they embraced her and wept. It was not clear why the radical jihadists had decided to release the Yazidis, whom they consider devil-worshippers, but the group previously freed 200 more it was holding under similarly mysterious circumstances. Yazidi activists say many remain in the hands of Islamic State, which has often subjected women to rape or sexual slavery . Iraqi Yazidis are seen at the entrance of a checkpoint in Kirkuk after their release by the Islamic State militants near Kirkuk, northern Iraq . The 216 prisoners have been held captive in the Islamic State since last summer when militants attacked their villages in the area around Sinjar in northwestern Iraq . Some of the Yazidis said they had been held in the Islamic State stronghold of Tel Afar most of the time, but in the days leading up to their release, they were moved from one town to another in Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate. Yazidi community leaders were there to receive them and an ambulance was on standby. Yazidi activists say many remain in the hands of Islamic State, which has often subjected women to rape or sexual slavery. The United Nations said last month that the Islamic State may have committed genocide against the minority. The Yazidis are an ancient, predominantly Kurdish people who follow their own religion derived from Islam, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.","Female Yazidi held prisoner by ISIS, suffered horrific sexual abuse .

"A mysterious benefactor has donated £1.5million to Bath Abbey which was posted to church in a plain brown envelope. The donor, who is known to church officials but has asked not to be named, sent the money along with a note, saying they wanted to help safeguard the church 'for the next hundred years'. The cash will be put towards the Abbey's restoration fund, which is aiming to raise £20million to repair the collapsing floor, fit heating powered by the Bath springs, and expand the building. A mysterious benefactor posted the plain brown envelope to officials at Bath Abbey, pledging £1.5million to the church's £20million restoration fund . Laura Brown, who is heading up the Footprint restoration project, said she had to read the letter twice before she could believe it was real, adding that she had to have a 'sit down' afterwards . The donation was accompanied by a note, which reads: 'Much impressed by the care and the consultation with has been put in by the Abbey, which is such a vital part of Bath’s future. 'This generation has a solemn duty to ensure the Abbey is fit and able to carry out its service to the city and the community for the next hundred years.' The church has been granted £10.4million of Heritage Lottery Funding, but only provided they can raise the additional £7.1million themselves by the end of the year. Before the mysterious benefactor came forward, the largest single donation the church had received was £1.1million from the congregation and charity Friends of Bath Abbey. The Footprint project was granted £10.4million of Heritage Lottery funding to repair the floor, and expand the building, but only if the church can raise the remaining £7.1million by the end of the year . The church congregation, and charity Friends of Batch Abbey, donated £1.1million to the project, but the anonymous donor topped that, with their gift of £1.5million . Laura Brown, 48, who is heading up the Footprint project, told MailOnline: 'We received it in the post, just like any normal letter, and it was in a plain brown envelope just like any normal letter. 'Your first thought is ""no, hang on, that can't be right"" but then you read it again and realise, this is actually happening. I had to have a sit down for a while. 'Of course there is gratitude, but there's also this glow you get. The team believe in this project so much and it feels so good to see that someone else sees the same thing. 'Not only that but that person has the resources to be able to really make something happen, and hopefully inspire other people as well.' She added that the church still needs to raise £4.1million in the next eight months, but that cash donations have already started arriving, and more people are also pledging money. Part of the Bath Abbey rennovations will see it fitted with an eco-friendly underfloor heating system which uses water from the River Avon, warmed by the town's springs . Speaking after the first £1.1million was donated, Reverend Prebendary Edward Mason, said: 'It’s wonderful, what a remarkable group of people. 'Less than six months ago, the Abbey invited its members to consider the Footprint project by pledging gifts. 'In this short space of time, the total raised has risen to £1.1 million, an amazing response. 'Footprint is about sustaining a Christian presence at the Abbey in the heart of Bath for the next century and these gifts demonstrate the congregation and The Friends of Bath Abbey’s commitment to the project.'","Anonymous benefactor donated money to £20million restoration fund .

"A mother-of-three who gained 12 stone after getting married when her binge eating problem became so bad that she hid calorific treats in her medicine cabinet has slimmed down to her pre-wedding weight. Julia Van Herck, 42, from Fulham, West London, underwent surgery after ballooning to 23 stone after tying the knot with Stefan in 1993. She wore a size 26 to size 28 and would regularly comfort eat tubs of ice-cream and family-sized pizzas because she was scared that her husband might leave her. Mum-of-three Julia Van Herck gained 12 stone (left, at her heaviest) after binge eating following post-natal depression and amid fears that her husband would leave her. She has since slimmed down to 11 stone (right) Julia (pictured above with actor and singer Darius Campbell) admits she used food as an 'emotional crutch' and would stash snacks away in hidden places so her family wouldn't discover her secret . Battling bouts of post-natal depression after having her children, Julia says she would sneak downstairs at night and gorge on calorie-laden treats, fearful her life was falling apart and she was going to split with Stefan. The fears proved unfounded and a health scare finally prompted her to lose weight. Julia said a turning point came in October 2012 when she contracted pneumonia and was taken to Charing Cross Hospital in London. 'I was pumped full of antibiotics and developed painful thrush all over my body,' she said. 'It was in my fingers, feet and mouth. 'It didn't clear for ages.' It was while she was in hospital that doctors offered her weight-loss surgery. Julia now weighs a healthy 11 stone and is a size 12. 'I used food as an emotional crutch,' she admits. 'My husband is from Belgium and when I married him in 1993 I went from a slim 11.5 stone to 18 stone within two years. 'I was homesick and I just kept eating. I suffered with post-natal depression and every time I had a child my binge eating worsened.' Julia says that a communication breakdown with her Stefan led her to devour her favourite snacks and by 2011, she'd reached rock bottom. 'There was no communication between me and my husband and I was really isolated. Food was my friend and I needed a friend. So I binged.' Julia can once again fit into the gown that she wore at her wedding to Stefan in 1993 (left) when she weighed 11.5 stone. The slimmer, who underwent weight loss surgery, says she's a new woman, right . Julia feared her life was falling apart and used food as a way of escaping her woes . Mum to Zachary, ten, Ciaran, 16, and Letitia, 19, Julia gorged on sugary foods. 'I was heavily addicted to sugar. Biscuits, cakes, ice-cream...I loved it all. The only savoury thing I ate was pizza. If I was on a binge cycle I would eat crisps and cereal.' The situation got so bad that Julia would hide food from her family so they were unaware of how bad her eating had got. 'I hid food in the medicine cabinet so my family didn't know what I was doing.They didn't know I was buying extra. Looking back my husband must have been aware. The carer described her eating as 'a form of self-harm'. 'Ice cream was my biggest splurge,' she said. 'I would eat a family-sized pizza and two tubs of ice cream in an hour. I couldn't stop.' Doctors agreed that Julia could be a candidate for weight loss surgery but first they said that she had to shed some pounds. So, in January 2013 she started only drinking juice. She was inspired by the story of Joe Cross, an Australian who weighed more than 22 stone but lost more than seven stone by sticking to a juice diet. He wrote a book, Fat, Sick And Nearly Dead, which Mrs Van Herck heard about. 'This led to me losing weight and wanting to eat fruit and vegetables,' she said. 'I even started exercising.' Just look at us now: Julia and husband Stefan decided they wanted to stay together and Julia realised that all the fears that she'd had were just down to a lack of confidence . Life overhaul: Julia now eats healthier foods and even goes to the gym and has a new wardrobe . By October 2013 she was four stone lighter and doctors agreed she could undergo weight loss surgery at St Mary's Hospital in London, which proved successful. Now she weighs 11 stone and loves healthy food. She never binges. 'I realised I had been causing myself pain by eating,' she said. 'Now I am much happier. I buy smaller clothes and feel confident in myself.' And to prove just how far she has come, Julia has stepped back into her bridal gown after rekindling her relationship with Stefan. 'I spoke to my husband and he didn't want to split up. It was in my head because I wasn't confident. 'I've stopped taking anti-depressants for the first time in my life.' The sky's the limit now, it seems: 'I've even started going to the gym and can now run much further than I used to be able to walk without losing breath. I'm a new woman.' The NHS said: 'Binge eating is an eating disorder where a person feels compelled to overeat on a regular basis through regular binges. 'People who binge eat consume very large quantities of food over a short period of time, even when they are not hungry. 'Binges are often planned in advance and can involve the person buying 'special' binge foods.' Joe Cross' new film Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2 will air on Channel 5, 7pm on  April 21.","Julia Van Herck used to binge on tubs of ice cream and family-sized pizzas .

She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claims she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the Sydney celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . The Paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around, with celebrity followers taking on the lifestyle . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post on Tuesday. The celebrity chef has been a proud Paleo advocate . 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg says she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The revelation comes after the outspoken Paleo advocate posted a 2,100 word rant on social media claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism. The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But Hollie has praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, saying 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo [sic] for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' However associate professor of dietetics and human n at LaTrobe University, Catherine Itsiopoulos, pointed out that Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The Paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around and has attracted a raft of celebrity followers even as some health professionals urge caution about interpreting results from the eating plan. 'Celebrity chefs have used their power to influence the public on health and well-being, in particular education on food and cooking but they need to focus on the evidence,' Dr Itsiopoulos said. 'I wouldn't say Paleo is dangerous. Paleo fits into the fad diets because of the concept around it - it provides quick results to weight loss but we still need more evidence. 'But adding food such as lean meat, seafood and nuts to your diet, it does bring out positive things to your lifestyle but it's hard to comment on how Hollie's condition has changed.' The Paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . The Paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Professor of Population Health and Nutrition at the University of South Australia Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The Paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . The Paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe with its focus on high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts. But Dr O'Dea said the modern Paleo diet does not quite follow the way how Palaeolithic ancestors lived from more than two million years ago. 'One of the things that impresses me is  the meat at that time was completely different to today's meat,' Dr O'Dea said. 'The modern Paleo diet consists of just lean  meat but our ancestors ate everything edible, including organs, brains, livers and fat from the carcass of wild animals. 'From my studies and experiences, our ancestors did eat wheat - an equivalent to grains and also yams - which is highly nutritionist.'

"A map that reveals every official sighting of a UFO over the past 76 years  suggests that we are experiencing more cosmic traffic than ever before. Many of the sightings can be put down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies, but some enthusiasts believe it is because of rise in alien activity. The interactive map was created by writer Levi Pearson, who used a UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source software from CartoDB. Click on the map below to find out if aliens have been spotted in your neighbourhood . A map shows sightings of extra-terrestrials around the world in the last 76 years – and seems to suggest we have more cosmic visitors than ever. It was created by writer Levi Pearson, who used a UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source software from CartoDB . Published in the QuantBait website, it begins in 1933 with the first UFO sightings being spotted over California and Nebraska in the US, the UK and France in Europe, and locations in Japan and Australia. The number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s across the world, according to the map. In the US, sightings documented during the 1940s include the famous Battle of Los Angeles and Roswell UFO Incident. On February 25 1942, radar operators spotted a UFO within 120 miles (193km)  of Los Angeles that moved at incredible speed before vanishing. The UFO map (pictured) was created by writer Levi Pearson, who used a UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source software from CartoDB. Its shows that the number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s . Explanations for UFO sightings are just as vague as for aliens themselves, and could be down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies – or a genuine rise in alien activity. An illustration of a flying saucer is pictured . The map shows a dramatic rise in the number of UFO sightings during the 1950s and 1960s. While this could indicate ore alien activity, the CIA recently claimed that half of UFO sightings in the US were linked to them testing U2 spy planes (pictured) at altitudes of 60,000 ft . An artillery officer said he saw 25 craft flying at 25,000ft (7,620 metres) and other eye witnesses reported seeing swarms of balloon-shaped objects flying at around 200mph (320km/h). Fearing the city was under attack, officials fired at the aircraft but no evidence of damage was ever found, prompting people to speculate the UFOs were from another world. And in 1947 the Roswell Incident occurred, which is still the source of speculation today. The US military claimed they recovered a secret research balloon that had crashed, but conspiracy theorists say the wreckage of an alien craft was discovered and hidden. While it’s possible that there were more UFO visitations during the decade, officials at the time put it down to people being nervous about World War II, and seeing objects in the sky. Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, told MailOnline: ‘Sightings of strange things in the sky have been reported for centuries, though it was only with them being labelled as flying saucers or UFOs that people began to realise that this is a worldwide phenomenon. ‘UFO sightings often come in sudden and short-lived periods, which ufologists call flaps or waves. 'Often specific locations seem to be highly attractive to UFOs, and these locations are known as UFO window areas or UFO portals. The British version of Roswell reportedly took place over Christmas in 1980. It occurred in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, next to RAF military bases. Soldiers reported unusual lights and when they investigated, found a metal object with coloured lights (UFO map of UK shown) Thanks to the rise in popularity of sci-fi films and an increase in UFO sightings, aliens were very much in the public consciousness in the 1960s. Here, Dr H Allen Hyneck, an astrophysicist at  Northwestern University says at a press conference in 1966, that a photo claiming to show a UFO is a time exposure of the crescent moon and the planet Venus . The British version of Roswell reportedly took place over Christmas in 1980. It occurred in Rendlesham Forest, which is next to RAF military bases. Soldiers reportedly saw unusual lights and when they investigated, found a metal object with coloured lights. But as they approached the 'craft', it moved away, frightening farm animals. The incident is unexplained, but some people say the lights were reflections from a nearby lighthouse and the craft may have been a secret weapon. On March 31, 1992, high speed white objects were spotted in the skies and an officer at RAF Cosford and Shawbury spotted a large triangular craft hovering at 200ft, which was humming and shining a spotlight. The incident was reported to the Ministry of Defence and sceptics say it could be explained by a nearby police tracking helicopter or a Russian rocket re-entering the atmosphere. ‘In the UK, Warminster, Cannock Chase and Bonnybridge are the most famous UFO window areas.' Bonnybridge is known as the UFO capital of Scotland and there are said to be some 300 sightings every year, although not all of these are shown on the map. Cannock Chase in the Midlands has been a UFO hotbed since the1960s when there were first reports of a crashed craft, and earlier this year, residents reported seeing slow-moving aircraft making a loud buzzing noise moving across the sky. There appear to be repeated UFO sightings in the Midlands shown on the map during the 1960s, with clusters of activity also seen in the Netherlands, Germany and other parts of central Europe. There is a marked increase in sightings on the map during the 1950s and 1960s, all across the US shown on the map. It is worth noting, however, that some famous sightings are missing, such as reports of flying saucers over Washington DC in 1952. Last year, the CIA took credit for half of the UFO reports in the 1950s and 1960s and as sci-fi films gained popularity such as Invaders from Mars, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it’s possible aliens were higher in the public conscious than ever before. The CIA said that UFO sightings were directly correlated to them testing U2 spy planes at altitudes of 60,000 ft (18,288 metres) - a feat of engineering that was not possible before. Reports suggest that the CIA soon realised that UFO sightings lined up with the place and time the U-2 planes were flying, but that they purposefully chose not to let people know that what they were seeing were not aliens to keep the tests firmly under wraps. However, this does not explain the 1966 Westall Encounter in Australia, when some 200 students and teachers in Melbourne claim to have seen a UFO land in a suburban field, before taking off again. But once again, sceptics say the UFO was an experimental military aircraft. The map also shows a famous UFO sighting in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1986, when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 UFOs, which showed up on radar. The mysterious flying objects disappeared when fighter jets gave chase, leading some people to say the UFOs were technically-superior alien craft. However, a British space researcher called Geoffrey Perry claimed that the UFOs were actually pieces of debris thrown out of the Soviet space station, Salyut-7, which burned up in the atmosphere, Stylist reported. In Europe, the map shows many sightings over Belgium, between 1989 and 1990, which is known as the Belgium Wave. At that time, some 13,500 people claimed to have seen huge black triangles flying silently through the skies. While the incident was tracked by Nato radar and investigated by the country's military, nothing unusual was found and sceptics believe the sightings may have been of ordinary helicopters. From the mid-1990s onwards, the explosion of sightings intensify on the map, with large concentrations over the West Coast and the whole eastern half of the US, from Texas. The map shows the whole of Europe ablaze with circles indicating UFO sightings, as well as areas of western Africa, India, South East Asia and South America. Some believe that the increase in sightings over the past 20 years could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet, which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before (UFO map focused on Australia pictured) The map shows a famous UFO sighting in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1986, when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 UFOs, as well as numerous sightings in South Africa and other parts of the continent, which have been reported in recent years. UFO maps of South America (left) and Africa (right) are shown . The global nature of the sightings suggests this could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet, which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before. Mr Watson said: ‘With the coming of the internet it is easier for people to report UFO sightings and this is probably one reason for a rise in sightings. ‘We should also acknowledge that Chinese lanterns and the increased deployment of drones are responsible for greater amounts of sightings.’ In 2008, a guard at Yeni Kent Compound in Turkey claimed to have filmed UFOs and the footage is said by some to be among the most important UFO images. There is no explanation for the encounter, in a similar way to a sighting in Warden in South Africa, where a police officer said he saw an enormous oval-shaped, orange light in 2000. In 2007, eyewitnesses in Kolkata, India said they saw a fast-moving, glowing  object which was a cross between a sphere and a triangle. And in 2013, in Bracknell, Berkshire, two glowing 'flying saucers' were photographed hovering in the skies above a pub and new of 'visitors' quickly spread online. John Wickman, Chairman of the British UFO Association (Bufora) said: 'Technology is vastly progressing and a very large number of sightings no matter where they are in the world can be attributed to modern military craft that have been misidentified.' ‘Just because a UFO report is made does not mean that the object originates from anywhere other than the Earth,’ he cautioned. Mr Watson said: ‘On the other hand, the internet allows access to greater amounts of information and enables us to discuss reports from lots of different angles, from the extreme sceptical viewpoints to the most outlandish conspiracy rumours. ‘With or without the internet, ufologists tend to think that only five to 10 per cent of sightings are of anything exotic and worthy of further investigation.’","Map's based on UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source mapping software .

"St. Louis Blues forward Ryan Reaves proved on Sunday that hockey players truly are some of the toughest men in sports. After being checked face-first into the glass by Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook, Reaves went to the bench and pulled out his own tooth. Reaves calmly digs around his mouth until he grabs the loose tooth, pulls it out of his mouth and hands it to his trainer.

Reaves sat on the bench as he calmly pulled out the tooth. It eventually fell into his hand (pictured above) and he gave it to a team trainer . It is unknown as to what period the check occurred in or if Reaves returned to the ice, one tooth lighter.

"A new species of glass frog has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides. The creature, named Hyalinobatrachium dianae, was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call. While most of its body is a brilliant lime green, like all species of glass frogs, the skin on its underside is see-though, making its organs easily visible. A new species of glass frog has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides. Hyalinobatrachium dianae (pictured) was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call . The animal’s heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract are easily visible. Scientists were surprised to stumble across the frog, given that a through survey of the region was conducted late last century, and reported their find in the journal Zootaxa. The frog was named by Brian Kubicki who discovered it, after his mother Janet Diana Kubicki to thank her for supporting his interest in science, Costa Rica’s Tico Times reported. The animal’s heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract are easily visible (pictured) thanks to translucent skin on its under side. It's distinguishable from other glass frogs which have this strange characteristic, by its long toes and black and white eyes . The bodies of glass frogs are bright green on their backs, while their abdominal skin is translucent. This means that the animal's heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract are visible. The first glass frog was discovered in 1872. They are thought to have originated in South America before spreading into Central America. Glass frogs are generally small, ranging from an inch to three inches in length (2.5cm to 7.5cm). They may look similar to tree frogs, but their eyes face forward, instead of sideways. The frogs are mostly arboreal, meaning that they live in trees and can be found along rivers and streams during the breeding season. Lead author of the study, Dr Kubicki said: Its advertisement call is quite unique…It’s different than any other species that has been discovered.’ The study says the frog’s ‘advertisement call’ consists of ‘a single tonal long metallic whistle-like note with a duration of 0.40–0.55 s... and a dominant frequency of 3.35–3.44 kHz’. It’s likely the frog uses it to find a mate in the mountain forests. Dr Kubicki said that the amphibian sounds more like an insect than a frog, which may explain how experts missed it during their extensive survey. The frog also measures just one inch (2.5cm) long, making it relatively difficult to spot among the foliage in the west forests and rainforests of the Caribbean foothills of Costa Rica where it was discovered at elevations of between 1,312 ft to 2,624 ft (400–800 m). There are 149 known species of glass frogs in Central and South America, 14 of which can be found in Costa Rica. H. dianae stands out from the others because of its captivating black and white eyes - which look similar to Kermit the frog’s - as well as its long, thin feet. They have historically been mistaken for tree frogs, but there is a major difference – in that their eyes face forward, instead of sideways like a tree frog's. H. dianae stands out from other glass frogs because of its unusual black and white eyes (pictured left), which are similar to those of Kermit the Frog, of the Muppets (pictured right) in that they face forward . The frog was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica in the provinces ofHeredia and Limon (shaded in pale green) and has a distinctive call . Scientists have discovered an aphrodisiac for frogs and fish. Added to water, a supplement has been shown to boost reproduction in frogs, fish, mollusc and roundworms - and it could work for humans too, Phys.org reported. Experts from the University of Hertfordshire observed guppy fish at London Zoo. When the fish were given a peptide, or short protein, they produced four times as many offspring in six months as fish that had not nothing placed in their tanks. Similar tests were carried out on brown mentalla frogs at Paignton Zoo, leading the endangered amphibian from Madagascar to breed for the first time. Dr Keith Davies of the university, who is an expert on nematodes, or roundworms, said: 'The supplement brought reproductive activity forward and increased the number of offspring by about 80 per cent in the famous soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. 'What is suggested by our work is a biochemical mechanism of action that is conserved across the animal kingdom.' The scientists hope to extend their research so the aphrodisiac can be developed for mammals and humans.","Hyalinobatrachium dianae was found in the mountains of east Costa Rica .

"The 12-year-old daughter of the mailman who landed his gyrocopter on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol last week has said she was 'downright proud' of her dad. 'He's a patriot you know?' Kathy Hughes told ABC News. 'He did it for the country.' Her father, 61-year-old Doug Hughes, landed the aircraft on the West Lawn last Wednesday to protest campaign finance laws but was swiftly taken into custody. He is now under house arrest at their Ruskin, Florida home as he awaits a hearing to determine if he will go on trial for crossing a no-fly zone, a charge that could send him to prison for four years. On Monday, Hughes called his 80-mile journey to the Capitol 'a huge thrill' and shared footage of the flight from Virginia, across Washington D.C. and his safe landing on the West Lawn.

Journey: He also shared  footage (pictured) of his 80-mile flight from Virginia and across D.C. Speaking to Good Morning America on Monday morning, Hughes said he never feared he would be shot down, despite coming within feet of the guarded building. 'I'm a mailman, I was delivering the mail,' he said wryly. 'I don't think that the government is going to shoot a 61-year-old mailman in a flying bicycle who is not threatening anyone.' He added that he had made 'every effort to notify the administration' before his flight to let them know who he was and what he would be doing. Instead of worrying about being shot down, he was focused solely on landing safely, he said. 'This is different than any other landing I've made, and it had a very surreal nature to it,' he said. 'I didn't have a hand free to pinch myself to see if it was happening, but that’s what was happening.' Despite landing unscathed, he said that he believes the security in the city is 'ironclad' and that if anyone else tries to land on the West Lawn, they might not be so lucky. He pulled off the stunt to bring the public's attention to the 'the problem of corruption in Congress' and to spotlight his belief that campaign finance laws are too weak, he said. 'It's up to the American people to decide whether or not they're going to catch the ball that I threw,' he said. 'If they pick this up, it's in their power to fix the problem. Then it's worth it even if I lose my job or go to jail.' He is also calling for changes to Congress on his blog. By his side: Both Kathy and her mother Alena (right) have called Mr Hughes a 'patriot' for his flight . Hughes is on leave from his job and is under house arrest in Ruskin, Florida. He will attend a hearing in Washington D.C. in two weeks to determine whether his case will go to trial. If found guilty of the charges - violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft - he faces four years in prison and fines. Speaking to GMA, he added that he does not expect to be reunited with his gyrocopter, but if he does, he plans to melt it down into beer cans. Hughes reportedly planned his trip for more than two years before flying through restricted airspace and a no-fly zone last Wednesday. He was carrying 535 letters - one for each member of Congress. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson later admitted that the gyrocopter went undetected and under the radar as it flew 80 miles from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to the building - in just the latest embarrassment for Secret Service security around the Capitol and White House. After a series of interviews, the Secret Service decided not to prosecute Mr Hughes' Belarus-born wife Alena, who claims she was not aware of his plan.

"A 12-year-old girl was tied up, beaten and raped for by seven ISIS different fighters when she was kidnapped from her home in the Iraq region of Yazidi, a shocking new report has revealed. The suffering of Jalila - whose name has been changed - is just one of a number of harrowing accounts given by women who have escaped captured by the brutal Islamist organisation which is taking over swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq. The study undertaken by Human Rights Watch found fighters were kidnapping women and children as young as eight, forcing them to marry and convert to Islam and raping them repeatedly – sometimes picking their victims’ names out of a hand in a sick lottery. Scroll down for video . Yazidi women and girls have been separated from their families, forced to convert to Islam and repeatedly raped by ISIS fighters, the study from Human Rights Watch says. Their actions amount to war crimes. it adds . Yazidi children as young as eight have been abducted from their homes in northern Iraq, raped by ISIS fighters and forced into marriage. One child interviewed said she was 'owned' and raped by seven different men . Of those who managed to escape, many feel suicidal after their traumatic ordeal and need better medical and psychological support, says Human Rights Watch. Some tried to kill themselves while in captivity to avoid rape . Their terrifying campaign of systematic rape was tantamount to war crimes - and possibly crimes against humanity, the report adds. Jalila,who managed to escape her tormentors, told the charity she was taken with seven members of her family when Arab men stormed her village north of Sinjar in August 2014. After a few weeks she was taken to a house in Syria that housed other abducted young Yazidi women and girls, where the men would come and select us. She was selected by an ISIS fighter, who slapped her and dragged her from the house when she resisted him. The names of Yazidi women were selected from a lottery for men to rape, a survivor told the charity . ‘I told him not to touch me and begged him to let me go’, she said. ‘I was a young girl, and I asked him, ‘What do you want from me?’ He spent three days having sex with me.’ During her captivity seven ISIS fighters ‘owned’ Jalila, and four raped her on multiple occasions. Human Rights Watch has collected the accounts of 20 women and girls who escaped from ISIS, which they say shows a system of organised rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery and forced marriage – acts that constitute war crimes. A 12-year-old girl (not pictured) told investigators she was raped for three days by a brutal Islamist militant . Another victim told Human Rights Watch how she had tried to kill herself so that she wouldn't be raped again . Rape and other forms of sexual violence committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war. These women were part of a group of 216 Yazidis who were recently released by ISIS after being captured last year . The survivors' stories come as United Nations (UN) investigators found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq. The human rights office published a horrifying report in March describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists. It suggested they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide'. The report, based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors between June 2014 and February 2015, highlights brutal ISIS attacks on the Yazidis. The jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed, according to investigators. Younger boys were forced to become child soldiers and women and girls were abducted as the 'spoils of war'. Head of the investigation Suki Nagra said: 'These attacks were aimed at destroying the Yazidi as a group.' She added that ISIS was guilty of 'genocide' against the minority. Now they are urging that survivors get the medical and psychological treatment that they need to cope with the unimaginable trauma they suffered. Rashida told the charity she was told by her brother to commit suicide if she was unable to escape the ISIS fighters who had captured her. ‘Later that day they made a lottery of our names and started to choose women by drawing out the names', the 31-year-old said. ‘The man who selected me, Abu Ghufran, forced me to bathe but while I was in the bathroom I tried to kill myself. ‘I had found some poison in the house, and took it with me to the bathroom. I knew it was toxic because of its smell. ‘I distributed it to the rest of the girls and we each mixed some with water in the bathroom and drank it. None of us died but we all got sick.’ Another woman, identified as Dilara, said she was taken to a wedding hall in Syria where ISIS fighters told the group to forget their relatives and prepare to marry them and bear their children. From 9:30am in the morning, men would come to buy girls to rape them. She told Human Rights Watch: 'I saw in front of my eyes ISIS soldiers pulling hair, beating girls, and slamming the heads of anyone who resisted. 'They were like animals…. Once they took the girls out, they would rape them and bring them back to exchange for new girls. The girls’ ages ranged from eight to 30 years… only 20 girls remained in the end.' Rape and other forms of sexual violence, sexual slavery, cruel treatment, and other abuses committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war, the report by Human Rights Watch says – and better support is needed for children and women who survive such attacks. As well as a lack of provision for psycho-social treatment, there is a reluctance in the community to accept it, despite many women continuing to feel suicidal after their ordeal. 'Yazidi women and girls who escaped ISIS still face enormous challenges and continuing trauma from their experience,” Liesl Gerntholtz, the women's rights director at Human Rights Watch said. 'They need urgent help and support to recover their health and move on with their lives.'","Human Rights Watch report reveals suffering of Yazidi women and children .

"The mortgage market has reached a ‘watershed’ moment with the launch of the first five-year fixed rate below 2 per cent. The battle between lenders has intensified in recent months, plunging home loan rates to their lowest in history. But the mortgage wars will erupt again next week after HSBC announced a 1.99 per cent interest rate on a five-year fix. Experts said it was the cheapest ever deal of its kind and described the move as ‘astonishing’. New low: The mortgage market has reached a ‘watershed’ moment with the launch of the first five-year fixed rate below 2 per cent . The offer from one of the country’s biggest mortgage lenders – HSBC is consistently in the top five – launches on Monday and is expected to trigger a flood of rate cuts by other banks and building societies. Fifteen lenders had already cut rates across their ranges in the past week, but more are likely to follow now HSBC has set a new benchmark. Brokers said lenders appeared to be slashing rates ready for the ‘spring mortgage spree’ when many families move or remortgage. Mortgage broker Andrew Montlake, of Coreco, said: ‘The breaking of the 2 per cent barrier for a five-year fix is a watershed moment and one many thought would never be seen in the UK. ‘Other lenders will now look to compete, but there is only so low they can go before their profit margins start to become too squeezed. ‘The current crop of low fixed rates could help to spur more borrowers into action as they lock in before these rates disappear.’ HSBC already had one of the lowest five-year fixes on the market at 2.19 per cent, but decided to under-cut itself to try to steal more customers from its rivals. The only cheaper deal was offered by TSB at 2.09 per cent, but it was available only on loans over £200,000 and for those remortgaging, and carried a fee of £1,995. With the HSBC rate cut from 2.19 per cent to 1.99 per cent, a homeowner borrowing £200,000 over a 25-year term would save more than £1,100 during the five-year deal. The offer is available only to those with a deposit of at least 40 per cent, with a £1,499 fee. Other than the usual affordability criteria, there are no other restrictions. The battle between lenders has intensified in recent months, plunging home loan rates to their lowest in history . Mortgage broker David Hollingsworth, of London and Country, said: ‘This is an astonishing low rate for a five-year fixed rate and certainly moves the market on again after a recent lull. They are laying down a marker for other lenders.’ The mortgage war has erupted six years after the Bank of England slashed its base rate to a historic low of 0.5 per cent to try to boost economic growth during the financial crisis. Recent economic growth had prompted speculation that interest rates could rise this year. But, with the inflation rate at zero, analysts believe the rate is unlikely to rise until the middle of 2016. This has allowed lenders to offer even cheaper fixed-rate mortgages with more confidence. Charlotte Nelson, at Moneyfacts, said: ‘This 1.99 per cent deal is the first five-year fixed-rate mortgage to be launched below 2 per cent. ‘The competition to be the lowest in the mortgage market shows no signs of stopping and is great news for borrowers.’ The average rate on a five-year fixed rate on offer, across all deposits, is now 3.55 per cent, compared to 4.04 per cent a year ago. Five years ago, the average five-year fixed rate was 5.87 per cent. Increased competition from new banks such as TSB and Virgin has forced major banks and building societies to compete harder, according to experts. They said banks had a ‘high appetite’ to lend at the moment as the economy continues to recover, and were desperate to attract custom. But brokers warned that tougher lending criteria meant these cut-price deals were not available to everyone, including older borrowers and the self-employed. Experts warned that borrowers looking for a fixed-rate mortgage deal must consider the whole package rather than the headline interest rate, and factor in any fees, which can add significantly to the overall cost of the loan. Brokers said that the HSBC 1.99 per cent offer was likely to be on the market for at least a week, if not several, depending on the demand.","Battle between lenders has intensified recently, causing rates to plummet .

"Isis was removed from the official list of future Pacific hurricane names by the UN's World Meteorological Organization, a WMO spokeswoman announced on Friday. The WMO Hurricane Committee deemed the name inappropriate because of the eponymous militant group. As the name of an ancient goddess of Egypt, Isis had been on the WMO list of names for hurricanes in 2016. Isis was deemed inappropriate and removed from the hurricane list by the UN's World Meteorological Organization. As the name of an ancient goddess of Egypt, Isis had been on the WMO list of names for 2016 . The Hurricane Committee also backed Mexico's request to retire the name Odile because of the storm (above) ISIS is also used to describe the Islamic State militant group, whose forces have captured large swathes of Iraq and Syria. The group stands accused of committing brutal atrocities against civilians by UN war crimes investigators. Spokeswoman Clare Nullis said from Geneva: 'The Hurricane Committee removed the name Isis from the rotating list and agreed to replace it with Ivette.' 'Names are knocked off the list, which rotates every six years, if they are considered inappropriate if they caused too much damage and too much death.' She added that this was not the case with Isis. The WMO has rotating lists of storm names for various regions that run from A to Z alternating between male and female. The proposal by the WMO regional center was endorsed by the committee. The group, which is composed of experts from 27 member states and territories, was meeting in Costa Rica this week. ISIS stands accused of committing brutal atrocities against civilians by UN war crimes investigators . The Hurricane Committee also backed Mexico's request to retire the name Odile and decided on Odalys as its replacement to be used for the 2020 season. Odile hit the popular beach resorts of Baja California last September, stranding thousands of tourists, knocking out power and causing heavy flooding. 'Tropical cyclone activity during the 2014 eastern North Pacific hurricane season was well above normal,' according to the WMO. 'Most of the tropical cyclones formed from tropical waves which moved from the Caribbean Sea to the eastern North Pacific. 'Of the 20 tropical storms that formed, 14 became hurricanes, and eight reached major hurricane strength. 'The hurricane total is the second highest on record for the basin and the number of major hurricanes ties the record for the most. 'By comparison, the 1981-2010 averages are 15 tropical storms, eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes.'","Name of ancient goddess of Egypt was on WMO list for hurricanes in 2016 .

"It's constantly battling to protect us from terrorism and the host of other major threats in the modern world. So you might think MI5 would have more important things to worry about than running a competition for Blue Peter viewers to go to ‘spy school’. But that is exactly what has happened, after three youngsters won a competition to visit MI5’s London HQ. The children even got to attend a meeting with the security service’s director-general Andrew Parker. The winning contestants with Andrew Parker of MI5 (left). The group were allowed inside the service's HQ . The budding young Bonds (seen here played by Daniel Craig) were chosen from among 5,700 other hopefuls . Jamie, 13, Reuben, 13, and ten-year-old Finley were selected after a series of ‘difficult’ tests to show they are young spies in the making. Codenamed Project Petra, the initiative was the first time cameras were allowed to film inside the MI5 building. It comes at a time when the UK’s intelligence agencies are busier than ever before fighting threats from Al Qaeda, Islamic State and Russia. And their ability to track foreign and home-grown terrorists and monitor their communications has been severely damaged due to the intelligence leaks by ex-US spy Edward Snowden. Some 5,700 children applied to the competition, making it one of the most popular in Blue Peter’s history. The young candidates had to complete a series of challenges and impress a judging panel made up of children’s author Anthony Horowitz, TV presenter and journalist Sonali Shah and Professor Christopher Andrew, the Security Service’s official historian. The finalists had to solve a series of clues to work out the location of the 'spy school' in Manchester . The lucky trio with director general Andrew Parker (left) and Blue Peter presenter Barney Harwood (second left) In last week’s episode, eight finalists had to crack codes to establish the location of the ‘spy school’, which was set up in the offices of accountancy firm KPMG in Manchester. And yesterday, the candidates were whittled down to the final three in a series of tests, including being quizzed on what they remembered from a walk around Manchester city centre to test their observational skills. Their guided tour of the MI5 building, which took place last month, will be shown in the third and final episode next Thursday. Finley, from Surrey, said: ‘When I first entered MI5 it was way cooler than I thought it would be and I got to see loads of things that no-one else will ever get to see.’ Cameras were allowed to film inside MI5 as the boy's dreams came true when they went on a guided tour . Jamie, from Glasgow, added that it ‘felt really cool because we were making history’ and Reuben, from North Yorkshire, said: ‘Being there for the very first time cameras have been allowed inside MI5 was an awesome experience and I loved doing it.’ The Blue Peter stunt came as Britain’s intelligence agencies launched a fresh drive to recruit more gay, ethnic and disabled spies. MI5, MI6 and GCHQ have teamed up with gay rights charity Stonewall and other equal opportunities groups in a bid to attract employees from different backgrounds. An advert for the initiative, which was launched last year, said: ‘Today’s spies come from every background modern Britain has on offer, a cultural and linguistic breadth that enables them to operate against every threat the UK faces. ‘Diversity is not a “nice to have”, it is essential for them to succeed.’ The competition's final hopefuls in Manchester searching for 'spy school' before the three winners emerged . Jamie, Finley and Rueben turned out to be the best budding spies, coming out on top in Blue Peter's challenge . In the first episode, broadcast last week, the children had to break a series of codes to find the location of ‘spy school’. Can you crack the codes? Left to right: Jamie, Rueben and Finley were the winners of a chance to have a go at being a real James Bond . Jamie, 13, from Glasgow . Jamie is a self-confessed gadget geek and would love to design gizmos for the spy agency. He has already won an engineering award for designing a special pair of gloves for astronauts to wear in space. His favourite subjects at school include maths, physics and chemistry. Jamie enjoys long distance running and jokes it could help him escape in tricky situations. Why does he want to be a spy? ‘The danger really,’ he said. ‘You don’t know what’s going to happen. You could go out and anything could go wrong.’ Reuben, 13, from North Yorkshire . Reuben describes himself as a ‘polymath’, someone who is a good all-rounder and he was praised by the judges for excelling in all areas. He loves playing rugby and says he is an adrenaline junkie who is not afraid to throw himself into dangerous situations. He is also very logical and enjoys solving riddles and cracking codes. Ruben said: ‘What is quite useful it that I am kind of a polymath so I’m quite good at everything: physical stuff, mental stuff, languages, so it’s not just having one speciality.’ Finley, 10, from Surrey . Still at primary school, Finley was one of the youngest candidates. He impressed by writing his application to be on the show in code – you had to read it in a mirror. Finley is a keen reader and a fan of the Secret Seven detective classics by Enid Blyton and James Bond. His favourite subjects are geography and sport. He says playing football has helped him be aware of what is happening around him, while swimming gives him stamina.","Jamie, 13, Reuben, 13 and Finley, 10, are on their way to becoming spooks .

"It’s one of the most boring kitchen jobs; prepping a mound of potatoes for mash. But this ingenious method eliminates all dinner preparation stress when you've got a pile to peel. YouTuber Dave Hax’s clever spud solution does away with peelers, and instead lets boiling water do all the hard work. The innovative Mr Hax, whose YouTube channel demonstrates various life hacks, devised the simple kitchen method which results in perfectly peeled potatoes. Start by taking a sharp knife and running the blade carefully around the middle of the potato, he advises in the video. Do this to all the potatoes you’re planning to use, running the blade just through the skin without letting it cut through the potato flesh. 'Try to get the line to meet up on the other side,' he says. Once all your spuds have been prepared put them in a pan on the hob and add some boiling water from a kettle. YouTuber Dave Hax’s ingenious new kitcken trick lets cooks peel potatoes without using a peeler. The process starts by running the blade of a sharp knife carefully around the middle of the potato, without letting it cut through, making sure to get the line to meet on the other side . Leave the potatoes to cook. When they’re ready, drain the water into another pan, leaving the potatoes in the first one. 'Run some cold water over your potatoes until they are cool enough to pick up.' he instructs. The cut mark should now be visible all the way around the potato. The next step is to simply use your fingers to gently pull the skin off the cooked potato. Turn the spud around and do the same on the other side… and hey presto, you’ll have a perfectly peeled potato. Chefs then need to boil the spuds (left) for as long as needed and let them drain before running under cold water (right) The swift method of skin removal means the potatoes remain warm under their skins. 'But if you want them warmer, simply pop them back into the water they were boiled it for a quick reheat,' he advises. The video, which was uploaded only five days ago on 10 April has already received more than 1.5m views. Finally skin the spud using fingers to pinch the skin off the potato - hey presto, perfectly peeled potatoes!","Dave Hax's YouTube tutorial advises to score the skin before boiling .

"Trials: Researchers at Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem found pregnancy helps regenerate tissue . Expectant mums really do bloom - for being pregnant has a 'rejuvenating effect' on women, according to new scientific research. And for older women it could help them feel young again, almost literally, as pregnancy helps regenerate tissue and slow down the ageing process, it added. Appearing to bloom is not just a cosmetic side effect of carrying a child, said medical experts for the journal Fertility and Sterility but an actual physical process. Researchers studied the effects of liver transplants on pregnant and non-pregnant mice using a high-tech MRI scanner at the Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem. It found in young, non-pregnant mice, 82 per cent of the liver had regenerated after two days and in older, non-pregnant mice, only 46 per cent had regenerated in that time. But in older, pregnant mice around 96 per cent had regenerated after two days, better than the non-pregnant rodents both young and old, they reported. They also found that pregnancy protected the rodents from tissue damage around the heart, which is also an irreversible part of the human ageing process, said the study. Pregnancy is a unique condition for the human body, said the researchers, and as a result it has to cope with two people's systems at the same time. For the older of the two bodies, it is as if it has been injected with a youth serum from the baby it is carrying, hence the rejuvenating process affecting the mother, it suggests. The report added: 'As we age, it is more difficult for our tissue to regenerate itself. 'Because pregnancy is a unique biological model of a partially shared blood system, we have speculated that pregnancy would have a rejuvenating effect on the mother.' Tal Falick Michaeli, Rubin Chair in Medical Science at Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, who led the review, has also done research that suggests that pregnancy can restore the mother's muscles' ability to regenerate. The research found, in the mice used to test their hypothesis, that the positive effect of pregnancy was 'transient' and lasted for about two months after delivery. Serum: Say tests carried out on pregnant mice suggested they 'got youth serum injection' from babies . Previous research has also found that old mice given a transfusion of younger mice's blood performed better in a memory task than those that aged naturally. A study by Stanford University found that changes in the make-up of people's blood as they age may damage connections in the brain and so cause memory deterioration and the decline of other brain functions. This could be tackled by filtering more youthful blood into the older body, which would rejuvenate old tissue and keep nerve cells in better working order, according to the research.","Researchers in Jerusalem found pregnancy helps regenerate tissue .

"Endangered bears kept in cramped metal cages on bile farms in Vietnam are dying at a rate of two a day, a MailOnline investigation has found. More than 700 Asiatic black bears, over a third of those held in captivity in Vietnam, have allegedly been butchered in the past year alone – with up to four bears inexplicably killed in one day on some farms. Farmers claim the extinction-threatened bears are dying from disease and old age – but sources say owners are killing them to 'extract the last ounce of blood' and selling their body parts to make Chinese medicine. Barbaric: A desperate moon bear with a left paw chopped off reaches out for help from its tiny rusty metal cage at the Cau Trang bear farm in Halong Bay, Vietnam . Metal coffins: The inhumane cages where tortured bears are forced to live in as they await death. The Vietnamese government faces a race against time to get them to a sanctuary in Tam Dao national park 120 miles away run by British charity Animals Asia . Confronted: The owner's son hides his face from MailOnline man at the Cau Trang bear farm in Halong Bay. He angrily told our man: 'You have no right to interfere in our business … If you take my picture I will sue you' The paws, meat and gall bladders of the 'moon bears' – named after the yellow moon-shaped crescents on their chests – are sold for the equivalent of £625 a bear and smuggled to China for use in traditional medicine, sources familiar with farm operations told MailOnline. Insiders say the bears are being massacred as the Vietnamese government attempts to crackdown on illegal bear bile farms. Today, only 1,245 of the animals remain in captivity in bear farms across the country compared to nearly 2,000 in 2014 and more than 4,000 in 2005. Officials want all the remaining animals held in captivity in Vietnam to be sent to sanctuaries where they can see out their days free from torment. But the owners won't see a penny in compensation if the bears are taken away and are killing them to sell their body parts before they can be removed, it is claimed. In Halong Bay, an idyllic seaside resort in northern Vietnam popular with Brit holidaymakers, a staggering 30 out of 49 captive bears held there have died in the last three months. The government has ordered the remaining 19 bears at Halong Bay to be taken to Tam Dao national park 120 miles away, a sanctuary run by British charity Animals Asia by September. Officials are under growing international pressure to rescue the animals. A raft of celebrities such as Judi Dench, Stephen Fry and Ricky Gervais have signed a petition calling on Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to save the remaining bears in Halong Bay. Skyfall star Dame Judi, 80, blasted: 'These moon bears have been used and abused by the cruel bile industry and are now being left to die. 'We are asking the Vietnam government to step in and enable Animals Asia to rescue these beautiful animals. They deserve their sanctuary.' In one  farm in Halong Bay, Cau Trang, 22 bears from just 27 in total have died since November. Four bears were reported to have died there in one day – raising suspicions the animals were killed to order. MailOnline dodged security guards to get into Cau Trang and witness the disgusting conditions the remaining five bears are forced to live. Packed into rusty metal cages, one of the bears lay motionless on the ground, seemingly giving up hope of ever being rescued. Another rocked manically from side to side and a third had a gushing head wound. A patch of dry ground 20 metres away from the cages was coated with clumps of bear fur. Two teenage guards with a dog confronted our man before phoning owner Nguyen Trong Bo's son, Hung. When he arrived at the farm, Hung was asked where the other 22 bears had gone. He replied with a sarcastic smirk – claiming: 'They have been released into the forest.' He refused to answer further questions and ordered us to leave, shouting angrily: 'You have no right to interfere in our business … If you take my picture I will sue you.' Butchered: Vietnam's moon bears are killed are sold for £625 each and smuggled to China for use in traditional medicine. Their paws, meat and gall bladders are used by men to increase sexual potency and cure hangovers . Death sentence: bears are being slaughtered and sold for their body parts to the lucrative trade in Chinese medicine . Cruel: 30 bears have died at illegal bile farms in the tourist resort of Halong Bay in the past three months. When contacted, one farm owner claimed his had all died from disease and old age. Bear bile farming was banned in Vietnam in 1992 . Bear owners are killing the animals to 'extract the last ounce of blood' out of them before officials force farmers to hand over the animals to wildlife sanctuaries. Greedy owners are demanding compensation from the government . Earlier his father Nguyen responded to a Vietnamese journalist, and claimed the four bears which died in one day at his farm were all aged over 20 and had been 'eating less' in recent months. Because of their endangered status – less than 100 moon bears remain in the wild in Vietnam – the death of any bear should be reported to local officials who are meant to oversee its post mortem and burial. But the sources told MailOnline official procedures are routinely bypassed and dead bears disposed of quickly by farmers on the pretext that the animals might have died from infectious diseases. Requests by animal welfare groups to inspect the bears are rebuffed and inquiries about burial sites brushed aside with explanations that bears might have been dug up by thieves, the sources said. The Prime Minister's office has instructed local officials and government departments to arrange the transfer of Halong Bay's surviving bears to the Animals Asia sanctuary. However, aid workers from Animals Asia say the process is being held up by greedy farmers' demands for compensation, and warns the remaining bears could be dead soon unless action is taken quickly. The charity's Vietnam director Tuan Bendixsen told MailOnline: 'We have received unconfirmed reports that bears are being deliberately killed and their body parts sold on the black market as bear farmers look for ways to recoup as much money as they can from the bears. 'Farmers are supposed to be caretakers of these animals. Selling a bear dead or alive is a criminal offence, as is failing to provide a proper level of care.' The charity founder, British nurse Jill Robinson MBE, who has saved countless bears from the cramped cages where they are kept, added: 'We are sickened to think that bears at death's door are possibly being slaughtered and exploited in such a mercenary way. As for the bears who have already died, who conducted post mortems? Who has disposed of the bodies and where are they? 'We, and thousands of supporters across the world, are heartbroken and frustrated that these slowly dying bears are not given the dignity of rescue and where necessary peaceful euthanasia after all they've suffered on the farms. 'For pity's sake, we implore the Prime Minister to release them from their pain, confiscate them in to our sanctuary, and allow our team to give them the love and care they deserve.' MailOnline man Simon Parry at the gates of Cau Trang bear farm in Halong Bay where 22 bears have died since November. Four died at the farm in a single day. Only five bears are left at Cau Trang . Bear bile farming involves crude catheters jabbed repeatedly into the caged bear's abdomen and gall bladder to drain out the fluid. This painful process takes place twice a day. The digestive juice contains Urso Deoxycholicacid (UCDA), a prized ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, an industry which is worth £1.5 billion. It can aid the treatment of liver and heart disease and reduce swelling when mixed with alcohol and rubbed on bruises. Men in China have also used bear bile as an aphrodisiac or to help cure hangovers. More recently it has been added to non-medicinal products such as wine and shampoo in China, the WSPA claims. Bile farming has been banned in Vietnam since 1992. In 2005 4,239 captive bears were micro chipped and farmers were told they could keep them but could not extract bile from them. But the cruel and illegal practice remains widespread. Until recently Korean, Japanese and Taiwanese tourists regularly visited bear farms in Halong Bay where they would buy bile and insist on watching it being extracted from bears to ensure it was genuine and fresh.

"Many Californians are taking extreme measures to conserve water in the face of the state's historic drought. Water-conscious residents have turned to techniques that utilize so-called 'gray water' to help them meet the unprecedented new water-use restrictions imposed by Governor Jerry Brown last week. Those techniques may appear weird to some - like the toilet that doubles as a sink and used washing machine water used to water fruit trees - but these Californians maintain it's the inevitable future of water conservation. Extreme water saver: Robin Weld of Sacramento has installed a hybrid sink-toilet in response to the unprecedented new water-use restrictions imposed by Governor Jerry Brown in the face of the state's historic drought. Clean water comes in through the faucet, is used to wash hands and then flows into the toilet tank to be used to flush . Robin Weld, who lives in parched Sacramento, recently took the step of converting her home's toilet into a toilet-sink. For $100, Weld purchased the sink positive, she told CBS Sacramento. It replaces the tradition lid to her toilet tank with a small hand sink. 'We're washing our hands and then reusing that water,' Weld said. Clean city water comes in through the faucet and then fills the tank instead of simply going to waste. On the next flush, the used hand sink water comes down into the bowl. 'The average person uses the bathroom what at least five times a day so that's five times a day, so that adds up,' she said. And just next door to Weld, her neighbor Chris Brown is using the left over water from his showers, laundry and other tasks to irrigate his yard. First, the 'gray water' goes through a filtration system that Brown had installed as the drought - now in its fifth year - continued to worsen. Gray water: Weld's neighbor Chris Brown collects all the soapy used water from this home's washing machine's, showers and sinks and uses it to irrigate trees and plants in his yard . A/C condensation: South of Weld and Brown, in the affluent LA neighborhood of Brentwood, Scott Mathers, the owner of Hey! Tanks LA, has installed one of his company's 10,000-gallon rainwater tanks under his home as well as a smaller tank to collect gray water. One place he gets water is from the condensate from his home a/c units . 'Every drop of water flows down to this pipe, runs underground now, down to the front yard, and then it's spread,' Brown explained to CBS Sacramento. To the south, a resident of Los Angeles' affluent Brentwood neighborhood is going to even bigger extremes to conserve precious moisture. Scott Mathers, the owner of Hey! Tanks LA, tells CBSLA he's installed one of his company's 10,000-gallon rainwater tanks under his home as well as a smaller tank to collect gray water. One of the sources of the gray water: the condensation from his admittedly large home's air conditioning units. Mathers uses his gray water to, among other things, feed his horses. 'There are so many opportunities to harvest your water on your site,' he says. While they may appear to verge on the fanatical now, these conservationists believe what they are doing is the new normal for the Golden State. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, California’s 2014 Water Year was the third driest in 119 years and the warmest on record, so perpetual wildfire season also appears to be the new normal. Gray water systems like Aqua2use filter a home's soapy water in order to make it usable for plants and lawns . And there’s little relief on the horizon: The National Weather Service’s seasonal drought outlook predicts developing, persisting or intensifying drought conditions for most of the American West through at least the end of June. The Sierra Nevada snowpack is at 5 percent of normal, the lowest since record-keeping began in 1950. With the wet season over and with no major rainfall in the forecast, parched conditions will continue. The Sierra snowpack is a key element of California's water supply. About one-third of the state's water comes from snowpack that melts in the spring and summer, recharging groundwater and replenishing reservoirs. But with hardly any snow recorded during the last survey of the year, there will be little runoff to refill half-empty reservoirs. Many Southern California cities get their drinking water from the Colorado River basin, which supplies water to about 40 million people and 4 million acres of farmland in seven states. Brown's order called for investment in new water technologies and the streamlining of water projects such as desalination plants that turn ocean water into drinking water. Such facilities, however, are expensive to build. Unprecendented: Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday ordered sweeping and unprecedented measures to save water in California . No snow: Surveyors on Wednesday found the lowest snow level in the Sierra Nevada snowpack in 65 years of record-keeping, marking a fourth consecutive year of vanishing snow that California depends on to melt into rivers and replenish reservoirs .","California is experiencing one of its most extreme droughts in modern history, forcing concerned residents to react with extreme measures .
Conservation techniques include utilizing so-called 'gray water'--soapy water used once for cleaning and by appliances--for a second use .
Those uses may include irrigation, flushing a toilet or even feeding livestock ."
"Emma Hannigan had her breasts and ovaries removed in 2006 to reduce her risk of cancer after she was diagnosed with the faulty BrCa1 gene . A mother-of-two has battled cancer nine times in the last seven years, despite having her breasts and ovaries removed to try and prevent the disease. Emma Hannigan was told in 2005 that she carried the faulty BRCA1 gene, which increases a woman's chance of getting breast cancer by 85 per cent, and ovarian cancer by 50 per cent. She opted to have a double mastectomy and oophorectomy the following year, to reduce her risk. But despite the drastic surgery, the 42-year-old received the diagnosis she had been dreading - she had breast cancer. Since that point, Mrs Hannigan has battled the disease a staggering nine times, including four bouts in the space of a year. She is now undergoing chemotherapy every three weeks as specialists try to keep the disease at bay. Mrs Hannigan, an author from Bray, near Dublin, said despite it failing to prevent cancer, she does not regret having preventative surgery. The Breast Cancer Campaign estimates preventative mastectomy is thought to reduce breast cancer risk in carriers of the BRCA gene, by 90 per cent. The odds reduce a woman's risk to lower than that of the average for women who do not carry the mutated gene. 'I didn't look at it like I was losing my ovaries or breasts,' Mrs Hannigan said. 'I looked at it like I was gaining my life. 'It wasn't a difficult decision. It was a no-brainer - I wanted to live.' But at the age of 33, Mrs Hannigan was devastated when she was told, just a year after having surgery, that she had cancer. 'I was tested because there was a family history of breast and ovarian cancer in my family,' she said. 'My aunt Helen died of breast cancer when she was 42. My other aunts, Ruth and Cathy, survived breast cancer in their 30s and 40s. My great aunt, Anneliese, died from ovarian cancer. 'When gene testing came in my family were invited to have tests. My mother, Cathy and Ruth were all diagnosed with the faulty gene. 'So I was tested and I was diagnosed too. Then I made the decision to reduce my risk of cancer and have surgery. 'It was not difficult. I had seen Helen die. 'I had two young children. I only had to look at them and know that I had made the right choice.' Following the mastectomy, her breast tissue was sent away for testing. The results showed early signs of cancer. But in 2007, the mother-of-two, from Bray near Dublin, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent treatment, including radiation, pictured, and within a few months doctors told her she was in remission . Since 2007, Mrs Hannigan, an author, has battled the disease nine times, including facing four bouts in one year. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy as specialists try to keep the disease at bay . But doctors said they were pre-cancerous cells, and she was clear of the disease at the time. In June 2007, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. 'In January 2007 I had muscle pains and a rash,' the former beautician said. 'My arms and legs started seizing and my face, head, arms and upper torso became covered in a burning itchy rash. Women with a significant family history of breast cancer may have an increased risk of getting the disease. A significant family history is defined by: . Women who inherit the faulty, or mutated, BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime. Genetic tests are available to women who are likely to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, or faults in two other genes called TP53 and PTEN. BRCA gene faults are more common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, about 2.3 per cent of Ashkenazi Jewish women have a BRCA gene mutation. Source: Breast Cancer Campaign . 'Between February and April I was in and out of hospital. 'In June I was diagnosed with cancer for the first time and also dermatomyositis, an autoimmune disease. 'I had IV chemotherapy used to treat both conditions, along with steroids to stop the dermatomyositis.' After a few months of treatment, doctors told the mother-of-two she was in remission. 'I thought it was over,' she said. 'I thought I had done my time and that was it. 'But cancer doesn't have a social conscious. It came back.' The disease returned again in March 2008 and October 2009. Both times she was treated with chemotherapy and went into remission with scans and blood tests coming back clear. Then in 2010, Mrs Hannigan was diagnosed with cancer four times and was treated with a mixture of chemotherapy and radiation. Each time she went into remission. But the cancer returned in 2011 and she received six months of chemotherapy. Again she went into remission. But again, it returned in 2013. 'This was the worst,' she said. 'I got a tumour in my skull and needed 50 bouts of radiation. 'I couldn't move my head. It was awful.' Mrs Hannigan said she wrote to see her through it the long hours of radiation. She has had a successful career as an author writing such books as Driving Home for Christmas and The Secrets We Share. 'Currently the cancer is gone – but I'm having chemo every three weeks as a precaution,' she said. 'Cancer doesn't get any less scary. 'The words, ""it is breast cancer"" are never easy to hear. 'All the cancer is classed as breast cancer as this was the primary source – the place where it first started. 'Each time I was diagnosed it was in my lymph nodes in the area around my neck, shoulder, underarm and or the back of my head. Mrs Hannigan said: 'Cancer doesn't get any less scary. 'The words, ""it is breast cancer"" are never easy to hear.' She said she is no better than anyone else at beating cancer, rather treatments have improved . 'Each time I found the cancer myself in the form of lumps just under the skin. I go to the doctor and am treated. 'Then I have scans and blood tests and it is clear. I am in remission. 'My husband, Cian, 41, and I crack open the champagne. 'But the cancer comes back.' She said she was no better at beating cancer than other people, rather treatments have improved. 'And I should know,' she laughed. 'Sometimes I wonder, ""why I have had it nine times when some people get it once?"" 'There's no reason.' Her son, Sacha, 15, and daughter, Kim, 13, will be offered the opportunity for testing when they are 18. 'But it's their choice,' she said. 'Whatever happens I will be there for them.' Mrs Hannigan has teamed up TanOrganic, the world's first eco-certified self-tanning brand, to raise money for cancer research. From every bottle sold in Waitrose, TanOrganic will donate 35p to cancer research charities.","Emma Hannigan was diagnosed with the faulty BRCA1 gene in 2005 .

"A woman who already has four children is set to become a mother of seven after falling pregnant with triplets. Nadine Crooks, 33, who lives in Smethwick, West Midlands, was stunned to discover she was expecting again as doctors told her she was infertile after she had her fourth child. She stopped taking contraceptives after learning she had polycystic ovary syndrome following the birth of her son Joshua 18 months ago. Set to become seven siblings: Nadine Crooks who is expecting triplets pictured with her four children, from left, Trae (13), Roxanne (18), Zion (9) and Joshua (1) The 33-year-old was stunned to fall pregnant again after being told she was infertile . Doctors said she would never be able to conceive naturally again after cysts were found on both her swollen ovaries. She stopped taking the Pill and was stunned when she fell pregnant for a fifth time last November. She said: 'I was shocked when I found out I was pregnant. When they told me I was going to have three, I couldn't believe it at all. 'They had told me I had polycystic ovaries shortly after Joshua was born. 'I decided to stop taking contraceptives and thought that was that. I was content with my four children so the idea of almost doubling my family has taken some getting used to.' Nadine was told polycystic ovary syndrome would prevent her becoming pregnant again following the birth of her fourth child, Joshua, pictured . Nadine has been told she is now expecting two boys and a girl with her 35-year-old partner, who did not want to be named. The triplets will be siblings to Roxanne, 18, Trae, 13, and Zion, nine, and Joshua, 18 months. The mother, who was born in Jamaica, said: 'I thought I was finished with babies. It is incredible.' She found out she was expecting triplets, who are due in July, at her 12-week scan at Birmingham Women's Hospital. 'I'm thrilled about it now but at the time I thought it must be some kind of joke. I knew I was pregnant though because I obviously know the signs by now,' Nadine said. 'I have no history of twins or triplets in my family and neither does my partner but we feel blessed to be having more children.' Nadine with her four children said they are all amazed that she's set to have three more . Her unplanned pregnancy meant she had to give up a college course in hairdressing so she can remain a full-time mother. 'I had planned to go to college but then I found I was pregnant. I wanted to further my career. I had been a hairdresser for some time but wanted to take the hairdressing course at college. 'So it has had an effect on my career. I really wanted to carry on working but had to stop,' she explained. The mother-of-four admits her whole family were amazed when she announced she would be adding another three to her brood. The expectant mother had been due to start a course in hairdressing but her career plans are now on hold . Nadine's scans, pictured left and right, have revealed she is expecting two boys and a girl due in July . She said: 'My family were shocked but I am only coming to terms with it now myself. My mum was not very happy. She thought four children was enough. 'When their father found out, he put his head in hands. He was quite shocked. 'I used to watch these programmes on TV about people with triplets and quadruplets and think I couldn't cope with that but I've got lots of family to help me when they arrive.' Nadine's pregnancy has also baffled doctors. She said: 'After the babies are born they are going to have a look to see what is going on. They will do some tests. I don't have a clue what has happened. I just don't know.'","Nadine Crooks, 33, has four children aged 18 years to 18 months .

"A Pennsylvania high school is attracting national media attention for all the wrong reasons after a group of students organized a so-called Anti-Gay Day protest, with future events scheduled. The organizers of the homophobic protest at McGuffey High School in Washington County encouraged anyone who shared their bigoted stance to show support by wearing a flannel shirt to school and writing 'Anti-Gay' on their hands. The event was held last Thursday and students report that openly gay pupils also had Bible verses pined to their lockers and were physically bullied by the so-called protesters. Scroll down for video . A number of the anti-gay protesters proudly shared photos of them wearing flannel shirts on social media platforms such as Instagram . Pupils also wrote 'Anti-Gay' on the hands along with a cross as part of their protests apparantly a reaction to a Day Of Silence events for bullied LBGT students the previous day . 'It hurts me to see how rude and cruel, and some of these people were my friends before this started,' Zoe Johnson told WPXI. She was one of a number of pupils who the previous day had observed the nationally recognized Day Of Silence, an event aimed at drawing attention to gay and lesbian bullying and harassment in schools. As part of their protest, Johnson and the other dozen members of the school's Gay-Straight Alliance had worn black, painted rainbows on their faces, and remained silent for much of the day. Thursday's Anti-Gay Day protest is understood to have been a reaction to the previous day's event. It is estimated that somewhere between 50 and 100 students took part in the Anti-Gay event and many openly shared photos on social media of them dressed in their flannel shirts. 'They had a very silent, respectful day of action, and then they came to school on Thursday to an organized backlash,' Kathy Cameron, chair of the board of directors of the Washington County Gay Straight Alliance, told BuzzFeed. The organizers of the school's anti-gay movement have promised further clothing-related protests this week . 'The instigators, the bullies, seemed to be very proud of their efforts and posted many smiling pictures online.' It is believed the students chose the shirts because they are a common item of clothing found in most wardrobes. The organizers of the anti-gay movement have promised further clothing-related protests this week including wearing orange. Students have also reported seeing a 'lynch list' circulating the school of LBGT students who participated in the Day Of Silence event. Concerned students and parents have called on school authorities to act and Dr. Erica Kolat, superintendent of McGuffey School District, has released a statement. 'Yesterday afternoon, April 16, 2015, allegations of harassment were brought to the attention of our administration. McGuffey School District, along with school police officers, continue to investigate all allegations,' she said. 'We will follow our Student Code of Conduct, and file legal citations, as warranted. We resolve to ensure that all children can grow and learn in a safe, supportive environment free from discrimination.'

'We were so excited to meet him. We all had butterflies and a few of the girls had the shakes.' Ms Knight had planned on being at Sheeran's concert in Auckland having bought tickets back in October, but just two weeks later she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. The teenager had to endure countless chemotherapy treatments and a bone marrow transplant, which meant she was forced to give up her tickets. With the help of her friends, Ms Knight launched a social media campaign to catch Sheeran's attention and beg him to visit her in hospital. Ed Sheeran crashed Jess Knight's hospital birthday party and happily posed for selfies with her friends and family . The British singer visited Jess Knight in Auckland Hospital after she was forced to give up her concert tickets due to her cancer treatment . Ms Knight's friend, Anna Strong, set up the Ed Visit Jess Facebook page last month, while family and friends spruiked the hashtag #KiaOraEdPlsVisitJess to get Sheeran to visit. It was a long shot that eventually paid off. Sheeran ended up crashing Ms Knight's birthday party in hospital in between shows over the weekend. 'When I was told he was coming we all felt a bit shell-shocked. It was something we'd hoped would happen but it was such a long shot,' Ms Knight said.

"It may look like CGI in the trailer, but the droid that will join R2-D2 in the forthcoming Star Wars film - The Force Awakens - is very much real. The robot, named BB-8, took to the stage at Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California, where it literally ran rings around the retro droid on its spherical body. JJ Abrams, the film’s director, confirmed that a real robot was used during filming, but did not reveal how it works. Scroll down for video . The robot, called BB-8 (left) stars in the eagerly anticipated film Star Wars: The Force Awakens and took to the stage at Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California, where it literally ran rings around retro droid R2-D2 (pictured right) It’s a question that’s got Twitter talking, with a user named Jock tweeting: BB8? BBGREAT more like and Jimmy Wong in LA saying: ‘HOW DOES BB-8 WORK. It's so coooool.’ Joshua Harris, a teenager from Oxford said: ‘#BB8 is one of the few things in life that makes me want to understand engineering, while Video editor Ron Dot Org tweeted: ‘This is the part of the #StarWars event today that really blew my mind. #BB8 is not cgi. AT ALL’. BB-8’s body is a spherical ball that allows it to move in any direction, but it also has a completely free-moving head that doesn’t fall off, leaving applauding spectators wondering how it works. Speaking about filming the movie, JJ Abrams said: 'There were a lot of discussions about how having a CGI BB-8 could be so much easier for shooting. JJ Abrams, the film’s director, confirmed that a real robot was used during filming, instead of CGI, but did not reveal how the robot worked. Here, BB-8 the rolling droid BB-8 is spotted inside the Millennium Falcon, peeking around a corner . From today, Star Wars fans will be able to tweet using new emojis exclusive to the social network. Three emojiis have been introduced showing C3PO, a Storm trooper and a new droid. They have been rolled out in anticipation of the release of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. To tweet a Star Wars emoji, users must include hastags: #C3PO, #STORMTROOPER or #BB8 which will be transformed into little cartoons. ‘But we talked originally about it would be better for the film, for the actors, for the sets and the look of it if it were performed.’ He confirmed that BB-8 was ‘built and puppeteered’ in the film, but no strings were visible when the beeping, chirping droid rolled on stage, leading experts to speculate that it must be controlled by at least one remote control. The robot’s body is likely to be a large robotic ball, like a big version of the Sphero, Mashable’s Andrew Tarantola speculated. The toy by Orbotix is controlled by a smartphone app using a Bluetooth connection and allows users to make it go in any direction – much like the new droid.

Professor Will Stewart, a Fellow of The Institution of Engineering and Technology in London, told MailOnline that the walking globe is easy to achieve – ‘we could build one if we had the budget’. ‘It’s related to the default egg-race-style self-propelled double wheel device or the walk-in-balloon which anyone can try,’ he said, referring to a zorb, which humans walk inside and push against the side to move along. But the real mystery is how the robot’s head can move independently but stay on top of the free-rolling ball. It’s possible that magnets are involved to ‘stick’ the droid’s head to its body, but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it’s head stayed on top of the body – and the stage performance seemed effortlessness. It could be that the droid’s head is a separate robot with its own set of remote controls, enabling it to ‘look’ around. It's currently a mystery as to how BB-8 moves, but its white and orange case may hide a larger mechanism like that found in Sphero, which allows it to move quickly in any direction. The real question is how its head stays on . BB-8’s body is a spherical ball that allows it to move in any direction, but it also has a completely free-moving head that doesn’t fall off, leaving applauding spectators wondering how it works. This image shows the robot on the set of the film, which will be released in the UK in December . It may be able to stay upright easily by depending on a gyroscope that tells it which way is up and use an accelerometer to monitor motion, much like many smartphone games. Magnets may still be used to keep the head in contact with the body. Professor Stewart said: ‘The floating ‘head’ is probably on rollers magnetically bound through the plastic ball to the ""driving"" robot inside.’ He explained that rare earth magnets are very strong and light and the robot’s ‘movements are consistent with this, such as a tendency to move in the direction of travel.’ ‘The inside and head could be wirelessly linked but given that this robot is radio controlled rather than autonomous…I suspect that head and body are just independently radio controlled.’ It’s possible that magnets are involved to ‘stick’ the droid’s head to its body (pictured), but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it’s head stayed on top of the body – and the stage performance seemed effortlessness .

Sphero is the world's first robotic toy ball that's controlled by a smartphone app. It's been suggested that BB-8 may use similar technology in its body. The Sphero toy can be programmed to weave in between objects, follow augmented reality race tracks and even keep a pet entertained. The 2.8-inch (73mm) ball travels up to 5mph (0.6 km/h), is fully waterproof and costs $99.99 in the U.S, and £99.99 in the UK. Sphero (pictured) is the world's first robotic toy ball that's controlled by a smartphone app . The gadget weighs 178g (0.4lbs) and has a gyroscope and accelerometer inside that connect to a tablet or smartphone via Bluetooth, as well as two rubber wheels. A counterweight gets the ball rolling on demand and sensors allow users to control the direction and speed of the ball. The wheels inside work like a hamster running inside a ball and never leave Sphero's surface, so it can turn corners at high speed. There are up to 30 games available via apps including driving, sports and arcade games, and the polycarbonate ball could soon be on its way to school classrooms to give children an insight into robotics. It is hoped the waterproof ball will inspire a future generation to get involved in computer science and design and technology.","BB-8 moved in all directions on stage at Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim .

"Charged: This picture shows Zachary Davis in 2012 when he was arrested aged 15 for the murder of his mother and attempted murder of his brother . A Tennessee teenager on trial for murder says he killed his mother with a sledgehammer because she knew he had been raped by his older brother and did nothing about it. Zachary Davis was fifteen when he bludgeoned his mother's skull 12 times as she slept and then set his family home ablaze in an effort to also kill his elder sibling Josh. On Tuesday, a court in Hendersonville heard how Davis, now 17, laughed as he killed his mother Melanie Davis in August 2012, leaving her bloodied and unrecognizable before fleeing. Davis is charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and aggravated arson and the court was shown gruesome images of the crime scene as his trial began on Monday. According to prosecutors, Davis, his mother and brother went to see the comedy movie, The Campaign on August 10 and then returned home. Melanie Davis went to sleep at 9pm, 'not knowing that her younger son was planning something sinister, something unspeakable.' In testimony given to the court by Major Don Linzy, Chief of Detectives at the Sumner County Sheriff's Office, Davis confessed after he was apprehended at a convenience store eight miles away, having fled the scene. 'Yes, sir, I killed my mom in her sleep with a sledgehammer,' Linzy told the court on Tuesday according to the Tennessean. Linzy said that during his interview Davis was asked why he killed his mother with a sledgehammer and replied, 'I was worried that I'd miss,' and that using that type of weapon gave him the 'highest chance of killing her.' Battered: The teen's single mother Melanie Davis, 46, was killed with a sledgehammer while she was sleeping in her bed . Shockingly, Davis told Linzy during his confession that he he laughed out loud for no reason he could remember during his frenzied attack. He also said he only had one regret from that night, 'I would probably kill Josh with a sledgehammer too.' However, during his interrogation, Davis did tell police why he brutally killed his mother and tried to kill his brother by burning down the house. Linzy told the court on Tuesday that Davis alleged his brother, Josh raped him and that he told his mom, 'who didn't do anything about it.' Josh Davis vehemently denies ever sexually abusing his family and Linzy told the court law enforcement came to the same conclusion. 'We started a child protective team to see if it happened,' he said according to the Tennessean. 'We did not have anything to corroborate Zach's statement.' Mental illness: Zachary Davis legal team admit that their client burned his own house down and killed his mother but was suffering delusions at the time . Indeed, Josh Davis, 19, spoke in court on Tuesday and saw his brother for the first time in two years. He told the prosecution that he and Zach were close and said that until the shocking murder his entire family were all close. He said that he, Zach and his mother had bonded after the death from their father from ALS in 2007 and the first he knew of his brother's murderous intentions was on the evening of August 10. He told the court he awoke to the sound of the smoke alarm and ran to his mother's room but found it was locked. He said he broke the door down to find her dead and ran to his neighbors' home for safety. Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley said that on the night of August 10, Davis packed a backpack with notebooks, a toothbrush, gloves, a ski mask and a clawhammer and readied himself. Horrific: On the night of August 10 Davis allegedly attacked his mother before moving upstairs into their home's game room, pictured, where he lit a fire, hoping to kill his sleeping brother as well . Far beyond: Davis is seen here in 2012: It was determined that his charges were so severe that he would not be charged in juvenile court . 'Zach Davis had planned and intended to kill his mother and brother, and tonight was the night,' said Whitley according to the Tennessean. After killing his mother, he set fire to an upstairs room using gasoline and whiskey but closed the door and the fire did not catch as he intended. Defense attorney Randy Lucas has asked jurors to listen to all the evidence before they reached their verdict, despite admiting that his client did kill his mother. Lucas will argue that his client was suffering from mental illness. 'The voice of his father told him to kill his mother,' said Lucas to the court. A volunteer firefighter, Winton Batson, told the court how he rushed into the home to try and rescue anyone inside. He said he found his way to Melanie Davis' bedroom and saw her body. 'I saw immediately that there had been significant trauma to her skull,' he said.","Zachary Davis, 17, is on trial for the murder of his mother and attempted murder of his brother .

"A museum in Hawaii is preparing to open a treasure-trove of artifacts from the shipwreck of a royal yacht sunk off the coast of Kauai 191 years ago. Richard Rogers, a Hawaii shipwreck chaser, worked with scientists from the Smithsonian Institution to dredge up the findings from the ship owned by King Kamehameha II, aka Liholiho, the second king of Hawaii. 'We found gold, silver, Hawaiian poi pounders, gemstones, a boat whistle, knives, forks, mica, things from all over the world, high- and low-end European stuff. Every bit of it is royal treasure,' Rogers said. Finally returned home: Artifacts that belonged to the second king of Hawaii but that sunk on a ship in 1824 are now being returned to Kauai and will go on display at the local museum. Seen here is  a cupid furniture mount that belonged to King Kamehameha II, aka Liholiho . Shipwreck: The sunken yacht, which became known as 'Pride of Hawaii', was 83-feet-long and considered the first luxury ocean-going yacht in the United States when it sunk just off Kauai in April 1824 . Sunken: This image provided by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History  shows a diagram of the wreckage of the stern of the ship belonging to King Kamehameha II . Retrieved: Among the artifacts found by divers between 1995 and 2001 were this vegetal ivory finger ring . Rogers volunteered his time aboard his research vessel, the Pilialoha, over a five year period in four-week intervals from 1995 to 2001 to pull up the treasures. 'It's all pickled and nice and ready to be displayed,' Rogers said. 'There are over a thousand artifacts. We did our homework and this find is invaluable because it all belonged to the king. It is a fabulous window into the 1820s.' Rogers said the king's belongings were buried in 10 feet of water and 10 feet of sand. His favorite discovery was a trumpet shell. 'I found it under a bunch of sand and carried it onto the deck. This was in 1999. I blew it and it made the most beautiful sound going out over Hanalei Bay,' Rogers recalled. 'I thought about how it hadn't been blown in over 170 years.' Kamehameha II purchased the yacht from George Crowninshield II, who named it 'Cleopatra's Barge' in 1816. According to historian and Kauai Museum volunteer Zenon Wong, it cost $50,000 to build the 192 ton yacht. Rogers said it was the first luxury ocean-going yacht built in the United States. Collection: A sampling of Hawaiian artifacts found in the wreckage. At the center is the royal pu, or conch horn. Around it are ulu maika game stones, pounders, canoe breakers, and a stone rubber . Wong said reports were conflicting about the condition of the crew of the 83-foot long ship, which had been renamed Ha?aheo o Hawai?i ('Pride of Hawaii'). Some documents indicate everyone on board was drunk April 6, 1824, when the ship went aground on a shallow reef. Other historical accounts report everyone was intoxicated except the captain. The cause of the wreck is unfounded but speculation shows it may have been the combination of an unexpected wind gale and a snapped anchor cable. There are no reports that anyone died aboard the ship, which was crewed entirely by Hawaiians. The principal value of the artifacts is historical, said Paul F. Johnston, Ph.D., Curator of Maritime History at the National Museum of American History Smithsonian Institution. They represent the only known objects from the short but intense reign of Kamehameha II, the man who abolished the Hawaiian kapu (taboo) socio-cultural system and allowed Christian missionaries into the kingdom. Precious: Pictured here is a gunpowder flask found in the wreckage of a ship belonging to King Kamehameha II . 'He only reigned from 1819 -1824, but Old Hawaii changed forever and irrevocably from the changes he put into place during that short period. He was an important member of our nation's only authentic royalty,' Johnston said. The State of Hawaii owns the artifacts and loaned them to the Smithsonian for conservation and study. T . he findings were in the custody of the Smithsonian from the time of their recovery, with the exception of some artifacts going to the Underwater Conservation Lab at Texas A&M University. Those objects were returned to the Smithsonian after cataloging, conservation and stabilization. Several years ago a sampling of the artifacts were displayed at the Smithsonian. Damaged: Pictured here are fragments from Dutch case gin bottles that were on the ship . Four crates of recovered artifacts weighing nearly 1,200 pounds were delivered to The Kauai Museum in March. Two to three additional crates are scheduled for delivery and will complete the collection. Kauai Museum Director Jane Gray said she expects to open the crates soon and unveil the contents to the public after everything has been carefully unpacked.","Ship owned by King Kamehameha II, the second king of Hawaii, sank off the coast of Kauai in April 1824 .

"The former head of the NHS warned Labour yesterday that its failure to match Tory pledges to invest in the Health Service would leave it in a ‘financial hole’. Sir David Nicholson is the latest expert to warn that Ed Miliband’s plans will not provide enough cash to keep the service going. He was branded the ‘Man with No Shame’ after refusing to resign over the Mid Staffs scandal which led to 1,200 needless deaths. Sir David: The former head of the NHS's criticism of Labour threatens to demolish its claim to be the champion of the NHS . Published in The Daily Mail, February 7, 2013 . The lifelong bureaucrat had led the West Midlands Strategic Health Authority, which oversaw Mid Staffs, before Labour appointed him to run the NHS in 2006. Sir David stayed in the top job, insisting he did not know what went on at Mid Staffs, until retiring in April last year with a pension pot worth almost £2 million. His replacement as chief executive Simon Stevens drew up a £30billion five-year rescue package called Forward View which the Conservatives and Lib Dems have both pledged to implement. It involves the NHS finding £22billion in savings but also needs an extra £8billion funding by 2020. Labour has paid lip service to the plan, promising just £2.5billion. Sir David said: ‘All of the parties now I think, bar Labour, have signed up to the £8billion so it’s important, obviously, we get all the political parties signed up. ‘They haven’t said the £8billion, it would be helpful, I think, for the NHS if they did.’ His comments add to a chorus of criticism over Labour’s health plans. Mike Dixon, a leading GP and chairman of the NHS Alliance, said he was ‘extremely worried by the lack of political consensus around the £8billion funding’. He added: ‘NHS leaders have been clear that this is the minimum amount needed to maintain current service provision. It’s not rocket science to predict the impact on the NHS if this commitment is not met. ‘Patients would face longer waits, services would face severe cuts and rationing, and many hospitals and GP practices would struggle to survive in their current form.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Labour must explain why it won't find the money the NHS 'says it needs' Chris Ham, chief executive of the King’s Fund think-tank, said: ‘The big question is about funding, with Labour the only one of the three main parties not to have pledged to find the £8billion in additional funding called for in the NHS five-year Forward View. ‘Given this is the minimum if the NHS is to continue to meet patient needs and maintain standards of care, this leaves a significant gap at the heart of its plans.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘Labour must explain why they won’t find the money the NHS says it needs. ‘They don’t have a plan for the economy and that means they’ll never be able to fund the NHS.’ Sir David warned that the scale of the impending cash crisis was so great that the Tories and Lib Dems would have to rein in plans to expand services, despite being committed to the £8billion. His criticism of Labour threatens to demolish its claim to be the champion of the NHS. The party has run a controversial poster campaign claiming the Conservatives would cut the NHS ‘to the bone’. But senior figures have confirmed that Labour would not match Tory spending plans. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said a planned shake-up of NHS services by Labour meant the ‘funding gap...may be smaller’.","Sir David Nicholson warned Labour about failing to match Tory NHS pledge .

"He’s a TV star with a love for adventure, so it’s no wonder Ben Fogle looks for somewhere a little bit extraordinary for his holiday. My husband and I see the TV star lazing with his little boy by one of the five swimming pools in the Martinhal Beach Resort in Portugal, soaking up the sun. The high-end resort, which opened in 2010, is renowned as being one of the best in the Algarve for a luxury family holiday. The beautiful Martinhal is a hit with families - and TV stars such as Ben Fogle . But despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes, the water is cold . Martinhal, which boasts a fine-dining restaurant, is the only five-star resort in the area to have direct access to a beach, and is set within 25 hectares in the protected Costa Vicentina Natural Park. So we’ve come to check it out – after all, why should the kids have all the fun? From the balcony in our chic Beach Room, we are afforded an incredible view over the glistening waters of the North Atlantic Ocean from the most south-westerly point in the Algarve. But despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes, don’t be fooled – the sea is sharp-intake-of-breath cold. Adventurer, author, broadcaster and writer Ben Fogle is a regular at Martinhal . Couples can overlook the ocean, read the papers, feast on fresh orange juice, and enjoy a classy breakfast . The resort boasts a stunning swimming pool surrounded by decking - and close to a restaurant . The boutique room in which we stay for three nights is in the resort's hotel. There are also 152 hours and villas in the vicinity, so with 190 accommodation options, there is plenty of choice. We’re just a short walk from the main reception building, as well as the beach. Inside, the décor is minimalist and comfortable, soft pastel hues, blend well with the wooden floor, mixing stone, cork and other locally sourced materials for this British-designed interior. For larger families, there is the villa option – 23 award-winning, independently owned properties, with three or four large bedrooms, a parking space, a BBQ area as well as easy access to the facilities and swimming pools.

Martinhal, which boasts a fine-dining restaurant, is the only five-star resort in the area to have direct access to a beach, and is set within 25 hectares in the protected Costa Vicentina Natural Park . Holidaymakers can also choose to stay in villas at the high-end resort . There’s also a baby concierge service providing equipment to guests – including door protectors, potties, bottle sterilisers, cots, baths and pushchairs. It’s June and the place is busy – I’m told it’s almost at capacity, but the only time you can really tell how many people are staying here is at breakfast. It’s an all-you-can-eat buffet style option in the first-floor O Terraço restaurant – which offers a la carte dining in the evening. In the morning, there’s a hum of excitement; parents doing their best to feed their offspring who know exactly what they do and don’t want to eat. My husband and I eat on the terrace, overlooking the ocean, reading the papers, feasting on fresh orange juice, eggs cooked the way we like them, fresh fruit, cereal, pastries and croissants. After breakfast, there are seemingly endless options for children – from face painting, treasure hunts, arts and crafts, to windsurfing, dolphin watching, swimming tennis and football. M Bar, with its quirky decoration and VW camper van hiding in the corner,  is the place for a light lunch . The balcony offers a scenic view across the glistening waters of the North Atlantic Ocean . The view is breathtaking – sea-carved cliffs jut out around a long, wide beach which is warm beneath your toes . So while all that’s going on, the golden-sanded beach looks relatively deserted. We wander down, and the view is breathtaking – sea-carved cliffs jut out around a long, wide beach. There’s plenty of space, so even if everyone at the resort decided to spend the day at the beach, there’s room for them all. So I spend the morning soaking up the rays while Rich attempts paddleboarding for the first time. I’m not sure whether it was the fear of falling into the chilly water or that he is a natural, but he makes it all the way out to a small island without falling off – 15 minutes there and 15 back. For a day trip, Martinhal is located next to the historic fishing port of Sagres, one of Europe’s surfing capitals, which boasts rugged cliff faces, as well as a 15th-century port on the southern-most tip of the peninsular; giving it an end-of-the-world quality. For lunch, there a small shop where guests can buy their own food (although it is more expensive than other local shops due to being in-resort). Or there are three restaurants to choose from; As Dunas Beach Restaurant & Bar, overlooking the beach, offers fresh seafood dishes and a children’s menu; Gambozinos dishes up pizza and pasta; and M Bar is the place for a light lunch. There are also four bars across the resort. The boutique room in which we stay for three nights is in the resort's hotel. There are also 152 hours and villas in the vicinity, so with 190 accommodation options, there is plenty of choice . unlike other posh restaurants, guests are welcome to bring their children. Couples seated near to us have babies by their sides, and our meal isn't disturbed in the slightest . and after treatments, there’s a garden relaxation area in which to chill out even further . My husband whiles away the afternoon with a swim followed by a game of tennis – there are two courts and Martinhal is home to the Algarve’s Padel Tennis Championships - while I book in for some serious pampering in the spa. Finisterra Spa lies apart from the rest of the resort and is an oasis of calm. There are six treatment rooms as well as a wet area with a sauna and steam bath – and after treatments, there’s a garden relaxation area in which to chill out even further. I can see this would be the perfect place for frazzled mums to recharge while their little ones are being looked after. I book for a 50-minute massage and leave feeling as though all my worries have been massaged away. We are booked into the fine dining O Terraço for our evening meal. With white tablecloths, a delicious-sounding menu and an extensive wine list, it really is the ultimate luxury. However, unlike other posh restaurants, guests are welcome to bring their children. Couples seated near to us have babies by their sides, and our meal isn't disturbed in the slightest. Our villa overlooks the stunning ocean - which is deceptively cold! For larger families, there is the villa option – 23 award-winning, independently owned properties, with three or four large bedrooms . With top quality regional restaurants from both the 'surf' and the 'turf', the restaurant offers a 'culinary journey through Portuguese gastronomy' presented with a modern twist. Dishes include braised scallops, beetroot puree, smoked ham and watercress as well as beef carpaccio, feta cheese, rocket and basil sauce for starters. Then there is octopus, sea bass, mussels, duck breast, sirloin and lamb for mains, with tofu curry or vegetable Wellington for vegetarians. There's an impressive cheeseboard to finish, as well as a selection of dessert wines. It’s a very grown-up finish to a luxury holiday in a resort which caters for families but is uncompromising in delivering high standards for all its guests. And if it’s good enough for Ben Fogle; it’s good enough for us.

"The Queen is the most powerful piece in chess. But one of the UK’s most well-known grandmasters has angered women by saying they aren’t smart enough to play the game. Nigel Short, 49, said women were not suited to playing chess because it required logical thinking. The chess commentator and writer said women should accept they were ‘hard-wired very differently’ and weren’t as adept at playing chess as men. Mr Short, who was the first English player to play a World Chess Championship match, made the comments when explaining why there were so few women in competitive chess. Nigel Short has controversially claimed women were not suited to playing chess because it required logical thinking . But critics immediately pointed out that he lost a high-profile game against a woman grandmaster. He told New in Chess magazine: ‘Why should [men and women] function in the same way? ‘I don’t have the slightest problem in acknowledging that my wife [Rea] possesses a much higher degree of emotional intelligence than I do. 'Likewise, she doesn’t feel embarrassed in asking me to manoeuvre the car out of our narrow garage. ‘One is not better than the other, we just have different skills. It would be wonderful to see more girls playing chess, and at a higher level, but rather than fretting about inequality, perhaps we should just gracefully accept it as a fact.’ His comments mirror those of his rival Garry Kasparov, who infamously said: ‘Women, by their nature, are not exceptional chess players: they are not great fighters.’ Female chess players reacted angrily to Mr Short’s statements last night. Hungarian Judit Polgar, above, the former women’s world champion, beat Nigel Short eight classical games to three in total . Amanda Ross, the leader of the Casual Chess club in London, told The Daily Telegraph the comments were ‘incredibly damaging when someone so respected basically endorses sexism’. She added: ‘Judit Polgar, the former women’s world champion, beat Nigel Short eight classical games to three in total, with five draws. ‘She must have brought her man brain. ‘Let’s just hope Nigel didn’t crash his car on those days, trying to park it. 'At least this resolves the age-old debate as to whether there’s a direct link between chess-playing ability and intelligence. Clearly not.’ Mr Short responded to Miss Ross’s comments on Twitter, writing: You seem to suffer from incomprehension. ‘Men and women do have different brains. This is a biological fact. ‘Furthermore, I never said women have inferior brains. That is your crude and false attempt to caricature me.’ Less than two per cent of grandmasters are female, but Hungarian Miss Polgar broke into the upper echelons of the game when she became one of the youngest grandmasters of all time at the age of 15.","Nigel Short said women should accept they're ‘hard-wired very differently’

"A teddy bear mascot owned by a celebrated Battle of Britain fighter pilot who carried it in his Spitfire cockpit has gone on sale for £10,000. Flight Lieutenant Stephen Beaumont took his cherished bear with him on every Spitfire and Defiant flight he took to defend Britain from the aerial onslaught from Hitler's Luftwaffe. The pilot gave his teddy, named Beaumont Bear, a RAF tie and printed the Royal crest, the letters AM for Air Ministry and his nickname 'Bea' on his chest. Flight Lieutenant Stephen Beaumont took his treasured teddy bear mascot on every flight, pictured together in the cockpit of a Boulton Paul Defiant . Fl Lt Beaumont was one of just seven of the 24 pilots in his squadron who survived the 1940 Second World War battle and believed his beloved teddy bear brought him luck. He was known as one of 'The Few', which comes from Winston Churchill's famous phrase: 'Never, in the field of human conflict, was so much owed by so many to so few.' When Fl Lt Beaumont died aged 87 in 1997, his bear - suffering from a little wear and tear - was passed to his family. It is now being tipped to sell for an estimated £10,000 when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams auctioneers on behalf of a private collector. The teddy, named Beaumont Bear (left), is expected to sell for £10,000 when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams. Fl Lt Beaumont's uniform (right) is also up for sale for £2,000 . Tom Lamb, a specialist in military history at Bonhams, said: 'The life of an RAF pilot in the Summer of 1940 was marked by great physical danger and mental strain. 'Of the 3,000 airmen who served in this period, over one sixth were killed in combat. 'Teddy bears became popular mascots and helped to bolster the resolve of men engaged in a conflict where survival seemed a matter of luck as much as of skill. 'This particular bear called Beaumont Bear once belonged to Flight Lieutenant Stephen Beaumont, a 30-year old Spitfire pilot in the Battle of Britain. 'He flew numerous sorties with the bear in his cockpit. 'Flight Lieutenant Beaumont survived the war and died at the age of 87. His bear has lived on and if it could speak it surely would have some amazing stories of dog fights, sorties and close shaves. 'If it were just a normal bear it would be almost worthless but this one could go . Fl Lt Beaumont was aged 30 when his Squadron Commander, 26-year-old George Darley, removed him from combat duties midway through the Battle of Britain because of his 'advancing age'. Beaumont, a solicitor before the war, was furious at the time. The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF, pictured is a German Messerschmitt 109 shot down in raids over Ramsgate . He became an instructor, teaching young pilots the skills they would need to fly Spitfires and Hurricanes in dogfights against the Luftwaffe. He quickly rose through the ranks to the Wing Commander before helping plan the aerial assault aspect of the D-Day invasions. In 1945 he Beaumont was honoured for his outstanding contribution to the war effort by being made an OBE. Mr Lamb said: 'The teddy bear followed Beaumont in his new duties as an instructor and flight commander at an Operational Training Unit. 'There he distinguished himself in training Hurricane and Spitfire pilots, before eventually assisting in the preparations for D-Day in the role of Deputy Air Officer Administration.' After the war Fl Lt Beaumont, who was a solicitor before the war and was educated at Oxford University, returned to his home town of Wakefielfd, West Yorks, and took a string of administrative roles including becoming the city's deputy coroner. In 1967 he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1979 High Sheriff of West Yorkshire. He retired to Devizes, Wilts. His teddy is being auctioned on April 29 in New York. Fl Lt Beaumont's uniform is also up for sale, for £2,000. The Battle of Britain was one of the turning points of the Second World War and prevented Germany from invading Britain . The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940. It was one of the turning points of the Second World War and prevented Germany from invading Britain. The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences. From 12 August, Hermann Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the destruction of the RAF, attacking airfields and radar bases. (Pictured above, RAF scrambling to their planes in 1940.) Convinced that Fighter Command was now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter planes to break British strength. However, Goering grew frustrated by the large number of British planes that were still fighting off his attacks. Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities. Eleven days later, on what became 'Battle of Britain Day', the RAF decimated the huge incoming Luftwaffe formations in the skies above London and the south coast.","Flight Lieutenant Stephen Beaumont took cherished bear on every flight .

"Former teacher Mary Kay Letourneau and her student-turned husband, Vili Fualaau, have revealed how their relationship became sexual when he was just 12 years old. On the eve of their 10th wedding anniversary, Letourneau, 53, and Vili Fualaau, 31, spoke about the rape trial and their marriage in an interview with Barbara Walters for '20/20', which will air tonight. The couple, who have two teenage daughters, met when Fualaau was in her second grade class in Seattle. She then taught him again in sixth grade in 1996. Speaking to Walters, Letourneau said they began to spend more time together as she helped him develop his drawing skills that school year and by the summer, their relationship turned sexual. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Mary Kay Letourneau, Vili Fualaau, and their two daughters, Audrey and Georgia, sat down for an interview with Barbara Walters on the eve of the couple's 10-year wedding anniversary . Speaking out: The interview will air on 20/20 on Friday - nearly 20 years after Letourneau's arrest for the relationship with her former student. She was his sixth grade teacher when their affair began . 'The incident was a late night that it didn't stop with a kiss,' Letourneau recounted. 'And I thought that it would and it didn't.' When asked how Letourneau - then a married mother to four young children - felt about the affair, she responded: 'I loved him very much, and I kind of thought, ""why can't it ever just be a kiss?""' But it didn't stop there and by the end of the summer, she had fallen pregnant with the boy's child. Months later, her husband discovered a love letter she had written to Fualaau and he contacted police. She was arrested and gave birth to their first daughter while on bail in May 1997. Following a highly-publicized trial, she was sentenced to six months in county jail - although three were suspended - and was ordered to have no contact with the boy. But weeks after her release, she was found having sex with him in her car and fell pregnant with their second daughter. Struggles: The couple said they have had their ups and downs but had a solid relationship to start with . Relationship: The duo first met when Fualaau (pictured in 1998) was in second grade and went on to have a sexual relationship when he was 12 and Letourneau (right in a 1996 school photo) was his teacher . Letourneau gave birth to the second baby girl, Georgia, while she was in jail after being sentenced to an additional seven-and-a-half years behind bars. Being a father at such a young age and bringing up the girls without Letourneau was a struggle, Fualaau said in the interview. He slipped into a depression over the years, he said. 'I don't feel like I had the right support or the right help behind me,' he said. 'From my family, from anyone in general. I mean, my friends couldn't help me because they had no idea what, what it was like to be a parent, I mean, because we were all 14, 15.' He was not allowed to visit Letourneau while she was in prison but he believes contact with her would've helped him. She was the only person he really needed to talk to, he said. 'I mean, if they gave me more options or choices to make instead of just saying, ""Oh, you can't talk to her anymore,"" and I was like, ""I really do want to talk to her, though"",' he said. In court: She is pictured left in court in 1997 - she ultimately went to prison for seven and a half years - and right proudly showing off her baby bump in a pregnancy photo released in 1998 . Struggles: A teenage Fualaau, pictured in 1998, said he struggled while Letourneau was in prison because he desperately wanted to talk to her, but was not allowed . Reunited: Letourneau is pictured with her daughter Audrey during a prison visit in 2003. In the ABC interview, Fualaau said he struggled with not speaking to Letourneau while she was locked up . 'I'm surprised I'm still alive today. I went through a really dark time.' She was released from jail in August 2004 and Fualaau, who was then 21, asked the court to have the no-contact order overturned, which it was. The couple got married just 10 months later at a Washington winery - when she was 43 and he was 22. They have been together ever since. 'If it wasn't strong enough in the beginning, it wouldn't have carried through those years,' Letourneau told Walters in the interview. The couple remained in the same Seattle community where Letourneau had lived with her first husband and their four children. While she was in prison, her husband had moved the children to Alaska, but she remains close to them, she said, and they have good relationships with their two young sisters. Family: She was married and had four children before the affair. She is pictured, right, with one of her sons . Back together: The couple is pictured during a photo shoot at their Normandy Park, Washington home in 2006. She was released from jail in 2004 and they got married a year later . At home: The couple is pictured with their daughters as they drive near their home near Seattle in 2005 . Fualaau, who is just a year older than his wife's oldest son, said it was 'awkward' for him to be so close in age to his stepchildren. But even though they were happy to be reunited, the couple were not without their struggles. In 2006, Fualaau was back in court - this time in the defendant's chair - for drink driving. He was pulled over for speeding and later found to be over the blood-alcohol limit. In trouble: Fualaau is pictured in court in 2006 for a hearing into a drunken driving charge . He was sentenced to a year in jail with all the time but a day suspended and was put on probation for two years. And last year, Letourneau made headlines after she was booked into Washington's King County Jail for failing to go to court following a 2013 third-degree charge of driving on a suspended license. The couple's two daughters, 17-year-old Audrey and 16-year-old Georgia, also joined them for the interview with Walters. Both girls attend school and sing in a choir in the same district where their mother once taught. Audrey graduates high school in June and will start college next fall, while Georgia is a sophomore. The Fualaau sisters said their parents have told them how they met, but they were not taken aback by the scandalous circumstances surrounding their mom and dad's relationship. 'There was never a sit-down chat, ""Now is the time we're going to talk to our children about this"",' their mother said. 'They seemed to already know... because they grew up with it.' While some might compare the story to other female teachers in underage sex scandals,  family friend, photographer Mark Greenberg, told the Daily News it couldn't be more different. 'I know there are people out there who find it to be nothing other than this woman broke the law and she's a rapist, and yet there are others who see it as 'love is something that's pure' and here's two people who are enjoying the fruits of that,' he said.

"Want to know what you'd look like if you hit the gym and shed a few pounds? Now you can, thanks to a new app that calculates a slimmer version of yourself - without having to do any exercise. ‘Visualize You’ processes an image of you to reveal what you'd look like if you were thinner - and perhaps inspire you to achieve your weight loss goal. Visual Health Studios in Colorado has developed a weight loss app called Visualize You. It calculates what you would look like if you lost a specified amount weight. Shown on the left is TV star James Corden at his current weight, 210lbs (95kg), and on the right he is seen after digitally losing 60lbs (27kg) A picture of Bridesmaids actress Melissa McCarthy at an event in February is shown on the left, and on the right the star is seen after digitally losing 50lbs (23lbs) Users are shown an original and a slimmer version, with a slider, so they can compare how they would look before and after losing weight. The app, which costs £1.61 ($2.40) on Android and £1.49 ($1.99) on iOS for the full version, has been developed by US company Visual Health Solutions Inc but with the assistance of major American hospitals. The makers say that it uses algorithms which show the effects of weight loss more effectively than other apps which stretch or pinch images. The app has been developed with the Wellness Institute of the Cleveland Clinic, the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Centre, and UnitedHealthcare. Actor Jonah Hill, pictured in June 2014, is seen on the left at his normal weight, and on the right he is shown with a digital weight loss of 60lbs (27lbs) It asks you to enter your current height and weight and your target weight, giving you flexibility over how ambitious you want to be. Weight loss specialist Dr Charlie Seltzer told Yahoo Health: ‘Visual cues are very helpful for a lot of people. ‘I will often recommend that people put up pictures of what they want to look like or what they used to look like, provided the body image is healthy. ‘l’d hate for someone to put [their photo] in and see themselves not the way they are going to look, and get discouraged and disgruntled that they’re not changing how they’re supposed to. ‘But my first thought upon hearing about this app, was: ""It sounds like a really good idea.""' Charlie Lankston (lost 20lbs/9kg) Charlie Lankston is seen here before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 20lbs (9kg) 'At first, I thought it was great. The ""after"" picture looks pretty realistic, which I wasn’t actually expecting, and it was amazing to see what I could potentially look like with a few more trips to the gym! 'However, after thinking about it a bit more, I started feeling a slightly ashamed about the size of my actual face. 'Realistically, losing 20lbs is actually a pretty tough task, and the likelihood that I’ll be able to achieve it - and attain my ""skinny face"" - any time soon is pretty ""slim"" which doesn’t make me feel too great. 'Looks like it’s time to hit the treadmill…' Erica Tempesta (lost 38lbs/17kg) Erica Tempesta is seen here before before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 38lbs/17kg . 'It was cool to see such a dramatic difference, but I feel as though the app just changed the shape of my face, which isn’t necessarily how I would look nearly 40lbs lighter. 'My face has always been oval, regardless of my size. The app just made my face look longer as if my cheeks were sucked in. 'I chose a somewhat unrealistic target weight, but it was the size I had been in high school, so based on past pictures, I already had an idea of what my face should have looked like with less weight. 'I personally didn’t think the app gave a realistic rendering of weight loss.' The app allows you to take or upload a photo. You then need to enter your current height and weight, and then also enter your target weight. It will then enable you to 'scroll' through various weights on your way to your target, to see what you would look like . The app, which costs £1.61 ($2.40) on Android and £1.49 ($1.99) on iOS for the full version, has been developed by US company Visual Health Solutions Inc but with the assistance of major American hospitals. The makers say that it uses algorithms which show the effects of weight loss more effectively than other apps . Visualize You is effectively a reverse version of the popular app ‘Fat Booth’ in which users were able to see what they looked like if they were overweight. Fat Booth was launched in 2010 and has been downloaded 35,000,000 times, earning its creators an estimated £16 million ($24 million). Opticians and fashion retailers have made use of similar technology to let users virtually try on glasses on their websites. Dr Michael Roizen, Chairman of Wellness at the Cleveland Clinic, said: ‘Visualize You is a major step forward in helping people approach weight loss in a more informed, educated and fun manner.’ Dr Holly Wyatt, Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center added: ‘The app offers individuals a clear-cut end goal for weight loss and provides [users] with an important tool to activate and achieve a successful programme.’ Visualize You was released earlier this month and there are free and paid versions of the app which are available for iPhone and Android.","Visual Health Studios in Colorado has developed a weight loss app .

"After a heavy night of drinking, your immune system is bound to be weaker. This is because your body is under oxidative stress - a process that can also happen after smoking, breathing in pollution and even sunbathing. Now, for the first time, researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin E, found in foods such as kale and almonds, can mitigate the stress on immune cells. After a heavy night of drinking, your immune system is bound to be weaker. Now, for the first time, researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin E found in foods such as kale (left) and almonds, can mitigate the stress on immune cells . Whenever a virus or other pathogen enters our bodies, a certain class of immune cells - the T cells0 jump into action, spreading rapidly. One sub-class of these cells, the CD8+ T cells, eliminate the virus by killing cells it has infected. Other T cells, known as CD4+ T cells, coordinate the immune response to all kinds of pathogens. But a week can pass before these T cells start to take their toll on a virus. And with cells dividing every eight to twelve hours, it takes a few days to gather a strike force of cells in the hundreds of thousands: enough to overwhelm the infection. But this immune response does not work if significant oxidative stress is damaging the T cells and depriving the body of the tools it needs to repair them, according to a new study. A white blood cell, also known as a T cell, carries special structures on its surface with which to recognise specific pathogens . If the immune cells lack repair enzyme Gpx4, the T cells die off as they divide, which means the immune system becomes weak and the infection can be chronic. This is the enzyme responsible for repairing oxidative damage to the cell membrane. Your body constantly reacts with oxygen as you breathe and your cells produce energy. As a consequence of this activity, highly reactive molecules are produced known as free radicals. Free radicals interact with other molecules within cells. This can cause oxidative damage to proteins, membranes and genes. Oxidative damage has been implicated in the cause of many diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's and has an impact on the body's aging process. External factors, such as pollution, sunlight and smoking, also trigger the production of free radicals. Source: NetDoctor . When testing mice whose immune cells lacked the repair enzyme, researchers led by Manfred Kopf, a professor at ETH Zurich, were able to save the immune cells by mixing a high dose of vitamin E into the animals' food. That was enough antioxidant to protect the T cells' cell membranes from damage, so they could multiply and successfully fend off the viral infection. At 500 milligrams per kilogram of mouse feed, this quantity of vitamin E was ten times higher than was present in their normal food. 'The benefit of vitamin tablets is a controversial topic,' says Kopf. With little scientific evidence as yet making a strong case for vitamin supplements, he felt their study was all the more interesting because it proved the effectiveness of vitamin E. 'Our work shows that even a genetic defect in a major part of a cell's antioxidative machinery can be compensated for by delivering a high dose of vitamin E. That is new and surprising.' What Kopf isn't yet sure of is what impact the results of their study will have on human health. He claims that people with a normal level of health and a balanced diet shouldn't need vitamin supplements. But he added a supplement of vitamin E or other liposoluble antioxidants could well make sense in the event of oxidative stress, which can arise in everyday situations such as an infection or exposure to sunlight.","Drinking makes body go under oxidative stress and weakens immunity .

"At long last, there's been a Scooby sighting in Iowa. Hillary Clinton's now-famous Mystery Mobile, an oversized, armored Chevy van, stopped in Iowa on Tuesday long enough for photographers to catch a glimpse of the vehicle that hauled the former secretary of state from New York to the American midwest. Unlike on Monday when Hillary stopped at an Ohio Chipotle for lunch, she popped into a coffee house in Le Claire, Iowa, for a cup of joe - and of tea. And at Tuesday's stop people actually recognized her. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . And she's off: Hillary Clinton gets ready to board the armored Chevy van which she is using to tour Iowa . MYSTERY MACHINE: Hillary Clinton's Secret Service-approved campaign van, nicknamed 'Scooby,' was photographed outside Jones Street Java House during a campaign visit on April 14 in Le Claire, Iowa . ORDINARY AMERICANS: Clinton sipped alongside Le Claire residents before heading to the town of Monticello for an education roundtable at Kirkwood Community College . Clinton talked with a panel of six at Kirkwood Community College on Tuesday in the school's auto-technology shop . ROAD TRIP: Clinton's black van started at her palatial Chappaqua, New York home and reached Monticello, Iowa as of Tuesday afternoon . Clinton focused her roundtable discussion on education issues, student loans and income inequality . Hillary and top aide Huma Abedin wore sunglasses inside the Chipotle on Monday in the Toledo suburb of Maumee and left without being engaged by anyone other than a cashier. Campaign operatives later phoned the New York Times, according to a journalist familiar with the chain of events, so reporters would know she had been there. A Times reporter later persuaded the restaurant's manager to send her photographs of his security-camera footage. Clinton ordered a chicken bowl with guacamole, a chicken salad and a fruit juice. The manager, Charles Wright, told Daily Mail Online that 'it's true nobody recognized her.' 'When the reporters started to call, I went back to the security footage, and there she was,' Wright said. 'The sunglasses probably made her harder to spot.' 'But it's not like there was anything special going on. She just stood in line like everyone else. I hope she stopped at Chipotle locations all the way from New York to wherever she's headed.' The 'Scooby' van, named as an homage to the Scooby-Doo cartoon and its 'Mystery Machine' vehicle, is an upgraded Chevrolet 1500. Hillary Clinton takes a moment out of campaigning to speak with three-year-old Kate Boens in Le Caire, Iowa . Hillary Clinton stopped for a picture with William Boens, 5 (left), Olivia VonDracek, 5, Kate Boens, 3 and Journey Peterson, 5 . Meet and greet: Hillary shakes hands with residents in Le Claire, Iowa, while on the campaign trail . 'ALL HAIL THE QUEEN': Joey Gallagher of Iowa City, Iowa shouted as he staged a protest outside Kirkwood Community College on April 14, 2015 . Iowa City resident Matthew Evans scratched out his 'Stand w/ Rand' sign in favor of an anti-Hillary slogan as Mrs. Clinton was set to arrive for her first official presidential campaign event . THIS MANY PEOPLE KNEW ME! No one in an Ohio Chipotle restaurant recognized Clinton on Monday when she and aide Huma Abedin stopped for lunch . At Kirkwood Community College in Monticello, Iowa, supporters turned out in force to see Hillary, with one activist telling Mail Online 'we're here to see the queen' You go girl: Two senior voters turned out to show their support for Hillary with this homemade sign . In Monticello, Kirkwood Community College became a carnival bazaar as reporters staked out the building awaiting Mrs. Clinton. Two protesters, possibly the first of her nascent campaign, held signs complaining that she was a friend of Wall Street and cast a U.S. Senate vote to support the Iraq war. 'All hail the queen!' shouted Iowa City resident Joey Gallagher, one of the pair. As journalists passed by, he carefully scribbled on the back of his sign to cover up a 'Stand With Rand' campaign slogan.

Before visiting Le Claire, Hillary help a roundtable discussion with students at Kirkwood Community College . Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican senator, launched his own presidential campaign earlier this month in Louisville. But Matthew Evans, the second protester, insisted that 'we're not here with anybody.' 'We're here to see the queen.' As Clinton's van pulled into the Kirkwood parking lot - trailed at a short distance by a black Humvee - Evans waved a sign and repeatedly shouted, 'Give the Saudi money back!' Clinton nicknamed her campaign van 'Scooby' in honor of the popular television show Scooby Doo, in which a gang of teenagers drive around a van and solve mysteries . Hillary Clinton's custom van is Chevrolet Express Explorer Limited SE, 'a kind of full-size living room on wheels,' according to Yahoo News. It sports a 6-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission, more than enough horsepower for a Secret Service driver to outrun most any ne-er-do-well. Yahoo reports that the vehicle was produced with all union labor and made in the USA, as any UAW-friendly Democrat would have to ensure. Among other enhancements, Clinton's private ride is armor plated. Armor is usually placed underneath the original exterior of the vehicle. She said in a 2014 speech that it had been nearly two decades since she had driven a car, however, making it likely that she's being chauffeured around the midwest this week. That's a reference to the millions of dollars the Saudi Arabian government donated to the Clinton Foundation while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. Republicans cite it as one of many examples of the Clinton family philanthropy pocketing money from countries seeking special dispensation from the State Department during her tenure. The foundation now bears her name, along with those of former president Bill Clinton and their daughter Chelsea. As morning turned to afternoon in Monticello, smoke billowed on the horizon and reporters asked the locals what was burning. The likely culprit, a controlled leaf-burning. But Joe Murphy, who said he was part of the audio crew for Clinton's visit, told Daily Mail Online that 'Hillary might have crashed her Mystery Machine.' 'I should shut up,' he added. On Monday Daily Mail Online spoke with Kirkwood students anticipating Clinton's arrival. One, Corey Jones, said he was chosen to ask her a question, and would focus on illegal immigration. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal,' said Jones. 'She's part of all that. And some people think – well, I think maybe – it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes' from millions of grateful new citizens. While inside the school, according to administrators, Clinton will tour the Advance Manufacturing Lab and see the Auto Technology Lab. Then she is scheduled to sit with a hand-picked group of students and faculty to take questions in a roundtable format. At Casey's General Store in Monticello, cashier Kathy Rigby said she was open to hearing what Hillary has to say . 'I think the whole government sucks. They need to stop running my life. It's everything, including my health care. Especially my health care.' 'But if Hillary comes, I'd go listen to her. I wouldn't vote for anyone I haven't heard from.' INCOGNITO: Hillary Clinton (center) and Huma Abedin (behind her) were spotted – only by a security camera – lunching on Monday at Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio . LISTENING: Clinton's coffee shop visit is part of an effort to make her appear more personable as she chats with ordinary Iowans in living rooms and at small businesses .

"Just over 60 per cent of Americans believe global warming is taking place and nearly half blame humans for the change. But within the US, opinions on global warming vary wildly between states, local communities, and congressional districts. People in California, for instance, are far more worried about the warming planet than those in parts of the central US. Click on the interactive map below to find out which regions think global warming is happening . Now a new interactive map has revealed public opinion in all 50 states, 435 congressional districts and more than 3,000 counties. To create the map, researchers at Yale University asked people if they believed global warming is happening and whether they were worried. They were also asked questions such as whether they would support research into renewable energies and what they think about carbon limits. Nationally, 52 per cent of Americans are worried about global warming. But, as the results show, this national number glosses over the geographic diversity. Concern about global warming ranges from an estimated low of 38 per cent in Pickett County, Tennessee, to a high of 74 per cent in Washington, D.C. The results also identify significant variation within states, and one surprising result is Texas. Here, public concern about climate change ranges from a low of 39 per cent in King County to a high of 61 per cent in Travis County. Just over 60 per cent of Americans believe global warming is taking place and nearly half blame humans for the change. Pictured are the percentages of people who are worried about climate change, divided by different counties . Concern about global warming ranges from an estimated low of 38 per cent in Pickett County, Tennessee (pictured), to a high of 74 per cent in Washington, D.C. The Earth experienced its hottest month of March since record-keeping began in 1880. There's been no break from the globe's record heat - the first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks. Last month's average temperature soared to 56.4°F (13.6°C), which is 1.5°F (0.85°C) above the average for the 20th century. Scientists warn that fossil fuel burning is pushing more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, leading to increased temperatures, melting of polar ice and glaciers, and rising seas. The data, released last week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) takes into account global averages across land and sea surfaces. It follows earlier announcements from US government scientists that 2014 was the hottest year in modern history. 'Although a majority of people in every state think global warming is happening, this analysis makes it possible to see how much opinions differ within each state,' said Peter Howe of Utah State University, the lead author of the paper. 'These differences are partly due to the fact that different groups often think differently about the issue. 'For example, Hispanics and Latinos tend to be more worried about global warming than other racial or ethnic groups, which can be seen on the map in counties with more Latino residents.' Hawaii, California, Vermont and Massachusetts are the four states that are most worried by climate change. Three are coloured in orange, which means that at least 50 per cent of the people in every county are concerned about climate change. The data used in is based on 12 surveys conducted between 2008 and 2013 by the Yale Project on Climate Communication. To validate the model, the research team conducted separate surveys in four states and two cities. They found the estimates were within three percentage points of the independent surveys at the state level and four percentage points at the city level. 'Most of the action to reduce carbon pollution and prepare for climate change impacts is happening at the state and local levels of American society,' said Anthony Leiserowitz, a research scientist at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. 'Yet elected officials, the media, educators, and advocates currently know little about the levels of public and political will for climate action at these sub-national levels. Leiserowitz added that state and local surveys are costly and time-intensive, and as a result most public opinion polling is only done at the national level. In Texas, concern about climate change ranges from a low of 39 per cent in King County to a high of 61 per cent in Travis County (pictured) Pictured are the number of adults who believe global warming is taking place. The results are divided by congressional district.  The researchers say many Americans believe that even if it exists, global warming is not their problem . 'This model for the first time reveals the full geographic diversity of public opinion in the United States at these critical levels of decision making,' he said. Earlier this year, research by the same group the number of people in America who believe climate change isn't happening has risen to 23 percent, up seven percentage points since April 2013. The researchers also say many Americans believe that even if it exists, global warming is not their problem. 'Over years of research, we have consistently found that, on average, Americans view global warming as a threat distant in space and time – a risk that will affect faraway places, other species, or future generations more than people here and now,' an earlier report by the group said. 'People who prior said don't know are increasingly saying they don't believe it,' said Leiserowitz. He told Livescience media coverage surrounding the release of the IPCC report in September may be the explanation for the shift. While the report made a strong case for human-caused climate change, the majority of global media coverage focused on the question of whether there has been a 'pause' in global warming. 'Media frames can be really important in shaping the way people interpret the news,' he said. The findings divide Americans into six distinct subsets. Sixteen percent are 'alarmed,' sure global warming is happening and concerned about it. On the opposite end of the spectrum are the 'dismissive,' who comprise about 15 per cent of the public and who almost all see global warming as a conspiracy theory or hoax. Changing either of these two groups' opinions about climate change is nearly impossible, the report found. This graph reveals the percentage of people in each state who support funding research into renewable energy sources. New York, Vermont and Illinois are among the states with the highest levels of support . Just over 60 per cent of Americans believe global warming is taking place and nearly half blame humans for the change. But within the US, opinions on global warming vary wildly between states, local communities, and congressional districts. People in California, for instance, are far more worried about the warming planet than those in parts of the central US .","The map, created by Yale University, reveals public opinion in all 50 states, 435 districts and 3,000 counties .

"A 20-year-old student at James Madison University in Virginia was discovered dead in her dormitory room Friday from what has been described as a case of alcohol poisoning. Marisa Curlen, a native of Rye, New York, was a sophomore at the Harrisonburg college and a member of the Alpha Phi sorority. Police were awaiting the results of an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death, but they said there was no evidence to suggest foul play.

Life cut short: The fresh-faced blonde beauty who studied managment at James Madison University (pictured) was found unresponsive in her room at the sorority house in Harrisonburg . Tracie Cooper, a spokeswoman for the Western District of the Chief Medical Examiner in Virginia, said toxicology tests are pending. It could take up to three months to find out what the college sophomore had in her system the night she died. Marisa Curlen's sudden passing left her hometown in Westchester County reeling as she became the third member of Rye High School's 2013 graduating class to die in less than a year. ‘The first one’s the warning,’ Rye High School senior Mike Augusta told CBS New York. ‘The third? I don’t even know what to make of it anymore.’ Michael Rath, 19, Rye graduate and a student at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, South Carolina, was found dead in January 2014 at his apartment on campus. Peter Collins, 18, a student at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, was found unresponsive at his Rye home in July 2013 and passed away later in a hospital.

"A young man who has been stuck in the foster system since the day his mother gave birth to him behind bars has finally found a home. Davion Navar Henry Only, 16, became the face of adoption and an example of all the struggles faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up in a suit and told worshipers at Florida's St Mark Missionary Baptist Church; 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.' He then said; 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.' Most of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever.' Millions of people around the country soon head about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family. That is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system. Scroll down for video . Davion Only has been adopted by his old case worker, Connie Bell Going (above) Davion (above) captured hearts around the nation in 2013 when he made a plea in front of church congregation for a family to 'love him forever' This after Davion (abobe with Going) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children . Throughout Davion's search for a family, and his years in the system, Connie Bell Going, had been by his side. In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times she revealed that after Davion returned, people kept asking her what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months. She said wanted to tell these people; 'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong.' Making matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida. Davion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year. Going says she had begun to call him numerous times, but always hung up the phone. Then, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy. 'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said. 'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?' For the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear. The 52-year-old had three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier. From August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Tyler. Then, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. Davion (above) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July . 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion (above in 2013) said to Going last December . Davion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' Going is set to officially become Davion's mother on April 22, and she will admit it has not been an easy task. There is fighting and tables get flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges. Davion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their birthdays, which fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers. After 16 years Davion was finally home. What's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well.","Davion Only, 16, captured hearts around the nation in 2013 when he made a plea in front of church congregation for a family to 'love him forever'
He was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children .
In the next year he was shuttled between four different homes and four schools in Florida before calling his old caseworker, Connie Bell Going .
Davion called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July .
Going agreed, and in February they signed court papers to officially make Davion her son, which should take effect April 22 .

"A star college athlete and a classmate from Alabama's Troy University have been suspended after authorities discovered a cellphone video that allegedly shows them sexually assaulting a woman at a beach while a large crowd of spring-break revelers watches. Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen described the graphic video as the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' he had ever seen likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. He says the footage shows several men surrounding an incapacitated woman on a beach chair. Delonte Martistee, 22, of Bainbridge, Georgia, and Ryan Calhoun, 23, of Mobile, Alabama, were charged with sexual battery for the incident believed to have occurred between March 10 and 12. Delonte Martistee, 22 (left), and Ryan Calhoun, 23 (right), have been officially suspended from Troy University in the wake of sexual assault claims . The two were arrested this week after police uncovered cellphone footage of the two of them assaulting an unconscious girl at the Spinnaker Beach Club in Panama City, Florida last month . The video allegedly shows hundreds of people gathered around the girl as the men violate her while she lays on a beach chair. The unidentified victim believes she was drugged before the incident. Above, the beach behind Spinnaker is seen on April 12, 2015 . 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case and additional arrests are expected. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. Martistee of Bainbridge, Georgia is a promising track star at Troy University according to officials, but he has since been removed from the team . Calhoun, of Mobile, Alabama pictured above in a picture from Facebook. Officials say they more arrests are expected . Above, a view of the Spinnaker Beach Club during a spring break party . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.' The investigation related to the incident is ongoing.","Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, have been suspended from the Alabama school .

"At first glance, the rest of our solar system seems to be a pretty barren place - pockmarked worlds with dry surfaces are abundant, and only one - Earth - has visible water. But by peering beneath the surfaces of other worlds, scientists are quickly realising that water may actually be much more commonplace than thought. Nine other worlds in total are now suspected to have some form of subsurface ocean containing far more water than is on Earth - and some may even contain life, according to Nasa. Nasa has released an infographic explaining which worlds in the solar system are thought to have oceans under their surface, such as Ceres, seen here. The distance from the sun is given in AU, which stands for Astronomical Unit - and one AU is the distance from Earth to the sun . The agency released an infographic detailing the various worlds of our solar system suspected to have subsurface oceans. It followed claims by Dr Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for the agency, that we could find life in the next ten or 20 years. ‘Nasa science activities have provided a wave of amazing findings related to water in recent years that inspire us to continue investigating our origins and the fascinating possibilities for other worlds, and life, in the universe,’ she said. ‘In our lifetime, we may very well finally answer whether we are alone in the solar system and beyond.’ There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy - and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington this week, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Dr Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Dr Jeffrey Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Dr Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' Water is important because life, as we know it, needs it to survive. Some may say that there could be other forms of life that don’t need water - but as we don’t know of any yet, it makes sense to look for wet environments to discover if we are alone or not. ‘As Nasa missions explore our solar system and search for new worlds, they are finding water in surprising places,’ the agency said in a statement. ‘Water is but one piece of our search for habitable planets and life beyond Earth, yet it links many seemingly unrelated worlds in surprising ways.’ The chemical elements in water, hydrogen and oxygen, are some of the most abundant elements in the universe. The signature of water can be seen in the giant molecular clouds between stars, or in disks of material in young planetary systems. In our solar system the gas giant planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - are thought to contains lots of water in their atmospheres. But it is the solid moons and dwarf planets that are of more interest. For example, scientists using Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice. Signs of an underground ocean on Europa can be seen in the lines that are strewn across its surface. A nasa mission next decade will seek to search for water emanating from Europa - and see if its oceans are habitable. Ganymede, meanwhile, has layers of water and ice below its surface . Scientists using Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice. The water forms because the moon is pushed and pulled by the gas giant Jupiter . Here the lines across Europa's surface can be seen, likely caused by the icy surface cracking due to the motion of water underground . On its surface, Callisto is a barren world covered in craters, but underground it might also have an underground ocean. Meanwhile, geysers of water have been seen shooting from Enceladus . Water on worlds like Ganymede forms through tidal heating; its orbit around Jupiter is not perfectly circular, so it is pushed and pulled by the planet’s gravity, melting ice beneath its surface. Saturn’s moons Europa and Enceladus are also thought to have an ocean of liquid water beneath their surface, in contact with mineral-rich rock, and may have the three ingredients needed for life as we know it. These are liquid water, essential chemical elements for biological processes and sources of energy that could be used by living things. Nasa's Cassini mission has also revealed Enceladus as an active world of icy geysers. Recent research suggests it may have hydrothermal activity on its ocean floor, an environment potentially suitable for living organisms. Signs of water have also been spotted in craters on Mercury, while it appears that Mars was at least once wet - and may still have occasional brief rivers of water on its surface. The dwarf planet Ceres, between Earth and Jupiter, may also have some water-ice on its surface - and water underground. Nasa’s Dawn spacecraft, which recently arrived in orbit, will hopefully reveal how wet this world is. Titan could have lakes of liquid hydrocarbons on its surface, but may also have an ocean of water underground - although its unlikely to support life. Mimas, meanwhile, often compared to the Death Star from Star Wars owing to its huge crater, could possibly harbor life . Jets of material are seen shooting from Enceladus here, as pictured by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft. Exactly how these jets form or what they are made of, however, is not clear . Nasa recently announced that it is now thought Mars once had more water than the Arctic Ocean on Earth, shown in this illustration. Almost of this water has gone today, leaving the world barren and dry . Towards the outer reaches of the solar system, even Neptune's moon Triton and the dwarf planet Pluto may have some sort of ocean hiding under their surfaces . Other moons including Callisto, Titan, Mimas and Triton are also thought to have underground oceans, while Pluto at the edge of the solar system may, too, be equally wet. And if these worlds are proven to have water, it stands to reason that others outside the solar system may also have oceans, either underground or on their surface. Missions like the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess) - scheduled to launch in 2017 - will such nearby, bright stars for Earth-sized worlds, some of which may have water. And Nasa’s next great space observatory meanwhile, the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2019, will examine the atmospheres of certain worlds in detail. ‘It's easy to forget that the story of Earth's water, from gentle rains to raging rivers, is intimately connected to the larger story of our solar system and beyond,’ Nasa said in a statement. ‘But our water came from somewhere - every world in our solar system got its water from the same shared source. ‘So it's worth considering that the next glass of water you drink could easily have been part of a comet, or an ocean moon, or a long-vanished sea on the surface of Mars. ‘And note that the night sky may be full of exoplanets formed by similar processes to our home world, where gentle waves wash against the shores of alien seas.’","Nasa scientists in California say our solar system is full of water .

"More than 2,000 families have fled the Iraqi city of Ramadi after ISIS forces intensified their offensive on the Iraqi city. According to Iraqi officials, ISIS fighters have nearly surrounded the capital of western Anbar province, despite the best efforts of the Iraqi army and arriving Shiite paramilitary reinforcements. The advance is widely seen as an ISIS's attempt at an counteroffensive after being forced to abandon the important Iraqi city of Tikrit, earlier this month. American troops previously fought some of their bloodiest battles against al-Qaida insurgents in Ramadi during the eight-year U.S. intervention. Prior to the current bout of fighting, some 400,000 Iraqis were already displaced, including 60,000 in Ramadi district, according to the International Organization for Migration. Hundreds of U.S. troops have been training Iraqi forces at Ain al-Asad military base, situated west of Ramadi. Iraqi government forces still control the city center but appear to be struggling after months of ISIS pressure from the suburbs of the city. Video obtained by The Associated Press showed plumes of thick, black smoke billowing above the city as fighter jets pounded militant targets.  On the city outskirts, displaced residents frantically tried to make their way out amid the heavy bombardment. Officials confirmed that US led coalition air strikes had targeted the three villages recently taken by ISIS on Wednesday. More than 2,000 families have fled the Iraqi city of Ramadi with little more than the clothes on their backs, turning the city into a ghost town. Hundreds of U.S. troops have reportedly been training units of Iraqi forces at a military base, located west of Ramadi. Supplies including tents and food has already been dispatched to the terrified families, now living in difficult conditions in the suburbs of Baghdad. Fleeing residents now in Baghdad said that Ramadi resembled an ghost town. Anbar's deputy governor, Faleh al-Issawi, described the situation in Ramadi as ""catastrophic"" and urged the central government to send in reinforcements. ""We urge the Baghdad government to supply us immediately with troops and weapons in order to help us prevent the city from falling into the hands of the IS group,"" he told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. Ramadi was once the battlefield for US forces eight year battle against insurgents during the 2003 Iraq war. Since ISIS captured Fallujah over a year ago, it has been targeting Ramadi. Shiite paramilitary groups and further Iraqi army reinforcements are expected to arrive in the coming days to try and prevent ISIS from taking Ramadi. Iraqi forces have been assisted by US led coalition air strikes, which targeted three villages recently captured by ISIS. Stephane Dujarric,spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said access to the city was limited but humanitarian workers were trying to verify the reports of fleeing residents. Prior to the current bout of fighting, some 400,000 Iraqis were already displaced, including 60,000 in Ramadi district, according to the International Organization for Migration. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who was visiting Washington on Wednesday, did not mention fears surrounding Ramadi. Instead he praised the 5,000 Sunni tribal fighters who have reportedly enlisted to help defend Ramadi and other strategic towns in Anbar province. If Ramadi does fall to ISIS, it would be the first major Iraqi city to be taken by the extremist group since militants seized Mosul in June 2014.

"Manchester Airport was forced to temporarily suspend flights today after a drone was reported buzzing around the area, causing disruption for hundreds of travellers. All flights were halted for about 20 minutes after the potential drone sighting raised fears that the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could collide with a passenger jet. Some departing flights were delayed and some incoming flights were diverted to other airports while a police helicopter scoured the area shortly after 11:30am. Flights were delayed or diverted while a police helicopter scoured the area around Manchester Airport . Flights resumed after the police search failed to turn up any evidence that a drone was operating in air space used by commercial airliners. Manchester Airport opened its second runway to clear the backlog of flights. A Manchester Airport spokeswoman said: ‘Due to a report of a potential drone sighting in airspace near to the airport, some flights have experienced short delays and a small number of flights have diverted to alternative airports while Greater Manchester Police carried out an investigation using their police helicopter. ‘Upon inspection, nothing was found. As the safety and security of all of our passengers is paramount, operations on runway one were suspended for 20 minutes. Radio-controlled drones have skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the growing trend of aerial photography . ‘Runway two, which was unaffected, will remain open for an hour so normal traffic flows can resume.’ Police continue to investigate the report of the sighting. Unmanned drones have skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the growing trend of aerial photography, and they have become a serious problem for airports and pilots as many operators are not aware of the rules or dangers. There have been dozens of reports of drones flying too close to airports or commercial aircraft, and experts say the radio-controlled devices pose a significant threat because they could be sucked into a jet engine. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has successfully prosecuted two UAV operators for safety breaches and it has another three investigations open. UK aviation authorities have successfully prosecuted two drone operators for safety breaches . John Mayhew, Nats’ general manager for air traffic services at Manchester Airport, said: ‘Flying drones in the close vicinity to any airport without permission is completely unacceptable, with the reported sighting causing delays to inbound and outbound traffic and the diversion of a small number aircraft to other airports. ‘The matter has now been referred to the police.’ Last year a device believed to be a drone came within 20ft of an Airbus A320 as it landed at Heathrow Airport, according to a UK Airprox (aircraft proximity) Board report. The passenger plane was just 700ft from the runway when the captain reported seeing a small black object to the left of the cockpit. The object did not collide with the plane and the pilot was able to make a normal landing during the July 22, 2014, incident. Under CAA rules drones cannot be flown beyond the normal unaided ‘line of sight’ of the operator, must always be flown at least 164ft (50 metres) away from a person, vehicle, building or structure, and must never be flown within 492ft (150 metres) of a congested area or large group of people, including sporting events or concerts.","Manchester runway closure caused disruption for hundreds of travellers .

"An astonishing letter from the Titanic's owners to the family of a dead officer asking for a huge sum of money to return his dead body to England has been uncovered 103 years on from the tragedy. The letter, dated May 7, 1912, was sent from White Star Lines to Christopher Moody, the brother of 24-year-old officer James Moody, who died after the Titanic hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage. In it, company bosses demand £20 - the equivalent of £2,000 in today's money - to return his body to England, and state that Christopher Moody will have to pick up the tab from there. Scroll down for video . Bosses from Ismay Imrie & Co, co-owners of White Star Lines, wrote this letter to the family of officer James Moody who died on board the Titanic, telling them his body could be returned - but only for a price . The letter asks for £20, almost £2,000 in today's money, to have Mr Moody's remains sent to his home in Scarborough, and say it will be the family's job to pay for him to be transported to the morgue and for burial . The letter, from bosses at Ismay Imrie & Co, the parent company of White Star Line, read: 'We have your further letter of the 6th instant, and while we will be prepared to transport the remains of your brother across the Atlantic to either Liverpool or Southampton we regret that it is not possible for us to do any more. 'Should you after further consideration desire the remains of your Brother to be returned will you kindly telegraph us in the morning at the same time sending us a deposit of £20 for any expenses and land charges on the other Side and we will at once cable New York asking then to arrange this if practicable. James Moody was born in Scarborough in 1887, the son of John Henry Moody, a twon councillor, and Evelyn Louise Lammin. Privately schooled, he was sent away to King Edward VII Nautical School in London where he graduated with a masters in 1911. He went straight into service as an officer, first working on the Titanic's sister ship the Oceanic, before transferring to her ill-fated relative in 1912, then aged 24. Serving as the vessel's sixth junior officer, he set sail on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on April 14, 1912, along with 2,224 passengers and crew. Two days later, as the boat was passing through the northern Atlantic, Moody was on night watch when he received a call from one of the lookouts at 11.40pm. 'What do you see?' Moody asked. The man replied: 'Iceberg, right ahead!' After the collision, Moody was seen on deck all night, helping passengers into the lifeboats, and declining to go himself, despite all his junior officer colleagues escaping. He was last seen shortly before 2.20am, when the boat finally slipped under, still trying to launch more lifeboats. Today there is a memorial to him in Scarborough, with the inscription: 'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' 'We also think it right to point out that the arrangements and expenses for taking charge of the remains after arrival of the steamer at Liverpool or Southampton would be on your account.' Instead, the company suggests that Mr Moody's remains be buried in Halifax with the other survivors, but they offer to send his family 'a photograph of the tombstone', if they want one. Even more shocking is the fact that Mr Moody's body had not been recovered by the time the letter was sent, and bosses would have known that, as all remains were cataloged. The remains of Mr Moody, who was on watch when the ship struck the iceberg and later helped passengers into the lifeboats while declining a space for himself, have never been found. Mr Moody was among the 1,500 passengers and crew to die aboard the Titanic when it sank in the north Atlantic on April 14 1912, two days into her maiden voyage. He had been serving as the Titanic's sixth officer, and was the only junior officer to perish after staying behind to help evacuate the passengers after the other officers left. Born in Scarborough in 1887 to John Henry Moody, a town councillor, and Evelyn Louise Lammin, James was privately educated before being sent to King Edward VII Nautical School in London. He passed his masters exams there in 1911 before becoming an officer. He was originally stationed on the Oceanic, the Titanic's sister ship, but transferred just months before the disaster in 1912. The letter has come to light after being listed for auction by a collector who acquired it directly from Moody's family. Experts at Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, have described the two-page letter as 'beyond comprehension' and say it could make £25,000 when it goes under the hammer. Mr Moody (front left), 24, was the Titanic's sixth officer, and the only junior officer to die on board while helping passengers into the lifeboats, long after his colleagues had abandoned ship . The Titanic (pictured), sank on April 14, 1912, on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, after colliding with an iceberg in the northern Atlantic . Andrew Aldridge, from the auctioneers, said: 'White Star Line is asking for £20, which was a colossal amount of money in 1912, for the return of the body of one of their own officers. 'The mere concept of requiring payment for the return of the body of anyone who died on Titanic - let alone one of the ship's officers - is just beyond comprehension. 'It is an horrific act on the part of White Star. You can't imagine how Christopher Moody must have felt to have been greeted with a letter like this when he was grieving for the loss of his brother. 'What's more, the £20 White Star were asking for did not cover getting the body home or to the undertakers once it arrived in England. 'But where this letter is most shocking is the fact that Moody's body had not been - and never was - recovered in the aftermath. 'When this letter was sent the recovery ships had already arrived in New York and the bodies they had found had been identified and catalogued. 'You would like to think the sending of this letter was an administrative error but it's open to a lot of interpretation. 'The implications are huge - how many families of the deceased did White Star ask for payment from? 'James Moody was an incredibly brave man, helping to get passengers into liferafts and choosing to stay with the ship until the bitter end. 'It appears that White Star treated his body as a commodity, which callous in the extreme.' RMS Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US. More than 1,500 people died when the ship sank carrying 2,224 passengers and crew under the command of Edward Smith. Some of the wealthiest people in the world were onboard the ship, including property tycoon John Jacob Astor IV, great grandson of John Jacob Astor, founder of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim, heir to his family’s mining business, also perished, along with Isidor Straus, the German-born co-owner of Mancy's department store. The ship was the largest afloat at the time and was designed in such a way that it was meant to be 'unsinkable'. It had an on-board gym, libraries, pool as well as several restaurants and luxury first class cabins. There were not enough lifeboats on board for all the passengers due to out-of-date maritime safety regulations. After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown in Ireland before heading to New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing she hit an iceberg at 11:40pm ship's time. James Moody was on night watch when the collision happened, and took the call from the watchman, asking him 'what do you see?', the man responded: 'Iceberg, dead ahead.' By 2.20am, with hundreds of people still on board, the ship plunged beneath the waves, taking many, including Moody, with it. Despite repeated distress calls being sent out, and flares launched from the decks, the first ship arrived nearly two hours later, pulling 710 people from the water. It was not until 73 years later that the wreck of the ship was discovered on the ocean floor.","James Moody, 24, officer on the Titanic, died helping passengers escape .

"Guilty: Andras Janos Vass, 25, has been convicted of human trafficking and racketeering . A Hungarian man has been convicted of luring young, gay Eastern European men to the United States for a horrific life of sex slavery. Andras Janos Vass, 25, was found guilty of human trafficking and racketeering felonies this week after grooming fellow Hungarians online then keeping them captive in New York City and Miami. Vass brought men to America with the promises of easy work and high wages - then took their travel documents, threatened their families, and made them spend 20 hours a day on sex work, prosecutors said. He was found guilty of the offences by a jury in Miami-Dade on Thursday, the Miami Herald reported. He faces a maximum sentence of 155 years in prison - and will spend at least 21 behind bars. Three of Vass's victims testified against him at the trial. Two said they were tempted to the United States after being contacted via Planet Romeo, a free dating site. According Gay Star News, the men believed they would be employed as legal escorts and make between $3,000 and $5,000 a month. The victims said they were flown to New York City in 2012 and forced to live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment. They were forced to perform sex work at all hours, either in person or live on webcams. Lure: Prosecutors said at least two of the victims were lured to America via the Planet Romeo gay dating website . According to online listings, Vass's company, Never Sleep Inc., was based at an address in Sunset Park, Brooklyn in New York City. In August 2012, prosecutors said, the Vass and his associates moved the business to Miami. Vass is accused of running the sex ring with two other men, Gabor Acs and Viktor Berki, who have yet to stand trial. Victims said that they had their passports taken when they arrived and that Berki, a former policeman, threatened their families in Hungary. Vass is due to be sentenced on June 2.","Andras Janos Vass, 25, found guilty of human trafficking and racketeering .

"A Missouri woman who finished a St. Louis marathon third last year and was the female winner of it this year is being stripped of the title after officials concluded she didn't run the full course either year. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that officials determined that Kendall Schler crept onto the GO! St. Louis Marathon's course last weekend after the last checkpoint, didn't record any of her times electronically along the way, and didn't run the entire 26.2 miles. Schler was spotted at the beginning of the race and the end of the race, and while Schler's actual course is unknown, the starting point of the race are suspiciously just three blocks apart. Scroll down for video . Fake winner: Kendall Schler cheated her way to the front of the St. Louis marathon course . Not a true winner: Her times that qualified her to run in Monday's Boston Marathon have now been erased, and her spot in the event has been vacated . Kendall Schler crept onto the marathon course after the last checkpoint and since she was spotted  at the starting point of the race just blocks from finish line, she may have lingered in that area before sneaking in . Schler claims to have removed both the magnetic strips meant to record her times from her race (violation of race protocol) and since no photographs of her were taken along the way there is no proof she is the rightful winner. Her finish time that qualified her to run in Monday's Boston Marathon has now been erased, and her spot in the event has been vacated. Her third-place finish last year also was wiped out after officials couldn't find evidence that she crossed any of that event's checkpoints. 'It’s a difficult situation for everybody, including the people who run a fair race and don’t get the recognition they should receive,' said Nancy Lieberman, president of GO! St. Louis. 'I said to her, ""It looks like you perpetrated a fraud.""' 'I have nothing legitimate that says she officially started and ran 26.2 miles in 2014 or 2015,' she added. Lieberman said incidents of dishonest runners happened but called this 'an extreme case.' When Lieberman made Schler prove she ran all of the checkpoints from last years race she was unable to provide them and he title was stripped from her. 'I said, ""I’m going to disqualify you in 2014 unless you provide me photos of you along the course,"" ' Lieberman said. 'I told her if she showed me photos within two hours I’d consider not disqualifying her.' Liar: Kendall Schler (left) was unable to prove that she won this year's marathon in St. Louis so Andrea Karl (right) was named this year's winner . Tough race: Runners return to St. Louis from E. St. Louis on the Martin Luther King Bridge during the race . The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the course has seven spots where a runner is meant to record a time. The spots are the start, the finish, and five spots within the course. Lieberman said she did not register a time at any spot. There was no electronic evidence of any of those times either. According to the president of the marathon Nancy Leiberman, Schler claimed to have removed the magnetic strips from both of her race bibs. Tampering with race bibs is a violation of race protocol, says Leiberman. Lieberman checked with U.S. Track and Field officials on the course who also saw no sign of her. 'They’re situated in specific places so that people can’t cheat and jump on at other times,' Lieberman said. 'They didn’t see (Schler) anywhere on the course.'

"The Missouri National Guard referred to Ferguson protesters as 'enemy forces' during demonstrations last year, according to a new report. Activists in the Missouri suburb, protesting over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown by a white cop, were also known as 'adversaries', according to internal briefings seen by CNN this week. The National Guard was first activated in Ferguson in August after Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency when riots and looting broke out amid peaceful demonstrations over police brutality. National Guard soldiers secure the police command center in Ferguson, Missouri, on November 27 last year. An internal report has revealed that the heavily-militarized guard referred to  protesters as 'enemy forces' The guard were activated again in November ahead of the November 24 decision by a St Louis grand jury who decided not to indict the officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Brown. Many in the community accused the National Guard of making an already tense situation worse. Guardsmen were seen rolling through the streets of the suburb in tanks wearing combat gear and carrying assault rifles. Missouri National Guard described some  on the streets as 'enemy forces' including the KKK, the RgB Black Rebels and the New Black Panther Party -  but also the 'general protesters'. According to CNN, National Guard supervisors were worried about how they were being viewed by the public and asked guardsmen to tone down the heavily militarized language. Officers were told by superiors to change references to 'enemy' to 'criminal elements' instead. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a response from the Missouri National Guard on Friday. Brown's shooting stirred long-simmering racial tensions in the St. Louis suburb, where two-thirds of the residents are black but the police force is almost entirely white. Rioting and looting a day after the shooting led police to respond to subsequent protests with a heavily-armored presence that was widely criticized for continuing to escalate tensions. At times, protesters lobbed rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, who fired tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds. At the time of the Guard's deployment in November, St Louis Mayor Francis Slay said he supported Nixon's decision to activate the Guard. 'The way we view this, the Guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on (the) front line interacting directly with demonstrators,' Slay said. Protesters flip over a Ferguson police car on November 25, 2014. Missouri's governor ordered hundreds more National Guard troops to the St Louis suburb following the grand jury's decision not to indict white cop Darren Wilson over the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown .","Activists in the Missouri suburb, protesting over the shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown, were also known as 'adversaries'

"A Texas mother who was intent on getting back stolen pieces of her husband's truck set up a sting and met with the suspected criminal without realizing the alleged crook was packing heat. Cristina Coria, a stay-at-home mom with a nine-month old child, helped police nab the 18-year-old suspect and get back the bed of her husband's custom-painted blue 2003 Chevy Stepside. In order to make it happen, the Houston resident got a little help from Facebook. Scroll down for video . Cristina Coria used Facebook and her wits to help police nab a man accused of stealing her husband's truck . Coria arranged to meet the suspect with her husband at a gas station parking lot near I-45 in Houston, Texas . The sequence of events leading up to the successful sting began on Tuesday when the truck was stolen from Coria's driveway,KHOU reported. Police discovered the vehicle the following day in a storage lot, but its bed and wheels had been stripped. When Coria went on Facebook after the truck was found, she saw an ad for a blue 2003 Chevy Stepside bed. When Coria went on Facebook, she saw an ad for a blue 2003 Chevy Stepside bed that looked familiar . She put two and two together and arranged to meet the man with her husband at a gas station parking lot near I-45. The police were also called. When the seller showed up and they determined he almost definitely had the stolen parts, Coria and her husband stalled him while waiting for police to arrive. Coria said: 'I took his keys. 'While [the seller] was going around his truck, I took the keys from his truck. 'So when he was out there looking for his keys he couldn't find them; he couldn't leave. 'I watch A&E a lot.' The police arrived after a wait Coria said approached two hours and arrested the man. A search of his truck turned up an illegal pistol. The suspect claimed he bought the truck parts on the street from a stranger outside the city. He said he had no idea the parts were stolen, even though they were being sold at a discount and didn't come with a receipt or bill of sale. Police may charge him for theft and unlawfully carrying a gun. If she had known he was armed, Coria said she 'probably would have ran'.","Cristina Coria's husband's truck was stolen from home in Houston, Texas .

"Anaesthetic gases used to send patients to sleep during surgery are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere where they are contributing to climate change. Scientists say they have detected the gases used in anaesthetic as far a field as Antarctica and concentrations have been rising globally in the past decade. The gases - desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane - are potent greenhouse gases that have 2,500 times the impact on global warming compared to carbon dioxide. Anaesthetic is used to send patients to sleep during surgery (above) but it may also be warming the planet . Atmospheric scientists who have been monitoring the gases say that while the concentrations in the atmosphere are low, they are having an increasing effect on the climate. Dr Martin Vollmer, who led the study at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Material Science and Technology in Dubendorf, Switzerland, said the anaesthetic gases were capable of storing far more energy from the sun than carbon dioxide. The world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change, scientists have warned. Researchers have found evidence that suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25°C per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years. The analysis, based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world, looked at the rate of change in 40-year long time spans. Over the 900 years preceding the 20th century, 40-year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1°C per decade, the study found. But by 2020 the rate was expected to have risen to an average of 0.25°C per decade, give or take 0.05°C. Different scenarios of future emissions showed that even at the lower end of greenhouse gas generation climate change picked up speed in the next 40 years. He said: 'On a kilogram-per-kilogram basis, it's so much more poten . 'Modern halogenated inhalation anesthetics undergo little metabolisation during clinical application and evaporate almost completely to the atmosphere.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that concentrations of desflurane reached 0.30 parts per trillion in 2014. Isoflurane, sevoflurane and halothane have reached 0.097, 0.13 and 0.0092 parts per trillion in the atmosphere respectively. By comparison, carbon dioxide gas currently makes up 400 parts per million in the atmosphere. However, one kilogram (2.2lbs) of desflurane produces the same greenhouse effect as 2,500 kg (5,512lbs) of carbon dioxide. The researchers estimate that anaesthetic gas emissions currently combine to produce the equivalent effect in the atmosphere of 3.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. The research team did not examine the impact of nitrous oxide, another major component of anaesthetic, as it is released by many other sources. The researchers have been taking air samples from remote sites around the Northern Hemisphere since 2000 while they have also obtained air samples in the North Pacific and the South Shetland Islands in Antarctic. The gases escape through vents in operating rooms (pictured) when breathed out by patients and from masks . The team also used two hourly measurements at a high altitude observatory at Jungfraujoch, Switzerland since 2013 to track anaesthetic gases. They then used computer modelling to produce global estimates for the concentrations of these gases. The gases escape from hospital operating rooms via air vents during surgery. An estimated 280 tonnes of anaesthetic gases are used every year. Jodi Sherman, an anaesthesiologist at Yale University who reviewed the paper, said hospitals should consider using other chemicals in anaesthetic. She said: 'There's nothing unique about desflurane that we can't do with other drugs. 'Desflurane we could live without, and every little bit makes a difference. 'Health care in and of itself in the US is one of the worst polluting industries. Scientists say that hospitals should consider alternative anaesthetics when performing operations like above . 'It generates eight percent of US greenhouse gases according to one study. 'Add to this the fact that climate change has been recognized by the World Health Organization as the number one health issue of the 21st century, and it behooves us to do a better job with emissions.' However, Edmond Eger, an anaethesiologist at the University of California San Francisco, said: 'What the report fails to note is that a major factor determining the environmental effect is the manner in which the anesthetics are used. 'Many anesthetists deliver sevoflurane or isoflurane in a two - three liters per minute flow but deliver desflurane in a lower flow - 0.5 to one liter per minute. 'Some believe that desflurane has clinical advantages that argue for its continued use.'","Gases used in anaesthetic in are accumulating in the Earth's atmopshere .

"The Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since the first was published in 1997. And now researchers have discovered its success may lie in the use of words author J.K Rowling chose across the series - rather than the texts as a whole. By scanning the brains of participants as they read passages from the collection, researchers discovered that the common use of 'arousing words' affected parts of the brain concerned with emotion. The Harry Potter books (pictured) have sold more than 450 million copies and its success may lie in the use of words used - rather than the texts as a whole. By scanning the brains of people reading passages from the collection, researchers discovered 'arousing words' affected parts associated with emotion . The emotional potential of words is rated in terms of valence and arousal ratings. Valence refers to how positive or negative a word is, while arousal refers to its 'physiological intensity', or the extent to which it affects the reader and their view of the word or text. These properties are normally used for words in isolation, which can be categorised as negative, neutral, and positive. But the researchers from Lancaster University wanted to see how these classifications and findings for individual words could be applied to passages of text and books as a whole. 'A text is more than a list of words, and the way these words are combined, or the context they are embedded in, clearly matter,' explained the researchers. They screened all seven Harry Potter novels: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (1997), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2003), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). Study screened seven Harry Potter novels. Emma Watson (left) as Hermione Granger and Daniel Radcliffe are shown in Prisoner of Azkaban . From this, they selected 120 passages, each of which was four lines long and did not require a high level of familiarity with the books. In each case, the emotional connotations of the passages were at the start and and the emotional contents were unambiguous and consistent throughout the passage. The team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these 120 passages. Following the experiment in the scanner, each participant rated the passages on valence, on a scale of -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive, and arousal, on a scale of 1 for very calming to 5 for very arousing. The sentence: 'And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor', from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban featured a range, or span, of arousal. The researchers said this was due to the contrast between the low arousal of 'silence' and the high arousal of 'chill', which led to the overall lexical arousal of the whole sentence to be moderate. Meanwhile, the passage: 'Ginny glanced round, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry's mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds,' from the Deathly Hallows was rated positive. But its valence was neutral. The emotional impact is said to result from the drift of Harry's mind into the past remembering his relationship with Ginny and the fact the reader has to imagine it, rather than being told about it. And the sentence from the Half-Blood Prince: ""You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!"" roared Gaunt, losing control' contains words that are consistently negative in valence and high in arousal, such as 'disgusting', 'filthy', 'blood', 'traitor', 'roar', and 'losing'. Following the experiment, each participant rated the passages on valence - from -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive - and arousal - scaled from 1 for very calming to 5 very arousing. Examples are shown . The team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these passages from the books before asking them to rate each on valence and arousal. A passage involving Ginny (played by Bonnie Right pictured left), and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe right) had a neutral valence . The MRI scans revealed that reading passages like the one from the Half-Blood Prince correlated with brain activity in regions associated with emotion, with building a mental model of a situation and also with the understanding of a character's state of mind. In particular, these emotional passages stimulated the left amygdala of the brain, which processes emotional reactions, and the insula. The more emotionally arousing words a text contained, the more it was judged to be emotionally affecting. But the sentence: 'You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!' from the Half-Blood Prince was said to contain words that are consistently negative in valence and high in arousal. This stimulated the left amygdala of the brain (left) and the insula (right) which are associated with emotional reactions . Researchers screened all seven Harry Potter novels and selected 120 passages, each of which was four lines long and didn't require a high level of familiarity with the books. The team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these 120 passages before they were asked to rate each for valence and arousal. The sentence: 'And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor', from  the Prisoner of Azkaban featured a range, or span, of arousal.

Thus, the researchers said the emotional engagement readers show is mostly driven by the single emotional words contained in the text, rather than by each passage as a whole. Psychologist Dr Francesca Citron from the university said: 'These results suggest that a text's constituting words can predict its emotion potential.' 'When we read a text, specific words reverberate in our minds beyond the more complex message conveyed by the text; the art of choosing the right words with the appropriate affective impact is part of what defines the skill of good writers or speakers.' The study: 'The emotion potential of words and passages in reading Harry Potter – An fMRI study' is published in Brain and Language.","Researchers chose 120 passages from across all  seven Harry Potter books .

"Four South African men accused of stabbing a Mozambican man to death in an anti-immigrant attack in a Johannesburg township  appeared in court today. The brutal murder of Emmanuel Sithole was captured on camera and shocking images show men stabbing him and beating him with a wrench. Anti-immigrant violence has spread across South Africa in recent weeks and the government has now sent in troops to control the riots. Four South African men suspected of killing Mozambican national Emmanuel Sithole in Alexandra township in an apparent xenophobic attack, are arraigned at the Wynberg Magistrate Court in Johannesburg . The brutal attack on Mr Sithole in Alexandra township near Johannesburg on Saturday was captured on camera  by a local journalist and published across the world the following day. They show the four men surrounding the Mozambican man, before  repeatedly stabbing him with knives and bludgeoning him with a wrench in broad daylight. Witnesses took Mr Sithole to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreign-born duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift for fear of being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township. Mr Sithole was taken to hospital where he later died, the cause of death was established as a direct stab wound to the heart. The four men accused of his murder will remain in custody until a full trial, set to be held on May 4th.

The South African army has been deployed to areas that remain volatile after a spate of attacks targeting immigrants, the defense minister announced on Tuesday. Soldiers have already been sent to support police in troubled areas, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said in a live broadcast. The minister made the announcement in Alexandra, a Johannesburg township where a Zimbabwean couple survived a shooting overnight. The man and woman were both shot in their necks and the woman suffered an additional shot in her leg, the minister said. Both Zimbabweans were treated and discharged from hospital. Troops have also been sent to Durban, the coastal city where the attacks on foreigners began, Mapisa-Nqakula said. The violence has been concentrated in areas of Johannesburg and Durban where poor immigrants and South Africans live. The recent spate of attacks has mainly affected immigrants from African states like Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, according to a statement from the aid group, Doctors Without Borders.

"It is a superfood with numerous health benefits, but our enthusiasm for almond milk is causing a storm in the US. Almond growers in California are at the centre of a row over water usage during one of the worst droughts in decades. The state, which supplies more than three-quarters of the world's $4.93billion(£3.3bn) almond market, is in its fourth year of drought. Scroll down for videos . Dry days: Homes with swimming pools are seen in the Palm Springs area, California, as the state enters its fourth year of severe drought . This has also seen local residents attack the bottled water industry, after it was revealed that several companies have been 'taking advantage of poor government oversight to deplete mountain streams and watersheds,' The Guardian reports. A campaign singles out Nestle as the main villain, after an investigation by a local newspaper found that the company has been sourcing water from some of the driest areas in the state using expired permits. An online petition demanding that the company seizes production of bottled water in California with immediate effect has garnered more than 150,000 signatures. Despite the ongoing drought,  almond growers, who require a gallon of water to produce a single nut, are still planting trees. The industry's growth is being driven by the public's clamour for a food with benefits for the heart, the bones and metabolism. Still going: Almond growers in California are at the centre of a row over water usage during one of the worst droughts in decades . Almonds are high in potassium, calcium, vitamin E and magnesium, and are thought to reduce cholesterol and decrease hunger without leading to weight gain . A gardener works on a golf course in La Quinta, California, as residents campaign against the bottled drinks industry and almond growers in a bid to stop the drought . Almonds are high in potassium, calcium, vitamin E and magnesium, and are thought to reduce cholesterol and decrease hunger without leading to weight gain. Unlike cows' milk, almond milk – which is made from ground nuts and water – has no cholesterol or lactose, and being a plant food, it is often consumed by vegans, vegetarians, and others forgoing dairy. David Cameron is said to be a fan, and Sainsbury's reported a 181 per cent sales increase in the milk last year. But in California, there is growing anger that while most people are facing water rations, the almond industry has been left to expand its orchards and guzzle all the water it wants. Tom Stokely, of the California Water Impact Network, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'There has been a huge expansion of almonds. As we speak, there are yet more almond orchards being planted. In many cases the farmers are planting them in areas of low water supply so groundwater is being over-drafted. 'They're doing it because there are such huge profits. Now they're asking the rest of us to give up our water so they can stay in business.' Unlike cows' milk, almond milk – which is made from ground nuts and water – has no cholesterol or lactose, and being a plant food, it is often consumed by vegans, vegetarians, and others forgoing dairy . But the almond industry insists it needs the resources. Brad Gleason, a grower in Fresno County, said: 'I'm proud to be a farmer of almonds. We produce something real and healthy that contributes mightily to the economy of California. 'Some of the old-timers still remember when this stretch of Fresno County belonged to the horned toad, jack rabbit and tumbleweed. Demonising us, and what we grow, is no way to meet the challenge. We're not the bad guys.' Governor Jerry Brown also defended his decision to exempt agriculture from the water consumption cap, saying: 'Agriculture is an important pillar of California.' Pineapple lovers are facing hefty hikes in the price of their favourite fruit, according to a report yesterday. Pineapple prices have soared to their highest level for almost three years as a result of poor weather in Costa Rica, which has led to plummeting supplies. Trade magazine The Grocer said that while retail prices of many fruit and vegetable lines had fallen over recent months, the average price of a loose pineapple in the biggest UK supermarkets has risen to $2.41(£1.61) – up from $2.21(£1.48) in March. Costa Rica is the world's biggest exporter of pineapples, accounting for 90 per cent of the global fresh supply, but recent cold and wet weather had hit this year's harvest.","California supplies more than three-quarters of world's almond market .

"Train conductor Graham Palmer is the first to admit his poetic works aren't Shakespeare, but when they're delivered over the Tannoy his passengers certainly don't seem to mind. Palmer, 52, has been giving safety announcements and other messages in verse since last year when Northern Rail encouraged their guards to give their addresses a festive flavour. The rhymes were a hit with travellers and have been going strong since, and he even customises the self-penned couplets according to the stations his carriages are passing through. Train conductor Graham Palmer delivers safety announcements over the Tanny in the form of poetry . Palmer, 52, has delighted Northern Rail passengers with his self-penned poems since Christmas last year . 'The poems aren't that clever really. They're not Wordsworth, but it's all a bit of fun,' he told Gazette Live. 'I was a bit self-conscious to start with but I've got more confident now, especially when I see the smiles on people's faces. 'I don't do them for every announcement and I try to mix them up a bit. For our regular passengers, it's probably a little bit repetitive but then again, so are safety announcements!' Palmer, who lives in Skelton and works out of Middlesbrough Station, has worked on trains since 2006 after a career working with glass and five years as a handyman for Age Concern Teesside. His poem's are anything but serious but they do get his messages about safety and ticket policy across. One as passengers enter the train goes: 'I'm Graham your conductor and welcome on track, Safety information's at front and back. Keep all your personal belongings in view, As you don't want anything missing, do you? Despite being a local hero with his colourful announcements, Graham still has to check his tickets . Have your tickets and passes ready to see, And if you have neither, you'll have to pay me. If you're buying a ticket, please have the right money, 'Cos my tea's going cold and it's simply not funny.' Graham said: 'I'm taking the mickey out of myself a little bit and it's all done tongue in cheek, but at least it's getting the message across. And the best words you can hear as a conductor are 'I'm glad it's you today'.' Passenger Kath Sainsbury, of Saltburn, said Graham is 'well known and liked by all his regular passengers'. She said: 'His jolly personality gives us all a lift.' I'm Graham your conductor and welcome on track . Safety information's at front and back . Keep all your personal belongings in view . As you don't want anything missing, do you? Have your tickets and passes ready to see . And if you have neither, you'll have to pay me . If you're buying a ticket, please have the right money . Cos my tea's going cold and it's simply not funny . Thank you for travelling on Northern with Graham . Please use the handrails when you step from the train . If you're making connections, consult platform screens . Or ask station staff if there's any to be seen . Keep your tickets and passes to exit the gate . 'Cos any delay and you'll be in late . Tell Northern Rail Twitter how it was for you . Cos we value your feedback, yes we really do! Graham says he's taking the Mickey out of himself a bit 'but at least it's getting the message across' Graham's boss, Northern's conductor team manager at Middlesbrough Colin Savage, is pleased with the response from the public but doesn't expect his colleague to follow suit if they don't want to. 'Graham's delivering the announcements in a different way which makes people listen, so we're delighted,' he said. 'The other conductors are scared we're going to make them do it too, but we don't have any plans!'

"The eye is one of the most complex yet delicate part of the human body. Now engineers claim to have designed a range of synthetic eyes that may one day let us replace and even enhance our own sense of vision. Italian bio-designers MHOX has unveiled project is has been working on to 3D print organic tissues to produce working body parts that can replace the eyes of people suffering from disease. It could mean rather than getting glasses to correct their vision, people would be able to replace their entire eye. The MHOX Eye concept (above) is designed to replace and even enhance the vision compared to a normal eye . The group plan to combine the biological tissue with microscopic wireless technology to provide additional functions and give super human eyesight. While currently still just a concept, the project raises the prospect of what bio-engineering may make possible in years to come. The team behind MHOX say their synthetic eyes, which include lenses that improves the image sharpness and can put filters over the vision, could be available by 2027. Scientists claim to have made a 'giant leap' towards creating 3D organs that could be simply printed out in hospitals when needed for a transplant. An international team have created the first organs that include a full vascular network for transporting blood through organs. They say it could even allows organs damaged by cancer to simply replaced. Scientists from the Universities of Sydney, Harvard, Stanford and MIT have now bio-printed artificial vascular networks mimicking the body's circulatory system that are necessary for growing large complex tissues. Using a high-tech 'bio-printer', the researchers fabricated a multitude of interconnected tiny fibres to serve as the mold for the artificial blood vessels. They then covered the 3D printed structure with a cell-rich protein-based material, which was solidified by applying light to it. Lastly they removed the bio-printed fibres to leave behind a network of tiny channels coated with human endothelial cells, which self organised to form stable blood capillaries in less than a week. Filippo Nassetti and Alessandro Zomparelli, the two Italian designers leading the project, said: 'Latest developments in bioprinting and biohacking let us imagine that in the near future it would be possible to easily print organic, functional body parts, allowing the human to replace defected districts or enhance standard performance. 'This project is based on the idea of augmenting the sight sense, increasing the functionalities of the eye with ones currently handled by other body segments or external devices.' Under MHOX designs, patients with eye disease will inthe future be able to replace their eye with a synthetic one printed in a laboratory. For those looking to improve their vision, they could buy the 'Enhance' model that features a 'hyper retina' to give 15/10 vision - significantly better than normal 20/20 vision. They say it could also include a gland that can filter the visual signal to the brain by producing vintage or black and white effects much like a modern camera. They say these could be turned on or off by swallowing a pill that alters the state of this gland. The Eye Advance model adds a wifi connection that allows what the eye is seeing to be recorded and shared with others. It could also connect to external devices to act like a camera. They say a socket that connects the eye to the brain - which would require a surgical operation - would allow eyes to be interchangable. The synthetic eyes would come in three different models (above) according to the designs outlined by MHOX . MHOX propose combining new technology like Wifi with bioprinting to produce an enhanced bionic eye . The concept sounds a little like something out of the science fiction hit Blade Runner where bioengineers built new eyes for robotic replicants. Writing on their website, Mr Nassetti and Mr Zomparelli said: 'The installation of the EYE augmentations needs a first surgical operation aimed at installing the Deck, the technology that actually connects the eye to the brain. 'After that, augmented eyes can be easily interchanged by their own users without the need of additional surgery. 'Besides allowing to use different augmentations in different contexts, this system is suitable for easy hardware upgrade.' The designers say 3D bioprinters could be used to create the tissues to create the complex eye stucture .","Italian designers have unveiled a concept for a bio-printed synthetic eye .

"Fears for two new strains of influenza, which caused a spike in deaths in Europe and the United States, will see the arrival of an improved vaccination on Australian shores. Stocks of the influenza vaccine are arriving a month later than expected as scientists have included protection against Influenza A strain H3N2 and Influenza B strain B/Phuket. The decision to include both was triggered by a spike in flu-related deaths in the northern hemisphere as the vaccine was not a good match to fight against the two types of flu. Stocks of the influenza vaccine are arriving a month later than expected as scientists have included protection against two new strains . High-risk groups - such as the very young and very old, and most indigenous Australians - will be able to access free, government-funded flu shots from April 20. Experts say the modified version of the vaccination is worth waiting for. But Dr Alan Hampson, who chairs the Influenza Specialist Group, said everyone should be getting the vaccine, which also provided protection against Influenza A strain H1N1. He said H3N2 and B/Phuket caused a spike in deaths in Europe and the US during the northern winter because the vaccine available did not provide the right buffer against the diseases. There was a spike in deaths related to H3N2 and B/Phuket in Europe and the US during the northern winter as the vaccine did not cover the strains . World health authorities realised that and modified the vaccine to be used in Australia this winter. 'Our vaccine now should be a really good match for the strains that are circulating globally and we certainly hope we can prevent more deaths per capita than they did,' Dr Hampson told AAP. 'In fact the vaccine that will be used in the next northern winter will be exactly the same as the one we'll be using over the next few weeks.' Dr Hampson said people should be booking their flu shots now, given the delay in stocks arriving. 'Even if people are not in one of the high-risk groups, they are probably coming into contact with people in their own families who are,' he said. 'Those high-risk groups are harder to protect so it's great if we can also protect the people around them.'","Flu strains H3N2 and B/Phuket triggered spike in deaths in U.S. and Europe .

"The new YouTube Kids mobile app targets young children with unfair and deceptive advertising and should be investigated, a group of consumer advocates told the Federal Trade Commission in a letter Tuesday. Google introduced the app in February as a 'safer' place for kids to explore videos because it was restricted to 'family-focused content.' But the consumer activists say the app is so stuffed with advertisements and product placements that it's hard to tell the difference between entertainment and commercials. Scroll down for video . The home screen comprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons (pictured): a TV set for popular TV shows such as Yo Gabba Gabba, a light bulb for educational programmes, a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos . Along with favorites from DreamWorksTV, Jim Henson TV, Mother Goose Club, Talking Tom and Friends and more, your kids can watch new series from YouTube channels they already like. National Geographic Kids; Reading Rainbow; and Thomas the Tank Engine leave the world of Sodor for the first time in 70 years to travel the globe. One example is a 7-minute video of Disney's 'Frozen' characters who appear as dolls inside a toy McDonald's, eating ice cream and drinking Sprite. The activists say digital media should be subject to the same rules as television, which limits commercial content on kids' programming. 'As a consumer, you should have the right to know who is trying to persuade you,' said Angela Campbell with the Institute for Public Representation at Georgetown Law, who provided legal counsel to the coalition. In young children especially, 'it takes unfair advantage of their trusting nature and lack of experience,' she added. In a statement early Tuesday, YouTube said:  'We worked with numerous partners and child advocacy groups when developing YouTube Kids. 'While we are always open to feedback on ways to improve the app, we were not contacted directly by the signers of this letter and strongly disagree with their contentions, including the suggestion that no free, ad-supported experience for kids will ever be acceptable. ' We disagree and think that great content shouldn't be reserved for only those families who can afford it.' Since its inception in 2005, YouTube has become the world's most popular online video site, with more than 1 billion users. For parents, it's become an easy way to find Elmo song clips or full episodes of 'Barney & Friends.' But when searching for Elmo or Barney, it's easy to pull up other user-generated content aimed at adults, such as the two puppets cursing or waving guns. 'Now, parents can rest a little easier knowing that videos in the YouTube Kids app are narrowed down to content appropriate for kids,' wrote Shimrit Ben-Yair, the app's product manager, in a February blog post. According to the consumer groups' letter, the videos mingle commercial and entertainment content in ways that wouldn't be allowed on television. Search for 'My Little Pony,' for example, and the first several options are lengthy advertisements for My Little Pony Play-Doh and toy kitchen sets, including one Play-Doh segment stretching 19 minutes. 'The fact that children are viewing the videos on a tablet or smartphone screen instead of on a television screen does not make it any less unfair and deceptive,' the letter states. Groups that signed the letter were the Center for Digital Democracy, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Center for Science in the Public Interest, Children Now, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Watchdog, Consumers Union, Corporate Accountability International and Public Citizen. MailOnline has learned the app will launch with content from Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a handful of popular YouTubers and new series, such as Thomas the Tank Engine. A stock image of Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street is shown . 'Like most parents, I love helping my kids learn more about something they're interested in,' said Shimrit Ben-Yair, mother of two and YouTube Kids Group Product Manager. 'For example, right now, I spend a lot of time on YouTube with my 3-year-old son, who loves watching videos of car washes, Super Simple Songs, and about the universe. 'Today, we're introducing the YouTube Kids app, the first Google product built from the ground up with little ones in mind. 'The app makes it safer and easier for children to find videos on topics they want to explore, and is available for free on Google Play and the App Store in the U.S.' The app includes a timer to limit kids' screen time, sound settings to turn off background music and sound effects, and search settings to limit your children to just the pre-selected videos available on the home screen. Ben-Yair, the project's group product manager, told USA Today that the site has seen a 50 per cent increase in viewing time year-on-year, but that the growth has been around 200 per cent for family entertainment channels. 'Parents were constantly asking us, can you make YouTube a better place for our kids,' she said. In answer, the company has come up with an app that is simple to use and eliminates features such as viewer comments from the design. Research show that children are just three clicks away from adult content on YouTube . The home screen comprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons: a TV set for popular TV shows such as Sesame Street, a light bulb for educational programmes, a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos. The categories are called: Shows, Music, Learning and Explore. 'The images are big as are the tap targets for small fingers, and since most younger children can't type they can search with voice,' Ms Ben-Yair said. If children try and search for a raunchy video, for example, the app simply blocks the request and a box that reads 'Try something else' pops up. They will be able to search for topics they are curious about though, such as spaceships and find how-to-make a volcano and maths tutorials, for example. The app will also give parents more power over their children's viewing habits. It will give them features to control the time children spend on the app so that it shuts down after a number of minutes or hours. It can be re-started again once a password is entered. There will also be an option to mute videos - a feature tested by families and NGOs. MailOnline has learned the app will launch with content from Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a handful of popular YouTubers and new series, such as Thomas the Tank Engine. 'The news that YouTube plans to launch a kid-friendly video app will be welcomed by security savvy parents,' said David Emm, principal security researcher, Kaspersky Lab. 'Our research shows that children can be as little as three click away from inappropriate or adult content on the video platform. 'Examining YouTube's 'suggested' videos which sit visibly alongside clips or episodes of popular children's television programmes such as Peppa Pig, Rastamouse and Dora the Explorer, our researchers have found that, on average, users are just three clicks away from content better suited to a more mature audience.' The child-focused app will in part compete with Netflix's Kids service and Vine's child-friendly app showing age-appropriate video clips. The move would appear to be part of Google's strategy to appeal to younger users. YouTube is owned by the search giant. Google recently acquired Launchpad Toys, which is behind the iPad app Toontastic, and has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome and Search, as well as YouTube. Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to develop a new version of the View-Master, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. The virtual reality device makes use of Google's Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called '360 degree photospheres'. To release the phone's virtual reality features, an Android smartphone running Mattel's app is needed. View-Master gets a make-over! Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to the new toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. An illustration of the new device is shown . The smartphone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel,meaning that parents will have to surrender their handsets while children play. The gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make the scenes feel immersive. Mattel says that its View-Master is an affordable platform enabling children to take 'engaging field trips' so they can explore famous landmarks, natural scenes and planets, for example, in 'photospheres'. By pairing an 'experience reel' with a smartphone, children 'will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment,' the company says. The device itself is set to be released in autumn for $30 (£20), with reels sold in themed packs of four for $15 (£10). Mattel told MailOnline the toy will come to the UK early next year.","App collate child-friendly videos, songs and educational resources .

"Dallas nurse Nina Pham contracted Ebola while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, the first U.S. patient to die from the deadly disease . A hospital operator has denied allegations of poor training and improper preparation in seeking dismissal of a lawsuit by a nurse who contracted Ebola while caring for the first U.S. patient to die from the deadly disease. Texas Health Resources filed a response on Friday to the March 2 lawsuit by nurse Nina Pham, The Dallas Morning News reported Saturday. Pham, who remains employed at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas but has not returned to work, seeks unspecified damages in her lawsuit. A man visiting Dallas from Liberia, Thomas Eric Duncan, died October 8 at the hospital. Pham and another nurse caring for Duncan contracted Ebola but survived. Texas Health Resources spokesman Wendell Watson said in a statement Friday that the company and the hospital acted responsibly to protect their employees, basing their responses on the most up-to-date federal guidelines and with leading experts at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The hospital also respected Pham's privacy and acted only with her consent, the statement said. A doctor on October 16 videotaped Pham, who was in a hospital bed, in images later made public. 'Nina Pham has gone through the unprecedented challenge of being the first nurse to whom the Ebola virus was transmitted while caring for a patient with Ebola in the U.S.,' the statement said. A doctor video taped Nina Pham while she was in her hospital bed on October 16 and images (pictured) were later made public. The hospital says it respected Pham's privacy and only acted with her consent . 'Our care and compassion for Nina is paramount, and we will continue to show her the utmost courtesy, dignity and respect as a member of the Texas Health family,' the statement continued. Since Pham contracted the disease while working for the hospital as an intensive care nurse, her remedy should be a worker's compensation claim, not in civil court, the hospital's response said. 'I am disappointed but not surprised about the answer THR filed,' said Pham's attorney, Charla Aldous. 'My hope was that they would come clean and be honest about what happened so that the health care community can learn from the mistakes made,' Aldous added.","Texas Health Resources filed response to Nina Pham's March lawsuit Friday .

"David Cameron's desperate attempts to appear cool have failed to impress his children. The Prime Minister has revealed eldest daughter Nancy has taken to likening her father to Phil Dunphy, the embarrassing dad from US hit sitcom Modern Family. He admits the comparison is 'not great', with even his fashion getting the thumbs down from the 11-year-old. David Cameron has revealed eldest daughter Nancy has taken to likening her father to Phil Dunphy (right), the embarrassing dad from US hit sitcom Modern Family . Now in its sixth series, Modern Family is one of the biggest sitcoms to come out of American since Friends . Dunphy, played by Ty Burrell, is one of the stand-out characters in the American show. He is convinced he is a cool parent, a view not shared by his three children or his wife Claire. Mr Cameron, who has often name checked ultra-cool bands to burnish his credentials, revealed the pain of discovering his children really view him as a British version of Dunphy. Nancy has taken to using the putdown 'That is SO Phil Dunphy' to highlight her father's flaws. It occurred on a recent shopping trip, Mr Cameron told The Sunday Times. 'I said, 'That's a nice shirt', and she said, 'Dad, that is so Phil Dunphy'. I thought, 'Oh dear. It's happened'. 'She does regularly say: 'That is so Phil Dunphy'. If you watch Modern Family, you will know what that means. It's not great.' In the show, Dunphy is often mocked by his wife Claire, but has become one of the best loved characters for his pearls of wisdom dubbed 'Phil's-osophy' Samantha Cameron, who has joined her husband on the campaign trail, has also teased the Tory leader over his DIY skills . 'When life gives you lemonade, make lemons. Life'll be all like 'what?!' 'If you're ever in a jam, a crayon scrunched up under your nose makes a good pretend mustache.' 'Some people call me a salesperson. I call myself a salesfriend.' 'If you love something, set it free. Unless it's a Tiger.' 'Watch a sunrise at least once a day.' 'Take a lesson from Parakeets. If you're ever feeling lonely, just eat in front of a mirror.' I got to be the top realtor of the year by thinking inside the box. That's right, I said inside. Because while everyone is chasing each other outside, what is the box? Empty.' 'If you get pulled over for speeding. Tell them your spouse has diarrhoea.' Now in its sixth series, Modern Family is one of the biggest sitcoms to come out of American since Friends, with Dunphy a standout character. The real estate agent's trademark pearls of wisdom have become one of the most popular aspects of the show, and have spawned fansites, online lists and even books. They include gems like: 'If you love something, set it free. Unless it's a Tiger.' Mr Cameron is not averse to making similarly bizarre comments. In the interview he was asked about the low-key nature of the Conservative election campaign so far. Some Tories are asking themselves whether their leader has a tiger in his tank. But the PM insisted: 'I'm hugely enthused. There's not just a tiger, there's a couple of elephants, a lion and a yeti in the tank. This is a very energetic campaign.' Dunphy is often mocked by his wife, particularly by his attempts at DIY around the family home. Last weekend, Samantha Cameron revealed how her husband also struggles with odd jobs. 'Historically, I'm the one with the drill,' she told the Mail on Sunday. 'He's become quite expert at putting together flat-pack furniture over the years. Normally, when I've just had a baby.' Mr Cameron also revealed that Nancy has threatened to a write memoir of her time in Number 10. It would include the embarrassing episode in which her father mistakenly left her in a pub. Mr Cameron also revealed that Nancy has threatened to a write memoir of her time in Number 10, including the embarrassing episode in which her father mistakenly left her in The Plough pub .

"Residents of a tiny Missouri city say they have no idea why five of their six police officers and several other top officials resigned after their first black mayor was elected. Tyrus Byrd, 40, was sworn into office in Parma last week, but her election victory was overshadowed by the departure of the majority of the police force, the city attorney, clerk and water treatment supervisor. The officials all cited 'safety concerns' in their resignation letters, the outgoing mayor says. There are 713 people living in the community and, according to the US Census Bureau, 57percent are white and 41percent are black. Unwelcome change: Tyrus Byrd, who was sworn in as mayor last week, must find replacements for five of the city's six police officers, the city attorney, the city clerk and the water treatment supervisor. Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in last Wednesday, told Daily Mail Online she still doesn't know why the employees quit - though the outgoing mayor says they cited 'safety concerns' in their resignations . Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in on Wednesday, told the Daily Mail Online on Sunday that she is still not sure why the city employees quit. Her father, former city board member Simon Wofford, insists his daughter has a good relationship with the police department. KFVS-TV broke the story last week. Citizens rallied to Mrs Bryd's side, saying that the town didn't even need as many officers as it had. 'I think it was pretty dirty the way they all quit without giving her a chance, but I don't think they hurt the town with quitting because who needs six police for 740 people?' resident Martha Miller told KFVS. The run-down city, which is 175 miles south of St. Louis in southeastern Missouri, has suffered a spate of break-ins recently. Despite the surge in crime and the comparatively large police force, residents told the TV station that they almost never saw cops patrolling the streets. Mrs Byrd told Daily Mail Online that the election of the first African American mayor should be celebrated instead of focusing on the departures of city employees. Randall Ramsey, the outgoing mayor who has spent 36 years in the job, told the Daily Mail Online he also has no idea why the group quit.

"After years of negotiations, Stephen King's hit novel series The Dark Tower is on its way to big and small screens near you. The revered writer, who penned Shawshank Redemption and The Shining, slammed Warner Brothers in 2012 for dropping plans to make a movie trilogy and TV mini-series. Finally, three years later, things are back on track - this time with Sony. Finally: Stephen King has announced Sony will be putting his 'magnum opus' The Dark Tower in cinemas . These are just two of the eight novels which King spent over 40 years writing. The movie and TV version is said to mainly stem from the first novel, The Gunslinger (left), focusing on the lead character Roland . 'I'm excited that The Dark Tower is finally going to appear on the screen,' King said in a statement. 'Those who have traveled with Roland and his friends in their search for the Dark Tower are going to have their long-held hopes fully realized. This is a brilliant and creative approach to my books.' The eight-book series written between 1970 and 2012 follows a 'gunslinger' on his journey towards a tower. Describing his self-professed 'magnum opus', King said it combines the essences of the Wild West, science fiction, and Lord Of The Rings. Like J. R. R. Tolkien's celebrated trilogy, The Dark Tower has its own unique language. According to Deadline, the newfangled project has an entirely new script which focuses on the relationship between Roland and Jake in Gunslinger, the first book. A provisional script has been written by Akiva Goldsman (Cinderella Man) and Jeff Pinkner (Lost). Rumored leads: Javier Bardem (left) and Russell Crowe (right) are said to be interested in the lead role . Three years on, Javier Bardem and Russell Crowe are still rumored to be interested in the lead role.

"A young fisherman in Thailand reeled in the catch of the day after hooking a fish with a plastic toy fishing rod – but was the achievement just a hoax? Captured standing on the bank of what appears to be a lake, the youngster – with a big grin on his face – holds onto a tiny blue and yellow fishing rod. Approaching the water, the young boy reels rapidly, but at this point it isn’t clear whether or not he has hooked anything. The youngster stands on the bank of what appears to be a lake  and holds a tiny blue and yellow fishing rod . He then crouches down by the side of the water and moves his rod from side to side – tension on the end of it is now visible. Fighting against what may well be a weed, the young boy continues to reel and before long a fish breaks the surface of the water. As it splashes about, the youngster puts his hand into the lake and plucks it out. He then lays it on the floor before confidently putting his finger in its mouth, removing the hook and proudly lifting it up to the camera. The young Thai boy crouches down by the side of the water and moves his rod from side to side while reeling . Discussing the video with MailOnline, Nathan Wardle of Mega Fishing Thailand, said that the fish was most likely a Nile Tilapia, although it is hard to see exactly from the clip. He added: ‘They are found in almost every river, lake or pond right through the whole of Thailand and were introduced back in 1967 as a gift from Japan to the Thai King. ‘Many people farm them in small numbers in their ponds for food. The fry can be bought for about 8p each. ‘They are very popular stocked in fishing parks where they will cook your catch and small ones are used as bait for the big monster fish we have here. The fish breaks the surface of the water and the boy bravely puts his hand into the lake to catch it . The boy plucks the fish from the water, lays it on the floor and confidently puts his finger in its mouth to remove the hook . ‘They are also great table fish, served up in most restaurants. They have really tasty meat that can be fried, poached, roasted or barbecued and usually come with some kind of spicy Thai dipping sauce. ‘The fish eat pretty much anything so are fairly easy to catch with worms, bread, shrimps or squid and the like.’ Since it was uploaded, the video has been viewed over a million times and many people have commented to congratulate the youngster. However, there is a suggestion that the fish may have been hooked to the line before the start of the video. The youngster proudly holds his catch, which appears to be a Nile Tilapia, up to the camera .","The young boy holds a tiny  blue and yellow toy fishing rod .

"Disciplining a child for doing something wrong is a tricky business. Coming up with a punishment that will teach a son or daughter not to commit the crime again but isn't harsh enough to scar them for life is tough. Often, the best schemes are ones that embarrass a child so that they are too mortified to consider falling foul of their parents again. Choosing the right punishment for a naughty child is a difficult business (picture posed by model) Others that work very well include the mind-numbingly dull chores, which drag on for a lifetime. Some cunning parents take away their child's favourite possession, like a book or a teddy, while others resort to a lengthy lecture. One thing's for sure, when most parents put their mind to disciplining their child, a trip to the naughty step starts to look like a weekend a way at Butlins. Reddit users have been comparing the most effective punishments their parents doled out when they were children and many of the schemes are both hilarious and genius . Parents often struggle to find the balance between a punishment being effective and not too harsh (picture posed by model) One Reddit user's mother used her son's naughty behaviour as a cheap means to improve her house. Every time that he stepped out of line - she set him a DIY task in her garden. Douglerful said: 'My mom loves her garden, anytime I did anything to piss her off I had to add to her garden. When I told her I was failing English back in high school my punishment was to build her a pond - it took me a solid week of work to dig it out, line it, shape it, fill it and then plant [everything] around it. 'She told me after that, that she really hated the 30 year old cherry tree in the yard and if my grades didn't improve I'd be removing it.' It turns out quite a lot of parents use their back gardens to enact punishments onto their children - another adult reminisced about how they were put to task on the lawn with some scissors. Some parents task their children with cutting the lawn with scissors (picture posed by model) Other boring tasks included making a child write a letter or essay on what they did wrong. Watchyourback said: 'My mom made me write apology letters from when I was little up into high school. Not only did I hate writing them, but she kept all of them so now they're great for a laugh.' Many mothers and fathers use their child's favourite toy or book as a way to guarantee good behaviour in the future. A user who calls themself futureblackpopstar said: 'I have an older brother that loved to annoy me. 'One day I was a bad boy so my parents took away my gameboy and put my older brother in charge of it for 2 weeks - the torment was real.' Another person's mother took a more drastic approach, removing everything from her child's bedroom. A user called imnotacrazyperson said: 'When I was younger, I p***** off my mom pretty good and when I got home from school my bedroom was empty. She took everything out, my TV, VCR, clothes, even my pillow and sheets. 'I had to do chores and earn back everything bit by bit, one chore for each item. 'I started with my pillow, blankets, sheets, and clothes so I could sleep and go to school the next day. 'It took me nearly two weeks to get everything back - I tried pretty hard after that not to get on her bad side too much after that.' Many mothers and fathers use their child's favourite toy or book as a way to guarantee good behaviour in the future (picture posed by model) Some parents applied the same logic to their child's wardrobe, taking away all of their favourite clothing, so that they had to live in embarrassingly uncool clothes. One user wrote: 'My 7 year old daughter who loves fashion f***** up real bad one day - we had tried every standard punishment and nothing ever seemed to phase her. 'Then my husband had the idea to 'ground her from fashion' and we made her wear solid coloured T-shirts with plain jeans and trainers to school with no accessories for two weeks... that one got her attention.' Many parents like to adopt the tactic of embarrassing their child, especially when it comes to a punishment after someone has been caught shoplifting. One user said: 'The first and only time I stole something I was 13 and got caught at a bookstore in NYC for stealing a couple of DVDs. 'My dad walked me around the city for hours forcing me to tell strangers on the way that I was a thief and to tell them what I had done. 'Almost everyone he had me tell on the subways and buses/streets gave me mixed reactions and disapproval. Ill never steal again.' Often, the best schemes are ones that embarrass a child so that they are too mortified to consider falling foul of their parents again (picture posed by model) For some, the solution to a pair of children who won't stop arguing seems impossible, but some appear to have found a novel solution to making them get along - force them together. Knight0fSpadessaid: 'I have a friend who, whenever she would fight with her brother, her parents would make the go into the yard and hold hands for two hours.' Another pair of arguing siblings were even forced to wear the same item of clothing. jrwrenosaid: 'Me and my sister had to share a big shirt, just enough to fit us in, but tight enough to restrict our arm within the shirt. 'We had to depend on each other to get s*** done, because we both lost the use of one arm. 'It only took once wearing it out to the Church potluck to be permanently shamed into obedience.' While many parents have come up with ingenious ways to make their offspring toe the line, the prize for cleverest of all us to go to user sixth_in_line, who has come up with a brilliant trick to stop her niece from watching too much television. She wrote: 'I have her convinced that TVs get sick and that you have to read to them before they get better.'","Choosing the right punishment for a naughty child is a difficult business .

"A teacher in New Jersey who assigned her third-grade class to write 'get well' letters to a sick inmate convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer was suspended Friday, the school superintendent said. Orange School Superintendent Ronald Lee said in a statement that school administrators 'vehemently deny' any knowledge of Marilyn Zuniga's assignment. Preliminary inquiries found that Zuniga did not seek approval from administrators nor were parents notified, Lee said. The letters were delivered to Mumia Abu-Jamal in prison following his hospitalization last month for what his family said was treatment for complications from diabetes. Suspended: Marilyn Zuniga (left), a teacher at Forest Street School in Orange, New Jersey (right), controversially had her third graders write letters to Mumia Abu-Jamal and then sent them to the cop killer as he was recovering in hospital from collapsing in prison. She has now been suspended without pay, pending an investigation . Ill: Mumia's supporters say photos of the prison journalist released this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is. Untreated diabetes is said to be the reason for Abu-Jama's hospitalization last week, but he has since been released . The former Black Panther is serving life behind bars for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he is the victim of a racist justice system. A supporter and history professor at Baruch College, Johanna Fernandez, brought him the letters. She posted on her Facebook page that 'he chuckled as he read excerpts from these touching letters'. Abu-Jamal was released from a hospital in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, on April 1, and returned to the prison, she said. The school district was closed for spring break and the superintendent said a full investigation would begin when classes resume on Monday. Zuniga will remain suspended without pay until the investigation is completed, the superintendent said. Additional action could be taken by the school board once the investigation is finished. An email The Associated Press sent Zuniga seeking comment was not immediately returned. A second batch of students, from the  the Philadelphia Student Union, also sent Abu-Jama letters. 'Get well soon': Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union have sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . Delivery: Johanna Fernandez (right), a professor of history at Baruch College, delivered Mumia Abu-Jamal a batch of letters from two different schools in hospital. He is pictured here also with (from left) Abdu Jon and Pam Africa . 'We shared a touching moment with Mumia in an effort to raise his spirits,' Fernandez reported. 'Two teachers delivered letters to us that their students had written to Mumia.' 'It had been a long time since we had seen Mumia smile.' A picture of some of the letters appeared online, however it is unclear what they actually said. However the fact they were written and then presented to Abu-Jamal has infuriated many. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. 'I think it's both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Costello told Fox News. 'He shot (the officer) in the back and then as the officer lay slumped against a wall helpless he leaned over and shot him between the eyes. 'When he was in the hospital he actually bragged about it.' Costello said all the teachers involved in the letter writing campaign should be fired. 'Furthermore all the parents who have children in that school system need to reevaluate that involvement, because these children are now placed in danger by the very people charged with their education,' Costello said. 'They are being used as tools in someone's twisted agenda.' Hospitalized: Convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal was placed in the critical care unit of a Pennsylvania hospital last week after collapsing in prison . Costello has previously described Abu-Jamal as 'the devil'. Abu-Jamal is thought to have collapsed in prison due to high blood sugar levels. Attorney Bret Grote with the Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center said last week that his client was placed in the critical care unit of Schuylkill Medical Center in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Grote says neither he nor Abu-Jamal's brother, Keith Cook, had been allowed in to see him. 'We're concerned, about as concerned as it gets, about Mumia's health,' Grote told the Philadelphia Inquirer. A Pennsylvania Department of Corrections official also declined to provide details. A spokesman for Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center says he had no information about Abu-Jamal. 'We never discuss an inmate's medical condition,' deputy press secretary Susan Bensinger told the Inquirer. Mumia's hospitalization was revealed Monday when a group of his friends arrived to the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy for a visit and were informed by prison staff that he wasn't there. While Grote and others had permission with the prison to visit Mumia, the hospital had not yet cleared them. Grote said he hoped the matter would be cleared up by Tuesday. Abu-Jamal is a former Black Panther serving life in prison for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. Treated: Lawyers with Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center say prison officials told them Mumia was being treated last week at Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center (pictured). He has since been released . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Mumia's death sentence was overturned in 2012. Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France.

"A Missouri family has bee reunited 49 years after a mother was falsely told her daughter had died at the hospital just hours after being born. For the first time, Zella Jackson Price, 76, and Melanie Diane Gilmore, 49, met in-person at Price's Olivette home. When Price gave birth at Homer G. Phillips Hospital so many years ago, she was told shortly after delivery that the infant had died. But Gilmore was alive and for an unknown reason adopted by another family. Scroll down for video . Zella Jackson Price (pictured), 76,  was told shortly after delivering her baby that the infant had died. But the baby was still very much alive and had for an unknown reason been given up for adoption . Melanie Diane Gilmore, 49, has been reunited with her mother after 49 years. Her children helped her find her mother through a name given to Gilmore through her adoptive parents . Price and Gilmore immediately embraced when the daughter arrived at her mother's house in Olivette, Missouri . 'I'm so elated. I'm just hugging her and there's such a big family. She didn't know she had so many people here in St. Louis,' she said. Price told Daily Mail Online that when she was still in the hospital ward, she was told by doctors her baby, which was prematurely born, had died. The details she was given were very vague, and she said she was told the baby's twin had died, too, even though she had only had a single-child birth. The hospital had a big maternity ward, she said, adding that she had seen women nursing the wrong babies while she was there. 'There's a lot of information they should have given me,' Price said. 'I still have a lot of questions.' Friends of Gilmore's foster parents revealed to Price this week that her daughter had spent six months in an incubator before being taken to the family who adopted her. Her foster parents have since died, but Price said it was heartwarming to know that she grew up in a good home. 'She ended up in a family of love. They cared for her so much,' Price said. Gilmore, who lost her hearing when she was three years old after a childhood illness, said meeting her biological mother - her father has passed away - is something she's wanted for a long time. Price and Gilmore exchanged many hugs and said they loved one another during their first in-person meeting . 'I'm just so happy... very excited,' she told KTVI. Gilmore's four children knew about their mother's wish and researched a name that Gilmore was given from her adoptive parents. They eventually came across Zella Price. Price received a text message from one of Gilmore's four children at 4am several weeks ago, something she 'will never forget'. 'She texted me a messaged asking if I was her grandmother. I said, ""Why do you think that"", and she started asking questions and asked if I had given birth on November 25 - which I had,' Price said. The mother and daughter eventually video chatted on Oovoo and the pair did a DNA test and confirmed Price was Gilmore's mother. And then they decided to meet in person. On the day she met her mother, Gilmore was also able to meet her biological brother Harvey, who picked her and her own daughter and son up at Lamber-St. Louis International Airport. The family had flown from Oregon. Gilmore also had a chance to meet her biological brother Harvey, who picked Gilmore and her children up from the airport . When the mother and daughter finally came face-to-face, they hugged for several moments and said they loved each other. 'There was a bond that automatically started when we saw each other,' Price said. She added that she has been hurt by the separation and is relieved to have a new start. '(God) has given me everything the devil has taken from me,' Price, an accomplished gospel singer, told KTVI. 'I'm getting it back. I'm getting my baby back.' Price said that Gilmore's kids told her they hadn't ever seen her as happy as she was when she arrived in St. Louis to meet her biological mother. 'She's been dancing and all of her comedy and laughter has come out,' Price said. 'We're all so happy.' The family will soon begin an investigation into what happened at the hospital the day Gilmore was born. Price has hired an attorney to help with the process. But for now, they celebrate being a family once again. 'There’s nothing greater. There’s nothing greater than this. Nothing,' Price said. Price (center) said that she's looking forward to having a second chance at forming a relationship with her daughter, who she thought had died nearly 50 years ago .","Zella Jackson Price of Olivette, Missiouri, gave birth to her baby 49 years ago .

"While Indonesia's plan to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan has not dented Australian tourist visits to the island, a proposed alcohol ban could. The number of Australians visiting Bali over the past two months was up 16.7 per cent from the same period last year, with more arriving than any other nationality. Indonesia Institute president Ross Taylor says it is unfortunate the fate of Bali Nine drug smugglers is probably third on the list of concerns about Indonesia among fellow nationals. A proposed ban on alcohol in Indonesia could deter Australians from holidaying in Bali . An Indonesia expert says Australian tourists are more worried about a proposed booze ban there than the execution of the Bali Nine pair, Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) Mr Taylor says legislation proposed by two Islamic parties banning consumption of all beverages containing more than one per cent alcohol is considered more of a worry, and could become law as early as the end of this year if backed by President Joko Widodo. Also of concern is a review of foreign property ownership. Mr Taylor said mini marts would be the initial focus of the alcohol ban, which would be broadened but not apply to certain locations to protect tourism, such as five-star hotels. He said the proposal had 'horrified' authorities in Bali. Mini marts would be the initial focus of the alcohol ban, which would be broadened but not apply to certain locations to protect tourism, such as five-star hotels . 'My own view would be that common sense would prevail... but I'd be cautious in saying that because there are some of the more pronounced religious groups throughout Indonesia really gaining momentum now,' Mr Taylor told AAP. 'In Aceh, they've introduced Sharia law. Very strictly. Even foreigners can be arrested in Aceh for not dressing appropriately.' Mr Taylor said nationalist sentiment was running high, with Indonesian authorities reviewing every property to ascertain whether it was being held on behalf of a foreigner. 'A lot of them are,' he said. 'The state will either resume that property or offer the nominee the option of just keeping it for themselves, with no legal comeback from the foreign owner. 'So if you take that and the alcohol thing I think it's really symptomatic of a disturbing trend - and Indonesia is a country that stole my heart so I'm not anti-Indonesia - of the Jokowi government showing all the signs of being naive, dysfunctional and lost at the moment. 'Just drifting off into thought bubbles.'","A proposed ban on alcohol in Indonesia could deter Australians from Bali .

"The shadow chancellor refused to rule out a five-point rise in corporation tax . Ed Balls yesterday opened the door to a tax raid on businesses, which critics warn would endanger the economic recovery. In a TV interview, the shadow chancellor refused to rule out a five-point rise in the main rate of corporation tax if Labour form the next government. He was also evasive about the 40p rate of income tax, into which millions of people have been dragged in recent years, saying he was unsure how quickly the threshold could be raised. Businesses are already concerned about Labour’s stated plans not to cut corporation tax – paid by all large firms on their profits – as the Tories have vowed to if they win office. The main rate has been brought down under the Coalition from 28 per cent to 21 per cent. Asked if he would raise it, Mr Balls would only commit to keeping the main rate ‘the lowest in the G7’ group of countries. This leaves room to raise it up to 26.5 per cent, the level which is imposed in Canada. When it was suggested Labour could levy a rate of ‘24 per cent or 25 per cent’, he did not rule it out, simply saying: ‘We need to make sure we back businesses ... we will keep our rates low.’ John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, warned last week that Labour’s plans to intervene in markets, such as the energy market, and their ‘signals on corporation tax are a cause for concern’. He added that any rise in business taxes would ‘undermine progress to make the whole tax system more competitive and send the wrong signal to firms of all sectors and sizes.’ Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said the prospect of a business tax rise was a ‘clear threat to working people’s future economic security’. He said: ‘It’s clear Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are leaving the door open to a damaging tax rise that risks costing jobs, risks costing investment and risks the economic recovery.’ The Right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies think-tank has said raising corporation tax to 24 per cent gradually over the next five years would cost nearly 100,000 jobs by the end of the Parliament. Labour say by keeping corporation tax at the current rate, they can freeze business rates for 1.5million small firms. The main rate has been brought down from 28 per cent to 21 per cent under the coalition with the Tories vowing to lower corporation tax if they win the Election . Lloyds bank shares on offer for all . Billions of pounds of shares in Lloyds bank will be sold off to the public at a discount rate within a year . Billions of pounds of shares in Lloyds bank will be sold off to the public at a discount rate within a year, David Cameron pledged yesterday. In the latest Tory attempt to revive the free market spirit of the 1980s, millions of small investors willing to spend £250 or more would be given priority access to shares still owned from the 2008 bank bailout. If the party wins the election, the sale would begin with a publicity drive similar to the ‘Tell Sid’ adverts that pushed the 1986 privatisation of British Gas. The plan would see up to £4billion of Lloyds shares sold off at a discount of at least 5 per cent, with individual investors allowed to spend up to £10,000. To counter any claims of a ‘get rich quick’ sell-off, buyers who keep the shares for a year would be rewarded with a loyalty bonus of one extra free share for every ten they hold. The sale would also recoup billions for the Exchequer to pay off some of the country’s vast national debts. Yesterday the Prime Minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show this would be the first time there had been such an offer for individual investors. ‘The taxpayer put billions into these banks and I want to get the money back,’ he said. ‘At the same time I think having people being able to own shares in a healthy, successful British bank is the sort of country we should be building.’ Labour said the Tories had announced the sell-off policy seven times already – including before the last election. Lib Dem Danny Alexander said the idea had been rejected over the past five years ‘because it’s not been clear that we’d be able to get the money back for the taxpayer’. Lloyds was bailed out with £20billion of taxpayers’ money in 2008, leaving it 43 per cent state owned. The Government still owns £12.5billion of shares, which were worth 78.7p each on Friday – compared to the 73.6p paid by Gordon Brown.","Shadow chancellor refused to rule out a five-point rise in corporation tax .

A traditional wedding march played as the love-struck pooches were led down the aisle by their owners to ‘exchange vows’ and receive marriage certificates, according to the People’s Daily Online. Love-struck pooches were led up the aisle by owners to ‘exchange vows’ and receive marriage certificates . Canine couples arrived in BMW convertibles and, in one case, a stretch Hummer limousine . Forty-two dogs tied the knot at the wedding, which is complete with tulle wedding dresses and celebrity owners . No expense was spared for the special occasion, as the 21 canine couples arrived in BMW convertibles and a stretch Hummer limousine. Organisers set up lavish flower arches and banquet tables in the park, where the couples showed off their outfits. One pet owner who attended the wedding, Ms Li, said: ‘I have attended many weddings before, but this is the first time I've ever been to such a large scale collective pet wedding. ‘Looking at these lovely pets getting married and listening to their stories, I was really moved.’ One owner said this was the first collective pet wedding for her and she was really moved by the scene . Organisers said the wedding was designed to give pets and their owners a day to remember . The ceremony was also designed to raise awareness of animal rights, said the organiser . Organiser Zhang Zhongsham, CEO of pet social media app Smack Talk, said the event was designed not only to give pets and their owners a day to remember, but also to raise awareness of animal rights. He said: ‘The idea of a collective wedding came about from our previous communication and research with users. ‘This is our first try and we want to take the opportunity to continually promote the development of the pet industry, improve the social lives of our pets and allow them to enjoy egalitarian treatment to that of mankind.’ Among the guests were Chinese Olympic gymnast and gold medallist Teng Haibin, who married off his pet. The organiser Smack Talk, which is available in Simplified Chinese on iPhone and Android, allows pets to have their own social media profile page and aims to get pets ‘speaking’ via their owners. The app has gained millions of users in three months . Chinese Olympic gymnast and gold medallist Teng Haibin (centre) also married off his pet .

"'Floral perfumes can take years off a woman' Two things in life give me instant gratification: perfume and wine gums. But while one rots my teeth and piles on the pounds, the other - no matter how bad my hair day - makes me feel beautiful. I'm in good company. Cleopatra was known for her love of perfume, liberally applying lotus and rose oil to her upper lip. 'We know she made her own perfumes and would certainly have worn it to increase her powers of seduction,' says Mandy Aftel, perfume historian and author of Fragrant: The Secret Life Of Scent. 'She didn't solely rely on her looks. Cleopatra believed that smelling divine was the real key to a man's heart,' she says. And according to scientists, Cleopatra was right. Perfume really can make us more attractive. 'Humans are mammals and though we're highly evolved, we have inherited mating mechanisms from the animal kingdom. One of the factors that influences our partner choice is smell,' says Tim Jacob, emeritus professor at the School of Biosciences at Cardiff University. We react in an involuntary way to smell because our noses are connected to synapses in the unconscious part of the brain (the piriform cortex), which governs the subconscious mind. 'The power of the subconscious mind is extremely strong. If we like someone's smell, they become instantly more attractive to us, and vice versa,' says Roja Dove, master perfumer at Urban Retreat Perfumerie in Harrods. Small wonder, then, that perfumers spend vast amounts of time and money creating fragrances that evoke positive feelings of satisfaction and sensuality. And there are ingredients with a proven track record of evoking other strong subconscious reactions. Perfumers spend vast amounts of time and money creating fragrances that evoke positive feelings of satisfaction and sensuality . 'Vanilla, an ingredient in many perfumes, is a smell that's strongly associated with pleasure,' says Professor Jacob. 'Just think of confectionery and the feelings of happiness that go with traditional childhood treats.' Lavender, another common ingredient in perfume, has been shown to calm and soothe the mind, while citrus smells evoke images of health and cleanliness. So powerful is our unconscious reaction to smell that perfumers claim wearing certain scents will make a woman seem younger, more athletic or even slimmer than she actually is. So what are the perfect perfumes to make others think we're slim, sexy, sporty or sophisticated? Harrods' Roja Dove picks his favourites . . . FLIRT WITH FLORALS . Floral perfumes can take years off a woman, as long as the smell is subtle. However, if it's cloying or overpowering, the effect can be ageing. Anything that overwhelms our senses can begin to smell stale and musty, and these are scents that the unconscious mind associates with age. Vivacious yet subtle scents of peony, lily of the valley and orange blossom will evoke images of spring and youth. Perfumes such as Balenciaga's Florabotanica (£56, Debenhams) or Love Story from Chloe (£65, Debenhams) use floral notes that create an impression of youthful energy. They're flirty and fun, like actresses Helen Mirren and Felicity Kendal. RAMP UP YOUR SEX APPEAL . Vanilla is an aphrodisiac that enhances sensations of pleasure across the central nervous system. Therefore, it's no wonder that so many perfumes use vanilla as a base note. Perfumes with a bright, breezy, citrus scent evoke images of health, youth and the outdoors . Applied to the nape of the neck or dabbed lightly behind the ears, the smell is intensely seductive. For serious sex appeal you need a slightly heavier scent, one which comes from the perfume group we call the Orientals. These are perfumes based on vanilla with touches of sandalwood, patchouli or coumarin, which is found in conker beans. The fragrances are sensual - they speak of arousal and passion. Think rich, luxuriant velvet as opposed to bright, clean cotton. Try Guerlain's Shalimar, (£62, John Lewis), L'Ambre Des Merveilles by Hermes (£82, House of Fraser) or Armani's Si (£64, John Lewis) for a date night your husband won't forget. WAFT AWAY THE YEARS . Perfumes with a bright, breezy, citrus scent evoke images of health, youth and the outdoors. Lemon has long been associated with a fresh, youthful vivacity, so perfumes with citrus notes combined with florals will have associations of vigour and energy. Opt for perfumes such as Tom Ford's Private Blend White Suede (£142, John Lewis) or Givenchy's Dahlia Noir (£63, Boots) to knock the pounds off in an instant. You may never run a marathon, but you'll smell like someone who does (in a good way). SMART AND SASSY AROMAS . If you've got a tricky meeting or job interview, you'll want to appear calm, competent and chic. The fragrance equivalent of an exquisitely tailored Chanel suit is a perfume from the Chypre family. This group of fragrances is blended with uncompromising clarity, made up primarily of woody scents: juniper, cedarwood and bergamot and citrus top notes. Nearly 80 per cent of women who use fragrance own two to ten bottles . Cartier's Eau De Cartier (£46, House of Fraser) or Bottega Veneta Essence Aromatique (£60, John Lewis) are perfect examples of understated statement perfumes. If a perfume can make you appear to be the sort of person who reads Proust at bedtime rather than Hello! magazine, it's going to be one of these. GIVE YOURSELF A MOOD LIFT . Clean, energising citrus notes with hints of healing, soothing jasmine and lavender work best to dispel gloom, spread joy and your spirits. These scents have been shown to have anti-depressant and rebalancing effects. It really is true that a little lavender essence sprinkled on your pillow at night will help you sleep peacefully, leaving you calm and re-energised for the day ahead. Try Clarins' Eau Dynamisante (£39, John Lewis), Fendi's L'Aquarossa (£64, Harrods) or, for a really lovely lavender feel, Marc Jacobs' Daisy Eau So Fresh (£72, Debenhams).","According to scientists, perfume really can make us more attractive .

"Just weeks after he controversially banned meat products from being sold at the Sydney Opera House during his upcoming shows there, Morrissey has once again weighed into Australian animal rights issues. The singer, who will be performing four sold-out shows as part of the Sydney Vivid Live festival in May, has written a public letter to The Just Group imploring them to cease their use of angora wool. The Australian retail giant, who own Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jacqui E, and Jay Jays, have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur. Warning: graphic content . New campaign: Morrissey has written a letter to Australian retailer The Just Group imploring them to stop the use of angora wool . Brutal: PETA have successfully petitioned a number of Australian and international retailers to stop selling angora wool after revealing the horrific treatment of rabbits at Chinese angora farms . PETA Australia has been petitioning The Just Group to reconsider their position after successfully getting other retailers, including David Jones, Myer, Sportsgirl, General Pants Co, and Jeanswest, to stop selling angora. 'I'm looking forward to my concerts at the Sydney Opera House in May, but I was extremely dismayed to learn from my friends at PETA Australia that The Just Group refuse to modernise and drop angora wool from their clothing lines', Morrissey writes. 'By selling angora wool, you're sending the message to millions of shoppers that your company condone the barbaric abuse and slaughter of rabbits and are willing to perpetuate it.' Refusal: The Just Group, who own Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jacqui E, and Jay Jays, have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur . Stance: The retailer has previously issued a statement on the controversy, simply saying: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group' The singer, 55, added that he would post petitions for concertgoers to sign at information booths throughout the Opera House if the company did not reverse their decision. Globally, major fashion chains including Zara, H&M, Marks & Spencer, and Gap have all pledged to not use the fur in recent years after PETA outed the heartbreaking conditions of angora rabbits. The organisation revealed the treatment of rabbits on angora farms in China, where workers rip the fur from live rabbits' skin. PETA alleges that the rabbits 'scream in pain' during the process. The Just Group are yet to respond to Daily Mail Australia's request for comment, however a spokesperson has previously responded to PETA with the statement: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group.' In February, Morrissey made headline when he ordered all food and bar outlets linked to the Opera House's Concert Hall remove meat products from their menus for the duration of his residency. Additionally, the former Smiths singer, who has been a non-meat eater since the age of 11, ordered that only vegetarian food be served backstage at the venue. Protest: Morrissey, 55, pledged to set up petition booths for attendees at his Sydney concerts to sign if The Just Group do not comply . The  Irish-born star, who says he sees 'no difference' between eating animals and paedophilia, they are both rape, violence, murder, -  will take to the stage during the festival of light and music on the 26th, 27th, 30th and 31st of May. Morrissey has never been shy about his views on meat eaters and has categorically said 'If I'm introduced to anyone who eats beings, I walk away.' He briefly walked off-stage at Coachella in 2009, complaining about the smell from the nearby food concession area, saying 'The smell of burning animals is making me sick'. Last month he banned burgers and hot dogs from Belfast's the Odyssey Arena for his performance. And he recently ditched a scheduled concert in Iceland when the venue refused to grant his no meat requests the night of his gig. In concert: The Irish-born musician has also banned the sale of meat products at the Opera House for the duration of his residency for the Vivid festival in May . Last year, during a Q&A session on his fan site, True To You, he replied to a groupie's question saying: 'I see no difference between eating animals and paedophilia... 'Imagine, for example, if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you ""Hello, I enjoy bloodshed, throat-slitting and the destruction of life,"" well, I doubt if you'd want to exchange phone numbers.' In another post, he wrote of TV chef Jamie Oliver: 'If Jamie 'Orrible is so certain that flesh-food is tasty then why doesn't he stick one of his children in a microwave?' The animal activist is equally known for his outspoken political views and hatred of the British monarchy. He once said in an outspoken interview in 1984 of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: 'She is only one person. She can be destroyed. It is the only remedy for this country at the moment.' British police responded by searching Morrissey's home and carrying out an official investigation. Daily Mail Australia have contacted The Just Group for comment.","Morrissey wrote a letter to Australian retailer The Just Group .

I never knew that I would have a chance to choose from possibly the best schools from the world. I was hoping to get into at least one of the Ivy Leagues.' Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn, Yale and Princeton have all come knocking. He had only held out hopes of hearing from one of them but has also heard from 10 other prestigious institutions.

"A 19-year-old woman is wanted by police after video appeared online this week, showing the teenager hitting and running over a rival with her car in a ruthless street fight. Grand Rapids, Michigan Police have an arrest warrant out for suspect Jalin Smith-Walker in connection to the Monday evening fight, but as of Thursday morning authorities say they are still attempting to locate the young woman. And this isn't the first time that Smith-Walker has been accused of wreaking havoc with her car.

Monday evening's incident was captured on video by a bystander who uploaded the shocking clip to the website World Star Hip Hop. It shows Smith-Walker and the victim, an unidentified fellow 19-year-old, throwing up fists in the middle of a street in Muskegon, Michigan - coaxed on by a small crowd surrounding them. The fight starts off with a few punches, and moves to the two girls brawling on a car. When friends try to intervene, others tell them to give the girls space so they can continue fighting it out. Punches thrown: A bystander recorded this video of the fight between Smith-Walker (right) and an unidentified 19-year-old opponent that happened in a street of Muskegon, Michigan Monday evening .

That's when her victim grabs what looks to be a log and throws it on Smith-Walker's windshield as she is backing out of her parking spot. Bystanders emit loud shrieks as Smith-Walker is then seen speeding forward with her car, knocking the victim onto the asphalt and running her over before speeding down the street. The clips ends with the victim in dumbstruck horror, helpless on the street as bystanders rush to her aid. Repeat offender? This isn't the first time Smith-Walker has had a run-in with the law regarding her car. In December she was arrested for dragging a mall security officer several feet when he tried to stop her and a friend on suspicion of shoplifting from the denim store Buckle. Smith-Walker pictured above in photos posted to her Facebook . The unidentified victim was treated for a leg injury at the hospital and has since been released to recover at home.

As of Thursday morning, Grand Rapids Sgt Terry Dixon told Daily Mail Online they are still attempting to locate the suspect. Police aren't sure what sparked the fight, but say it appears the two girls involved used to be friends. 'It ultimately ended with blows being thrown,' Sgt Dixon told MLive. 'It's very unfortunate.' This is apparently the second arrest for Smith-Walker in recent months for a crime involving her car.

Smith-Walker was driving and Johnson was in the driver's side back seat. Authorities say Johnson shut her door on the guard's left arm as he tried to reach inside the vehicle and Smith-Walker started driving as he was still connected to the car. The guard eventually freed his arm and the young women were arrested not far away from the shopping center. They were charged with unarmed robbery. The guard in that incident sustained minor injuries but did not need to be treated at the hospital.","Police are still attempting to locate suspect Jalin Smith-Walker, 19 .

"When you're a Barbie girl in an Instagram world, life in plastic isn't just fantastic - it also gets you more than 730,000 followers. Since Barbie's style Instagram account launched last August, swarms of fashion lovers have become fans of her 'official style feed', watching as the Mattel icon models an impressive collection of Barbie clothes that even includes pieces by top designers. Racked recently got the behind-the-scenes scoop on all the outfit changes, international trips, and VIP invites that go into producing the doll's hugely popular page. Pretty popular: Barbie's style-centric Instagram account, @BarbieStyle, is painstakingly planned - and now has three quarters of a million followers . Wow-worthy wardrobe: Barbie has 'thousands' of pieces, most of which are one-of-a-kind and made especially for her Instagram account by the brand's director of design . The idea for  Barbie's fashion-focused Instagram page came to be when Barbie's vice president of design, Kim Culmone, realized that in addition to the official @Barbie account - which promotes the brand's products - the doll could also be presented in a more editorial way, taking inspiration from fashion magazines. The page for @BarbieStyle, she told Racked, tells the story of Barbie's role in pop culture today as a 'contemporary girl with an aspirational lifestyle'. Unlike the main Barbie account that targets children and parents, @BarbieStyle aims to attract trendy twentysomethings - so instead of mermaid and princess costumes, followers get fashion-forward outfits 'firmly rooted in reality'. Along with Barbie director of design Robert Best and Zlatan Zukanovic, the account's creative and photography lead, Ms. Culmone soon grew @BarbieStyle to have even more fans than the original @Barbie page, which has 434,000 followers. Chic at Coachella: Barbie travels to buzzed-about events like Coachella, pictured here, with friends, Ken, and sometimes even her dog . Fashion week regular: The @BarbieStyle account captioned this photo in front of the London Eye: 'Just landed in London...the best way to cure jet lag? Hit the city for the sights and fresh air!' Total jetsetter: The account's creators really pose Barbie in front of famous landmarks - not pictures or green screens - including Notre-Dame, left, and La Belle Epoque restaurant, right, in Paris . But @BarbieStyle doesn't just have more followers than @Barbie - this doll also has a much more glamorous life, juggling trips to Paris with shopping sprees rather than multiple careers as an astronaut, pastry chef, and lifeguard. She also has an entourage to take her wherever she goes. Some combination of Ms. Culmone, Mr. Best, and Mr. Zukanovic travel to each location that Barbie visits, including London, Paris, and New York for Fashion week, California for Coachella, and Miami, Florida for Art Basel. Once she arrives, Barbie gets the star treatment: Mr. Best creates almost every one-of-a-kind piece Barbie wears and uses a professional camera, not a smartphone, to take the shots. 'She travels with an entire wardrobe,' Ms. Culmone said. 'Thousands of accessories! Ken and her friends and her puppy come too - she does have an entourage.' Mr. Best added: 'We pretend she’s a little person going to do all these things, so we think, ""How would she do them? What would she wear? What would her point of view be?"" If Barbie’s like our celebrity and we’re her team, you don’t want her to falter!' Party hopping: This photo of Barbie in a glamorous gown was captioned: 'Kicking off this #GoldenGlobes weekend at the #WMagShootingStars event. Thanks for having me @wmag & @hugoboss! [sic]' Moschino model: @BarbieStyle caption this photo: 'It’s @Moschino mania! A few of my favorite looks from the Spring/Summer 2015 collection by @itsjeremyscott [sic].' Trendy toy: @BarbieStyle 'called in a professional' when Rachel Zoe appeared on the doll's account, left; @BarbieStyle also posts photos of only clothing an accessories, like this lookalike Dior bag, right . The trio even has a PR firm, KCD, to organize event invitations and requests to dress Barbie. 'You have the same kind of conversations you would have if this were a celebrity,' said Mr. Zukanovic. One notable designer to style Barbie is Moschino's Jeremy Scott. In fact, his spring/summer 2015 collection included a range of Barbie-inspired outfits, and he has dressed the doll for several photos on the @BarbieStyle Instagram account. Karl Lagerfeld, Rachel Zoe, and fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni have also appeared on the page. 'It brightens people's days because it's so silly and it’s so fun and it’s so different from anything you see out there,' Mr. Zukanovic said.","The account's creators have made 'thousands' of one-of-a-kind pieces for the iconic doll .

"Loneliness is often associated with elderly people who may have lost their partner or feel isolated because they're less mobile. But a new report released today reveals that it is in fact younger people who feel more lonely than older generations - despite being more connected to their friends online. The survey, funded by the Big Lottery, found that more than 80 per cent of young people feel lonely at some point. Scroll down for video . Chloe Jackson, 19, appeared on today's This Morning to talk about how Facebook makes her feel lonely . The research revealed that half of those aged 55 and over said they never felt lonely. In comparison, 43 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds admitted they wished they had more friends. A third of the under 34-year-olds said they found it hard to make new friends and they didn't know how to form new friendships. Many admitted they were more likely to interact with friends online than face-to-face and that seeing what their friends were up to via social media sites like Facebook increased their feelings of isolation. One young person who feels this way is Chloe Jackson, 19, from Norfolk, who appeared on today's This Morning to discuss the issue. She told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that she often feels lonely thanks to websites like Facebook. She said: 'You look at all the things your friends are doing on social media where they have checked into a pub and tagged their friends or shared pictures of themselves out having fun and you're sat at home not there. 'During my A levels I spent lot time inside revising but you still see all these people having fun without you and it's hard not to take that personally.' Ruth, 54, agreed that this contrasted with her experience growing up as 'when we were young, if you weren't invited to a party you didn't know about it.' Chloe added that people often create an online persona that doesn't reflect how they are really feeling and as a result, she often feels under pressure to do the same. She said: 'It makes you feel down all the time you are expected to be massive happy person like you are on social media, you start doubting the friends you have got. I have 1000 friends on Facebook but I don't have 1,000 friends in real life.' Chloe said Facebook often made her feel like she was left out of the fun her friends were having . This Morning's agony aunt Denise Robertson advised people to be proactive if they are feeling lonely. She suggested they join more groups, take up a new hobby or organise an event like a coffee morning in order to meet more friends. She said: 'Friendship like love does not climb in your window, if you don't go out, you won't find it.' The Big Lottery funded survey was carried out to promote 'The Big Lunch', an idea from the Eden Project encouraging people across the UK to have lunch with their neighbours on the first Sunday in June in an act of community, friendship and fun. In 2014, 4.83 million people took to their streets, gardens and community spaces for the sixth annual Big Lunch.","Younger people feeling lonelier than older generations according to report .

"The state of Oklahoma has removed protection for gay people who use ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft. Initially, the Oklahoma Transportation Network Company Services Act included language that prohibited the companies from discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation or gender identity. However, Sen. Jason Smalley has revealed he rewrote the bill to eliminate that language and allow private businesses to establish their own policies regarding discrimination. Controversy: Uber drivers in Oklahoma now have a right to refuse gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender customers who use the ride-sharing app . 'I believe if a private business owner wants to serve or not serve an individual, they have that purview right now,' said Smalley, a Republican. The new version of the bill faced fierce criticism from Sen. John Sparks, a Norman Democrat who tried unsuccessfully to amend the measure. He attempted to add requirements that any driver who wishes to discriminate against a customer based on sexual orientation or gender identity must advertise their intent on their vehicle and on the company's website. 'Why should you be able to discriminate?' Sparks said. 'We're talking about a level of civil conduct in the marketplace. Society has figured out that when you enter the marketplace, you should have an expectation of being treated fairly.' Uber and Lyft, among the most popular ridesharing programs, already have policies in place that prohibit discrimination against customers based on sexual orientation or gender identity. 'Uber's policy is to serve every neighborhood, every driver and every person who needs a ride,' company spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin said. Rewritten: Republican Sen. Jason Smalley (pictured) rewrote the bill to give drivers the option to discriminate . The company will continue to enforce its current terms of service, 'which make clear that discrimination in any form is not tolerated and will result in removal from the platform,' she said. Troy Stevenson, executive director of Freedom of Oklahoma, said in a statement that the group does not 'understand why a member of the Oklahoma Legislature wants to remove protections for [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] Oklahomans from a bill that is specific to an industry that already protects them, in their corporate policies. Oklahomans do not believe in discrimination, and it is time for ideological law makers to quit trying to distract from the real problems of our state by attacking the LGBT community.'","Initially, the Transport bill included language that protected LGBT users .
But Senator Jason Smalley rewrote the bill to allow drivers to discriminate ."
"More than 70,000 people across the world have signed a petition demanding McDonald's remove spikes that deter the homeless from sleeping outside one of its restaurants. The fast food giant has caused fury after installing metal studs outside its branch in Leeds city centre, which critics say are there to stop people  sleeping rough. McDonald's has defended the use of the spikes, claiming they were installed two years ago in an attempt to stop anti-social behaviour, not target the homeless. Uproar: A petition has been started to get the spikes removed from outside this Leeds McDonald's and 70,000 have backed the campaign . But critics say they have been put in because they are uncomfortable to sleep on and installed on areas which used to be benches. Isobella DeMartino set up the petition to have them removed and has received support from across the globe. Row: Critics say the spikes were installed to target the homeless but McDonald's say it is only about anti-social behaviour . 'Anti-homeless spikes show complete disregard and lack of respect for homeless people who struggle every day,' she said. 'Spikes have been installed, presumably to prevent people sleeping there.

She added: 'Every time I'm in Leeds I see many ignore homeless people, not even bothering to smile at them let alone try to help them or give charity.

"The future of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent sparked a bitter war of words yesterday. Tories claimed Russian leader Vladimir Putin would be happy with Ed Miliband as prime minister because he cannot be trusted to keep our Trident submarines. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon led a ferocious assault on the Labour leader – claiming he is a 'backstabber' who cannot be trusted not to sell out in a 'grubby' deal with the SNP. Scroll down for video . Tories also pointed to a survey suggesting up to three-quarters of Labour election candidates oppose the replacement of Trident. Business and skills minister Nick Boles, a close ally of David Cameron, went further, claiming the Russian president would be pleased to see Mr Miliband enter Downing Street propped up by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. 'Ask yourself this. Who does Vladimir Putin want to see running Britain after May 7?' Mr Boles demanded. 'Answer: the man who abandoned the Syrians to their fate and the woman who wants to scrap our nuclear deterrent. He… stood alongside Putin in protecting [Syrian President] Assad.' Mr Miliband reacted with fury to the attacks, accusing the Tories of 'desperate smears' and dragging the election campaign 'into the gutter' by claiming he would 'stab the UK in the back' in the same way that he did brother David in the Labour leadership contest. 'David Cameron should be ashamed,' Mr Miliband said, insisting that Labour was committed to renewing the Trident fleet. But Mr Fallon's promise to renew all four submarines appeared to leave Labour in disarray. Mr Fallon said the full replacement of Trident would be a 'red line' in any second Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. 'I want to see multilateral disarmament, I'm not in favour of unilateral disarmament. That means we have got to have the least cost deterrent that we can have.' - Ed Miliband, January 5 . 'We're going to see whether there's any way you could do it with three [submarines].' - Ed Balls, March 15 . '[Four submarines] is exactly the policy that we have had for a very long time.' - Chris Leslie, Wednesday . 'Four boats... but we'll look at that in government.' - Douglas Alexander, yesterday . 'It's right to have a review because technology changes.' - Ed Miliband, yesterday . For Labour, however, frontbenchers gave differing positions. Some suggested a Labour government might cut the number of submarines. Mr Miliband said he favoured 'basically four boats' but it was 'right to have a review' while Labour treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said that maintaining four submarines was 'exactly the policy that we have had for a very long time'. Earlier this year Mr Miliband had said he favoured the 'least cost deterrent' possible. And in March, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had said the party would see whether three submarines could suffice. Military experts insist four submarines are the minimum needed to ensure Trident can be deployed at sea at all times. Any fewer would mean that the missiles would on occasion be left vulnerable in port. Mr Fallon attacked the idea of having only three, saying there was no point in having a deterrent that 'takes the weekend off'. A survey of Labour candidates, conducted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, suggests that Mr Miliband would have difficulty carrying large sections of his party with him if he sought to renew Trident. In several Labour safe seats, MPs who supported Trident are being replaced by candidates who oppose it. They include Meg Munn in Sheffield Heeley, whose replacement Louise Haigh says: 'Investment in nuclear is immoral in and of itself'. Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox said the lack of clarity from Labour over Trident left Britain in a 'very dangerous position'. 'Unless we are absolutely sure where they would be then we have to assume that they are not fit to protect this country by having a continuous nuclear deterrent,' he said 'In a very dangerous world that is a very dangerous position.' As many as three-quarters of Labour candidates oppose the replacement of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent. Pictured is the HMS Victorious off the coast of Scotland . CND's survey of Labour candidates suggested as many as three-quarters opposed the replacement of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent. The anti-nuclear group said last month it had polled a 'representative sample' of Labour candidates, including sitting MPs. But Labour critics claimed only 73 candidates had been surveyed with 50 or so anti-Trident. The finding suggested anti-nuclear Labour MPs could make common cause with the Scottish National Party, which has said it wants to ditch Trident. Labour's official policy is to maintain a continuous, submarine-based deterrent. But many senior figures want Labour to back a more limited, cut-price deterrent – while others believe the party should scrap it altogether. Kate Hudson, CND's general-secretary, said: 'Labour candidates are in step with public opinion. The majority of the public don't want tosee £100 billion spent on nuclear weapons.' Mr Cameron backed Mr Fallon's attack and challenged Mr Miliband to rule out any arrangement with the SNP that would put Labour into power. He said: 'When I listen to what Labour are saying, they are playing fast and loose with the country's security.' Miss Sturgeon said: 'We would never be in any deal with a Labour government who is going to renew Trident.'","Tories say Russia's Vladimir Putin would be happy with Ed Miliband as PM .

"This is the shocking moment a toddler was left hanging by her neck as she tried to climb out of her cot - and was only saved because her mother was watching her on the baby monitor. Ophelia Conant had managed to crawl backwards through a gap in the cot at her home in Holmer Green, Buckinghamshire, but was left hanging mid air by her neck. The furniture boss who supplied the beds, Phillip Dickens, who was described as the 'king of DIY' was today fined £50,000 and given a suspended prison sentence. Ophelia Conant managed to crawl backwards out of her cot and get trapped between the horizontal handrail . The 19-month-old was left dangling mid air by her neck and was only saved because her mother had been watching her on the baby monitor . The 19-month-old was only saved when her mother, Louise Conant, happened to be watching the incident unfold on a baby monitor. Days later a second toddler was found dangling from the £450 bed with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail. Both mothers had purchased the Nutkin three-drawer cotbeds from Dicken's company, Baumhaus Ltd, which had the beds produced in China and imported back into Britain for distribution. Amersham Crown Court heard Mrs Conant had put Ophelia in the cotbed for her lunchtime sleep on April 16, 2013, when she saw her getting into difficulty via the video monitoring system. She rushed upstairs to find her daughter hanging by her neck, which had become lodged in a gap between the end of the bed and a horizontal handrail. Judge Karen Holt told Dickens: 'Seeing her daughter on the baby video monitor screen hanging by her neck was, using her words, beyond description and completely traumatic to her. 'One can only imagine the horror that mother must have felt. In her view, it is without doubt the fact she had a video monitor that saved her daughter's life.' She added: 'This is a serious offence because it came through your negligence. It could have caused the loss of life of babies. 'The crown's case against the company and you was, with your negligence, this unsafe product was put on the market. 'Clearly, you did not act with all due diligence, or take all reasonable precautions to make sure such a situation would not occur. 'The product itself was dealing with the most vulnerable people in society, and I know that you accept that.' Louise Conant with her daughter Ophelia today after what she described as a 'traumatic' experience . Judge Holt said the design of the cot 'could have been fatal' and added that although Dickens and the company had been 'naive and negligent', there was 'very strong mitigation' on their behalf. Nine days after Ophelia's incident, Deborah Turner, from Northamptonshire found her son dangling on the outside of the cot with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail. 'It took both her and her mother to lift her son back through the gap,' said Judge Holt. Mrs Conant complained to Trading Standards at Buckinghamshire County Council and officers took away the cotbed before confronting Baumhaus. They were shown a copy of the video of Ophelia and immediately recalled all the cots it had sent out around the country. The court was told no health and safety tests were carried out in the UK, with the only quality control being made in the Chinese factory, which did not comply with British safety standards. Following test reports and an offer from Dickens to give Mrs Conant a part-refund, Baumhaus was served a product recall notice in July 2013, which recovered 93 per cent of the 212 cotbeds sold. The following month Trading Standards received three lab test reports which identified failures, including test parameters and clauses relating to strength of certain parts, finger, head and neck entrapment, and BSI standards markings. Thames Valley Police visited Baumhaus in October and seized computer equipment. A month later Dickens was interviewed under caution during which he confirmed the company had designed the Nutkin cotbed, which was produced in China and imported back into Britain for distribution. The court heard the prototype had been tested and passed in 2010 but the product placed on the market in 2013 had different dimensions and Dickens had no proper quality control in this country. In mitigation Sunyana Sharma told the court neither Dickens nor Baumhaus set out to harm children with their cotbed, and the company accepted that it failed in not having proper quality control. She added that the company had acted quickly to remove the product from distribution and done all it could to trace the remaining cots, all of which were accepted by Judge Holt. Phillip Dickens, company director of furniture supplier Baumhaus Ltd, which distributed the beds, was today given a suspended prison sentence for placing an unsafe product on the market . Judge Holt described this as a serious offence but said the court acknowledged naivety and negligence on the part of the defendant, who at the time had no manufacturing experience, kept no technical product notes, and relied on an external company for testing to assess compliance with relevant British Standards. Dickens, described as 'the king of DIY' on a profile on the Baumhaus website, entered pleas on the company's behalf at an earlier hearing, admitting two counts of placing an unsafe product on the market between January 2010 and July 2013. The 38-year-old, of Burnley, Lancashire, was given a three month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. He also pleaded guilty to a similar charge relating to his company, which is based near Bicester, Oxfordshire, and ordered to pay £500 to the two mothers. Baumhaus was given a £12,000 fine and Dickens and his company also face prosecution costs of £35,653. Judge Holt said she felt able to suspend the jail sentence because of his lack of intent to cause injury in supplying the potentially deadly cots to the market. She added: 'It is very difficult to put a figure on the clear distress that both these ladies suffered.' In a statement read through solicitor Tim Healy, Dickens and Baumhaus said they 'sincerely regretted' any distress caused to the families. Speaking outside court Dickens' solicitor, Mr Healy, said: 'Baumhaus Limited and Philip Dickens wish to express their sincere regret for any distress caused to the families effected. 'Health and safety remains of paramount concern to Mr Dickens and the company.' Speaking after the hearing Mrs Conant said the court case brought an element of closure to the nightmare experience of seeing her daughter trapped by her neck in her cot. She said: 'I bought what I thought was the best for Ophelia - a premium quality cot bed. But it turned out to be a living hell. Standards Officers Rebecca Kaya (right) and Kirit Vadia (left) examine the Nutkin three-drawer cotbed . 'For a long time afterwards it gave me nightmares, and it made me nervous about putting Ophelia to bed. 'The video monitor definitely saved her life. I'd never have thought to buy one, but a friend suggested it. Now I'd urge every parent to consider a video monitor for their child.' Trading Standards Officer Rebecca Kaya, who led the investigation, said the case demonstrated the department's commitment to protecting families from products posing a safety risk, and was an example of the tough measures they were prepared to take. She said: 'This case highlights the need to be very careful buying online. Before clicking the ""buy"" button, make sure you have a manufacturer's code, product code and full contact details of the retailer, including a cancellation process in case you need to return the product, or there is a safety problem.' Ms Kaya added that they believe there are still 12 cotbeds out there that weren't reached during the product recall.","Ophelia Conant managed to crawl backwards through cot and get trapped .

"Anything To Declare . by John Frost . (Constable £8.99) Stopped by Customs officers, Oscar Wilde notoriously said he had nothing to declare but his genius. Other passengers, as Jon Frost hilariously recounts, try to sneak through the red and green channels considerably more heavily laden. John Frost says he ‘wouldn’t trust a nun with a crutch’ (stock image) During his long career as a Customs specialist at London airports, Frost has had ‘to politely listen to people lying through their teeth at you’ as they attempt to smuggle in snakes, bush meat (zebra, lion, gorilla), combs that double as flick-knives, a monkey sewn into the lining of a coat, another monkey ‘disguised as a hairy child’, corpses ‘propped up in a wheelchair wearing wonky sunglasses’ and a box of dry ice containing a man’s buttock, apparently sliced off by a Samurai sword. Hospitals were put on the alert to look out for ‘anyone who had trouble sitting down’. As they riffle through travellers’ bags, Frost and his team frequently detect drugs: socks impregnated with heroin, cannabis resin in shoes, soup cans or barrels of bitumen. Drugs are often hidden in hollowed-out disposable lighters, AA batteries that unscrew to reveal a stash inside and shaving cream aerosols cleverly made to still squirt real foam out of the top. Once, Frost found a pack of 12 brightly coloured lipsticks, ‘where every lipstick was actually moulded from cocaine paste. Very clever’. The cardboard lining of suitcases or sports bags, originating in Amsterdam, often contained 20 compressed sheets of LSD tabs, worth £10,000 on the street. To deter the Customs inspections, smugglers sometimes litter their luggage with hypodermic needles or razor blades. What Frost looks out for are people whose passports show frequent trips being made to drug-source countries. Flights paid for in bundles of cash can be suspicious. Also don’t stroll around too flashily dressed: ‘It is better to look scruffily right than too smartly wrong,’ he says. It’s amazing how many drug-dealers try to behave like drug-dealers in a film. By and large, the Customs officers would sooner ‘nab some nob on a private plane who thinks it allows him to sneak in a suitcase of cocaine than some kid from the Netherlands with a spliff in his sock’ — though don’t let that make you feel over-confident. One of the hallmarks of a tip-top inspector is that he ‘wouldn’t trust a nun with a crutch’ — and no wonder. They are always confronting nuns smuggling in gin disguised as litre bottles of Holy water — ‘Another miracle!’ The worst part of the job, however, is the strip-search. ‘Every single hiding place and hole in the human body has, at one time, been used by smugglers.’ Frost has to snap on his Marigolds and wait for the ‘swallowers’ and ‘stuffers’ to void condoms filled with drugs into the lavatory pan. ‘It becomes a waiting game,’ he says, philosophically. Yet such criminals are easy to spot. ‘You try walking normally with half-a-kilo of drugs up your jacksy.’ There’s me thinking everyone arriving from South America had piles. It is not only narcotics, of course. Frost’s job is to detect and confiscate weapons, child porn videos, pirated medicines and counterfeit art. He has seen mobile phones containing tiny pistols and stun guns, and straw camels and donkeys from Spain and Tunisia crammed with used hospital bandages. He has to collect the duty due on imported diamonds, fur coats and Rolex watches. Contraband is destroyed, valuables handed to the Crown and booze poured away. ‘The airport drains probably had the only alcoholic rats in the country.’ On one occasion, Frost had to board a Hercules aircraft from Nigeria, where a rat the size of a Shetland pony had been glimpsed in the hold. Though the police went in with their Heckler & Koch MP5 automatic rifles, it was Frost who did the deed, bashing the monster with a B&Q garden spade. As ‘death by rabies is a nasty way to go’, our quarantine rules are strict. Frost also says that they look out for those strolling through the airport in flashy clothing, because he says ‘It is better to look scruffily right than too smartly wrong' Frost often has to do battle with rich folks in private Gulfstream jets who think their pets are exempt — one lot even had the gall to suggest they were on their way to Balmoral to shoot grouse with the Queen. If their dog mixed with the corgis, Frost patiently explained, then the corgis also would have to be destroyed . . . Horses, incidentally, are tricky animals to ship. They get so nervous and frightened, it is not unknown for them to bite their trainer’s fingers clean off at the knuckle. Corpses aren’t given much peace, either. Did you know that if you croak abroad, it can cost £4,500 to repatriate the body, which has to be embalmed and secured in a zinc coffin? (Hence the wheelchair and sunglasses gambit — cheaper.) As coffins are ‘a good vehicle for contraband importation’, these have to be rigorously searched — a ghoulish task, especially if the deceased’s arm shoots up and its wig falls off. And it is also not unknown for stowaways in the hold to be crushed by the retracting undercarriage — and to drop onto the runway at Stansted several hours later as a block of ice. No wonder, to ease the tension, Customs officers play wicked pranks on each other. ‘Never fly into the airport where you also work’ is the strong advice. Otherwise, you can come back from Tenerife and your luggage will have been replaced on the carousel with concrete blocks. Eventually, Frost was upgraded from the rubber gloves to work in undercover surveillance. This meant the painstaking study of airline computer systems, which give details of ticket payments and full details of a passenger’s travel. (Privacy and freedom of movement? Forget it. They know where we are, where we’ve been and where we are all going.) The Customs Investigation Division, which follows international drugs cartels and involves ‘info gathering and smuggling ops’, is based in a Georgian building near Tower Bridge, built in the days of old-fashioned pirates and ships flying the Jolly Roger flag. Here, Frost had to serve alongside MI5 and MI6. The doings of the Serious Organised Crime Agency sound like the plot of a Guy Ritchie movie — with traces of Breaking Bad thrown in. Further jaunty volumes of reminiscence are promised.","John Frost hilariously recounts stories from his career at London airports .

"The mother and daughter who survived a tragic car accident this week, which saw three children die, have been reunited. Aluel Manyang was moved from the intensive care unit at the Royal Children's about 5.15pm on Friday, and greeted her distraught mother, Akon Goode, with a 'big hug', her father said. 'She didn't believe that her mum was still alive,' Joseph Manyang said, according to the Herald Sun. Scroll down for videos . Aueel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode, believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water . Ms Guode visited her daughter for the first time but did not stay the night in the hospital. Mr Manyang said his daughter was expected to make a '100 per cent' recovery and she should be allowed to go home within four days. The five-year-old girl who survived when a car driven by her mother plunged into a lake believes her three siblings who died in the crash were eaten by crocodiles. Aluel Manyang believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Her siblings - one-year-old brother Bol and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger - died after their mother Akon Guode crashed her 4WD into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west on Wednesday. The crash on Wednesday killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake . The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang, says five-year-old Awel remains in a serious condition at the Royal Children's Hospital but she remembers the accident. 'Always when they see water they think of crocodiles, so that's what she said. She said they'd fallen into the water and there were crocodiles eating my younger brothers and sister,' Mr Manyang said. 'I went to see her yesterday and she was happy to see me. She knew me when I asked: 'Do you know me?' She said, 'Yeah, you're Daddy'.' Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody on Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told him she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her children crying out. One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west just before 4pm on Wednesday . Ms Guode has been sent to stay with a relative after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash, The Age reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother earlier on Thursday saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He  made an emotional visit to the crash site on Thursday where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday . Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman . Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' It follows as the four-wheel-drive was removed from the lake on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. 'It's a shock for everyone,' Mr Kok said, according to the Herald Sun. 'We spent all night at hospital until 3 in the morning.' It comes as the tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. 'As soon as I saw the community coming towards this scene where the incident's happened, it's making me feel like people care,' Mr Kok said.

Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children . Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' A witness Michelle relived the tragic moment the car ploughed into the lake on Thursday morning. 'It is still in my mind now, every time you close your eyes you just see someone so little,' she told Nine News in tears. 'My heart goes out to the family and to everybody who witnessed it. 'Those rescuers, those workers, when it was winding down it was just devastating seeing them sitting in the gutter.' Michelle told 3AW late on Wednesday that her friend Travis rescued one of the young boys from the vehicle. 'Travis jumped into the water and smashed the back windscreen and got one little boy out. (Emergency workers) then started working on the child,' she said. 'I only saw three get taken out. I believe they were travelling down the boulevard...and they've just gone over and into the lake.' Emotions were still raw on Thursday morning for neighbour Michelle who witnessed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger plunging into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore . Locals are shocked as to how the car was able to get into the centre of the lake as it is 'pretty far from the road' Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred. Police particularly wish to speak to anyone who saw the car between 3.30 and 3.45pm. Witnesses or anyone with further information about the incident should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

"Getting thousands of dollars more when you sell your house could be as simple as changing the door-knobs or sprucing up the curtains. Finder.com.au money and real estate expert Michelle Hutchison says there are easy ways to improve the look and feel of your home for prospective buyers - and they need not cost thousands. 'Spending a relatively small amount can go a seriously long way when it comes to the returns you could make on the value of your home,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Get into the garden: Tidying the edges, mowing the lawn and trimming the trees will improve the presentation of your home. This beautiful garden at 115 Jersey Road in Woollahra immediately catches the eye. The house on the market and last sold four years ago for $5.5m . Putting in new lights and light fittings can make a home stand out, just like this home for sale in Sandy Bay in Tasmania. It's expected to fetch upwards of $2.5m . Artwork like these paintings at 1 Madeline Street in Hunters Hill and photo collages, along with new curtains, can add plenty to your home's appearance. It went for $4.5m in 2013 and is on the market . This property at 5 Closeburn Avenue in Prahran stands out with its bright lights. New light fittings and a fresh coat of paint are winners, according to money expert Michelle Hutchison . Michelle Hutchison (right) is a money expert from Finder.com.au who insists that de-cluttering and reworking the wardrobes to look as presentable as those featured on The Block (left) will add cash to your sale . In most parts, the Australian property market remains at record high levels, and the experts say you can profit even more handsomely from a bit of elbow-grease.

'Get tidy and organised, and fix those things that have been broken forever. 'Get your kids involved to occupy them as well as save money by doing it yourself. 'It might be cheaper than going away for the weekend and the best part is that any improvements will almost guarantee you'll add significant value to your home.' Changing the door handles is her first tip. 'Replacing tired, grubby and dated door handles to shiny, matching new ones throughout your home can transform your doors and hallways,' Ms Hutchison said. 'New kitchen cupboard door handles can also give your kitchen a whole new fresh look . 'For as little as $5 and no more than $20 each from your local hardware store, they are inexpensive and an easy do-it-yourself project.' She said that a coat of paint is underestimated as a sell point but the fresh, brighter appearance of a house is very important ahead of a sale. 'Painting a light, fresh neutral colour on your walls can make your whole home much cleaner and brand new. 'If you have wooden kitchen cupboard doors you could also paint them which would give your kitchen a face lift. 'And don't forget to spring clean your cupboards and any areas that are cluttered such as a garage or study.' The doors and handles stand out in this part of 11A Molesworth Street, North Adelaide.

Finder's real estate assessors say buyers are increasingly on the lookout for places which have great storage space and that's an easy fix, even for the most cluttered of homes. 'Tidying up and organising your storage spaces will always add value to any home,' she insisted. 'Sell old clothes and shoes on sites like eBay or Gumtree or have a garage sale and you could make some money to go towards other fixes around your home.

"A new anti-smoking advert warning people that they could get colon cancer and be forced to use an ostomy bag for the rest of their lives has drawn the anger of a 19-year-old student who  uses one as a consequence of her fight with inflammatory bowel disease. Hattie Gladwell blogs about her experience of living with an ostomy bag after she underwent emergency surgery for ulcerative colitis. She has called for the new Tips From Former Smokers ad, commissioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to be banned. Scroll down for video . Hattie Gladwell blogs about her experience of living with an ostomy bag after she underwent emergency surgery for ulcerative colitis . The advert features Julia, 58, of Mississippi who smoked for more than 20 years before she developed colon cancer at 49 years old which requires her to use an ostomy bag. The 30 second ad features her warning smokers that she has to use an ostomy bag taped to a hole in her abdomen as a consequence of smoking. 'I'm Julia, I smoked and I got colon cancer. I had chemo and two surgeries. But what I hated the most, was the colostomy bag. That's where they re-route your intestines so you have bowel movements that go into a bag,' she says. 'Through a hole in your stomach. My tip is: get over being squeamish. You're going to be emptying your bag 6 times a day.' The video ends with Julia holding up an ostomy bag, with a voiceover telling people where they can seek  help to quit smoking. Gladwell, who is English, writes on her MoreThanYourBag.com blog that the ad 'came as a complete shock' and left her feeling angry and disgusted. Gladwell has called for the new Tips From Former Smokers ad, commissioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to be banned . 'Watching this video bought out so much anger that I didn't know was there. I am absolutely, utterly disgusted that they feel they can advertise a quit smoking campaign with something that has saved so many lives,' she wrote. The blogger says she doesn't understand why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to use a condition that can be caused by a variety of diseases – not just colon cancer – to put people off smoking. The ad is unfair to many people who need to use an ostomy, she argues, because it suggests that it is caused by something they've done to ourselves. Gladwell writes that Julia should remember that her colostomy bag is the reason that she's still alive. 'How the hell does this company have the audacity to make people feel so insecure? And how the hell do they have the nerve to use my condition as an example of why you should not smoke? The video ends with Julia holding up an ostomy bag, with a voiceover telling people where they can seek help to quit smoking . 'My ileostomy bag saved my life. It does not make me feel squeamish. If anything, I am just damn grateful to be alive. 'How are we meant to move on and embrace our bodies when such a large company are drilling it into the minds of society that Ostomy's are nothing but a consequence?' She has called for the advert to be banned.","Hattie Gladwell, 19, blogs about her experience of living with an ostomy bag after undergoing emergency surgery for ulcerative colitis .

"Crusaders in Chains . by Robin Esser . (Palatino £9.99) Journalists tend to be a fund of good stories and Robin Esser, who has worked in national newspapers for 60 years, is no exception. What shines through this memoir is that journalism is a serious business, but it is also fun. His best stories are from his days as editor of the William Hickey gossip column in the Daily Express. Robin Esser (pictured) has worked in newspapers for 60 years . Once, he answered the phone and an aristocratic voice said: ‘Marlborough here. That awful chap Bedford has been round Blenheim writing “Woburn is better” on our brochures and giving them to our visitors. That’s the sort of thing you like to print in your newspaper, isn’t it?’ He put the phone down without further conversation. Fearing a hoax, Esser rang Blenheim Palace, home to the Duke of Marlborough, where the butler said, haughtily, that the Duke never spoke to the Press and was in his bath, so couldn’t be disturbed. Esser pointed out that the Duke would be cross — very cross — with the butler if he was not asked to confirm his call. A chastened butler later called back to confirm that the Duke himself had, indeed, called Esser. Esser rang Woburn, where the Duke of Bedford confirmed the story. Next, he sent a motorcyclist to Blenheim to pick up a brochure and then ride over to Woburn to get it signed and brought back to Fleet Street. It was the lead story in William Hickey next day. At that time, the Daily Express was owned by Lord Beaverbrook. He rang Esser to say how much he enjoyed the tale. Often, however, his calls about the subject of a story would be more ominous. ‘Very good story in your column this morning, Mr Esser,’ he would say. ‘I hope it is true.’ ‘I believe so, Lord Beaverbrook.’ ‘Good, I’m lunching with him today,’ he would bark. Esser worked in Fleet Street during the glory days, when reporters kept four pennies in their pockets for the telephone box, a knife to puncture the tyres of rival reporters’ cars, and enjoyed liquid lunches on expenses. Esser describes a lunch with an Express editor, during which they drank champagne, a goblet of dry sherry, a bottle of Chablis, two bottles of claret, a couple of Cognacs and, finally, several glasses of port. The editor went back to work. Esser went to bed. The editor died young. But more good stories were elicited over a boozy lunch than can ever come from a tuna sandwich at the desk. And they were also the days when Esser, as editor of William Hickey, could ring Aristotle Onassis on his yacht at Monte Carlo and be invited over to meet Maria Callas. Or plot with John Paul Getty, then the world’s richest private citizen, to disentangle himself from his girlfriend, Marie, who had moved into his Sutton Place home and was angling for marriage. Esser suggested an interview in which oil billionaire Getty made it plain that he was never going to remarry, with the headline ‘I’m married to an oil rag’, i.e. my oil business comes before women. Shortly afterwards, Getty and Marie were dining with the paper’s proprietor, Lord Beaverbrook. Marie complained about Esser and said the story he’d written wasn’t true. Beaverbrook turned to Getty — who said that, on the contrary, it was the only article ever written about him that was 100 per cent true. Marie packed her bags and left. A grateful Getty gave Esser the freedom of Sutton Place. The peak of Esser’s 60-year career came when he was editor of the Sunday Express, which then sold two million copies a week. Esser is now an elder statesman of the national Press and works for the Daily Mail, where he is a leader of the fight against attempts by the state to extend its control over the media and to put newspapers in chains. He is particularly critical of the recommendations in the Leveson Report that threaten the right to protect journalists’ sources, and which mean information acquired confidentially can be seized by the police. He points out that legislation designed to have a chilling effect on investigative journalism already exists — laws on contempt of court, data protection, bribery, harassment and terrorism, among others. There is also the arrival by the back door of a privacy law. The British Press is now regulated and self-regulated to such an extent, he says, that it is only half-free. The ‘outrageous’ recommendation that whistleblowers should report misgivings only to the organisation that is responsible for the abuses — never to the media — guarantees that fewer scandals will be exposed. At least one politician — the Tory veteran Kenneth Clarke — gets Esser’s blessing, though. The Information Commissioner, Chris Graham, had been campaigning for prison sentences for those who breached the Data Protection Act; newspapers worried almost any inquiry by a journalist risked being classified as a breach. Clarke and Esser were sitting together at a conference when Graham approached them and made his pitch for prison punishment. ‘If you think I am going to stuff my jails full of people who break your Act, you have another think coming,’ Ken Clarke roared. Of course newspapers must continue to entertain, Esser concludes, but they must also be a thorn in the sides of those in power, wrongdoers and those who abuse the young and old.","Journalists are known for being a fund of good stories .

"Philip Hammond pledged to protect the Falklands from ‘Argentinian bullying’ last night as the country began legal action against British companies exploring for oil off the islands. It follows a provocative speech by Argentinian president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, prompting the Foreign Office to summon her ambassador for a dressing down. Buenos Aires responded by accusing three British oil firms of working without permission. The Argentine government said it was taking legal action against three British and two US companies for ‘exploration activities for fossil fuels on the Argentine continental shelf without obtaining the corresponding authorisation’. The legal complaint listed Rockhopper Exploration, Premier Oil, Falkland Oil and Gas Limited and US firms Noble Energy and Edison International – accusing them of sending a semi-submersible rig to explore a basin 120 miles north of the islands ‘subjected to the illegitimate British occupation’. Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (centre) poses with veterans of the 1982 Falklands War, during the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary of the conflict last week . It also warned the rig’s owner, Greece-based firm Ocean Rig, that it could face ‘legal consequences’ over the drilling. The diplomatic row over the fate of the Falklands has worsened in recent weeks, after the UK Government pledged to invest £180million in the islands’ defences over the next ten years. President Fernandez de Kirchner last week promised: ‘We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It’s not just wishful thinking.’ Her remarks came on the 33rd anniversary of Argentina’s invasion of the Falklands, leading to a conflict that cost 250 British and 650 Argentinian lives. Last night Foreign Secretary Mr Hammond said: ‘Cristina Kirchner’s threats against those who do business with the Falkland Islands are as hollow as they are illegal. The islanders have a perfect right to develop their oil and gas industry – and they can rely on us to protect them from Argentinian bullying as they do so.’ Alicia Castro, Argentine ambassador to the UK, was summoned by the Foreign Office on Wednesday. Yesterday, in a tit-for-tat move, Argentine deputy foreign minister Eduardo Zuain summoned the UK ambassador to Buenos Aires, John Freeman, to complain about recent spying revelations by Edward Snowden. Daniel Filmus, minister for the Malvinas – as Argentina calls the Falklands – said his government would try to block further oil exploration. ‘We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes,’ he said, adding that this could involve ‘an Argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in Argentine waters’. Although Falkland residents overwhelmingly voted to stay British in a recent referendum, Buenos Aires claims the islands and surrounding waters belong to Argentina. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, pictured today, last month announced plans to boost the UK's military defences of the Falkland Islands . Last week, the Argentine president and ambassador Alicia Castro publicly attacked the UK Government's plan to boost defences on the South Atlantic islands. Mrs Kirchner's government has also suggested that British oil firms could be prosecuted if they start drilling in the waters around the islands without formal permission from Argentina. The outspoken Argentine president's latest comments came on April 2, the 33rd anniversary of the start of the 1982 Falklands War. She reportedly said: 'International law and dialogue, not militarisation, are the path to a reunion and sovereignty. 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking.' But a Foreign Office spokesman attacked the provocative intervention. He said: 'The UK has no doubt about its sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and surrounding maritime areas, nor about the Falkland Islanders' right to decide their own future. 'We object strongly to recent statements by the Argentine president and the Argentine ambassador to London and so summoned the ambassador to account for these.' It came after the British government last week dismissed the threat of prosecution against oil and gas firms working off the Falkland Islands. Three British firms - Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas - announced that they had found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands, which are claimed by Argentina. Last month, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the Government was preparing to 'beef up' defences in the Falklands. He said two Chinook helicopters and an upgraded surface-to-air missile system will be part of a new defence package for the islands. Mr Fallon said: 'We've been reviewing the defence of the Falklands, we do that every so often, and I'm going to be announcing to parliament later today how we are going to beef up the defences there, how we are going to modernise our defences, and to reassure the islanders that we are absolutely committed to their right to remain British and to the defence of the islands... 'We are absolutely committed to defending the Falklands. The threat to the Falklands has not gone away.' He said 'modernising what we are doing' in the Falklands was a response to the threat of Russia. 'Russia has changed. We hoped Russia would be a partner to us – a normal trading partner that respected the rules of the international system, but it's turned out that Russia is directly competing against and is becoming much more aggressive in lots of different parts of the world, and we have to respond to that.'","Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said islands not British .

"Her top tips to achieving success include trusting your guts, be bold, and never back down. And Jo Burston certainly lives her mantra. The award-winning tech entrepreneur's ballsy attitude helped land her an investor in very unusual circumstances for her first business Job Capital - a leading technology services firm that handles payroll services, migration, salary packaging and contract-management and turned over $40 million in its first four years. 'I was running a services company with an 80 million dollar turnover and realised I wanted more,' says Burston. 'I was on a working trip to Melbourne where I was meant to be pitching on behalf of my employer to an investor but I thought, ""I have 15 minutes, I better make the most of it"". Scroll down for video . Seventh start-up: Australian Entrepreneur Jo Burston, 43, achieved a turnover of $40 million in her first four years of business . 'When I walked into the investor's office he had all these computer screens going and there was this energy in the room, he had this vibrancy. 'So I walked straight to his side of the desk and said ""I'm going to be here anyway one day so I may as well sit here now.""' 'He laughed and said ""who the hell are you?!"" Six weeks later I started Job Capitol and he became my first investor and mentor.' 1.Surround yourself with inspiration . 'Find people that are better at what you do than you. Be around them and up your knowledge all the time.' 2. Hire the right people . 'From admin, to tactical, get those who are skilled in areas that you aren't as much.' 3. Trust your gut instinct . 'When I've fallen in a big heap it's been because I haven't followed my instinct. 4. Know your numbers . 'When you're looking for investors, know your financial literacy. They always look at numbers first, then passion and capability of the entrepreneur. 5.Never give up . 'My mentor always says 'when you're in the ring, fight until the end.' So even if you get hit get hit, get back up and be stronger for it. Burston, 43, has now started eight companies, and last year caught the attention of Richard Branson while staying on his private retreat Necker Island. She was invited to visit Necker Island with a group other entrepreneurs. High on her bucket-list, she jumped at the chance and it was during alone time with the Virgin mogul that her new project 'Inspiring Rare Birds' came into being. 'I was very conscious [of the fact that] he's a busy man - you can imagine how many times he gets pitched to in a day,' says Burston. Burston told Branson and the staff at Virgin Unite about a new business concept she had that focused on the lack of awareness surrounding female entrepreneurs. 'I had taken a film crew to my local high school, Reversby high and talked to girls aged 8-17 about what an entrepreneur was and who came to mind,' says Burston. 'They said Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Oprah, but they couldn't think of one Australian and most didn't associate entrepreneurs with women.' The man, the myth, the legend: Burston received wise advice from Branson to: 'Say yes and figure it out later' Empower entrepreneurs: Burston hopes new venture 'Inspiring Rare Birds' will empower women in business . 'I was so upset about the whole thing, it became the catalyst for my new business. I wanted to change the perception in Australia to be about recognising women as influential and doing incredible things, both socially and economically.' Needless to say, Branson and his team were won over and it wasn't long before she was flying to London to work with Virgin Unite on the idea further. But before Burston left, she was given some wise words of wisdom from Branson. He taught me to ""'say yes and work the rest out later,"" and to keep things simple. He can look at the most complex problem and have a simple, well thought out and articulate way of delivering it.' Inspiration island: Necker Island is Branson's privately owned island in the British Virgin Islands . Idyllic for ideas: On Necker, Burston says her business concept inspired women and helped launch her brand . Since Necker Island, Burston has gone on to launch her new business venture 'Inspiring Rare Birds' a philanthropic endeavour she calls a 'business with a beating heart that's social, sustainable and has a profitable smart heart (neither non-profit nor capitalistic).' The website Inspiring Rare Birds hosts a range of tools, support and network to help Australian female entrepreneurs reach their full potential. Currently there is a mentor program whereby young entrepreneurs can be connected with senior mentors (who are captain of industry executives or successful entrepreneurs). The program is a collaboration with Virgin Unite, and soon there will be a 'Deal Room' - an online portal where entrepreneurs can source investors. Start-up success: Burston's experience has lead to her releasing book to inspire and share success stories . To coincide with the website launch, Burston also published a book 'Rare Birds: Australia's 50 Influential Women Entrepreneurs' which she plans to produce annually to spread the word about up and coming success stories. 'My goal now is to aim for a million female entrepreneurs globally by 2020,' she says. 'I want someone to be able to ask a little girl what she wants to do and her say she wants to be an entrepreneur, have her own company and change the world.'","Jo Burston is a top Australian entrepreneur and owns seven businesses .

"The parents of a student who vanished in mysterious circumstances after leaving a nightclub made a desperate appeal for information last night. Karen Buckley, 24, disappeared from the Glasgow club in the early hours of Sunday morning without collecting her coat after telling friends she was going to the loo. CCTV cameras filmed her talking to a man outside the club before getting into his car and travelling to his flat in nearby Kelvindale . But fears over the Irish student’s safety were heightened yesterday after police revealed they had tracked down the man and he is not being treated as a suspect. Scroll down for video . Karen Buckley, 24, (left) pictured with friends on the night she went missing after leaving a Glasgow nightclub . Karen Buckley, a student at Glasgow Caledonia University,  has been missing since Sunday after going out with friends . Miss Buckley, who is brunette and 5ft 2in, was wearing a black jumpsuit and red heels when she was last seen leaving the man’s flat in Kelvindale at around 4am. A handbag thought to belong to her was found in a park near the man’s home yesterday, causing police to say they are ‘gravely concerned’ about her safety. The family of Miss Buckley, who is from Cork in the Republic of Ireland, have flown to Scotland to help with the search for the Glasgow Caldeonian University student, who studies occupational therapy. Her mother Marion told a press conference in Glasgow: 'We just want Karen home safely, we are desperate. She is our only daughter, we love her dearly. Miss Buckley, who is originally from Cork in Ireland was last seen when she left the flat of a man she had met at around 4am on Sunday morning and was planning to walk home to her flat in Hill Street in the Garnethill area . Miss Buckley's parents Marian and John have travelled to Glasgow from Cork to help in the search for their daughter . 'If anybody has any information please come forward, we would dearly appreciate it.' Her father John Buckley, 62, added: 'We are extremely concerned for her. We are desperate to get her back and safe with her family - she is our only daughter, we love her dearly and just want her to come home safe and sound. 'She always keeps in contact with her family and friends to let them know where she is and what she is up to. 'To not return to her flat or be in contact with her pals - not responding to texts and calls to her mobile is very, very worrying as it is so out of character.' Miss Buckley arrived at the Sanctuary club with friends at around 11.45pm on Saturday and at around 1am she told them she was going to the toilet. She failed to return and did not take her jacket. She was then seen outside on CCTV talking to a man and then walking west along Dumbarton Road towards Church Street. Friends then raised the alarm on Sunday, saying it was 'very out of character' for her not to return home. Officers have traced the man Ms Buckley was seen speaking to outside the nightclub, and he is 'helping police with inquiries.'

A handbag which police believe belongs to Miss Buckley was found in Dawsholm Park, near Dorchester Avenue, early this afternoon. There has been no activity on her social media accounts in the last couple of days and her mobile phone is believed to be out of battery. Detective Superintendent Jim Kerr, from Police Scotland's major investigations teams, stressed that the male was 'not a suspect.' He told the press conference: We've traced the man she was with in Dorchester Avenue. He believes he was intimate with her at his flat consensually in the early hours of Sunday. 'From what we can see, she does not appear to be under duress, there's no signs of a struggle or reluctance on her part to leave the club. 'However, that does not mean that something untoward has happened to her at a later stage. 'There was talk of another man she had been seen with. We've also traced him, we've spoken to him.' Police comb through trees in Kelvingrove Park below the tower of Glasgow University in the search for Miss Buckley . Police say there has been no activity on Miss Buckley's social media accounts and say that they have recovered her handbag . Miss Buckley, who has three older brothers, is described as white and around five to five foot two inches tall with brown eyes and dark hair which had long black curly extensions in it. When last seen, she was wearing a black jumpsuit with red high-heeled shoes and was carrying a black handbag. She also speaks with an Irish accent. Miss Buckley lives with three other student friends and earlier on Saturday evening had drinks with them in their flat before going to the night club, although her friends told police she was not drunk. Mr Kerr appealed for people to come forward with any information about the missing woman's whereabouts, saying while it 'may seem insignificant to them, however to us it may be the piece of information that leads us to finding her.'

'However, at this time we need the information about her whereabouts and her movements after leaving the club.' DS Kerr also appealed for information on a grey car that had been seen parked on remote roads between Milngavie and Drymen on Monday. He added: 'From our inquiries we are also keen to trace a grey car which was seen on the country roads between Milngavie and Drymen, between 11am and 3pm on Monday. 'The activity of this grey car on the Monday is something that we're a wee bit concerned about. This car has been seen at various locations on these roads and I want to know why.' 'We are gravely concerned that Karen has come to some harm, whether that is down to foul play, criminality or she has taken unwell or had an accident is obviously still to be established.'

Mystery: The man, described in the police appeal as 6ft3in and about 35-years-old, was found in Gniezno, in February, claiming that he has no memory of who he is or where he is from . The man was spotted in Gniezno, a historic city which used to be the capital of Poland in the 10th century, on February 28th. Locals told police he appeared disorientated and was walking into traffic, so an ambulance was called to the scene. Since then, he has remained in a psychiatric unit at the hospital, but his memory has yet to return. The Gniezno Police's appeal for help describes the man as 6ft3in tall, about 35-years-old, and has ginger hair. Memory lost: According to police, the man communicates only in English, but knows a few Polish phrases, and some in several other languages, but his accent has yet to be determined . 'He communicates in English but he does not know his name, when he was born or where he lives,' Anna Osińska, press officer of the District Police Headquarters in Gniezno said.

He was found wearing jeans, a yellow T-shirt, a grey sweater and a black jacket. Polish officials have published the images of the man in the hope somebody might identify him and asked experts to try and work out where the man's accent is from.","Man found on the street in western Poland who only speaks English .

"Jobless Keith MacDonald (pictured) has sired a massive brood with at least ten mothers - and is said to have already cost the taxpayer over £2m . The man dubbed 'Britain's most feckless father' after having 15 children by the age of 30 is back on the market after he split from his most recent pregnant girlfriend. Jobless Keith MacDonald, 29, from Sunderland in Tyne and Wear, has sired a massive brood with at least ten mothers - and is estimated to cost the taxpayer over £2million. He was set to become a father for the sixteenth time but has revealed he's split from the unborn child's mother. MacDonald, of County Durham, says he's back on the dating market - and the baby in question is not actually his. He said: 'There is no baby - it's not mine and I'm single now.' MacDonald, who has appeared on Jeremy Kyle, says he gets most of his women by chatting them up on the bus. In the past, he bragged: 'It's easy - they never seem to say no. Just chat them up on the bus. I just pick them up like that. 'That's what I do and they never seem to say no. If they like you, they like you. Get their number and text them and arrange to meet when you come off the bus.' Last month he caused a stir when he appeared on Channel 5 documentary 40 Kids by 20 Women. MacDonald told the programme he can't find work, partly because he is 'no good at listening', and spends most of him time playing computer games. Scroll down for video . He says he finds it hard to meet new women because of his reputation in Sunderland and is shown in the programme going to Birmingham to 'pull girls'. MacDonald hit the headlines in 2011 when he tried to fake his own death in a bid to shirk responsibility for his ninth child.

Charlotte Anderson (left) with her daughter Kady-Marie Anderson and June Garrick with her son Brendan Garrick (right), all in 2005. Both children are believed to have been fathered by MacDonald . In November 2012, he was found guilty by Sunderland magistrates of common assault and stealing from one of his ex-partners after a row over a cheese toastie. The binman's son was desperate to avoid paying out any more than the £5 a week he was putting towards each of his other children. Keith MacDonald: . - Unemployed . - Reportedly receives incapacity benefit for bad back of up £68.95 a week and £44 income support . - Said to contribute just £5 of his weekly income to his children . - The total benefit bill racked up by him and his offspring has been estimated at £2million from birth to 18 . He pretended to be one of his friends and sent a text message to his pregnant former girlfriend Clare Bryant, 22, telling her: 'Keith is dead.' Miss Bryant, who already had a one-year-old daughter by MacDonald, rang his mobile phone, but there was no answer. She then called the local hospitals and the police, but to no avail. Two weeks passed before Miss Bryant found out that 25-year-old MacDonald was, in fact, alive and well. He sent her a message to apologise and told her that he wanted to 'get away from his life'. He refuses to use contraception and had fathered six children by the time he turned 20 - including two he claims were conceived on double-decker buses. In 2008 he bragged: 'It's not my fault - I thought they were all on the pill. Lasses keep on coming up to me.' Macdonald first became a father at 15 as he left school and has rarely worked since saying he finds it boring. He has previously claimed incapacity allowance for a 'bad back'. MacDonald was just one of several feckless fathers to gain infamy after appearing in 40 Kids by 20 Women. Michael Holpin, a 56-year-old unemployed alcoholic from Ebbw Vale, South Wales, became an unlikely TV star after appearing in the documentary. He claims to have 40 children by 20 women - and says while he would not recognise many of his offspring in the street, he wants more. Now engaged again, the three-times married man keeps track of their names with an ever-growing family tree tattooed on his back. In 2012 MacDonald was found guilty of common assault and stealing after a row over a cheese toastie .","Jobless Keith MacDonald, 29, has fathered 15 children by 10 women .

"Crime victims seeking emergency help are waiting up to 50 per cent longer for assistance compared with three years ago with response times increasing by an extra couple of minutes. Analysis of Home Office figures show that in areas such as Bedfordshire as well as Devon and Cornwall, response times are now at least 50 per cent longer than they were three years ago. In Essex and Kent, crime victims are waiting up to a third longer for a response. Police response times in some areas have been increased by up to 50 per cent because of funding cuts . Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, pictured, claimed the victims of crime were being put at risk . According to figures released to the Labour Party  under the Freedom of Information Act, across England and Wales, average 999 response times have increased by 17 percent. In Bedfordshire the average response time has increased from seven to 11 minutes. Crime victims in Cambridgeshire and South Wales wait on average 14 minutes. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: '999 waits have gone up significantly for the most serious emergencies and that means victims are being put at risk. 'This is the direct consequence of of Tory police cuts, yet now they want to go even further.' In an effort to reduce the pressure on the 999 system, the government introduced a 101 number to report less urgent crimes such as antisocial behaviour, drug dealing, car theft and petty vandalism. The number of police officers across England and Wales has fallen by 17,000 since 2009 with several forces planning even more extreme reductions. The Metropolitan Police is one of the only forces in the country which has been able to keep front-line officer numbers at earlier levels. Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales said: 'What we are seeing are the dangers of the governemnt cutting the police budgets so harshly over the last five years. It can come as no surprise that victims of crime are now having to wait significantly longer for police help to arrive. 'There are now 17,000 fewer officers and 17,000 fewer police staff around - what does the government expect to happen? 'Cuts have consequences and the politicians must start backing the police service. Otherwise, despite the best efforts of officers, victims of crime are going to have to wait longer and longer for police attention.' However, the Home Office dismisses the criticism claiming that crime levels are continuing to fall.","Some crime vicitms are waiting up to two minutes longer for a response .

"Maryland police are conducting a criminal investigation into the death of a black man who lapsed into a coma and died in their custody a week after his arrest at the Gilmor Homes in Baltimore. Freddie Gray, 27, died Sunday after he 'had his spine 80 percent severed at his neck' following his arrest by four bicycle officers for violation that's being kept 'secret' according to his lawyer. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake vowed to ensure the city held 'the right people accountable' after his early-morning death at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. Scroll down for video . Freddie Gray, 27, was arrested last Sunday in Baltimore, Maryland, by four officers for an undisclosed violation . In a video of the arrest, it appears the officers dragged Gray to a police van while he screamed out in pain . Gray was placed in restraints in the van and then an ambulance was called to the police station 30 minutes later . Gray's stepfather, Richard Shipley, confirmed the death of his stepson, the Baltimore Sun reported. Shipley said: 'He's gone. What else is there to say?' A timeline released earlier in the week by police said Gray was taken by a prisoner transport van from the 'crime' scene to the Western District station shortly before 9am last Sunday. While he was in the van, Gray was put in additional restrains, according to CBS Baltimore. Thirty minutes after he was put in restraints, an ambulance was called to the police station to take Gray to the hospital. Gray suffered a broken vertebra and an injured voice box, according to his family. Civilian video showed him being loaded into the van, but did not show the entire encounter. During the video, a woman said: 'That boy's legs look broke. 'His legs [look] broke and y'all dragging him like that.' The race of the officers involved could not immediately be confirmed and they have been placed on leave. The alleged violation that led to Gray's arrest has not been disclosed. Gray died on Sunday morning at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, likely from spinal injuries . Justice League NYC organized a rally Saturday night at the Western District station where Gray was taken . An attorney retained by Gray's family, William 'Billy' Murphy, described the circumstances leading up to the young man's death: 'On last Sunday morning at about 8am, the police chased Freddie Gray, a 27-year-old healthy man, without any evidence he had committed a crime. 'His take-down and arrest without probable cause occurred under a police video camera, which taped everything including the police dragging and throwing Freddie into a police vehicle while he screamed in pain. 'While in police custody, his spine was 80 per cent severed at his neck. 'He lapsed into a coma, died, was resuscitated, stayed in a coma and on Monday, underwent extensive surgery at Shock Trauma to save his life. 'He clung to life for seven days and died today at approximately 7am. 'We believe the police are keeping the circumstances of Freddie's death secret until they develop a version of events that will absolve them of all responsibility. 'However, his family and the citizens of Baltimore deserve to know the real truth; and we will not stop until we get justice for Freddie.' Anyone who witnessed Gray's arrest or has video of the incident is being asked aid in the investigation . March: Citizens and groups such as the Justice League of NYC took to the streets to protest following the death of Gray on Sunday . Fight for justice: Marchers slowed traffic as they held placards with messages including 'Respect Human Rights' following the death of Gray yesterday . Taking a stand: Peaceful demonstrators walk with their hands on their heads yesterday in protest over the death of Gray who slipped into a coma and died a week after his arrest by police . Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake vowed to ensure that her city held 'the right people accountable' Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said the criminal investigation was underway. He said: 'It's a two-part investigation. 'One is a criminal case, for Mr Gray and also the officers. 'We always have that component in there to determine whether there is criminal culpability.' Rodriguez declined to specify why the officers stopped Gray. 'We had officers in a high-crime area known to have high narcotic incidents,' he said . 'The officers believe that Mr Gray was immediately involved or recently involved in criminal activity and decided to make contact.' Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she had the same questions as reporters: 'How was Mr. Gray injured? 'Were the proper protocols and procedures actually followed? 'What are the next steps to take from here?' She promised a thorough investigation and 'real answers' for the community. Civilian video showed Gray being loaded in the van, but did not show the entire encounter or how he was hurt . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said the department would try again to share information with the Grays . Gray's family has declined, so far, to interact with police, according to Police Commissioner Anthony Batts. He said the department would try again this week to share information with them. Batts said: 'Today, on this holy day, a mother has lost her son. 'Freddie Gray passed. My greatest hope and wish and desire is that any time we have an interaction as a police department or a contact, that everyone goes home safe. 'All lives matter. All lives matter in this city.' The department, an independent review board and the Baltimore prosecutor's office will investigate the case. The Justice League NYC, which organized a rally Saturday night at the station where Gray was taken, held another protest Sunday afternoon at the site. The Reverend Jamal Harrison Bryant of the Empowerment Temple said at Saturday's protest: 'What happened to Freddie was unnecessary and uncalled for. 'All of those police officers involved need to be held accountable and answer for what they did and need to be terminated from their positions.' The first event was scheduled as the league's 'March2Justice' reached Baltimore on its way to a rally Tuesday in Washington. The group said in a statement: 'Enough is enough! Police brutality must end!' Gray's death comes amid a national debate about the deaths of black men at the hands of police. Anyone who witnessed his arrest or has video of the incident is being asked to call police.","Freddie Gray, 27, died Sunday a week after his arrest at the Gilmor Homes .

"The family of a former civil servant have spoken of their fury after he left his £1million estate to Turkish carer Nermin Kancefer (above), who he met just 14 months before he died . The family of a former civil servant have spoken of their fury after he left his £1million estate to a Turkish carer he met just 14 months before he died. Dennis Sears changed his will to leave everything to live-in home help Nermin Kancefer months after she moved in to his £615,000 flat. He disinherited his surviving relatives who had been the intended beneficiaries for more than 20 years. Four months later, he died at the age of 87. His family claimed the carer exploited the 'vulnerable' childless widower, who had Parkinson's disease and was in poor health. But the mother-of-one, 50, insists Mr Sears had a change of heart after falling out with his family. Mr Sears's family challenged the will but agreed a £50,000 settlement in August after they were told legal costs in the case could reach six figures. His nephew Peter Harris, 49, told the Mail the family had always got on well with the various carers Mr Sears had following his wife Kath's death in 2009. But he claimed within months of Miss Kancefer's arrival she was calling him 'Daddy' and they felt 'something was not right'. He said Mr Sears 'suddenly' turned on his nephews and niece, accusing them of conspiring to put him into a nursing home. He instructed solicitors to serve harassment notices to prevent them contacting him. Four months after she moved in, in February 2012, Mr Sears paid £3,000 to buy Miss Kancefer out of her agency contract so she could work for him privately. He also gave her rings which had belonged to his wife of 40 years. He changed his will in August 2012 leaving the bulk to charity and some to Miss Kancefer, but changed it again in December that year leaving everything to her. His estate included his three-bedroom riverside flat in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, and £400,000 in shares and cash. Mr Harris said he and his four siblings visited their uncle – whose late wife was their mother's sister – once a month and he had spent Christmas with their family for decades. He added: 'We built a rapport with Dennis's carers to ensure he was happy and well cared-for. This all changed suddenly when Nermin appeared on the scene. We were incredibly close, he was ensconced in the family. 'All of a sudden there was a dramatic change in his behaviour. She convinced him we wanted to put him in a home and were only after his money. It was so far from the truth. Our only concern was for Dennis's welfare.' He said fighting the will had been 'difficult' as his uncle was proved to have been of sound mind when he changed it. 'We just want people to know the warning signs so this doesn't happen to anyone else,' he added. Dennis Sears' estate included his three-bedroom riverside flat in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey (above), and £400,000 in shares and cash . Miss Kancefer strongly denied any wrongdoing and said Mr Sears was 'extremely happy' with her. She said he was 'angry' with his relatives and it was his decision to disinherit them. She told the Mail: 'I had a special connection with Dennis. He gave me love like I never had from my father.' She added: 'When I found him he was in a very bad condition but he really recovered and was enjoying life.' She claimed she didn't find out about Mr Sears's second will change until after he died. Asked why she thought he left everything to her, she said: 'Because he was looked after very well.' She said Mr Sears had felt 'bullied' by his relatives. 'If he was unhappy why should he leave it to them,' she said, adding: 'If my son does not treat me well I will do the same.' Surrey Police fraud officers were investigating the case but yesterday made the decision to take no further action.","Dennis Sears edited his will to leave everything to carer Nermin Kancefer .

"Channel Ten show The Project has apologised after mistakenly using footage of the wrong African-American comic when promoting upcoming guest on the show, Saturday Night Live star Michael Che. ‘Tomorrow, we’ll chat to the star of the Daily Show and Saturday Night Live, Michael Che,’ the promo promised – although, in a cringeworthy gaffe, two of the three clips shown were of Che’s castmate, Jay Pharoah.

"A species of whale that was feared to be extinct has been found washed up on a West Australian beach, giving scientists an opportunity to learn more about the mammal. The Omura's whale was discovered on a remote Exmouth beach, at the tip of the state's North West Cape, after Tropical Cyclone Olwyn tore through the area last month. It is the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Identifying the 5.68m juvenile female was at first difficult for Department of Parks and Wildlife staff, who eventually confirmed it was an Omura's whale with DNA profiling. Scroll down for video . An Omura's whale was discovered on a remote Exmouth beach in WA (pictured). It left authorities confused as they struggled to identify the rare species . Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the find was 'highly significant' for whale scientists because very little was known about the species. 'Omura's whale was only described in scientific journals for the first time in 2003 and is apparently restricted to tropical and subtropical waters,' he said. 'The knowledge we gain from this whale will help to improve field identification guides to better understand the whale's regional distribution.' The species is usually found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. Omura's whales have a sleek body shape and several unique skeletal features, including 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass has been buried and the skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific investigation and possibly for public display in museums.

For an e-cigarette inspired by Nigel Farage, the site says: 'We all know Nigel Farage likes his ciggies and a pint, now it turns out he is also a vaper!

"An honest taxi driver has made a friend for life after returning a bag a passenger left on the back seat of his car - containing £10,000 in cash. Mohammed Nisar, 55, had been driving sole trader Adrian Quinn to Walsall train station when the passenger hopped out of the vehicle in a rush, forgetting his rucksack. He had been carrying the hefty sum of money after cashing a cheque from his inheritance following the death of his mother - and on realising his mistake says he felt 'dazed'. Reward: Taxi driver Mohammed Nisar (left) accepts a reward from sole trader Adrian Quinn after returning a bag the passenger left in his taxi containing £10,000 in cash . Mr Quinn, 46, of Hereford, said: 'Losing that money would have been the end of my business. I was physically sick! He realised he had left the bag in the car just seconds after Mr Nisar dropped him at the station. He added: 'I was walking across the car park when I realised I hadn't got my bag and I panicked. I tried to flag down another taxi but they all had fares. 'I was sick. My body just went into shut-down and I didn't know what to do.. I was just in a daze. If I'd lost that bag it would have been the end of my business. 'We have built it up from nothing for the last nine years and we are sole traders. We don't have the backing of banks. It is hard work, but it earns us a living.' After eventually flagging down another cab the father-of-three arrived back at the taxi rank in a flustered state to find Mr Nisar sitting in his car with the bag safely on the passenger seat. Honest cabbie: Mr Nisar believes 'honesty is the best policy' and has returned a number of valuable lost items to passengers in the past . He said: 'I was very emotional. I said, ""Do you know what was in that bag? Put it this way, it is not a box of sandwiches or a newspaper. There is £10,000 in there"".' Mr Quinn gave Mohammed a cash reward to thank him - in an envelope marked 'to my best friend in the world' - and has even invited him and his wife to his home for a family meal. Mr Nisar, 55, said: 'He nearly had a heart attack, he was really worried! 'He came up to me and asked if I realised what was in the bag. He was very, very thankful. He had just bought a car but forgot the bag full of money.' It is not the first time Mr Nisar, who has been a self-employed taxi driver for 15 years, has found things in the back of his car. Only two years ago one passenger left a wallet containing £150 in, but Mohammed drove straight back to the man's home to return it. New friend: Mr Quinn hands a cash reward to Mr Nisar in an envelope labelled 'to my best friend in the world' Now, following his latest find, he is urging fellow taxi drivers to do the same if they find themselves in the same situation. Mohammed said: 'At the end of the day honesty is the best policy. There are some drivers who don't return things but what is the point? 'If the council had not have called me and no-one had have claimed it after 12 or 24 hours I would have taken that bag straight to the police station. 'Mobile phones are the most common thing left behind but most of them now can be traced anyway. 'My message is to encourage all my taxi driving brothers that if they find something valuable just give it back.'","Mohammed Nisar had been taking Adrian Quinn to Walsall train station .

"She's just days away from giving birth but, as ever, the Duchess of Cambridge refused to let her style icon status slip during her second pregnancy. Rather than  swaddling her growing bump  under baggy dresses, the 33-year-old dressed to impress every time she stepped out. But while Mulberry coats and Alexander McQueen gowns did creep in, much of Kate's pregnancy wardrobe came from the High Street. Scroll down for video . Favourites: Hobbs, Seraphine and ASOS have all been worn repeatedly during the pregancy . From a £35 ASOS polka-dot dress to  Seraphine shifts, the Duchess is proof that you don't have to splash out to look gorgeous while expecting. Leading the High Street charge to the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe is Hobbs, a mid-range label that has taken her through everything from glamorous evening events to international tours. So enamoured is Kate of the brand, even Zara, of which she was once a die-hard fan, has had to make way for it, although another budget favourite, L.K Bennett,  also remains a favourite. 'The Duchess of Cambridge likes to play it quite safe when it comes to her wardrobe, pre and post-baby, and Hobbs is the perfect brand for her,' explains fashion pundit Simon Glazin. Hobbs: A £160 shirt dress (left) in January and, right, in a peplum top at a Place2Be event in November . 'Not only is it uber British, with everything designed in-house in London, it also dovetails with royal fashion protocol: not too revealing, neutral colours, and affordable.' The Duchess wore a brown shirt dress from Hobbs to visit foster carers in North London in January and a delicate polka dot velvet top by the brand for a Place2Be reception at Kensington Palace in November. On that occasion, she deployed one of her favourite styling tricks and combined the budget top with a glamorous silk skirt by Jenny Packham for maximum effect. But while she championed Hobbs on several occasions during her second pregnancy, it is by no means the only high street staple in Kate's wardrobe. Spot the Duchess! Kate in a £169 Hobbs Dalmatian coat in March that was first seen in 2013, right . The brunette royal is also a huge fan of a small Anglo-French label called Séraphine, which has grown from a small shop in 2002 to the A-list favourite it is today. The Duchess is the brand's most famous fan, having repeatedly chosen the label during both her pregnancies. Along with a £195 coat worn in January and a £95 blue and green floral dress sported to visit the Potteries in February, she also opted for the brand when making her début in New York. On that occasion, it was the glamorous £225 plum boucle Marina coat that was chosen - and true to form, the design has since sold out repeatedly. Séraphine is the brainchild of French expat Cecile Reinaud, who launched the brand in 2002 from a small shop on High Street Kensington, and is no doubt thrilled with the royal endorsement. In March, on a visit to ITV drama Downton Abbey, Kate wore a chic cream coat from high street maternity label, JoJo Maman Bébé. She has also sported a shirt dress from Jaeger and £99 print dress by Alice Temperley during her pregnancy. Cosy: Kate in a £275 Seraphine Maternity Marina coat with Prince William in New York in December last year . Séraphine: Kate in a £195 coat in January and, right, wearing a £59 Vanessa dress in December . Thanks to the much-marked Kate effect, everything she has worn has swiftly sold out. 'One of the reasons for her enduring sartorial popularity is the accessibility of her wardrobe,' explains Glazin. 'It's very real. Very practical. People can relate to her through her wardrobe, which is a clever move from her and her people. 'Nothing is out of reach, and she does wear a lot from the British High Street, which is great to see. It allows people to copy her head-to-toe. People want her hair, her make-up and now her wardrobe. 'People want someone to look up to when it comes to the royals. She is the new generation. 'She, more than any other royal, has made fashion achievable for the public. Diana had an amazing wardrobe but she wore a lot of made-to-measure pieces. 'She's quite safe with her wardrobe, which makes it even more accessible.' Good look: Kate wore a £250 blue Jaegar tile-print shirt dress in a video message supporting mental health .

"Budget airline easyJet has been charging stranded customers a £10 fee for proof that their flight was cancelled. The charge came to light when customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. They were asked to provide an airline letter confirming the cancellation, but easyJet told its hard-hit passengers to pay a £10 fee. Scroll down for video . Compensation: The charge came to light when easyJet customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. Above, file image . The Association of European Airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this and said customers should not be charged. However, a spokesman for easyJet defended the airline’s position, saying: ‘The administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger.’ In an email seen by the Mail in response to one customer’s request, easyJet’s customer service team said: ‘We can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance, that’s not a problem. ‘There is a small administration fee of 10GBP for the letter, which you should be able to claim back through your insurer.’ There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. EasyJet is France’s second-largest airline and cancelled 588 flights over the two days. The airline launched ‘rescue flights’ to repatriate holidaymakers and children stranded abroad. Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Travel chaos: There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. Pictured, passengers queue for check-in at Stansted Airport . And flight cancellations have risen by a fifth in the first quarter of 2015 as services were hit by poor weather as well as the strikes. There were 5,080 cancellations in the first three months of 2015 compared to 4,239 in the same period last year. The number of delayed flights increased by 7 per cent with 2,427 hold-ups compared to 2,260. Monarch had the greatest increase in delays – 30 per cent – with 64 incidents, according to figures from compensation firm EUClaim. Strikes: Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Above, a flight information board at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, where several flights were cancelled . EasyJet has seen a 19 per cent increase with 245 delays in the first four months of this year compared to 206 last year. The EUClaim report said: ‘There are two main reasons for the poor start to the year. Firstly the winter weather across Europe has been worse than 2014 this particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch who suffered considerable delays on their routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. ‘The second cause has been the number of strikes in Europe. The four-day Lufthansa strike resulted in some 116 cancelled flights to the UK, strikes by Italian air traffic controllers and security staff in Germany has also compounded the problem.’","Customers sought to claim after French strikes affected flights this month .

"Although invisibility suits and hover cars are yet to become a reality, it turns out we might be closer to the future than we think. Austrian designers, Maya Pindeus, 24, and Johanna Pichlbauer, 25, have created a robot that takes the effort out of applying make-up - by doing it for you. The device applies eyeliner with a long black brush, while an attachment smears lipstick on lips, before lighting up when the process  is complete. Scroll down for video . There's clearly still a few precision kinks with the Beautification machine created by Austrian designers Maya Pindeus and Johanna Pichlbauer . A visitor lets the machine apply her red lipstick thanks to a crank which creates a circular rotation . The robot made its debut at the exhibition, Biennale Internationale Design Saint-Etienne 2015, in France, and gallery visitors were in for a treat. The machine is composed of three components: a lipstick wheel, an eyeliner applicator, and a mask which illuminates when the 'beautification' was complete. Women were then filmed testing the machine for the two University of Vienna students' art project entitled Beautification. When creating a device for such a personal ritual as applying make-up, anyone would think that the robots would favour precision and speed, but this was - hilariously- not the case. The beginning of the video shows the designers setting up and creating the machine's frame which includes two magnified mirrors. Each device is fitted with chin rests in order to let the user know where to position their faces. Another girl has felt the wrath of the machine, which has dealt her face many random strokes of eyeliner . A gallery visitor rests her head on the chin rest, expecting eyeliner to be expertly applied . The eyeliner is fixed to a robotic arm, which moves the brush in a movement intended to mimic that of a hand, against the backdrop of a mirror with the motto, 'with determined brush strokes the cosmetic ritual takes its course' inscribed into the glass. The lipstick wand is secured to a crank which  rotates in small circles. Once each area has been completed, a mask threaded with LEDs lights up in the corresponding part of  the female face. The video shows how it's only when visitors begin trying out the make-up robot that they realise precision is not the machine's greatest attribute. Each woman rests their chin on the chin-rest and the eyeliner brush is seen swiping wildly, leaving them with smears of kohl on their foreheads, eyelids and along the bridge of their nose. At one point the robot actually smears the eyeliner directly into a unsuspecting girl's eye. The lipstick robot is slightly more successful than the eyeliner robot, as the user can control how much lipstick is applied . Next a woman  trials the lipstick wand but the speedy circular rotation of the lipstick isn't well aligned to the natural shape of a pair of lips. The user is left with a  circular smudge over her  lips and chin. But Pindeus and Pichlbauer say the robots weren't intended to revolutionise make-up, explaining: 'We wanted to explore the relationship between humans and machines.' The designers found the results of the art project were differed from their initial expectations. 'We expected the outcome to be threatening and a little creepy but instead we discovered a very affectionate side in our robot. One woman is waiting for her eyeliner to be applied, with her face directly aligned with the brush . She gets a shock when the eyeliner brush swipes directly into her eye . 'The interaction with our machine made people smile. Its tireless spins, the way it didn’t quite succeed, it seemed to have its own ideas of what looked good in a human face.' On their Tumblr page, the pair explain the inspiration for the project: 'Without us paying much attention, many processes and rituals in our lives have been taken over by machines which are said to be cold and unemotional.' The designers added: 'Our machines, however, have their own will, their own ideals. We want to put users in the beauty care of robots, to experience what it feels like when delicate decisions that are usually made by themselves are now determined by machines.' The third component of the make-up robots is a light mask (pictured), which is meant to illuminate parts of the face it is satisfied with .","Created by designers Maya Pindeus, 24, and Johanna Pichlbauer, 25 .

"A missing schoolgirl was murdered by a 60-year-old man who called police two weeks prior to the killing to see how officers would react to her disappearance, a jury heard today. Robert Ewing, 60, was said to have had an 'inappropriate sexual interest' in 15-year-old Paige Chivers and took advantage of her 'chaotic and dysfunctional' upbringing which had left her 'very troubled and vulnerable'. He is accused of murdering the schoolgirl, from Blackpool, Lancashire, between August 23 and August 27, 2007. Scroll down for video . Robert Ewing, 60, is accused of murdering 15-year-old Paige Chivers (pictured left as a young schoolgirl and right aged 15) after she disappeared from her family home in Blackpool, Lancashire, in August 2007 . Police investigate a site in Thornton Cleveleys in Lancashire during an earlier search for Paige's body . Paige was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home and, despite appeals from police and a £12,000 reward offer from TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle, no trace of her has ever been found. Ewing was arrested in connection with her disappearance in September last year and is currently on trial at Preston Crown Court. The jury was told today how he allegedly rang police anonymously less than a fortnight before she went missing to tell officers that a 'problem child' had turned up on his doorstep having been thrown out by her father. Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, told jurors that the Crown Prosecution Service believes he did so to 'test the water'. He told the court: 'We allege that he wanted to see what official reaction there would be to the suggestion of a 15-year-old girl turning up on the doorstep of a 52-year-old man and the answer he learned, we suggest, was very little reaction.' The court also heard how eight months after the schoolgirl's disappearance, Ewing's friend, Gareth Dewhurst, 46, was overheard in conversation saying he had used his car to dump the teenager's body. Mr Cummings said: 'He then went on to say: ""I didn't want to have sex with her, they made me"".' The prosecutor said a 'highly stoned' Dewhurst told a 16-year-old boy that Ewing had killed Paige and had then made him have sex with her before forcing him to use his car to dispose of her body. Mr Cummings said: 'He (Dewhurst) said that he had put the body in the boot and was saying that he was going to set his car on fire. He was frightened that he was going to get arrested, or that Bob (Ewing) would kill him.' Paige (right) was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home (left) and, despite appeals from police and a £12,000 reward offer from TV host Jeremy Kyle, no trace of her has ever been found . Detectives hunting for Paige Chivers, who vanished in suspicious circumstances more than seven years ago, dug up a farmer's field amid fears she maybe buried in a shallow grave but still no trace of her has been found . An extensive proof of life inquiry has not found any evidence Paige is alive and she has yet to claim a 'significant' inheritance sum left to her on her mother's death once she turned 18, the jury heard. The prosecutor said: 'The prosecution say that even though no body has been recovered, you can be sure that Paige Chivers is dead.' The court heard that Paige's father reported her missing on August 26 and clearly stated she was 15, but her date of birth was wrongly entered on the police system as 1962. 'In consequence, the matter was dealt with as though Paige were an adult aged 45 who had moved on voluntarily, rather than a girl of 15 who was worryingly missing from home,' said Mr Cummings. That approach was not corrected until September 7 when police inquiries then commenced, he added. Ewing, formerly of Blackpool, denies murder and intending to pervert the course of public justice by intimidating witnesses and providing false information to the police in their investigations. Dewhurst, of Blackpool, denies sexual penetration of a corpse and assisting an offender in disposing of a body. The trial continues.

"Graeme Finlay leaving Teesside Crown Court today. He is accused of attacking husband and wife Ronald and June Phillips while on board a cruise ship . After enjoying dinner, an evening show and a drink in the cruise ship’s cabaret bar, Ron and June Phillips headed to their cabin clutching cups of cocoa. But their relaxing night on the luxury liner was shattered by a violent confrontation that left both unconscious. The elderly couple were ambushed outside their room by a passenger who had earlier sat with them in the restaurant and claims that he was snubbed, a court heard yesterday. Graeme Finlay, 53, says he was ‘ignored’ when he joined their table and so moved to another after looking at the menu. He claims Mr Phillips, 70, later struck him with his crutch during a confrontation but the couple say they were ambushed. Mr Phillips and his 69-year-old wife were on a 14-night holiday based in the Canary Islands, which involved seven nights on the Thomson Celebration ship and seven nights in a hotel. Describing the horrific night in January last year – when the liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote – Mr Phillips told the court he had drunk about three gin and tonics when he and his wife headed back to their cabin. Mr Phillips walked with a crutch because of a hip replacement operation and his wife also suffered from limited mobility due to osteoarthritis. He told Teesside Crown Court that he was holding both cups of hot chocolate in one hand and his crutch in the other when they were set upon as they entered their room. Mr Phillips said he was about to follow his wife into the cabin when he spotted someone out of the corner of his eye. The couple were travelling on a Thomson Celebration cruise ship when they were viciously attacked. The liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote when it is alleged Graeme Finlay beat the frail, elderly pair . ‘The next thing I knew I came to with people all around me,’ he said. ‘There seemed to be blood everywhere and broken hot chocolate mugs. I only remember one punch to my head and I was knocked out.’ In her evidence, Mrs Phillips said: ‘I saw Ron lying on the bulkhead and this great big guy going boof, boof, boof [she made a punching motion]. 'He must have hit him five times. I put my hand on his arm and told him, “leave him alone, you will kill him”.’ Prosecutor Lewis Kerr told the court that Mr Phillips suffered facial injuries. His wife was pushed against a wall and also knocked unconscious. She was found to have suffered two broken vertebrae. The crew of the Celebration found bed sheets and a T-shirt in Finlay’s cabin with blood marks. He was not on the ship, which was in port at the time of the discovery, but when he returned he was told to make his own way back to his home in Glasgow. Mr Kerr said: ‘The defendant was interviewed by the police and explained he had an argument with Mr and Mrs Phillips. ‘He accepts he hit Mr Phillips but didn’t accept causing the injuries to Mrs Phillips. He said he was only ever acting in self-defence.’ Teesside Crown Court, pictured, heard how crew members discovered a bloodstained T-shirt and bed sheets in Mr Finlay's cabin. He denies unlawfully wounding Mr Phillips and causing Mrs Phillips grievous bodily harm . It was alleged that after dinner Finlay had shared a lift with Mr and Mrs Phillips and told them: ‘You ignored me, I want an apology.’ Peter Kilgour, defending, put it to Mr Phillips that he swore at the defendant and ‘lashed out at him’ with his crutch. Mr Phillips replied: ‘No. Never in my life have I hit anyone, not even my wife, you can ask her.’ He said there was no row in the lift and that he was attacked without warning. He also denied snubbing Finlay at dinner, insisting: ‘I wouldn’t ignore someone who had sat down at my table. We were in the restaurant for 45 minutes to an hour and didn’t see him again. We just chatted to the other couple. There was no disagreement.’ Finlay denies unlawfully wounding Mr Phillips and causing Mrs Phillips grievous bodily harm. The case continues.

"A Pennsylvania math teacher was called 'dangling candy' by the judge who sentenced her to 30 days in jail for having sex with a 17-year-old student. Erica Ann Ginneti, 35, a married mother of three from Philadelphia, pleaded guilty in December to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor. During her sentencing, Montgomery County Court Judge Garrett D. Page reportedly asked 'What young man would not jump on that candy?' Erica Ginnetti, 35, was referred to as 'dangling candy' by Montgomery County Court Judge Garrett D. Page, who also reportedly asked 'What young man would not jump on that candy?' before sentencing her to 30 days in jail for having sex with a 17-year-old student . Page made the 'dangling candy' comment as he chastised Ginneti for sending the student explicit photos and videos of herself, according to Huffington Post. The former math and calculus teacher at Lower Moreland Township School District had been facing seven to 14 years in prison, but on Friday Judge Page sentenced her to 3-23 months, including the first 30 days in jail and the next 60 on house arrest. Page's comments drew criticism from many people, who were also outraged at what they said was a lenient sentencing. Ginnetti, pictured above with her husband, first approached her victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym . Ginneti will also face three years’ probation, 100 hours of community service and will have to register as a sex offender for the next 25 years, according to The Intelligencer. In court Friday, Ginneti wept as she read a letter of apology in hopes of offering the victim 'closure for this nightmare.' Prosecutors said the boy had seen his grades drop in his senior year and has been struggling with social interactions. The former educator described for the court how she has reconciled with her family and embarked on a new career as a fitness instructor. In her time off, she volunteers at a church, reported Philadelphia Inquirer. Page told Ginneti he was certain she would continue to turn her life around, but he reminded her that her ill-thought actions had had devastating consequences. 'One bad day because of sexual hunger has resulted in all this avalanche of harm,' Page stated. Two months after Ginnetti first met her 17-year-old victim at his prom in May 2013 they drove to an industrial park and had sex in her car . The judge later clarified that he does not think the defendant is a 'bad human being,' but stated she must be punished for her ‘bad act.’ Ginneti's attorney asked the judge to spare her jail time so she could care for her small children. She was fired by Lower Moreland Township School District after her arrest in January. According to investigators, the teacher first approached the victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym. A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis. The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, she sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times. According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July 2013 when Ginnetti and the student met for coffee in Starbucks and then drove to an industrial park to have sex in her car. She then allegedly dropped her paramour back at the coffee shop and told him not to tell anyone about the encounter. The 35-year-old, pictured above after her arrest in January 2014, will have to perform community service and register as a sex offender . As part of her $50,000 bail condition in January, Ginnetti was forbidden from having unsupervised contact with any minors except for her own children - aged 8, 11 and 14 . Authorities say the investigation began after they received a tip-off that students had been overheard discussing X-rated pictures showing a minor and Ginnetti doing 'sexual things.' When police questioned the 17-year-old boy, he came clean about the affair and Ginnetti then also confessed to having a relationship with the student, police said. ‘I would say that she treated her relationship with this student as she would have treated a relationship with an adult with whom she was involved,’ Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told The Mercury News in January. Police said they found several texts the lovers had exchanged discussing their July outing and one mentioning ‘a used condom that had been left in Ginnetti’s vehicle,’ according to the criminal complaint. On the night of the alleged tryst, after he returned home, the student told police he got a text from Ginnetti asking him to ‘do it again.’ As part of her $50,000 bail condition in January, Ginnetti was forbidden from having unsupervised contact with any minors except for her own children, ages 8, 11 and 14. She also had to surrender her passport, and the authorities have been keeping track of her using a GPS device.","Erica Ginnetti, 35, must also serve 60 days under house arrest, 100 hours of community service and three years' probation .

"Jeremy Hunt said a future Conservative government would look into the findings 'in detail' The Mail’s revelations sparked outrage last night with all three major political parties backing calls for an inquiry. There was disgust too among frontline NHS staff and patients. The head of the Royal College of Nursing said nurses who had faced five years of pay freezes would struggle to comprehend the six per cent pay rise for their bosses. Patient groups said the packages were indefensible when patients were seeing spiralling waiting times and cuts to routine procedures. Professor Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, called for an independent review of top NHS pay while Professor Sir Brian Jarman, a senior Government health adviser, called for a public inquiry, saying bosses were manipulating the system. The main political parties promised an inquiry. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘A future Conservative government would ask the Department of Health to look at the Mail’s investigation in detail. 'Too often high executive pay has been awarded as a matter course, not because of exceptional performance. Labour’s Andy Burnham said: ‘Labour will conduct a thorough investigation into this, as part of our plan to ensure pay fairness from bottom to top in the NHS. We have called for loopholes to be closed to prevent abuses.’ For the Liberal Democrats, Norman Lamb said: ‘NHS frontline staff will rightly feel that this situation is unfair. It is right to have an investigation so that these contracts are looked into so that we can make the best use of taxpayers’ money.’ Calling for an independent review, Professor Dacre said: ‘Transparency in the NHS, including transparency of remuneration, is vital to ensure accountability to the patients we serve. An independent review would help to ensure that NHS CEO salaries are fair. ‘It is important that we appoint high quality chief executives in NHS Trusts and their focus should always be on standards of patient care. They should be rewarded for the difficult role that they have taken on, but this should relate to the standard of patient care that they provide and the size of the organisation they run.’ Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, described the findings as 'shocking' Sir Brian Jarman said: ‘It is wrong. It is as simple as that. It seems to be manipulating the system. ‘They should be putting their attention on to lowering their death rates or seeing if there’s a problem with the quality of care rather than getting themselves higher incomes. That should be their priority. It is very worrying. ‘It is something that should be investigated, absolutely, by the Department of Health. Or a public inquiry so you can subpoena witnesses and they must give evidence under oath and if they don’t give evidence that’s relevant they can go to jail for up to 51 weeks.’ The country’s foremost pensions expert, Dr Ros Altmann, said the figures showed executives were ‘milking the system’. She said NHS bosses were signing off their own pay rises and taking advantage of loopholes in the ‘exceptionally generous’ NHS pension scheme. She added: ‘It is outrageous, it is so wrong. 'They think they can get away with it just because the law allows it. But morally it is questionable. ‘It is like the MPs’ expenses scandal. The rules would never have been intended to be used in this manner – they are meant for nurses struggling, who need to keep working to make ends meet. ‘These executives are exploiting the rules for their own advantage. It is not acceptable. There should be independent scrutiny. The idea that senior executives can retire and come back to work to double-dip needs to be rethought. ‘Taking lump sums and then re-employing themselves when there is evidence of failure – that needs to be challenged.’ Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, said: ‘At a time when NHS finances are in crisis, it is shocking that some NHS bosses continue to receive such vastly inflated financial rewards. Nursing staff will struggle to comprehend that their bosses have had an average 6 per cent pay rise when they are only getting 1 per cent this year, having seen their pay fall further and further behind the cost of living over the last few years. Norman Lamb for the Liberal Democrats said frontline staff would rightly find the revelations 'unfair' ‘Senior managers such as chief executives do important and highly valued work, but they should not be getting disproportionate pay rises and bonuses while frontline staff continue to struggle.’ Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the revelations of ‘misallocation of money’ in the NHS required ‘serious attention.’ Roger Goss of Patient Concern, said: ‘These pay packets are simply outrageous. They are indefensible. We need a formal inquiry into this. ‘It is impossible to justify these ludicrous pay arrangements when patients who are being told they cannot have routine treatments on the NHS and are suffering huge waiting times because of stretched resources. Patients will be horrified.’ Campaigner Julie Bailey, who helped expose the horrific neglect at Stafford Hospital, said: ‘The public would be shocked with these huge salaries and added perks. ‘Where else could you fail so badly and yet be rewarded so highly, by yourself?’ Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, said: ‘Staff working in hospitals and health centres up and down the country are right to feel outraged that their pay has been reined in year after year, while their bosses see such huge increases.’ And Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, and an adviser to the TUC, added: ‘This is the private sector’s influence on the NHS gone mad.’ Sue James retired for a day to claim a £155,000 payout . TRICK ONE: Retiring for a day . One of the most lucrative loopholes NHS bosses exploit is the health service’s ‘24-hour-retirement’ rule. In the past, the NHS banned employees from retiring to claim benefits and then returning to the same job. From 2008, however, an exception was written in allowing staff to ‘retire’ for 24 hours to claim retirement benefits before carrying on working. Pension experts said this was aimed to make life easier for highly experienced nurses and other low paid front-line staff and to encourage them not to leave. NHS board members are now exploiting this, allowing them to claim hundreds of thousands of pounds in lump sums from their huge pension pots when they turn 60. This cash can be taken tax-free. But because they only really ‘retire’ for 24 hours, they can carry on drawing their huge NHS salary afterwards. Peter Herring, chief executive at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, claimed a £252,000 tax-free lump sum by ‘retiring’ for 24 hours, before returning to the same position. Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Sue James did the same to claim a £155,000 payout. Despite their public positions, they did not announce their brief retirements and their trusts did not disclose the highly sought-after posts were vacant before re-employing them. Instead, the details were hidden in the small print of their annual reports the following year. Under pension rules, most NHS workers can claim the retirement benefits only if they work for 16 hours or less per week for a month after ‘retiring’ for 24 hours. But none of the executives approached by the Mail team had announced they were working part time for a month – or taken a salary cut accordingly. TRICK TWO: Compensation bonuses . Hospital chiefs were awarded extraordinary compensation payments after quitting their pension schemes for apparent tax reasons. Under national rules, there are tax benefits applied to pension pots up to a limit, which was £1.5million until last year and has since been reduced to £1.25million. As a result, many choose to stop contributing to their pots when approaching the limit. When hospital bosses found themselves in this position, however, some received top-ups to their already huge salaries as compensation. South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Lorraine Lambert withdrew from the NHS pension scheme in 2012/13 as she approached the tax-free pension pot limit. She was awarded £20,000 the following year on top of her £165,000 salary. A footnote in her trust’s annual report stated: ‘During 2012/13 the chief executive withdrew from the NHS Pension Scheme and received additional remuneration to compensate for the loss of the employer’s contribution to that scheme.’ TRICK THREE: Flexible new job . Many bosses retire to claim their huge lump sums – before being re-employed on ‘flexible’ contracts. North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust boss Mike Walker earned more than £1million in 2012/13, including £855,000 in pension-related benefits. He is also entitled to a £220,000 tax-free pension lump sum after turning 60 last October. At the end of 2013, Mr Walker – who has a £1.6million pension pot – was allowed to ‘flexibly retire’. The former medical director is now working on the development of a new hospital and a patient feedback system. Because he is no longer on the board, his new pay is not disclosed. TRICK FOUR: Leaving after pension boost . The generous NHS pension scheme is said massively to favour high earners. The scheme – until this year a final salary system – still uses a calculation method that gives a huge pension boost as salaries increase. If an employee’s salary suddenly goes up, their pension pot will receive a huge boost – sometimes worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. As a result, staff promoted to hospital boards see their pension-related benefits for the year rise dramatically. Many bosses appear to stay in jobs until they get a promotion and a pay rise which boosts their pension, before quitting the year after they have banked the pay out.","A Daily Mail investigation revealed NHS bosses raked in £35m last year .

"A British marathon runner has become the first blind athlete to complete the 'toughest footrace on Earth', which saw him run almost 160 miles across the Sahara Desert. Dave Heeley, 57, from West Bromwich, ran the gruelling challenge over six days as he battled through sand dunes, dried river beds and rocks. The super-fit father-of-three, known affectionately by his friends as 'Blind Dave', took part in the Marathon des Sables where competitors carry provisions on their backs and temperatures can rise to 50 degrees. Scroll down for video . Dig in: Dave Heeley, pictured with his guide, is the first blind man to finish the Marathon des Sables . Endurance: In the marathon, brave competitors run 156 miles in six days across the Sahara Desert . Thumbs up: Father-of-three Mr Heeley has raised funds for the Albion Foundation, a charity that works in partnership with his beloved West Brom to use sport as a way to help the local community . Mr Heeley - who became the first blind man to run seven marathons on seven continents in 2008 - set off on April 5 and hopes to raise more than £30,000 for charity. He was joined by two guides and friends Rosemary Rhodes and Tony Ellis. The 57-year-old crossed the finish line on Friday after running 156 miles and camping in the desert. Tough: In the Marathon des Sables, athletes have to carry their provisions on their back and sleep in tents . Rocky: Mr Heeley struggled with the terrain as he hadn't done any mountain climbing, but still finished the race . Completed: Mr Heeley finished the 'toughest foot race on Earth' on Friday after running almost 160 miles . The Marathon des Sables translates into English as Marathon of the Sands. It was started in 1986 by Patrick Bauer - a French concert promoter. The course is about 156 miles, the equivalent of six regular marathons. It is a six day race and there is only one rest day. Competitors must carry all their provisions for the whole race on their back. Temperatures in the desert can reach 50 degrees during the day and more than 40 per cent humidity, while dropping to below freezing at night time . Other famous Britons to compete include rower James Cracknell. His wife, Debbie, 48, said: 'The terrain was something that he did not know how to manage. 'The team hadn't done any mountain climbing in their training. 'It took them a bit longer than he expected as a result. They were eight or nine hour days running in that heat. 'It was sweltering and he also had to go through sandstorms. The conditions were difficult.' She added: 'They had to do 56.5 miles straight and run through the night at one stage. 'They had to go up a big hill at that part and going down can be just as bad, especially if you can't see. 'I am very proud. It is certainly a tough challenge. 'He has done a number of difficult challenges in the past but this tops it. I am very pleased for him.' Mr Heeley has been raising money for the Albion Foundation, a charity that works in partnership with his beloved West Bromwich Albion FC to use sport as a way to benefit the community. So far, he has raised £20,000 but hopes to reach a further £10,000. Resting up: Mr Heeley ran through the Sahara Desert and then had to sleep in his tent and make his own food . In 2008, the father-of-three completed the Seven Magnificent Marathons challenge which saw him finish seven marathons in a week on seven continents. His route took him from Port Stanley, Falkland Islands (Antarctica), to Santiago, Chile (South America), Los Angeles, USA (North America), Sydney, Australia (Australasia), Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Asia), Nairobi, Kenya (Africa), before finishing with the London Marathon. In another record breaking achievement, explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes became the oldest Briton to finish the Marathon des Sables when he completed this year's course at the age of 71.","Dave Heeley, 57, completed the 156-mile Marathon des Sables on Friday .

"Motorists could be hit with a hike in fuel duty if Labour gets into power, Harriet Harman has admitted. The deputy Labour leader has refused to rule out above-inflation increases in taxes on fuel, alcohol, tobacco or air fares. Asked if the party would raise the levy on petrol, she told LBC Radio: ‘We rule out increasing VAT, the basic or the higher rate of tax, we will put up the top rate of tax, we will not put up the national insurance rates. Motorists could be hit with a hike in fuel duty if Labour gets into power, Harriet Harman has admitted . ‘For all the other taxes that there are – you know, airport taxes, I can’t remember what they are called, airport passenger duties, or alcohol duties or tobacco or petrol – we will lay that out in the Budget.’ Chancellor George Osborne yesterday said the remarks showed Labour would bring back the ‘fuel duty escalator’, which raised the levy by the level of inflation plus 1p per litre, scrapped by the Coalition in 2011. He said: ‘Now we know. Ed Miliband will put up taxes on hardworking people. It’s clear he is planning to bring back the last Labour government’s “fuel duty escalator” – the petrol tax that ratcheted up the cost of filling up your tank, all to pay for ever higher spending on welfare and waste. ‘One by one, we are finding out the £3,028 of tax rises for working families Ed Miliband is planning. He must now come clean and set out what the others are.’ Miss Harman was asked to rule out raising fuel duty by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan during a women leaders’ debate on LBC. Chancellor George Osborne yesterday said the remarks showed Labour would bring back the ‘fuel duty escalator’, which raised the levy by the level of inflation plus 1p per litre, scrapped by the Coalition in 2011 . Mrs Morgan said Mr Osborne’s freeze in fuel duty, which has been extended for four and a-half years, had saved the average motorist £680 and was one of the Coalition Government’s biggest achievements. Fuel duty has been frozen for a fifth year in succession, allowing the Chancellor to boast that motorists have had ‘£10 off a tank with the Tories’. Mr Osborne’s announcement in the Budget last month means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September 1 will not go ahead. And the freezing of duty over the five years of the Coalition means the average driver spends £10 less per fill-up than if the controversial ‘fuel-price escalator’ had been implemented in full. Between 2011 and 2016, a typical motorist will have saved £675, the Treasury calculated. The planned fuel duty rise by the RPI rate of inflation on September 2015 would have increased the current duty rate by 0.54p per litre – from the current 57.95p to 58.49p. For an average family car fill-up of 55 litres, this would have increased the cost by 30p. The RAC said the above-inflation fuel duty ‘escalator’ that operated between 1993 and 1999 ‘is the primary reason that we now pay nearly 70 per cent in tax on every litre of fuel we buy at the pumps’.","Harriet Harman admitted drivers could be hit if Labour gets into power .

"Indiana has seen a 'significant increase' in the number of cases of HIV more than two weeks into a short-term needle exchange program approved by Gov. Mike Pence, state health officials said on Friday. There are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. That's up from 106 last week, said the Indiana State Department of Health. Health officials who declared an epidemic last month have said they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested. But the growing number could put pressure on Pence to extend the 30-day needle exchange program that he approved on March 26. Scroll down for video . More than two weeks into a short-term needle exchange program approved by Gov. Mike Pence, there are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky . Spokeswoman Kara Brooks said Pence is reviewing reports and recommendations from health officials and will make a decision early next week about extending the program beyond April 25. The Scott County outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered painkiller Opana, health officials have said. The county typically sees about five HIV cases each year. Since Pence approved the temporary needle exchange, 5,322 clean syringes have been provided to 86 participants, health officials said Friday. About 1,400 used syringes have been returned. Brittany Combs, public health nurse for the Scott County Health Department, said the needle-exchange program had 'really picked up a lot this week,' in large part because a mobile unit has been traveling around neighborhoods seeking to get more IV drug users into the program. 'It's that trust factor. You have to gain that trust, and I think we're slowly starting to do that,' Combs said. But the future of the Scott County program, as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle-exchange programs in other counties, isn't clear. The Scott County outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered prescription painkiller Opana, health officials have said . Pence opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy. Senate President Pro Tem David Long said on Thursday that the emergency exchange for Scott County was 'the right reaction' but wasn't sure if it is the correct approach long-term. Nor was he sure whether the Senate would support legislation sponsored by House Public Health Committee Chairman Ed Clere, R-New Albany, that would allow the 23 Indiana counties with the highest rate-per-population of hepatitis C to establish their own needle-exchange programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that between 50 percent and 90 percent of people with hepatitis C are also infected with HIV. Health officials say because of this, high rates of hepatitis C are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential HIV outbreak. The House approved the bill on April 7 in a 54-39 vote, and the measure is scheduled for a hearing on Monday in a House-Senate conference committee, which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the Legislature's April 29 adjournment deadline. Long said Pence isn't alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote drug use instead of prevent it. 'At the same time, you adapt and you evolve based on the world we live in, so we're going to have to see if that requires a pivot for us,' Long said. Medical waste containers stored in preparation for Scott County residents that are looking to exchange used needles. The needle-exchange program was created through an emergency executive order signed last week by Gov. Mike Pence in an attempt to curb the state's largest-ever HIV outbreak . Clere said he appreciates Pence's approval of the short-term needle exchange but that 'it doesn't help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak. It's just not enough.' He said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people, including lawmakers, uncomfortable. But he thinks the exchange program shouldn't be viewed as anti-drug policy, but as 'a proven and effective harm-reduction policy.' 'We simply can't afford to view this as a short-term problem,' Clere said. Money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options. Since 1989, the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs. Pence's executive order didn't include money for the Scott County program. 'They asked the state agencies to find their own money. How sustainable is that?' said Dr. Beth Meyerson, co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention at Indiana University. 'There's no evidence that the Pence administration is thinking about this in the long term at all.'","There are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky .

"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered their 8-year-old son and permanently maimed their 7-year-old daughter, but Bill and Denise Richard do not want to see him executed. In a moving op-ed for the Boston Globe, published just a day after the two-year anniversary of their son Martin's death, the Richards have asked that Tsarnaev  be spared the death penalty so that they can finally get closure on the darkest chapter of their lives. Last week a jury found Tsarnaev guilty on all counts related to the April 15, 2013 attack on the Boston Marathon finish line. The penalty phase of the trial starts next week, in which the jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. Scroll down for video . No to execution: The family of Boston Marathon bombing victim Martin Richard wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe, saying they oppose the death penalty for convicted terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The family pictured above on Tuesday, the two-year anniversary of the attack. Clockwise from top left: Denise Richard, Bill Richard, Henry Richard and Jane Richard . Victim: Martin Richard died at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, after the Tsarnaev brothers set off twin pressure cooker bombs . While the Richards say they are thankful to the government prosecutors for their 'tireless and committed' work to bring justice, they are now asking them to drop the fight for execution and sign a plea deal to send the 21-year-old to jail for the rest of his life. 'We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives,' the Richards wrote. 'We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.' They say sentencing Tsarnaev to death will only bring continued pain for themselves and the other hundreds of bombing victims. 'As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours. The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family,' they wrote. The Richards brought their three kids out to watch the Marathon two years ago, and were standing just steps away from where Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan (who died in a shootout with police a few days later) dropped off two pressure cooker bombs. Little Martin died in the blasts and his sister Jane lost a leg. Death or prison? Last week, a jury found Tsarnaev (center) guilty on all charges related to the attack. Next week marks the beginning of the penalty phase of the trial in which the jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison. Tsarnaev pictured above in a court sketch from April 6 . Moments before: Martin Richard is seen circled in blue on the day of the Marathon. Behind him walks Tsarnaev, carrying a backpack believed to have held one of the two bombs . During the course of Tsarnaev's trial, photos were shown in court of the moments before he dropped off a bomb in a backpack, strolling just behind the Richard family lined up against a gate at the finish line. On Tuesday, the Richard family revisited the finish line to take part in a memorial. The family were pictured hugging and crying at the emotional ceremony. The Richards aren't the first to speak out against the death penalty in Tsarnaev's high-profile trial. The Boston Globe editorial board issued similar sentiments and last week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Tsarnaev should 'die in prison'. The death penalty is outlawed in Massachusetts, where the trial is taking place, but since Tsarnaev is being judged in federal court, execution is still a sentencing option. However, experts say that the jurors may sway towards life in prison, considering the state's generally liberally view on the controversial issue. Tsarnaev's lead defense attorney is Judy Clarke, a woman who specializes in helping high-profile clients like the Unabomber escape the death penalty. Clarke and the rest of Tsarnaev's legal team have been trying to paint their client as a gullible young man who was a secondary player in her older brother's terrorist plot. All together: Above, Bill and Denise Richard pictured with their three children before losing Martin (bottom right) in the bombing .

"A woman who died suddenly was eaten by her pet dogs after her body lay undiscovered for days, an inquest was told. Noelle Baynham was found by a close friend who let himself in after she failed to answer the door. The body had been partially eaten by the Jack Russell and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, which are initially thought to have tried to wake her before becoming desperate for food. It is believed the 61-year-old from Winchester, Hampshire, collapsed and died following an accidental overdose of medication. Eaten: Noelle Baynham's dogs started to eat her remains after being locked in the house for days. The most likely cause of death was an accidental overdose, an inquest was told . However a pathologist could not determine the exact cause of death because the dogs, who were trapped in the house, ate parts of her vital organs. Concerned friend Grant Donovan made the 'horrific' discovery of her remains after nobody answered the front door at her home. He told the inquest that he could hear her two dogs barking and jumping behind the door and became concerned that there did not appear to be anyone in with them. Finding the back door unlocked, he entered the house where he said the floors were covered in dog faeces. Walking through, he then discovered Ms Baynham's body lying on the landing. 'This was the most horrifying thing I have ever seen,' he told the inquest. 'I could not look at her long, so I just came away and called 999.' Detectives who searched the house following the grim discovery, on January 17 this year, could find no evidence of a struggle or foul play. The hearing was told how former jeweller Ms Baynham was found was in her dressing gown and had run a bath just before her death. Pets: A Staffordshire Bull Terrier (left) and Jack Russell (right) like the ones owned by Noelle Baynham . Detective Constable Wesley Arnold from Hampshire Police told the coroner that scratch marks on her chest indicated that her dogs may have tried to wake her after she collapsed. Home Office pathologist Dr Amanda Jeffery reaveled that she had probably died 'a few days' before she was found, but because the dogs had eaten her organs it was impossible to establish exactly what had killed her. The 'combined effect' of a variety of drugs found in her system was likely to have been the cause of an accidental overdose, she added. The hearing was told that Ms Baynham suffered from bipolar disorder and chronic alcoholism and was prescribed a variety of medication. Blood tests found a range of drugs in her system including potentially toxic levels of painkillers. Recording an open verdict, senior central Hampshire coroner Grahame Short ruled that there was no evidence of suicide or an accidental fall, but said Ms Baynham may have had a stroke. 'The horrific element in this case is what happened after death rather than before, and it's entirely plausible that when there are dogs in the house with no one to care for them, that they will then start to eat her remains. 'That clearly was a major hindrance to Dr Jeffery in her examination, and as she's explained, she was not able to look at her important organs and she could not establish a clear cause of death. 'I have to say there's no sign to say this was a deliberate overdose. There can come a point where [the drug level over time is] just too high and one pill too many can tip over the balance.' The dogs were subsequently put down on the advice of police officers.","Jack Russell and Staffordshire Bull Terrier were trapped in house .

"Ask any Peruvian where the best place to party is and you'll always get the same reply: 'Puno!' The city's colourful fiestas, combining Spanish and Inca traditions, often last for days. During the fortnight-long Candlemas celebrations, dancers parade through the streets. Men dress as multi-coloured dragons or monsters, while local women, known as cholitas, wear skirts puffed up with petticoats and small bowler hats. Reeds all about it: Hand-crafted boats on the gentle surface of Lake Titicaca . Arriving in Puno, you wonder at first where on earth the inhabitants get their energy. This city of 100,000 souls on the shores of Lake Titicaca could leave you breathless for all the wrong reasons. Situated on a vast plateau in the Andes, at an altitude north of 13,000 ft, it is higher than any Alpine ski resort, and you need to go gently the first few days you're here. Hotels stock oxygen to revive tourists from soroche - altitude sickness - an affliction that causes shortness of breath, headaches and worse. But once acclimatised, you're in for a treat. Though its architecture is underwhelming (with the exception of a splendid central square), what entrances every visitor to Puno is Lake Titicaca. One of the world's largest lakes, and its highest navigable one, it stretches 110 miles by 38 miles across Peru and Bolivia. It is vast, remote, unworldly. The high peaks of the Andes frame it in the distance, some glistening with snow. There are more familiar sights, too. At the town's busy port, you'll see a gunboat called the Yavari, which has a distinctively British look. It was built in London in 1862, then transported, piece by piece, across the Andes to Puno, where it ferried people around for 70 years until the roads made it obsolete and it was left to rot. It was saved from the scrapheap by an English woman, Meriel Larken, who restored and turned it into a B&B. Local life: The ingenious floating Uros Islands in the middle of Lake Titicaca are made from totora reeds . The accommodation onboard is suitably nautical - you sleep in bunk beds. If you're not spending the night, for a small donation you can just tour the ship. The port is the gateway to Puno's fascinating islands. A standard, full-day tour will first take you to the Uros Islands, originally built by the Uru people as a way to escape rival tribes. These man-made floating structures are hewn from mats of totora reeds, which grow abundantly in the shallows of the lake. Secured to the bottom of the lake by ropes, as the layers at the bottom rot, new ones are added to the top to keep it dry and afloat. Stepping on them feels decidedly squidgy, as if you're treading on a giant waterbed. Uru women greet you dressed in wide-brimmed hats and brightly-coloured skirts. Islanders make the most of their income from tourists, so will invite you into their cosy, pointy-roofed huts, which smell of hay. The only hint of the 21st century? A television in the corner. After the Uros, the next port of call is an island in the conventional sense. Taquile, with its craggy, terraced hillsides dotted with sheep, is reminiscent of the Aegean Islands. It's around the same size as Sark in the Channel Islands and home to 1,700 people. A glimpse of traditional Peru: You can meet Uru islanders, and go inside their homes, on the lake . Like Sark, cars are banned here, but the island's elders also forbid beasts of burden, such as donkeys and horses, which leaves the locals to lug everything around on their backs. The other thing you'll notice is that the men all wear distinctive woollen hats, reminiscent of Victorian nightcaps. These denote their marital status - the tip of a bachelor's hat is white to signify it is unfinished. Knitting here is the preserve of men, who pass the tradition down from father to son. On marrying, a man may wear a totally red hat, to show that he, like his hat, is now complete. Early evening in Puno and the streets are abuzz. Head to the pedestrianised Calle Lima and a restaurant called La Casona. Here, you'll eat some of the city's best ceviche, the national dish of raw fish 'cooked' by being marinated in lime juice, a trend that has caught on in the UK. Being so close to the bountiful Lake Titicaca, Puno has some of Peru's best ceviche restaurants. Another excuse, as if you needed one, to visit this wonderful place.

"A 250-year-old sex toy has been found by archaeologists during a dig of an ancient toilet in Poland. The eight-inch leather dildo with a wooden head was discovered during an excavation at an old school of swordsmanship in the coastal city of Gdansk. A spokesman for the Regional Office for the Protection of Monuments in Gdansk, said: 'It was found in the latrine and dates back to the second half of the 18th century. Relic: The eight-inch, 250-year-old sex toy was found during a dig at the city of Gdansk in Poland, pictured . 'It is quite thick and rather large, made of leather and filled with bristles, and has a wooden tip that has preserved in excellent condition. It was probably dropped by someone in the toilet. 'Whether that was by accident or on purpose is anyone's guess though.' Archaeologists at the site earlier discovered old swords leading them to suspect that the place was once a school of swordsmanship. The artifact has now been taken away for preservation work. Historical: The 'quite thick' and 'rather large' sex toy was discovered during an excavation of ancient toilets in Gdansk, Poland . Dildos have been found in some form throughout history, with Upper Palaeolithic artefacts previously discovered being said to be likely used for sexual pleasure. For thousands of years, phallic objects have been used symbolically as a means to boost fertility and ward off evil spirits - but their use as sexual aids has a long history, too. A 28,000-year-old phallus recently found in Germany is quoted as being the oldest known 'sex toy' ever found. While phalluses made from stone, wood, leather and even camel dung have all be found during excavations, or referenced throughout historical text and images. And an Austrian museum even has the world's oldest condom on display together with four other condom fragments dated from around 1650. These were found in a toilet at Dudley Castle in England.","The 250-year-old toy was made from leather with a wooden head .

"From bank overdraft fees to charges for booking tickets and even spending a penny, being a consumer can be a very expensive business. But of all the fees consumers have to fork out for the ones they hate the most are unreasonable parking charges, a survey found. They topped a table of the most-loathed fees and charges in the poll by insurer Direct Line, followed by ATM cash withdrawal fees and debit and credit card surcharges for booking items such as air travel. Most-loathed: A poll found that parking charges topped the list of fees and charges that frustrate consumers the most. A total of 48 per cent thought they should be free, while 31 per cent said they are too high . Asked about their frustration with such charges, 48 per cent said they should be free, while 31 per cent thought they are too high and 15 per cent say they are often hidden. Direct Line spokesman Gus Park said: ‘These types of fees and charges can be very frustrating because they tend to cover things that we either feel entitled to or think we have already paid for as part of another product or service.’ It is hardly surprising that parking costs infuriate drivers as the fines are often extortionate compared to the price of a ticket. Parking charges and fines made councils in England a record £667million last year, according to figures from the RAC Foundation – up 12 per cent on the previous year. Most ATMs are free to use, but those in places such as nightclubs and some corner shops can charge around £1.50 to withdraw cash. Renewing a passport was made £5 cheaper to £72.50 in 2012, but it is still a hefty sum that stands in the way of a foreign holiday. Annoyance: Also high up on the list of most-hated charges are ATM cash withdrawal fees. Most ATMs are free to use, but those in places such as nightclubs and some corner shops can charge around £1.50 .","48 per cent of people surveyed said that parking charges should be free .

"A 16-year-old boy has admitted trying to buy a biological toxin that is 30 times more deadly than ricin from undercover police on the 'dark web'. The teenager from Mossley, Greater Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wanted to obtain abrin online. He was caught after an investigation was launched by the North West counter-terrorism unit in January. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods online without being found by traditional search engines . Today he pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court. He will be sentenced later this month for the offence, which is contrary to the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and Section 1 of the Biological Weapons Act 1974. The dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website, and its successor that were recently shut down, was used to sell drugs in exchange for Bitcoins. Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers. The investigation came after information was passed to law enforcement officers who were covertly in communication with the 16-year-old, who had expressed an interest in acquiring the poison on the dark web.

During the online chats, the teenager showed awareness of the drug's toxicity and the potential for it to be used to cause considerable harm, police said. On February 6, the youth attempted to place an order and also suggested he wanted to make future purchases in larger quantities. Ten days later, warrants were executed at two addresses in the Mossley area of Greater Manchester and the teenager was arrested.

"The United States has issued a very ominous warning to nine Iranian vessels suspected of carrying weapons to the Houthi rebels in the besieged north-African nation of Yemen. It has deployed the massive aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and eight other combat vessels to waters off the embattled country to keep an eye on the shipment - and 'in response to the deteriorating security situation' there. The cargo ships' presence raised fears within the Saudi-led coalition which is helping Yemen's government fight off  Iranian-backed rebels known as the Houthis. The coalition of Arab countries backed by America continued its aerial assault on the rebels in the country today, killing at least 20 in the capital Sana'a. Their assault is aimed at crushing the Houthis who have already taken over regions in northern Yemen and are now trying to expand their gains throughout the rest of the country. Scroll down for video . Warning: The United States has deployed the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (pictured) off the coast of Yemen in response to the worsening security situation in the country . Armed response: The Roosevelt (back) and guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy (front) are among 12 American ships stationed in the waters . Keeping watch: The US fleet is keeping an eye on eight Iranian cargo vessels suspected of carrying weapons to the Houthi rebels in Yemen . Tactical: But Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren refused to say whether the US flotilla - armed with F18 fighter jets (pictured) - would intercept the fleet if it neared a Yemeni port . Dangerous: The Roosevelt (pictured) which carries around 5,000 crew and some 60 aircraft has been deployed to the Yemeni coast along with a group of three amphibious ships and two minesweepers .

Collateral: Residents in Sana'a inspect a bridge which was destroyed by a Saudi-led airstrikes targeting Houthi positions in the nearby city of Ibb . Battle: The cargo ships' presence raised fears within the Saudi-led coalition which is helping Yemen's government fight off Iranian-backed rebels known as the Houthis (pictured) Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said US ships are closely monitoring a convoy of nine Iranian cargo ships but refused to say whether they would be intercepted if they neared a Yemeni port. Warren said: 'We don't know what the Iranian convoy of ships plans to do, but we are watching them... By having American sea power in the region, we preserve our options.' He claimed there has been no communication with the ships and said reports the Americans were preparing to intercept the convoy were 'a bit over-cranked'. The convoy's presence 'is one of the factors' in any US naval engagement but not the only one, Warren added. Nine combat vessels were among 12 US ships in the region stretching from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. The warships included the Roosevelt which carries around 5,000 crew and some 60 aircraft, a group of three amphibious ships and two minesweepers. Three resupply ships are in the area to support combat vessels. Colonel Warren added: 'They are operating in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden with the very clear mission to ensure that shipping lanes remain open, to ensure there's freedom of navigation through those critical waterways and to ensure there's maritime security.' The Iranian vessels were suspected of carrying arms and equipment destined for the Huthi rebels, United States defense officials said on Monday. But they suggested it was more likely that Saudi Arabia, Egypt or one of their allies would intercept the vessels if necessary. An arms embargo was imposed on the Iranian-backed Houthi forces by the UN Security Council earlier this month. The Saudi-led intervention was launched in late March to help pro-government forces fighting the insurgents.

Warning: Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said: 'We don't know what the Iranian convoy of ships plans to do, but we are watching them' Intense ground fighting and airstrikes have pushed the Arab world's poorest country to the brink of collapse. Airstrikes hit a gathering of the Houthis in the western of Ibb today and killed 20 fighters, security officials on the ground have said. Although the rebel-controlled Interior Ministry said 84 people were killed across the country in Monday's airstrikes, the casualty figures could not be independently confirmed. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of arming the Houthis, a claim both Tehran and the rebels deny even though the Islamic Republic has provided political and humanitarian support to the Shiite group. The Shiite nation of Iran has long accused Saudi Arabia of supporting Sunni militants, including the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. In remarks Tuesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he airstrikes in Yemen were prompted by the Sunni kingdom's failures elsewhere, causing what he called a 'mental imbalance.' Speaking to reporters before heading to Indonesia, Rouhani mocked Saudi Arabia by calling it a country with dashed dreams in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, adding: 'All the failures have accumulated and caused mental and emotional imbalance for that country.' The remarks came a day after U.S. Navy said aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt was steaming toward the waters off Yemen to beef up security and join other American ships that are prepared to intercept any Iranian vessels carrying weapons to the Houthi rebels.

"This is the moment a young boy covered in blood was dragged from the scene of a devastating suicide bomb attack in Afghanistan. He was near a bank in Jalalabad early Saturday morning when the attacker detonated an explosive-laden motorcycle, killing 35 people and injuring another 125. The group, which included military personnel as well as civilians, were waiting to receive their monthly salaries as crowds bustled around them when the bomb exploded in the busy commercial district.

Mr Ghani added that Islamic State was starting to establish a presence in Afghanistan. He used his visit to the United States last month to reiterate his concerns that the extremist group was making inroads into Afghanistan. 'If we don't stand on the same line united, these people are going to destroy us,' he told the 600 people gathered at the provincial government headquarters in Faizabad. The rise of even a small Islamic State affiliate could further destabilize the region and complicate U.S. and NATO efforts to end the 13-year Afghan war.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Attacker targeted crowd of military personnel and civilians in Jalalabad .

"From moisturising skin to beating bacterial infections, coconut oil was the health food du jour in 2014. But there's a new superfood on the block, which is thought to enhance your mood, renew skin and even help with menopause symptoms. Reaping with beauty and health benefits, experts say it's time to replace coconut oil with pumpkin seed oil, which is being touted as the the new must-have - and, of course, health aficionado Gwyneth Paltrow is already a fan. Health gurus are touting pumpkin seed oil as the next big thing - and say it can help enhance your mood, renew skin and even reduce menopause symptoms (just ask Gwyneth Paltrow, who features it in many of her recipes in her book, It's All Good) Much like coconut oil, pumpkin seed oil is thought to help boost shiny locks. Pumpkin seeds are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help strengthen hair and even help boost hair growth. When applied to the lengths of your locks, PowerHealth, who supply the health produce, say it  hydrates hair follicles giving shiny and lustrous strands. It also apparently has similar skin-boosting benefits. With high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids and natural antioxidants, pumpkin seed oil helps promote normal cell structure and retains moisture, which ensures skin is hydrated and youthful. Zinc and vitamin E from the pumpkin seed can also improve the skin’s healing process, helping to fight off acne, beat scarring and maintain skin renewal. Pumpkin seeds, left, are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help, strengthen hair. The oil, right, can be drizzled onto food or applied directly to skin and hair to help boost your beauty and health . Studies have even found that pumpkin seeds are a mood-boosting food. Pumpkin seeds and chia seeds topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson. One of the richest sources of tryptophan, pumpkin seeds increase production of serotonin, a hormone that can help improve people’s mood and help us feel relaxed. With a high zinc content, which plays a central role in boosting the immune system and cell division, pumpkin seeds can increase brain power by enhancing memory and focus, claim nutritionists. The potent seeds are also thought to help beat menopausal symptoms. The little seeds are said to be rich in natural phytoestrogens, which can decrease blood pressure, headaches, hot flushes, joint pain and other menopausal symptoms. Pumpkin seeds, pictured, topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson . Nutritional therapist Angela Falaschi told The Telegraph: 'Hot ﬂushes are one of the most common and distressing symptoms of the menopause, with extreme highs and lows in temperature causing episodes of profuse sweating. 'I often recommend supplementing the diet with isoﬂavonoids (naturally occurring compounds) by incorporating chick peas, soya, lentils and pumpkin seeds into your meals.' Gwyneth Paltrow, who penned cookbook It's All Good, loves to use the nutrient-rich seeds in her healthy recipes. Lorna Driver-Davies, Nutritionist at NutriCentre, said: 'Pumpkin seed oil is high in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (a longer chain fatty acid) omega 6, which is beneficial for the skin and hormone support in women. I also recommend pumpkin seed oil to men due to the zinc content. 'But we must be careful to not use too much omega 6 oils in our diet as we need less of them than we do omega 3. A source of omega 3 would be oily fish. When using any nutritional oils, we should all be aware that balance is key and use a wide variety of sources; coconut, pumpkin and fish, for example.'","Experts say it's time to replace coconut oil with pumpkin seed oil .

"A three-bedroom apartment in one of the most expensive areas to live in Britain has been put on the market for just £575,000 - but the 'bargain' property comes with a catch. The Knightsbridge flat, London, which is on sale for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes, has just three years left on the lease. The cost would work out at £191,000 per year, or £15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area. The entrance to the flats in one of the most expensive areas to live in Britain where a three-bedroom apartment has been put on the market for just £575,000 . But if any buyer decides to extend the lease, the property could be worth upwards of £6 million. The 'unmodernised' maisonette in the in exclusive Egerton Place, is described as 'bright and well proportioned' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space. It boasts three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room and utility room along with a lift, parking and a communal garden. The property is being sold by Russell Simpson for £575,000 - the same price as a three-bedroom house in Stanmore, Middlesex. It is one of two maisonettes being sold  with three years remaining on the lease. Both homes will need to be modernised, with the second, larger property - also on Egerton Place - on the market for £595,000. The next cheapest three-bedroom property in Knightsbridge costs £1.5 million, and this flat is only offered with a 28-year lease. But the property comes with a catch, not only is it in dire need of renovation, (such as in one of its bedrooms, pictured)  the home has just three years left on the lease . The cost for £575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £191,000 per year, or £15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area, plus renovation works which are needed, such as in the living room (pictured) But if any buyer decides to extend the lease, the 'bright and well proportioned' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space, could be worth upwards of £6 million . Jake Russell, from Russell Simpson, said: 'Properties like this come up once in a blue moon and I think it is an outstanding opportunity. 'To get properties like this in Egerton Place is very exciting and the phone hasn't stopped ringing, which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner. 'We have had interest from locals, developers and end users. In modernised condition, we would estimate they would sell for between £2,750 and £3,000 per sq/ft.' This gives the smaller property a £6 million prices tag, while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £7.5 million. The current freeholder is thought to be The Welcome Trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and, for a 90-year lease, it is likely to cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million. Egerton Place was built off Michael's Grove by John Grover and Son to the designs of architect Mervyn Macartney around 1893. The properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the Egerton Gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets, finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange. Estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone 'hasn't stopped ringing' about the Egerton Place apartment . But Alex Newall, from Hanover Private Office, had a warning to potential buyers: 'It looks cheap, but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease' Leases of all the homes were granted by the Smith's Charity trustees in 1894, and its first occupant was, Sir Evan MacGregor, permanent secretary to the Admiralty. Other residents of high status included the Dowager Lady Lawrence, probably the widow of the first Baron Lawrence, at No. 5, and Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, Q.C., son of the novelist Charles at No. 2. One property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases. Alex Newall, from Hanover Private Office, said: 'It looks cheap, but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease. 'A developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder. 'It is a very quirky situation. Properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like Knightsbridge. 'I know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought 'right, I need to extend it', but by then it was too late and the extension was too much. 'Let it be a warning to check your lease.'","The Knightsbridge flat has been put on the market for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes, at £575,000 .
It has only three years left on lease putting cost at £15,000 a month -  going rate for renting a three-bed in the area .
Property experts said if a buyer decides to extend the lease, the property could be worth upwards of £6 million .
But renewal would not come cheap with the cost for a new 90-year lease estimated at between £3.35 and £4.5 million ."
"One is a legendary supermodel and the other is quickly following in her footsteps, so it made sense for Naomi Campbell and her modern-day protegee Jourdan Dunn to team up for a new campaign. Naomi, 44, and 24-year-old Jourdan have been unveiled as the faces of Burberry's new eyewear range, the Gabardine collection. The second joint campaign for the catwalk stars sees them cuddling up on set and modelling the seasonal styles inspired by gabardine - a fabric invented by Thomas Burberry and the original material of the iconic trench coat. Jourdan Dunn and Naomi Campbell haved joined forces for  Burberry's new eyewear campaign . The duo show off their razor-sharp cheekbones and flawless skin as they model the new frames, which were designed to reflect the timelessness, craft and innovation of cotton gabardine. Jourdan and Naomi, who are close friends, look chic in the luxury British fashion house's colour-pop collared trench coats. The pair first teamed up for Burberry's spring/summer 2015 campaign, in which they rocked a range of the popular brand's colourful coats and dresses, and toted bags bearing Burberry's distinctive plaid pattern. Naomi, 44, and 24-year-old Jourdan giggle on set as they model Burberry's new eyewear range: the Gabardine collection . The duo show off their razor-sharp cheekbones and flawless skin as they model the new frames . Last year, Jourdan revealed that she and Naomi had a rather unconventional first meeting. Speaking to Vogue.com, she recalled: 'I didn't really have time to be nervous about meeting her. It was at the launch of Kate Moss' Topshop line and I was half naked backstage when she just came running up to me in front of everyone and gave me a massive hug and said, ""hi darling, it's so great to meet you, we must have lunch"".' 'So I wasn't nervous because I didn't have time to register being scared really, I was just thinking: ""I'm half naked and Naomi Campbell is hugging me in front of everyone, and now we're going to have lunch. OK…""' Dunn also previously revealed that Campbell taught her how to look after herself in the fickle world of fashion: by bringing her own snacks to photo shoots in case the crew forgot to feed her. Jourdan and Naomi look chic in the luxury British fashion house's colour-pop collared trench coats . 'She told me I had to look after myself - to remember to look after number one,' said Jourdan. 'She told me to take my own snacks on shoots in case they forget to feed you - which they do sometimes! And she told me not to forget to ask for time off otherwise you'll be booked in for job after job after job and never get a break.' Jourdan was also hand-picked as one of the models to walk in Naomi's Fashion For Relief catwalk earlier this year. Jourdan revealed that Naomi offered her advice when she first started out and told her she had to 'look after number one' The pair first teamed up for Burberry's spring/summer 2015 campaign, in which they rocked a range of the popular brand's colourful coats and dresses .

"A Chinese entrepreneur has quit his well-paid day job to revive the dying art of Chinese sword making. Jia Huaijin, 33, now hand-makes swords in rural China that sell for up to £22,000 each – nearly 18 times the monthly salary of Chinese president Xi Jinping or the average price for a 750-square-foot flat in Shanghai. Mr Jia uses the 2,000-year-old technique to make the traditional swords, which are highly sought after by international collectors from as far as Canada, reports The People's Daily Online. Warrior: Mr Huajin looks like he could have time travelled from the Han dynasty . Hammering away: The molten metal is forged and folded to create the sword . Red hot: The metal is heated in a furnace before it can be shaped . Master craftsman: Mr Huajin is now at home in his workshop, worlds away from his job as a civil servant . Swords feature prominently in ancient Chinese history and the blades made by Mr Jia would have been the type used by warriors in the Han Dynasty. However, the ancient art of sword making gradually declined over the years due to the time and effort it requires. Mr Jia, who now produces swords on the outskirts of Zhengzhou in central China, has previously already been a garage owner, a fish farmer, a sales rep for golfing equipment and a well-paid middle-manager at a state owned enterprise. He made the drastic change in career five years ago at the age of 28, when his job working as a manager in a government organisation left him feeling 'empty'. The craftsman, who looks like a Han Dynasty warrior with his hair tied back, said that he wanted to bring back the masterful act of his ancestors and pass it on to future generations. He decided to take the plunge and move to a remote wheat farm in Henan province with his wife to set up his own workshop. Handling the past: The technique dates back 2,000 years to the Han dynasty . Knife edge: Mr Jia made the life-changing decision to quit his well-paid job to bring back the dying ancient art . He makes the razor sharp swords with steel that is 3mm thick. After heating up the steel in a furnace, the molten metal is forged and folded into shape. The process was developed by sword smiths in order to improve the quality of the steel. At his workshop, swords of different sizes can be seen everywhere – even on tables inside his house – and each of them costs between £11,000 to £22,000. The master sword maker said that his interest in blades goes back to when he was a child. Back then his hobby was to place nails onto railway tracks and wait for trains to pass and press them into 'knives'. Gilded history: Swords have a prominent place in Chinese history and legend . Art work: Each of Mr Jia's swords have elaborated decorations of auspicious symbols such as dragons . Razor sharp: The thin blade can shave off the hair on your arm with the lightest of touches . He said that his wife had been fantastic in backing his ambitions: 'How can I not love a wife who would willingly come to this village to support me in my pursuit of a dream?' She said that all he needed were two packets of cigarettes and a bottle of wine to keep him going. Mr Jia is one of only a handful of craftsmen in China who have adopted this ancient technique of sword making. His work can be seen on display in a special showroom in the Han Dynasty museum in Zhengzhou. All change: He moved with his wife to a remote farm to set up his own workshop . Tempering with fire: Metal is heated up in a furnace, then forged and folded into shape . Restoration: Mr Jia wants to bring back the craft for future generations .","Jia Huaijin aspires to bring back 2,000-year-old sword making technique .

"The family of a Syrian imam who was shot dead on a London street have paid tribute to 'the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet' as counter-terror police continue to investigate his murder. Abdul Hadi Arwani, 48, a fierce critic of president Bashar al-Assad, may have been assassinated by the governing regime in his home country, according to friends. The father of six was found slumped in a Volkswagen Passat with wounds to his chest on a street in Wembley on Tuesday morning. Last night it emerged that Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism officers, who handle political assassinations, were now leading the inquiry because of its potential 'international dimensions'. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Abdul Hadi Arwani had taken part in a demonstration against President Assad three years ago . His son Murhaf issued a statement on behalf of the family, calling for witnesses to come forward and paying tribute to the political dissident who fled Syria after being apparently sentenced to death by Assad's father. 'My family and I have been in a state of shock ever since we learned of this terrible news,' he said. 'We have not slept and our minds are a blur as to what happened and why. 'The police are currently investigating this brutal murder. As an individual, a family and a community, we are helping the police to solve this heinous crime.' Murhaf continued: 'He was the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet. He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. 'He did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. 'He was an old fashioned man who thought love and understanding could cure all of the world's ills. He was always smiling and joking with everyone he met. 'He showed so much love to his congregation and to his community as an imam and a loving father to us, his six children. I don't know how we will cope without him.' Imam: Mr Arwani was a preacher at the An-Noor Mosque (pictured) in Acton, West London, which has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers . The statement said Mr Arwani was a 'peaceful man' who was 'actively involved in the fight against extremism'. 'He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it,' it said, adding that Mr Arwani was 'a British citizen who loved the people of this country'. Murhaf added: 'He loved the idea of democracy and freedom. He loved the idea of freedom for all regardless of religion, race and background.' A source has claimed that the killing had all the hallmarks of a 'state-sponsored assassination', while a friend laid blame at the feet of 'Assad and his cronies'. Last night, the Metropolitan Police said detectives from its counter terrorism command are carrying out the inquiry 'because of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. Mr Arwani was an imam at the An-Noor Mosque in Acton, West London, but was forced to step down last year over reports it was repeatedly linked with extremists. He was found with gunshot wounds to his chest in Wembley on Tuesday morning. He was declared dead half an hour later. His daughter Elham Arwani said her father ran a building company and had been visiting Wembley in connection with his work. Speaking from the family home yesterday, the 23-year-old said: 'We have no idea what happened. We don't even know how he was killed. We have just been told he was killed and that's it. 'Any Syrian who is free and who knows the truth is against Assad. It's not going to be because he was against Assad. It must be for another reason, but we can't think of anything.' She described her father as a 'loving father and husband' and added: 'He was the best person, always helping everyone. His phone would ring 24/7 with people asking for help and advice.' At least 200 mourners gathered to pay tribute to him last night at Nadi Park Royal in Willesden Junction, north west London, where he preached every Wednesday. Preacher: Mr Arwani was known for his outspoken opposition to the Assad regime . Mourners claimed the  imam was a peaceful man who opposed extremism. Some speculated that he may have been killed in a hit from the Syrian regime or because of a disagreement over management of the west London mosque. One also said that he had visited Syria 10 times in recent years but had been ordered by the Turkish government to stop and had been questioned by security services at an airport there. Dr Khaled Kamaraldi, who gave Arwani his first job as a builder 15 years ago, said: 'He went out to Syria to educate the fighters about the treatment of prisoners of war and about human rights. 'He said if you behaved like the Assad regime you become like them. He was questioned by security services but they let him go. He said everything in his heart.' He added: 'This was a state kill. Assad was behind it, and if not Assad one of his cronies. He was very active against the Assad regime. But he was a conciliator, he was not violent. 'What shocks me is they shot him in broad daylight in the centre of London. They have no respect. There is no doubt the police will get him.' Home: Mr Arwani, originally from Syria, lived in this home in White City, west London . One friend, solicitor Mohammad Bassam Tablieh, 43, from west London, said there could be 'two reasons behind his killing'. He said: 'Number one: a dispute about running the mosque. Number two: his activities against Assad. He was an active member of the opposition against Assad. 'There was a problem with dealing with who is imam at the mosque. He had nothing to do with extremism at all he was a very moderate person, very peaceful.' He added that many people in London who had green flags in there car as a symbol of being anti-Assad have had their tyres slashed but did not know if Mr Arwani had one in his vehicle. But Haras Rafiq, managing director of anti-extremist think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, said it was too early to start speculating about why Mr Arwani was killed. He said: 'He was definitely anti-Assad, he was very vocal and we all know that. But he wasn’t necessarily Assad’s biggest enemy here in the UK. I am just thinking ""Why him?"" and not other people that we know are more vocal and more active. 'They have got other problems, more serious problems in Syria. If the murder was carried out on behalf of Assad, then that would suggest that they are looking at people abroad, but it is not something that I have come across.' Mr Rafiq added: 'Arwani himself wasn’t actually extremist. He wasn’t on my radar as somebody who himself held extreme hatred-based views. However, the centre that he was involved in was quite controversial.' Mr Arwani was involved in violent anti-Assad demonstrations outside the Syrian Embassy in London in 2012 . Mr Arwani grew up in Hama, the site of a notorious 1982 massacre where up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the Syrian Army under the orders of Hafez al-Assad, the current president's father. In a lecture he gave in 2012, Mr Arwani described how the Assad regime had sentenced him to death, forcing him to flee his homeland, and then harassed his elderly relatives for three decades. Mr Arwani, who was just 16 at the time, said that he took a series of photographs chronicling the damage done to mosques and houses in the city, and was sentenced to death by the authorities for it. 'When they found out that I did that, they issued a capital punishment against me, when I was 16 years old - so I had to flee from Syria,' he said. The teenager bribed a policeman so he could leave the country, he said - but for the next 30 years, the authorities questioned his parents once a month in an attempt to find out where he had gone. Mr Arwani blamed the atrocities carried out by the Assad regime on its supposed abandonment of Islam, saying that from the 1960s the government 'started to implement atheism, and take off Islam from the life of the people'. He also claimed that Muslim scholars were forced to stop working as imams, and told to take jobs selling cosmetics instead. The Assad regime has been known to assassinate its political opponents in the past, most prominently the Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri, whose killing in 2005 was blamed on the Syrian government. The An-Noor Mosque, where Mr Arwani used to be one of the main imams, has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers. The mosque became notorious in 2013 when a terror suspect went there and changed into a burqa in order to escape surveillance then went on the run. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed has been missing for 16 months, and was last seen entering An-Noor dressed as a man before leaving in a full-length covering designed for women which obscured his identity. He was subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure, which restrict the movements of people suspected of involvement in terrorism. Other extremists linked to the mosque include Uthman Mustafa Kamal, the son of hate preacher Abu Hamza, who has regularly led prayers at An-Noor. Three years ago, another preacher delivered a sermon arguing that 'Jews, Zionists, all of those people' who mock the prophet Muhammad deserve to face 'the sword'. Some friends of Mr Arwani said that he had left the mosque after a dispute about money, despite reports that his departure was linked to extremism . Ali Belai said: 'Nothing he said was ever extremist. The management forced him out of the mosque. There was conflict over money. I think it was about £30,000.' Anas Qamar, another Syrian exile, said that Mr Arwani had been involved in a High Court battle over the mosque's finances when one of the trustees allegedly embezzled money from worshippers. 'Abdul Hadi said the mosque was a charity and should not be run to profit one man,' he said. 'He was banished by the mosque.'","Abdul Hadi Arwani was found dead in on a street in Wembley on Tuesday .

"Unexpected: Waitrose announced yesterday the early arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year . Our glorious spring has accelerated the growing season - and supermarket shelves are already bursting with English summer fruit and veg. Usually at this time of year we would still be eating vegetables imported from Spain and South America. But thanks to endless days of sun and temperatures we would not expect until August, English tomatoes and asparagus are already on the shelves, weeks ahead of usual. Waitrose announced yesterday the early arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year. It is stocking large Jack Hawkins, aromatic Red Choice and tiny Baby Plums, all grown in greenhouses across England. And the supermarket has been stocking asparagus since the beginning of the month. Strawberries are also already on the shelves - far earlier than normal - and English raspberries saw their earliest ever appearance in the last week of March. Morrisons, meanwhile, yesterday predicted Britain would have best crop of asparagus for nearly a decade. The chain estimates that the asparagus crop could be up 20 per cent this year compared to average, having received an early boost of high light levels and warm temperatures. Morrisons asparagus buyer David Bartle said: ‘Growing conditions look like they are going to be perfect. ‘The good weather will not only affect the amount of asparagus grown but also the quality of the crop. We could have the most exceptional year since 2007.’ Peter Cooke, Waitrose vegetable buyer, said: ‘Our customers can choose from a wide variety of home grown tomatoes and in bigger quantities than this time last year.’ The sunny spell is set to continue until later this week, when the weather will take a turn for the worst. The mercury is set to hit 21C (70F) as the Queen celebrates her 89th birthday today (Tuesday) - making it hotter than Ibiza, Athens and Barcelona. But rain, cloud and cooler temperatures are predicted for the second half of the week.

He said: ‘There has been lots of sunshine around and the temperatures have been pretty decent for this time of year - temperatures have hit 19C in Sussex and 18C in London. But he added: ‘By Thursday a lot more cloud will be around in general and there will be light rain over Scotland. ‘For most it will be a dry day still with some sunny spells, but generally that cloud is the herald of slightly more unsettled weather. ‘The high pressure that has been dominating for the past few days moves over and we see a bit more of what you would expect this time of year.’","Usually eat vegetables from Spain and South America at this time of year .

"A Polish prince has challenged Nigel Farage to a sword fight over his attacks on immigration. Janek Zylinski, the aristocratic son of Polish war hero who fought the Nazis in 1939, posted the challenge online after declaring that he had 'had enough' of the Ukip leader. Brandishing his sword, Mr Zylinski said: 'Enough is enough, Mr Farage. So what I'd like to do is to challenge you to a duel. I'd like us to meet in Hyde Park one morning, with our swords, and resolve this matter.' Janek Zylinski, the aristocratic son of Polish war hero who fought the Nazis in 1939, posted the challenge online after declaring he had 'had enough' of the Ukip leader . The Polish prince, who lives in Ealing, West London, begins his video by introducing a gold sculpture of his father, Captain Andrzej Zylinski. The cavalry officer led a victorious charge against the Nazis in Kaluszyn, near Warsaw, in 1939, helping to save 6,000 Jews. In the online video he declares that he has had enough of the discrimination against immigrants from people such as Mr Farage. He said: 'I've had enough of the discrimination against Polish people in this country.' Mr Zylinski added: 'The most idiotic example I've heard of has been Mr Nigel Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the M40.' The prince says a duel with swords is what any self-respecting 18th Century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman would do. But Zylinski also offers up an alternative way to settle their differences. He says that 'if his sword is a little rusty, we could meet in a studio for a duel of words in the run up to the election.' The Ukip leader was today forced to defend his stance on immigration after meeting an Eastern European worker during a factory tour in Essex. Nigel Farage, the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, chats to a supporter during campaigning in Clacton, Essex . Mr Farage (centre) and parliamentary candidate for Clacton Douglas Carswell (left) meet staff during a visit to hinge manufacturer NICO in Clacton, Essex . Mr Farage was visiting hinge manufacturer NICO in Clacton as he spoke of the need to boost manufacturing and improve skills among British workers. During a tour of one of the factory's workshops, he met Hungarian Ivan Loncsarevity, 62, who has lived in Colchester for five years after travelling to the UK for work. Mr Loncsarevity could not answer questions as he does not speak any English but was described by colleagues as 'relatively low-skilled'. The firm's manufacturing manager Steve Dalton confirmed that the company needed to look to Eastern Europe to fill a skills gap and on occasion had flown potential employees from Poland. Mr Farage displayed his Union Flag themed socks out campaigning today . Asked about the encounter and whether Mr Loncsarevity should be working in the UK, Mr Farage said: 'Ukip has never said anyone should leave the country, so the question is entirely baseless. 'One of the big problems that we've got in engineering is a real shortage of young people studying engineering to go into trades such as this, which is regrettable. 'We've got rid of technical colleges and encouraged more and more young people to go to university and study degrees which are not directly linked to industry such as this. 'If there's no British person trained to do that job, then that says more about us than them.' Mr Dalton said he was not a Ukip supporter but did not oppose the party's proposal of an Australian-style points system designed to limit the number of immigrants. He said: 'There needs to be some controls but presumably, if we needed to fill a skills gap, we would still be able to do that under such a system.' The company employs 130 people, six of whom are migrants from Eastern Europe. Finance director Gillian Hagger said: 'A lot of industries in the UK do need migrant workers. 'The area we're in means we've got a large pool to recruit from but sometimes we find their skills are limited. 'On those occasions we have had to look further afield, including flying interviewees in from Poland.' Later Mr Farage visited the town's Copping Community Centre with Douglas Carswell - the first person to be elected as a Ukip MP after defecting from the Conservatives. He met supporters and again spoke of the lack of young British people pursuing careers in manufacturing and leaving engineering firms with a 'genuine shortage' of skilled workers. He said: 'We will say that anyone doing engineering at degree level should not be paying any tuition fees.'","Janek Zylinski, the aristocratic son of Polish war hero, slams Mr Farage .

"Ed Miliband today pledged to protect the jobs of 10,000 police officers as Labour claimed Tory cuts had allowed rapists and violent criminals to go free. The Labour leader said the bobby on the beat is 'at risk of disappearing', while rising numbers of serious criminals 'are being let off the hook'. But the launch of Labour's criminal justice plans risked being over-shadowed by the news that the party's police adviser, Lord Stephens, is be investigated over hotly disputed allegations of a cover-up of police corruption in the bungled Stephen Lawrence murder probe. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the bobby on the beat is 'at risk of disappearing', while rising numbers of serious criminals 'are being let off the hook' Mr Miliband hopes to get back on the front foot today with the promise of action to protect community policing. It comes after the chaotic launch of a plan to abolish non-dom tax status for foreigners and a deeply personal row with the Tories over claims he 'stabbed his brother in the back' and would do the same to Britain to get into power. Today Labour claims the police are 'struggling to keep up' with the rise in child sexual exploitation, terrorism and online crime while public safety is being 'put at risk' by a chaotic prison and probation system. Police and crime commissioners (PCCs) would be axed to help fund the £800 million plan to guarantee neighbourhood policing across England and Wales. PCCs were set up by the Tories to increase accountability, but turnout was just 15 per cent in elections held in 2011. Mr Miliband said: 'Because of the Conservatives' decisions, neighbourhood policing - the foundation of good British policing - is at risk of disappearing, whilst increasing numbers of serious criminals are being let off the hook. 'Labour has a better plan. We will make different choices, finding savings to safeguard 10,000 officers in the next three years. 'We will ensure victims are at the heart of the criminal justice system with the country's first ever victims' law. And we will ensure the police have the powers they need to keep us safe, including proper controls for dangerous terror suspects.' Mr Miliband and shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper joined with police officers from Ollerton Police Station during a walk around New Ollerton in Nottinghamshire . Ms Cooper claimed the Tories were planning deeper cuts to policing in the next Parliament 'even though the police are already struggling to keep up with rising complex cases' New laws would introduce a local policing commitment that required forces to guarantee neighbourhood policing and 10,000 officers would be safeguarded for three years, the party said. Axing the PCCs combined with charging higher fees for gun licences and requiring police forces to share services and carry out joint procurement would fund the plans, according to Labour. Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington headed an independent commission on policing by the Labour party. However, last night it emerged the former Metropolitan Police commissioner and crossbench peer, is to be investigated over the Lawrence murder inquiry. Labour said new laws would introduce a local policing commitment that required forces to guarantee neighbourhood policing and 10,000 officers would be safeguarded for three years . The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it will investigate claims that the former Met chief failed to hand over key information to the Macpherson Inquiry regarding the black teenager’s race hate killing. The watchdog probe stems from a complaint from Stephen’s father Neville Lawrence. Lord Stevens was deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1998 to 2000 – while the Macpherson Inquiry report was being compiled – before serving five years as the UK’s most senior policeman. The complaint concerns a letter to the Macpherson Inquiry in 1998, in which Lord Stevens stated that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption. It is alleged that the letter included misleading information. A source said: ‘Any suggestion that anyone from the Met would seek to withhold the truth from the Macpherson Inquiry at that time is completely untrue. Last year Mark Ellison wrote to Lord Stevens to say he had done nothing wrong.’ Last night, Channel 4 News – which revealed details of the IPCC probe into Lord Stevens – quoted him as saying: ‘Step very carefully, I’m not putting up with any more c**p about this.’ Quoting from a letter he received from Mr Ellison, Lord Stevens was reported to have said: ‘No one is suggesting that you did anything that was culpable in any way.’ Despite the revelation, Lord Stevens was quoted by Labour backing their policing plans. He said: 'This is the right plan for neighbourhood policing, following the plans set out by the independent commission I had the pleasure to chair. 'It is not credible to say you can take away resources on the scale the Government are talking about without wiping out neighbourhood policing. ;And it doesn't show the right priorities to be spending significant sums on police and crime commissioners, nor to be ideologically opposed to the shared services and joint procurement that simply must be driven through.' 'Cover-up': Former Met Police commissioner Lord Stevens (left) is to be investigated into allegations of a cover-up over the Stephen Lawrence murder probe in the nineties . Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'Under the Tories we've seen fewer police on the beat, longer waits for 999 calls and less justice for victims as there have been fewer arrests and prosecutions for rising crimes like violence, rape or child sex offences. 'Now they plan deeper cuts to policing in the next Parliament even though the police are already struggling to keep up with rising complex cases such as child sexual exploitation, terrorism or online crime.' Labour's manifesto will commit to improved crime prevention and the introduction of a new child protection unit to tackle sexual exploitation. Prison reforms would see inmates spend more time working and learning while the controversial Prevent programme Labour introduced to stop radicalisation would be overhauled as part of plans to deal with the growing terror threat. But Tory Home Secretary Theresa May said the Government had increased the proportion of officers on the frontline. She added: 'These are the same tired, unfunded promises from a Labour party who tied up the police with red tape and central targets, and who have opposed everything we have done to help the police do more with less. 'People have had enough of Labour's made-up numbers and scaremongering. When we started to clear up the mess left by their legacy of debt, they warned that crime would rise. They were wrong: crime is down by more than a fifth under this Government, and has never been lower.'","Miliband warns cuts mean rapists and violent criminals have gone free .

"It is hard to believe that the mansion you see before you, with its bronzed clock tower and cherry wood doors, was initially a garage and chauffeur's residence that would have been home to a Rolls Royce, or two.

"Isabelle Obert, a nutrition consultant, believes a good diet can affect the health of the sperm and the egg before they even meet . One in seven couples have trouble conceiving - and it's often not clear why. But one nutritionist argues that a good diet can affect the health of the sperm and the egg before they even meet. Isabelle Obert, who runs Nurture Me Fertility, believes a diet rich in minerals, vitamins, essential fats and proteins can prepare both a man and a woman's body for conception. Writing for Healthista.com, Ms Obert said: 'I believe passionately that good nutrition is important for 'good' fertility. 'Many of us are leaving it until much later to start trying for a family, by which time our fertility may not be what it was. 'We will have been exposed to more hormone disrupting chemicals, more free radicals to damage egg and sperm quality and of course much more stress - which can have wide-ranging negative effects on our bodies.' She goes on to explain how the health of both the sperm and the egg - even before they meet -  can affect the outcome of the pregnancy and the health of the baby, child and even through to adulthood. Ms Obert adds: 'I also think food should be fun, delicious, moreish, colourful, fantastic. We should live to eat, not eat to live.' Here, she reveals her list of ten top foods to boost fertility, plus some tips on how to prepare them... AVOCADOS . Avocados are nutritional powerhouses packed with minerals, vitamins, essential fats, protein, carbohydrate and fibre. They are a fantastic source of vitamin E, which studies have shown can be beneficial in improving endometrial lining (the lining of the uterus). They can also help with embryo implantation, which is how a fertilised egg becomes a pregnancy. Avocados are also an excellent source of folate. It is known that consuming foods high in folate - as well as taking a folic acid supplement - can help prevent spina bifida. 'Avocados are nutritional powerhouses packed with minerals, vitamins, essential fats, protein, carbohydrate and fibre,' Ms Obert said . Top Tip: Choose carefully as a ripe avocado is nectar — sliced onto wholemeal or rye toast, topped with cherry tomatoes, basil and a drizzle of peppery extra virgin olive oil makes a nutritious and delicious breakfast. BUTTERNUT SQUASH . This is one of the most nutritious and healthy vegetables you can eat, with a rich array of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants - as well as significant amounts of digestible fibre. It's rich in beta-carotene, which is known to help boost production of the hormone progesterone. It can also help increase both sperm quality and count, the latter according to a study published in the medical journal Fertility and Sterility. Ms Obert recommends beetroot juice for women undergoing IVF treatment as a way to improve blood flow to the uterus to help with embryo implantation . Top Tip: Butternut squash is hugely versatile -it’s delicious roasted with garlic, thyme and black pepper, or spice it up in a warming curry or soup. BEETROOT . A fantastic source of the antioxidant resveratrol, which is thought to help combat against age- related infertility, beetroots are also rich in nitrates. These are well known to improve blood flow and are often used by athletes for this purpose. I particularly recommend beetroot juice for women undergoing IVF treatment as a way to improve  blood flow to the uterus to help with embryo implantation. Top Tip: Forget pickled beetroots from school lunch days — try quartering small fresh beetroot, tossing with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and whole garlic cloves. Add some fresh oregano, thyme or marjoram, place in a tinfoil pouch to avoid burning and roast in a hot oven. SALMON . Salmon is a great protein source, rich in many nutrients but particularly anti-inflammatory omega 3. Research has shown that optimal levels of omega 3 are important in the management of female infertility. For general health, salmon is excellent for the cardiovascular system, boosting brain function and eye health. Ideally it should be wild or organic in order to avoid unnecessary pesticides, fungicides and excessive omega 6 consumption found in conventionally farmed fish. Top Tip: Salmon works beautifully with oriental flavours - try it grilled with a teriyaki glaze and a crunchy vegetable stir-fry. Butternut squash is rich in beta-carotene, which is known to help boost production of the hormone progesterone and increase sperm quality and count . POMEGRANATES . In ancient Persia, pomegranates were seen as a symbol of fertility and this still exists today in some countries. In fact, research shows that drinking pomegranate juice during pregnancy may prevent brain damage in babies. Pomegranates are also rich in many nutrients, including vitamin C, vitamin K, folic acid and several other vitamins and minerals. And they are known to have anti-ageing properties, anti-cancer properties, can be helpful for cardiovascular health and bone health and have anti-inflammatory properties as well as helping boost blood flow. Top Tip: Incorporate pomegranate seeds with quinoa, walnuts and fresh mint for a Middle Eastern experience. Pomegranats are rich in vitamin C, vitamin K and folic acid. They also boost blood flow, which is important for people trying to conceive . EGGS . Eggs are among the most nutritious foods you can eat — after all, they contain the nutrients to turn a single cell into a baby chicken. They are rich in choline, which studies have shown can have significant positive effects on foetal development that may have a lasting influence into adult life, according to a study at Cornell University. Eggs are also rich in many different vitamins and minerals, as well as essential fats, and of course are an excellent source of protein. Not only this, they are good value and have a multitude of uses. Walnuts are beneficial for sperm quality as they are good sources of omega 3 and vitamin E . Top Tip: When time and inclination are in short supply, why not top a wholemeal English muffin with wilted spinach, a poached egg and some black pepper for highly nutritious simple supper. WALNUTS . Walnuts are packed with health-giving nutrients which include cancer fighting properties (they’re known to reduce prostate and breast cancer risk). They can be beneficial for sperm quality, are excellent sources of omega 3 fats and vitamin E, which is great for endometrial health, as well as B vitamins and protein. In fact, walnuts could be called ‘king’ among nuts and, according to a study by the Society for the Study of Reproduction at UCLA, a handful of walnuts daily was linked with increased sperm vitality, motility and morphology. This means how healthy and fast sperm are, and whether they are normal-shaped. Top Tip: Eat raw as a simple snack or add flavour and crunch to boost a superfood salad. QUINOA . This little seed is highly nutritious, a complete protein. It’s gluten-free and rich in many minerals and vitamins as well fatty acids and fibre – a great alternative to starchy grains such as couscous and bulgar wheat. A real superfood. The Mediterranean diet is widely recommended for optimal fertility, as it is rich in vegetable proteins, and quinoa makes the perfect addition as it goes without saying protein requirements are raised when trying to conceive and during pregnancy. Top Tip: Quinoa cooks like rice, top with vegetables roasted with plenty of garlic and herbs, drizzle with fruity olive oil and sprinkle with toasted pine nuts for a Mediterranean treat. Protein requirements are raised during pregnancy, and quinoa is a great source of protein, Ms Obert said . WATERCRESS . Watercress is a member of the cruciferous vegetable family and rich in many nutrients including vitamin C, vitamin K, calcium, beta-carotene, iron and iodine — which is often lacking in the Western diets of today. Asparagus is high in folic acid, which is well-known to be important for male and female fertility . Watercress is well known to be a superfood, rich in age-defying antioxidants that may help to prevent or slow the oxidative stress induced by free radical damage. Several studies have found watercress has significant anti-cancer properties and can help repair DNA damage. Top Tip: What a crime to use just as a garnish — make it the main attraction in soups and salads. ASPARAGUS . Asparagus is high in the potent antioxidant vitamin C and folate (folic acid) amongst other health giving nutrients and a valuable addition to your diet. The importance of folate is well documented in research for both male and female fertility. Top Tip: Lightly steam asparagus and dip into boiled eggs, or grill and sprinkle with balsamic vinegar and shavings of parmesan.","Isabelle Obert, a nutrition consultant, believes good diet can boost fertility .

"A boy of 13 has become one of the UK's youngest murderers after he was jailed for killing a woman he had just mugged by stamping on her face so hard it left a footprint on her cheek. Shocking CCTV footage shows the horrendous moment Petri Kurti murdered 47-year-old Glynis Bensley before he fled to a nearby park in Smethwick, West Midlands and boasted about the savage attack. The schoolboy, who can be named after a judge lifted a reporting restriction order, was jailed for a minimum of 12 years today and will be on licence for life. His co-defendant, Zoheb Majid, was sentenced to 10 years behind bars for manslaughter and robbery. Scroll down for video . CCTV of the attack was shown in court, with 13-year-old Kurti seen jumping Ms Bensley as she walked home. Co-defendant Majid then joined in, with the pair leaving her for dead in a pool of her own blood . Killed: Glynis Bensley was murdered by Petri Kurti, 13, as she walked home in Smethwick, West Midlands . Sentencing Judge John Warner said the boy had been 'running wild' in his home life. 'You come from a home where there has been a complete lack of boundaries or structure where neither parents understand the seriousness of your behaviour - they blame others. 'This reinforces your own clear reluctance to take responsibility for your own actions.' Previously the court heard how the pair had teamed up with the sole intention of carrying out a violent robbery. CCTV footage captured Kurti jumping Ms Bensley in the street as she made her way home from Seven Stars pub. Majid joined in seconds later before the pair flipped her body over to ransack her pockets. Kurti was then filmed stamping on her face, leaving a shoe print on her skin. The court previously heard that both Majid and the teenager thought Ms Bensley was a man because of her clothes and haircut. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter but was found guilty of murder following a trial last month. Kurti had been excluded from school and a pupil referral unit for his aggressive behaviour, and as young as he was, already had previous convictions for attempted theft, assault with intent to steal and battery. He sentenced the 13-year-old to 12 years imprisonment for the murder with five years concurrent for robbery. Also jailed: Zoheb Majid, 20, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for manslaughter and robbery . He was given another 12 months, to run concurrently, for another street robbery carried out with his 25-year-old sister whilst on bail for the murder on February 4. The teenager was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure - the equivalent of a minimum term life sentence for a youth. Judge Warner added while Kurti had boasted of the attack afterwards, he demonstrated 'criminal maturity'. 'I'm in no doubt that she was targeted by you both, selected to be robbed' he continued. 'She was chosen by you because she was clearly in a vulnerable condition. 'It started with you Petri Kurti punching her and she went to the ground. 'She suffered a minimum of two blows. There was a clear print of a shod foot visible on her cheek, she had been stamped in the face. 'You Petri Kurti were just 13 when you committed this murder, on the streets late at night effectively running wild. 'This was a murder committed for gain, a night time robbery. The victim was vulnerable and targeted as such. 'Zoheb Majid, you're about to turn 21. 'You knew what you were doing and knew what you were involved in. You knew the victim of this night time robbery was a vulnerable person.' Earlier the court was told Kurti 'was not a mature' 13-year-old. His solicitor, Michael Turner QC, said: 'He's operating at a level of a seven to 11-year-old in terms of his cognitive ability. 'He has real learning difficulties. He accepted the act that caused the death and limited the decision of the jury to one of intent. Distraught family: Ms Bensley's siblings, Dawn and Harry Bensley, were at Wolverhampton Crown Court today to see their sister's killer jailed . 'He is susceptible to control and influence by those older than him.' After their sentencing Ms Bensley's family spoke of their horror that the 13-year-old had been out so late and behaving in such a violent way. 'It opens your eyes to a different world. We are talking two o'clock, four o'clock in the morning - that is not a normal 13-year-old,' said John Bensley, 60. 'They are cowards, the way they did it. She was an easy target.' 'Justice has been done. If it hadn't happened to Glynis it would have happened to someone else. It could have happened to anybody. 'They seemed a bit arrogant in court, there was no remorse. They are not sorry, they are sorry they have been caught."" Paying tribute to the charity worker, Ms Bensley's sister, Dawn, said: 'She loved working for charities. She just liked to help people, she would help anybody."" Detective Chief Inspector Samantha Ridding said the pair had intended to target someone in a violent robbery . Her brother Kevin, 53, added: 'Glynis had walked down that road for 30 years and never had a problem. 'She walked the same way for 30 years, they must have crossed paths before. Whether he was 13, 33, or 53, it doesn't make it any easier.' Leading the investigation Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted: they were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other. 'Ms Bensley was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet. 'Our thoughts remain with Glynis’ family at this time and we hope that today’s sentencing will provide some help in their grieving process.'","Petri Kurti has been jailed for 12 years for the murder of Glynis Bensley .

Police have confirmed Ms Bialek returned home, and she is now speaking with officers about her disappearance. Police thanked the public and media for their help in locating the mother-of-one. Ms Bialek had last been seen by her family when she left home to walk to the bank. Her husband  said he spoke to her that morning but she has been 'out of reach since then'. On Thursday afternoon Jessica's father Michael Bialek, who had just flown in from Melbourne, fronted media to appeal for information. 'We would obviously like to appeal to anyone who may have contacted or had contact with Jess,' Mr Bialek said. The mother-of-one  was last seen leaving her home in Coogee on Wednesday morning, around 8.30am .

Michael Bialek also described as a 'complex character as many young people are today' but added she was a loving mother, daughter and wife and he simply wanted her home. Detective Superintendent Gavin Dengate said the reason police were involved shortly after Jessica's disappearance was due to how 'out of character' it was. 'The reason is it's out of character, totally out of character for Jessica to go missing,' he said on Thursday. Police worked through phone records, social media, CCTV, and financial records to try and locate the woman, Detective Superintendent Dengate said. Her husband Sabino Matera made a worried plea on Facebook in a bid to help find her .

"Sacked by the BBC: Jeremy Clarkson (pictured on April 10) said receiving a cancer warning was one of the most stressful experiences of his life . Two days before assaulting a BBC producer, Jeremy Clarkson was told by a doctor that he might have cancer. Speaking for the first time in detail about the incident that resulted in his sacking from the Top Gear show, 55-year-old Clarkson said being given the warning was one of the most stressful experiences of his life. In an attempt to explain his state of mind at the time of the attack, he said: ‘Two days before the “fracas”, I had been told, sternly, by my doctor that the lump on my tongue was probably cancer and that I must get it checked out immediately. But I couldn’t do that. 'We were in the middle of a Top Gear series. And Top Gear always came first.’ Clarkson said he had now been given the all-clear, but wrote in his column in The Sunday Times: ‘That was the most stressful day I have ever had in 27 years at the BBC. ‘It was beyond-belief stressful, everything was gong wrong, and then you know... there you go. But everyone has stressful days, and they manage to cope better than I had.’ Clarkson was sacked by the Corporation after an ‘unprovoked physical and verbal’ attack in Hawes, North Yorkshire that left his victim, Oisin Tymon, 36, in need of hospital treatment. The presenter said the show about cars had come to dominate his life after his divorce from wife Frances and the death of his mother Shirley, and he worried about all parts of the programme. Scroll down for video . Top Gear: Clarkson (pictured centre with co-presenters Richard Hammond, left, and James May, right) said the show about cars had come to dominate his life after his divorce and the death of his mother . Shock: Clarkson (pictured with in London last Tuesday) has said that two days before assaulting a BBC producer he was told he might have cancer . He said: ‘I woke every morning worrying about every single line. And I went to bed at night worrying that the changes I’d made during the day were wrong. ‘Friends would talk to me when we were out and, though I could see their lips moving, I couldn’t hear what they were saying.’ He added: ‘I felt sick because after I’d lost my home and my mother, I’d thrown myself even more vigorously into my job and now, idiotically, I’d managed to lose that too.’ Clarkson also revealed that he expected to present another television show about cars in the future. The star was suspended by the broadcaster last month when he became the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Mr Tymon, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him. Divorced: Clarkson, 55, and his wife Frances, 53, pictured together in London in April 2008 while stile married . Clarkson's contract was not renewed, with director-general Tony Hall saying at the time 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. But the broadcasting veteran received widespread public support, including from friend Prime Minister David Cameron. Clarkson said he even considered turning his back on presenting altogether in the immediate fall-out from the incident. Earlier this month, North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel. Clarkson pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You, which was due to be filmed next week, and aired a day later. It would have been his first BBC appearance since the fracas which led to his exit.","Clarkson, 55, had cancer scare two days before assaulting Oisin Tymon .

"Police have released an image of a bearded young man in relation to a suspected arson attack on a Melbourne church which was once presided over by a paedophile priest. Detectives have issued a photo of a brown haired, Caucasian male wearing a black top who they want to speak to after  a fire was started at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2.15am on  April 1. Victoria Police said: 'Detectives have released a FACE image of a man that may be able to assist with their enquiries.' Dandenong Crime Investigation Unit detectives are yet to determine the exact cause of the fire which is being treated as suspicious. The Dandenong fire was one of a string of suspected arson attacks on three Melbourne Catholic churches with links to paedophile priests. The church is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased convicted paedophile Father Kevin O'Donnell.

Emergency services were called to a fire at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2am on Wednesday, and police are treating the blaze as suspicious . Police are investigating whether the blaze is connected to two separate suspicious blazes that were lit two days before at St James Catholic Church in Brighton and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda, where paedophile priest Ronald Pickering served as minister.

On April 1, it took firefighters 90 minutes to extinguish blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street in Dandenong. Father O'Donnell - who was reportedly known by police as the 'two-a-day man' - was jailed for 15 months in 1995 after he admitted to abusing 10 boys and two girls. He is believed to have committed hundreds of sexual assaults against  young girls and boys over the 50 years that he worked in Victorian Catholic churches, before he retired in 1992. He died in 1997. At the Dandenong church in 1958 Father O'Donnell allegedly molested a 15-year-old boy in the presbytery and went on to sexually abuse his brother, sister and friends, The Age reported. He presided over the church from 1958 to 1986, before moving onto Oakleigh. On March 30, heritage-listed St James Catholic Church in Brighton was mostly destroyed by fire and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda was found with a small amount fire damage to a door. Bishop Peter Elliott told 3AW Catholic churches would be increasing their security, and said he did not believe the fires were lit by sex abuse victims. Australian actress Rachel Griffiths said she was 'quite elated' when she heard the 124-year-old James Catholic church  had been destroyed by fire. Firefighters extinguished blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street . The Six Feet Under star revealed that like many of the church's former parishioners she found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east. Firefighters desperately tried to battle a fierce blaze that took hold of the  building at around 6.30am on Monday morning but it was left gutted. Ms Griffiths told 774 ABC Melbourne the church was plagued by 'tragedy and complicated feelings' and described it as being known locally as 'the haunted house on the hill'. 'We've all attended many funerals of boys that we now know were abused by [Father Ronald] Pickering ... and other perpetrators in the parish - at the actual church that it occurred in,' she said. 'It's been hard for priests to really cleanse this parish, it's been very difficult to rebuild a community and we pretty much all scattered after the revelations came out and found other parishes.' 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east . Australian actress Rachel Griffiths is happy that her former Melbourne church has burned down because of its past links to a paedophile priest . Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it. Her mother stopped taking her to the church after her father left them because Pickering wouldn't have a 'divorced woman in the church'. 'I think that's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends' brothers got involved with,' she said. Ronald Pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in Melbourne . 'We stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door.' At least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest Ronald Pickering between 1960 and 1980, according to research carried out in 2012. The former priest was named by the Catholic Church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children. However, after emigrating to Britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died. One victim, Raymond D'Brass, told a 2013 Victorian government inquiry that Pickering groomed him with cigarettes, money and alcohol. He was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church. In his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on March 4, 2013, Mr D'Brass said: 'Over this four-year period I am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by Father Ronald Pickering. 'I was regularly fondled and petted by Pickering, as were other boys. This occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery. I began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with Pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol, which left me vulnerable to such abuse.' Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church . Photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky . He recalled: 'I now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses, as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication. In 1983, I stopped going to the presbytery after Pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming Sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father. 'He told me that I was not welcome back and that I would burn in hell. Between 1983 and 1987, the two other boys who I know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money, alcohol and cigarettes from Pickering, but I chose not to because I was terrified of him. I have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by Pickering. 'One night after one of the boys paid a visit to Pickering, he attempted suicide. He was unsuccessful on this attempt, but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later.' Many of the church's former parishioners found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton after revelations of child abuse came out . The church is described as a 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church' on its heritage-listed page . The cause of the fire has not yet been established. 'MFB will determine the cause of the fire and then if it's suspicious it will be passed on to police,' a Victoria Police spokesperson said. More than 80 firefighters and 20 trucks were at the scene where the ancient bluestone church was fully alight on Monday morning. A caller to radio show 3AW, named Andrew, said: 'You can hear that in the background, the roof is actually collapsing now.' 20 fire trucks were at the scene of the fire at the ancient bluestone church . Residents watching the fire were cleared from the area because of asbestos. And a 10 metre exclusion zone was put in place around the building over fears of structural collapse. MFB spokesperson David Jarwood told the ABC the smoke could be seen from 50 kilometres away. 'It's about 50 by 40 metres apparently the blaze is, the structure, so I'm not surprised people can see a plume from Mornington,' he said. Smoke from the St James Church fire could be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge. An advice notice put out by the MFB said: 'Emergency services are attending to building fire in North Rd Brighton. The area of North Rd and St James Brighton is currently closed and people are advised to avoid the area.' Smoke from the St James Church fire can be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge . The church was built in 1891 and the Parish of Saint James was established a year later. In 1990 a bell tower and bells were installed at a cost of $500,000. The Victorian Heritage Database website said the church 'stands on a site which has great importance in the early history of Catholicism in Victoria as the place where the mission to Brighton was established circa 1854'. It is described as 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church, rectory and church close, mostly dating from the last century but with additions made in 1908 and in the 1920s'. It has an 'unusually elaborate 1934 decoration of the chancel with Roman mosaic flooring, opus sectile tiling and marble altars and rails. The pipe organ by Alfred Fuller of Kew, placed centrally in the rear gallery, is a rare example of his work'. Investigators are keen to speak to anyone that may have seen any suspicious activity in the area. Police are urging anyone with information about the fire to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www.crimestoppersvic.com.au to make a confidential report.","Police are investigating suspected arson attacks on three Melbourne churches with links to paedophile priests .

"An 18-month-old toddler was left covered in blood after being dragged face first for 3ft along a pavement by a hit-and-run cyclist. Young Harry was out with his parents in Cambridge on Bank Holiday Monday when he was caught under a cyclist's wheel and dragged along the path. Angela Buckler, 34, said the female cyclist rode off without showing any remorse, despite leaving Harry with blood pouring from her face and inside his mouth. An 18-month-old toddler, Harry, was dragged along the path (pictured) by a cyclist after getting caught under her wheel while he was out in Cambridge with his parents . The incident took place while the family were parking up to go shopping on a path which is used by both cyclists and walkers. Police have now urged the cyclist to contact officers over the incident. Ms Buckler a project manager for a Cambridgeshire biologics firm, told the Cambridge News that the cyclist, thought to be in her 20s - who was also wearing headphones - was not paying attention and was 'not bothered' by what she had done. She said: 'He was caught on his front and his face was dragged along the pavement. She then ran over one of his legs with her bike wheel – there was a big bruise and welt there.' She added: 'I had this feeling of horror. I scooped him up and there was blood everywhere. 'But she was not remorseful in the slightest. She just said he was on the cycle path. She stayed for a couple of minutes while I called the ambulance and then said something like ""well there's nothing else I can do here"" and went off. She could see him bleeding.' The incident took place on a path which is used by both cyclists and walkers on Monday (file picture) Harry had to be treated at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge for cuts and bruises to his face, head and legs. An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said they received a call just before 11.30am to a report of a child being hit by a bicycle. They said: 'An ambulance crew and paramedic in a rapid response vehicle attended to the patient who was conscious and breathing, but was not completely alert. 'The child was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital for further treatment.' A Cambridgeshire police spokesman said they were also called to the incident. They said: 'We were called by the ambulance service just before 11.30am. The 18-month-old boy was taken to hospital but did not suffer serious injuries.

"Green party leader Natalie Bennett has been forced to distance herself from a bizarre online site run by her boyfriend. Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember… Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance. 'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes. When you have a teacher who kissed a 17-year-old placed on the same register as Gary Glitter it does make you wonder how useful the list is, no matter how creepy that teacher might be.' Another post entitled 'Even monsters have feelings' is said to have covered the case of Austrian schoolgirl Natascha Kampusch, who was kidnapped aged 10 by Wolfgang Přiklopil and held in a cellar for . Mr Jepps wrote: 'These are two people who had a long term and human relationship.' Ms Bennett and Mr Jepp reportedly share a flat she bought for £249,950 in 2007 in North London. Last night the Green Party distanced itself from Mr Jepp's remarks. A spokesman said: 'The Daily Maybe was a personal blog written by Mr Jepps until 2011. 'The party does not endorse the views expressed and would not want to be associated with them. Jim Jepps has not been a member of the party since 2012.' Ms Bennett said: 'Jim is a private individual not involved in party politics.

"An Oregon teacher is suing her rural school district over the lingering stress she feels following a surprise active shooter drill that administrators held in 2013. Linda McLean was in her classroom at Pine Eagle Charter School in the tiny town of Halfway in August of that year when a masked man in a hoodie burst in with a gun, lowered it to her head and pulled the trigger. The 56-year-old elementary school teacher had no clue it was a drill to test her 'preparedness' or that the gun was loaded with blanks. 'You're dead,' the shooter said. Shooter drill: Pine Eagle Charter school in Halfway, Oregon was the scene of a surprise 'active shooter' drill that's left teacher Linda McLean with post-traumatic fears years later . In fact, she believed for a several moments that she would soon die. Now, years after learning of the 'harebrained scheme,' Oregon Live reports that McLean is still traumatized by the event. 'McLean could not figure out what was going on,' reads the lawsuit. 'She felt very confused. Her heart was racing. She walked out of the classroom and saw a pistol lying on the ground . 'She wondered if she was really shot and was going to die.' Class was out of session that day and school officials had warned emergency services in the area not to show up should any teachers call 911. They also ran checks on all the teacher to make sure none of them had concealed weapons permits, should they decide to fight back. The two masked 'intruders' stormed a room where several teachers had gathered. 'It was shocking,' teacher Dollie Beck admitted at the time, but 'it heightened my awareness about what's around me.' But well afterwards, says the complaint, McLean's awareness was possibly too heightened. 'She could not shake the event but continued to relive it and try to make sense of it, . 'Ms. McLean could not sleep, and remained anxious and vigilant. When she drifted off to sleep, she experienced nightmares and sweating.' Doctors diagnosed McLean with post-traumatic stress disorder and urged her to return to the school as a form of desensitization. However, 'when she returned she was short of breath, anxious, emotionally distressed, and had to leave. She has not returned to the school building since.' Now McLean wants reparations  'for her involuntary separation from employment, her medical and psychological treatment, and the loss of retirement contributions and fringe benefits.' She is suing members of the school board, the masked safety officer who ambushed her, school administrators and the alarm company that services the school for punitive damages and attorney fees.","Linda McLean was in her elementary school classroom in tiny Halfway, Oregon in 2013 when she was surprised by a man in a mask with a gun ."
"Stephanie Scott's devastated father has opened up about the grief her family is feeling as they struggle to come to terms with their daughter's brutal murder, which took place just days before her much-anticipated wedding. The adored school teacher from Leeton went missing on Easter Sunday and her body was found in nearby bushland the following Friday.

She loved her family, drama, soccer and school - eager for every opportunity to learn. It comes after local Leeton parents expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott. Stephanie Scott was a 'favourite teacher' to many students at Leeton High School . A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their kids. 'Well said, my daughter has lost her favourite teacher, and she will never be the same,' wrote Glenda Goolagong. Meanwhile Jodie Salerno posted: 'Stephanie was my son and 2 daughters favourite teacher at leeton high this ... has put so much pain and sadness on our comunity [sic].' Ms Salerno told The Australian her three children 'don't want to return' to school because they are so upset over Ms Scott's death. This comes as police are due to begin an autopsy on Stephanie Scott's body to determine how she was killed. Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week. Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer.

"Technology billionaire Elon Musk pursued a sale of struggling electric-car company Tesla to Google in 2013, according to an excerpt of a book published on Monday by Bloomberg News. Beset by technical problems on its flagship Model S, Tesla in early 2013 was on the verge of bankruptcy, Bloomberg reporter Ashlee Vance said in an excerpt of his biography Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX And The Quest For A Fantastic Future, which will be published May 19. In March 2013, Musk contacted Google co-founder Larry Page, according to the excerpt, which cited two people close to the situation. Technology billionaire Elon Musk pursued a sale of his struggling electric-car company Tesla to Google for $6 billion before its share price rocketed in May 2013, according to a new biography . Musk proposed that Google buy Tesla for $6 billion and promise an additional $5 billion in factory expansions. He also demanded that he be permitted to run Tesla as a unit of Google for eight years, or until Tesla produced a third-generation car, the excerpt said. Page declined to comment on the matter, but told Vance that a 'car company is pretty far from what Google knows.' But Page, Vance reported, 'accepted the overall proposal' and the two sides began negotiating specific points. Tesla's fortunes changed suddenly in May 2013 when the company reported its first profit after an intense drive overseen by Musk to address technical glitches yielded a sudden jump in Model S orders. The surprisingly good earnings sent Tesla shares rocketing higher and ended the Google negotiations. Musk 'no longer needed a savior,' Vance wrote.

"It marks the moment when the civilised world entered the Dark Ages and some of the most spectacular societies in the world disappeared. Now one historian claims he has unraveled what may have lead to the downfall of Ancient Egypt and other Bronze Age civilisations collapse. He claims they were hit by a 'perfect storm' of disasters 3,200 years ago that left the Ancient Egyptians, the Babylonians, Minoans and Mycenians unable to cope. The Sphinx and pyramids at Giza (above) hint at the power of ancient Egyptian civilisation before it collapsed . As each of these great societies were interconnected, the collapse of one also affected the others, creating a domino-like effect, claims Professor Eric Cline, director of the Capitol Archaeological Institute at George Washington University. He claims that a series of droughts, famines, climate change, earthquakes, invasions and internal rebellions between 1225BC and 1177 BC happened in quick succession. Egypt's Old Kingdom - when most of the pyramids were built - collapsed more than 4,200 years ago because it failed to adapt to climate change, according to research. Scientists examined 7,000-year-old ancient pollen and charcoal samples from the Nile to piece together the time - and found evidence of a 'mega drought' in the the area. The droughts brought fires, famine and social unrest to the region. Pollen grains obtained from the bottom of the Sea of Galilee have also provided similar evidence that the region endured a 150 year drought between 1250BC and 1100BC. Scientists behind the study say there was a sharp decline around 1250 BCE in oaks, pines, and carob trees—the traditional flora of the Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age. Plants usually found in semiarid desert regions increase while the number of olive trees - an important crop plant - also declined. Speaking to Haaretz, he said: 'Normally if a culture if faced with just one of these tragedies, it can survive it, but what if they all happened at once or in quick succession. 'I think that the Late Bronze Age civilisations were simply unable to weather the ""perfect storm"" and cam crashing down. 'The thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium BCE, which had stretched from Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, suddenly ceased to exist, long-used trade routes were abandoned, along with writing systems, advanced technology, and monumental architecture.' Professor Cline sets out his arguments in his recent book '1177BC The Year Civilisation Collapsed'. The claims the events that led up to the collapse of these civilisations marked a turning point in ancient history. The demise of the powerful ancient civilisations has long been blamed on a mysterious group of seafaring raiders known as the Sea Peoples. These marauding people have been credited with having invaded and destroyed large swathes of Ancient Egypt, Hittite, Mycenian and Mitanni kingdoms around the Mediterranean. A series of battles between the Egyptians and the Sea People's are depicted on the Medinet Habu wall relief at Ramesses III's tomb on the west bank of Luxor in Egypt. The Sea Peoples, shown here fighting ancient Egyptian forces, were widely blamed for the collapse of many of the great civilisations in the Near East and Mediterranean at the end of the Bronze age 3,200 years ago . The map above shows many of the suspected invasions made by the Sea Peoples around 1200 BC . Although the Egyptians apparently managed to defeat them, the kingdom never recovered. Ugarit, a port city in ancient Syria that traded with the Hittites and Egypt was destroyed and the involvment of Sea People's is mentioned in four letters found at the site of the city. Archaeologists also point to the widespread destruction around much of the Mediterranean at the time. Many Anatolian sties show signs of violent battles and abandonment. Coastal sites at Canaan, including Gaza, Ashkelon and Ashdod, Akko and Jaffa, in Israel, were also leveled while the inland palace at Megiddo was burnt to the ground. The ancient cities of Hazor and Lachish, also in Israel, were completely destroyed and left abandoned. The tomb of Ramesses III (above) in Luxor, Egypt, features a wall relief that shows battles with the Sea Peoples . However Professor Cline says in his book that the Sea People's may have been unfairly blamed for causing the collapse of these great civilisations. Instead he says while the raids may have been a menace, there were greater forces at work. Recent analysis of pollen found in a core sample taken from the Sea of Galilee by researchers at Tel Aviv University and the University of Bonn has shown that the years between 1250BC and 1100BC were the driest the area had seen in the Bronze and Iron ages. Clay tables found in Afek in Israel, Huttusa in Turkey and Emar in Mesopotamia and Ugarit in Syria also suggest the area was hit by an unrelenting drought. Professor Cline says as each of the civilisations relied upon each other for trade, the misery of one was shared by others. Ramesses III's reign was plagued by raids by seafaring people but also coincidence with a great drought . He said: 'I would argue that the civilizations of the Mediterranean and the ancient Near East were so interconnected ... that when one collapsed, it affected the others, so that one by one they fell, like a chain of dominoes. 'The fact that similarly-intertwined civilizations collapsed just after 1200 BCE should be a warning to us; if it happened once, it can happen again.' Indeed Professor Cline warns that he can see parallels between the events that led to the downfall of those ancient societies and those occurring today.

"The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, according to researchers. They also found the sons of fathers with a criminal record for sex offending were nearly four times more likely to be convicted of such crimes. The biggest study of its kind suggests sex offending could run in the family along the male genetic line. The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, a study found. Johnny Savile (left) is accused of abusing seven women, while Jimmy Savile (right) raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse . Sex offending could run in families along the male genetic line, experts claim. The Savile's, including alleged sex abusers Johnny (far left) and Jimmy Savile (far right), are pictured in a family portrait from the 1930s . Mohammed Jumale, known as Deeq, (left) and  his brother Omar Jumale (right) were part of a 13-strong Somali prostitution gang that raped girls as young as 13-years-old . The findings show that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in risk between close relatives of offenders and men from the general population were genetically driven. But the researchers stressed that this did not mean a man with a brother or father convicted of rape would inevitably follow in their footsteps. The news comes after the high profile case of Jimmy Savile, who it was revealed raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse. It is now believed that his elder brother Johhny ‘most likely’ abused seven women at a South London hospital, according to an NHS report. Over the past few years a string of brothers have been convicted of child sex offences, including Mohammed Jumale and his brother Omar Jumale, who were part of a 13-strong gang that raped girls as young as 13-years old. Anjum Dogar, 31, and his brother Akhtar, 32 were jailed in 2013 for the abuse of six girls over the course of eight years in Oxford. Lead scientist Professor Niklas Langstrom, from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said: ‘It’s important to remember that it’s nothing mystic. ‘Of course you don’t inherit in some kind of automatised robotic way so that you will grow up to be a sexual offender.’ Razwan Razaq (left) and his brother Umar (right) were jailed in 2010 for being part of a five-member gang that groomed girls as young as 11 in Rotherham . Anjum Dogar, 31, and his brother Akhtar, 32 were jailed in 2013 for the abuse of six girls over the course of eight years in Oxford. Another set of brothers, Zeeshan Ahmed and Bilal Ahmed, were also convicted . The scientists studied data on all men convicted of sexual offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. Rates of sexual offending there are similar to those in the UK. Of the 21,566 offenders, nearly half had convictions for adult rape or child molesting. Other crimes included possession of child pornography, indecent exposure and sexual harassment. In terms of absolute risk, being closely related to an offender only led to a small increase in the chances of committing a sexual crime. Just 2.5 per cent of brothers of sex offenders were convicted of similar crimes, compared with 0.5 per cent of men in the general population, according to the study reported in the International Journal of Epidemiology. Evidence from half-brothers sharing either a mother or father and being raised in different family environments supported the idea that genetics played an important role in sexual offending. More than half of the difference in risk was linked to ‘non-shared’ environmental factors including perinatal complications, head injuries and childhood sexual victimisation that affect an individual but are not shared with other family members. Less than one per cent of convicted sex offenders are women so it was not ‘meaningful’ to include them, said Prof Langstrom. Behavioural factors found in sex crimes, such as impulsive behaviour, hypersexuality and sexual deviance, may be genetic-based drivers for the offences, said the researchers. Co-author Professor Seena Fazel, from Oxford University, said: ‘We are definitely not saying that we have found a gene for sexual offending. ‘What we have found is high-quality evidence from a large population study that genetic factors have a substantial influence.’ Christopher Davis left was jailed for 14 months and his brother Timothy (right) given a community sentence for child pornography offences . The findings may point the way towards providing better social help to at-risk families, many of which were already known to social services, said the authors. ‘At the moment genetic factors are typically ignored when it comes to making risk assessments of those at high risk of sexual offending’ said Prof Fazel. ‘Many of the families we are talking about may already be known to social services for other reasons, and if we can predict those at high risk of offending with greater accuracy then it may be possible to shape these interventions and target education and preventative therapies where they could do the most good’ he said. Interventions might include help with setting boundaries, and improving conflict resolving and social skills, he said. A logical next step would be a large-scale study that took DNA samples and looked for genetic patterns that may contribute to problem sexual behaviours, Prof Fazel added. But pinning down the precise genetic variants involved in sexual offending would be next to impossible, requiring samples from many thousands of individuals, which rules out the use of genetic screening.","Swedish research finds tendency to sex offences passed down male line .

"A photographer and mother-of-two has turned a collection of candid images of her energetic daughters and their friends into a powerful photography series that celebrates their strength and confidence, while highlighting what it means to be a girl today. Kate T. Parker, from Atlanta, Georgia, was inspired to create her aptly-titled series Strong is the New Pretty while pouring over photos she snapped of her daughters Ella, nine, and Alice, six, playing sports and enjoying their childhoods. 'The project became about capturing my girls and their friends as they truly are and how that is OK -not only OK - but worthy of celebration,' she told Daily Mail Online in an email. Summer breeze: Atlanta-based photographer Kate T. Parker captured this group of girls cooling off in front of a fan for her photo series Strong is the New Pretty . Serious athlete: Kate snapped these pictures of her daughter Ella, nine, before her first triathlon (L) and while she was playing soccer (R) Team spirit: As a part of the powerful series, Ms Parker photographs her daughters and their friends playing sports . Ms Parker continued: 'There's a lot of pressure for girls - and women - to look a certain way, act in [a] certain manner, and I wanted to let my daughters know that who they naturally are is enough.' When the devoted parent first turned the camera lens on her girls she was hoping simply to record their childhood, as well as practice certain photography techniques, but about a year ago the project started to evolve into something more. 'The images changed,' Ms Parker explained. 'I started to see patterns and recognize that the images where the girls were authentically captured were the strongest images. The images that showed the girls as they genuinely are were my favorites.' Water world: Ms Parker snapped this shot of the girls while they were enjoying a swimming session .

Sisterly love: These young girls embraced while wearing matching uniforms . Wild woman: This little girl let out a delightful scream as she ran through sprinklers in her bathingsuit . She kept that idea in mind as she continued to shoot her daughters and their friends. The series of photos aims to empower the girls and honor their personal interests - whatever they may be. The images of Ella, Alice, and their friends are black and white and free of frilly dresses, dolls or anything else stereotypically associated with young girls. Instead, Ms Parker captured the girls playing sports, running through sprinklers and horsing around, essentially exploring their everyday adventures. 'My girls know that who they are is just perfect,' she wrote on her blog last year. Girl fight: Ms Parker photographed her girls horsing around and playfully fighting like sisters typically do . Powerful gaze: Ms Parker got close-up for this candid snapshot . Peek-a-boo: These four girls can be seen posing inside a cardboard cutout . Uphill battle: This little girl rides her bike wearing a swimsuit and a helmet . Ms Parker added: 'They don’t need to have their hair done, clothes matching, or even be clean to be loved or accepted... I wanted this series of images to show their boldness, their strength and the beauty in them, as they are. Strong is the new pretty.' The photographer explained to Today that she is in no way 'taking out' girls who like traditionally feminine things. She has nothing against tutus or the color pink. In fact, she believes that parents should celebrate whatever their kids are into. 'My kids are this, you know? Athletic and strong and dirty and loud and crazy,' she told the outlet. 'That’s what I’m trying to celebrate.' Ms Parker added: 'But I encourage everyone to document their own kids the way they see them.' Getting clean: The two girls give their dog a bath in this humorous shot . Keeping pace: Ms Parker captured her daughter running a race . Hideout: Ms Parker snapped this photo of her daughter and her dog peeking their faces out of their play house . Animal instinct: The girls chose to stick their heads out the window while their dog remained inside . When the Today show shared Ms Parker's story on their Facebook page yesterday, it was liked nearly 25,000 times and inspired hundreds of parents to post photos of their own daughters doing the things that they love. 'Already a fierce little girl! Girls play in the mud and with sticks too!' Mary Kenyon wrote of her daughter. 'Determined and strong that's what all girls should be made of!' Cheryl Koscielniak Brzyski added. Meanwhile, Charlotte Yarbrough Knowles noted: 'My daughter is amazing.

"The City of Brotherly Love may also be the city of second (and third) chances, as the Philadelphia Eagles officially signed quarterback Tim Tebow to a one-year contract on Monday. Tebow, 27, hasn't played a snap in the NFL in over two years since being cut by the New England Patriots before the 2013 season. The team announced the contract Monday but did not disclose the financial terms of the deal the club reached with the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner. Scroll down for video . The Philadelphia Eagles officially signed 27-year-old quarterback Tim Tebow to a one-year deal on Monday . Tebow hasn't played a snap in the NFL since being cut by the New England Patriots before the 2013 season . Originally a first-round draft choice  of the Denver Broncos in 2010, the 6-3, 236-pound Tebow worked out with the . Eagles last month and must have impressed Philadelphia head coach Chip Kelly. Philadelphia . missed out on the playoffs despite compiling a 10-6 record and Kelly has made a number of surprising roster moves this offseason. The Eagles already have four other quarterbacks on their roster: Sam Bradford, Mark Sanchez, Matt Barkley and G.J. Kinne. Bradford and Tebow faced each other in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game. Tebow's Florida Gators defeated Bradford and the No. 1 ranked Oklahoma Sooners 21-14. Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper went to Florida and was Tebow's roommate in college. Former Patriot and convicted murderer Aaron Hernandez was also Tebow's college teammate. Fans can already purchase a Nike Tim Tebow midnight green Philadelphia Eagles game jersey for $99.95. He will wear No. 11 with the team. News of the deal leaked Sunday, the same day Tebow tweeted: 'Be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Ephesians 4:32.' Tebow has thrown 173 completions, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions in 35 games in the NFL . Tebow hasn't played in a regular season game since 2012 when he was with the New York Jets. He worked as a television analyst last year with the SEC Network and ESPN. Before signing his deal, Tebow was working out with noted throwing coach Tom House, according to the Eagles. His accuracy and skill as a NFL-caliber passer has been questioned since he was drafted. Tebow is still highly popular after leading Florida to two national titles and spending two seasons with Denver. He helped the Broncos win an AFC West title and won a playoff game before being dealt to the Jets after the 2011 season when Peyton Manning arrived in Denver . Many fans follow Tebow because of his strong Christian beliefs. A native of Jacksonville, Florida, Tebow has served as the chairman for the Tim Tebow Foundation since its inception in 2010.","Tim Tebow signed with team Monday after news of the deal leaked Sunday .

"They are caught between their bodies and their church - but have managed to walk a line between the two. These three Mormons, all from Utah, have realized that they are transgender - a designation not officially recognized by the Church of Latter Day Saints. Indeed, church doctrine states that anybody who takes their transgender identity to the extent of gender reassignment surgery cannot be baptized - and could face discipline from church elders if they are already a member of the religion. However, in the case of Annabel Jensen, Grayson Moore and Sara Jade Woodhouse, they have found a way to exist within the Mormon universe - often with the help of local Mormon leaders. Scroll down for video . Struggles: Grayson Moore, left with his mother, and Annabel Jensen, right, have both transitioned gender. Grayson used to be Grace and Annabel was once Christopher . Changed: Sara Jade Woodhouse, above, changed gender much later in life. As a man, she had married and fathered a child . As an extensive profile of the three in the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper reveals, the three have managed stay devout members of the church while navigating the difficulties of their gender identity. According to the Tribune, around 30 transgender Mormons meet every week in a support group, and have started to get the attention of senior church members. Grayson Moore, 22, is a math student at the University of Utah, and first came to terms with being transgender in junior high. Until then, he had been known as Grace, but made the decision to throw out his girls' clothes, swap his name to Grayson and start living as a male. Therapy: Moore, pictured above at home in Syracuse, Utah, started taking testosterone hormones several years after switching to wearing boys' clothes . Several years later he began testosterone therapy, which has made his body more masculine. He attends an all-male congregation, but is officially still listed as female by the church. He told the Tribune that after being told about gender identity disorder by his mother, he prayed to God asking 'Am I your son?' and felt the answer was 'yes'. While he understood the change would be hard, he said 'there was a bigger risk in not transitioning.' Accepted: Jensen told how she was welcomed when telling a Mormon bishop of her transgender identity . 'Living that lie was killing me.' Annabel Jensen, who was born Christopher, got as far as being ordained as a Mormon elder and was lined up to go on a two-year mission before she confronted her identity as a woman. She came out to her family, who told her she couldn't wear women's clothes and insisted on using her old name. Jensen, who is estranged from her parents and siblings, now lives alone and has started taking hormones to be more female. She said: 'One of my brothers sent me a text calling me a monster. I miss my family, but I don't want to visit. It's become too painful.' However, she has found solace in the church, and says the bishop of her ward was unambiguous about letting her join in. She remembers him saying: 'I don't know anything about being a transgender Mormon - but it's my job to welcome you.' Sara Jade Woodhouse had already grown up, and had a wife a child by the time she embraced her female identity, which she says she felt since grade school. She separated from her wife after deciding she could go no longer without changing her identity. She explained the switch to her daughter, then five, who said she found it 'weird' but looked forward to playing dolls with her. Woodhouse remains devout but is not allowed to attend the Relief Society - an all-female organization within the church. Difficult: Woodhouse has not been allowed to participate in some female Mormon activities, but says that she believes her gender identity is compatible with Mormon teachings . However, she believes that church doctrine on gender being eternal and unchangeable is compatible with her situation. She told the Tribune: 'We know that some people are born with ambiguous genitalia or with both - it is absolutely possible for a perfect feminine soul to end up in a male body and vice versa.' Even the most senior members of the church are starting to take notice of the Mormon transgender population. Dallin H. Oaks, one of the twelve apostles who are in the top echelon of the church hierarchy, said more needs to be done. He told the Tribune: '[Mormon leaders] have not had so much experience with [transgender persons]... We have some unfinished business on that.'","Grayson Moore, Annabel Jensen and Sara Woodhouse are transgender .

"A Queensland man has opened up about a very special friendship between him and his best mate - a crocodile called 'Gregory'. Mick Tabone, 74, who previously owned and ran Johnstone River Crocodile Farm and zoo in far-north Queensland first came across the 5.2 metre croc in 1989. For 20 years the farmer would sit on the enormous creature's back while he chatted to him, and never once felt as though he was in danger. Rangers had already been trying to capture Gregory, who had apparently been killing cattle in Eubenangee Swamp near Mirriwinni, 70 kilometres south of Cairns for years, when they asked for Mr Tabone's help. Mick Tabone and Gregory the crocodile shared a strong bond during their 20 year long friendship . 'He was on the run for a couple of years, he had been a naughty boy and was taking cows,' Mr Tabone told Daily Mail Australia. 'The cattle used to come down there and have a drink and Gregory used to grab them by the nose and drown them,' he said. Mr Tabone then spent the next six months setting up traps for the huge creature, in a last bid to save him after a warrant had been issued to kill the croc. 'They had a trap for a couple of years but he just didn't go in, and after a certain amount of time, you know, there's a limit to the amount of time you can spend on this,' he said. 'They (National Parks) issued a warrant to the farmer to shoot him.' The farmer who owned the property where Gregory was snatching cattle called in the help of Mr Tabone and, helped by some 'freak weather', they were finally able catch the reptile. A heavy rainfall meant the trap which had been set up had moved and turtles had gone in after the bait, which Gregory then followed. Gregory was captured my Mr Tabone in 1989 after he was found stealing a local farmer's cattle . 'Three weeks later, water was down to about ankle-deep and I looked hard in the murky water and I said there's this great big massive animal in there,' Mr Tabone revealed. 'I said I've done the most horrible thing of my life, I've killed this big animal.' However upon closer inspection it appeared Gregory was alive and well, and had been keeping himself alive by coming up for air every few hours. 'Because of his size he was able to push the trap up to get a breath of air and then go back down for three to four hours,' the croc farmer said. After a huge operation which involved 16 men carrying Gregory onto the back of a truck and taking him back to Mr Tabone's farm, the creature was finally settled into what would be his home for the next two decades. The farmer describes the reptile that was his best friend as a 'funny animal', and said Gregory and him shared a special bond. He was named after Greg Cullen, the farmer whose cattle he was stealing. 'That gives me a memory of where I caught him from,' Mr Tabone said. The 5.2 metre croc and his farmer would spend time together every day, and Mr Tabone said he was never frightened or felt he was in danger . 'Greg would brings friends over to have a look at the crocodile named after him.' The crocodile would come when Mr Tabone called him, rushing up out of the water to greet his mate. The farmer would then spend time perched on Gregory's back, chatting to him about what was happening on the farm. 'Every day I was there I always spent time with him, I always sat on him,' Mr Tabone said. These meetings would take place between ten and 20 times a day, often in front of the tourists who came to visit the farm but sometimes just between the two of them. 'Sometimes depending if I had time I would go and sit on him and just hang out and chat to him'. When asked whether what he was doing was dangerous, Mr Tabone disagreed saying he never felt unsafe with Gregory. 'No, if I felt danger I wouldn't be in there. 'I love animals but I love living too,' he joked. Since Mr Tabone had to give up the farm in 2008 after repeated knee problems left him with less mobility than he was used to, the farmer has been back to visit Gregory only once. Mr Tabone previously owned and ran Johnstone River Crocodile Farm and zoo in far-north Queensland . 'I went down after 18 months and went down to Gregory's cage and he was in the water,' he revealed. 'I called him over to the gate and he came over to me and the look on his face was just like ""Mick why did you leave me here?""' 'They wouldn't let me go inside and I can see their point because it's not mine any more, I understand,' Mr Tabone said. 'He was a really lovely animal, the only reason I sold out was that I got an infection on my knee.' But Mr Tabone doesn't think he can go back to see Gregory again, who he believes has been moved to another farm. 'I can't go there again,' he said. Mr Tabone instead prefers to remember Gregory as he knew him, happily sitting with his farmer and best friend sitting on his back, having a chat.","Mick Tabone and Gregory the crocodile shared a 20 year long friendship .

"He only wore it a handful of times but, for many, Elvis Presley strutting around the stage in his gold lame tuxedo is their enduring image of The King. And as the decadent outfit makes the 4,300-mile journey his Memphis mansion to London, British fans are finally able to get up close to one of their idol’s most famous artefacts. Normally on display at Graceland, the singer’s former home-turned-museum, it is making a special two month appearance at the Elvis at The O2 exhibition from Sunday. The golden suit is making a special two month appearance at the Elvis at The O2 exhibition from Sunday . Even during Presley’s lifetime, the tuxedo carried a level of mystique. His manager Colonel Tom Parker had it ferried to concert venues in an armoured truck and under armed guards as a way of drumming up more press coverage. Angie Marchese, Graceland’s Director of Archives, has previously said: ‘It’s the ultimate piece of 50s memorabilia that is connected to Elvis’s life and career which is important because our collection is quite light on 50s stuff because Elvis didn’t keep those things. It really represents his rise to fame in the 50s.’ Although touted as his $10,000 suit, this astronomical price was reportedly a gimmick and the actual value was closer to $2,500, although this would still be around £20,000 by today’s standards. It was made for the singer by Hollywood tailor Nudie Cohn, whose other customers have included Sir Elton John, Ronald Reagan and John Wayne. Graceland director Kevin Kern inspects the suit before it is put on display. Although touted as his $10,000 suit, this astronomical price was reportedly a gimmick and the actual value was closer to $2,500 . Presley, who died in 1977 at the age of 42, first wore the suit in public on March 28, 1957 during a performance at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago. He wore the full ensemble – consisting of gold jacket, trousers, belt, tie and shoes – just twice more at live performances, in St. Louis on the night following its first appearance and then again in Toronto on April 2, 1957. It is perhaps best known for being worn on the cover of 1959 compilation album 50,000 Elvis Fans Can’t Be Wrong, which contained no less than 17 pictures of the singer wearing the extravagant outfit. Arriving at the O2 exhibition, it will sit alongside other artefacts such as his 16 karat ‘Taking Care of Business’ ring, a signed Champagne bottle from his wedding to Priscilla and the Red MG Roadster from his film Blue Hawaii.","Presley first wore suit in public on March 28, 1957, during a performance .

"Max Maisel (above) went missing on February 21, after his car was found abandoned on the shore of Lake Ontario in New York. Police have now discovered his body . Police have found the body of senior ESPN writer Ivan Maisel's son, two months after his car was found abandoned. Max Maisel went missing on February 21 and was last seen leaving his vehicle near Lake Ontario, New York. The 21-year-old's body was spotted by a fisherman around 200 yards from a coast guard station on Monday, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported. The family, from Fairfield, Connecticut, have owned a five-bedroom vacation house near the area he went missing since 1999. They described Max, a third-year photography student at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), as 'very comfortable' there. They released a statement after they heard his body had been found. It read: 'We knew this day would come, and we are relieved that it has. 'But it is merely the postscript to our sad story. 'We have mourned Max from the night that the Rochester police called to tell us he was missing. 'There was no other plausible solution to the puzzle he left behind. Now we must get on with living with this hole in our lives.' Max was last seen by a member of the public at Charlotte Pier. When he did not return to his car, a bronze 2004 Acura SUV, the passerby called the police. Since he went missing, his family have said he loved the destination, had a sweet tooth, loved anime, Japanese comics and short animation. In a eulogy seen by the Democrat and Chronicle, paid tribute his son. It read: 'Death cannot take away the love we continue to have for our son and the love that our daughters have for their brother.

"Authorities in Montgomery County have released the 911 call that led to two 'free range' getting picked up and held by police and Maryland CPS for five hours over the weekend. The unnamed caller gave the operator a blow-by-blow account as he wandered behind Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, in Silver Spring on Sunday. The 7-minute call would reignite a controversy focused on those kids and their scientist parents, Danielle and Alexander Meitiv, who espouse the hands-off parenting style. The caller, who was out walking his dog in the suburb adjacent to Washington, DC, said he saw 'two kids that are unaccompanied, and they've been walking around for probably about 20 minutes by themselves.' Scene: The 911 call that reignited the 'free-range' parenting controversy for two Maryland parents has been released and reveals that Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, were picked up by police while walking through this vicinity of the Washington, DC-adjacent suburb of Silver Spring on Sunday . The operator asked, 'Have you talked to them to see, you know, why are they just walking around by themselves?' 'No, no, they came up and asked to pet my dog, I let them, and that was it...I don't want to scare them,' he said. The man continued to tail the children, who eventually did become frightened when they realized they were being followed, until police arrived. Their parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their kids to roam free in their suburban neighborhood. But the Meitivs say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up Rafi and Dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents. Picked up: Officials seized Dvora, 6, (far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. The parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv (right) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours . Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . Attorney Matthew Dowd, of the firm Wiley Rein, is representing the Meitivs and on Tuesday sent a pointed letter regarding Sunday's events. Rein wrote: . 'The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. 'This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent's reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children.' The firm declined to say who the suit would be against, exactly, when asked by the Washington Post. However, the attorney has vowed to pursue 'all legal remedies' to protect the rights of the Maryland parents. The Meitivs made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi and Dvora walking the sidewalk on their own. 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. 'They kept the kids for hours,' a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. 'It's 10:30 at night. They've been missing since 6 o'clock…Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn't call us.' According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . 'The policeman said 'We'll give you a ride home' when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said 'I'll bring you home' and, instead, he brought us here.' 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . 'They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I'm not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.","Police seized Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6, in a Maryland park on Sunday and their parents say they weren't reunited by CPS for hours .

"New York City in the height of summer with children. Would you buy that for a dollar? Precisely. But take your crew 90 minutes north of the Big Apple to Mohonk Mountain House in the heart of the Hudson Valley and you’ll not regret it for a second. It gets its name from the surrounding Mohonk Preserve, on the fringes of the monumental Shawangunk Ridge, a vast cliff band that runs down through Pennsylvania to New Jersey. It is astonishing to find such wilderness so close to the city. The hotel is a faux-gothic Victorian castle and may look too faux to European eyes, but the lake, gardens and trails are a vast adventure playground for all ages. A world away: The faux-gothic Victorian castle hotel Mohonk Mountain House enjoys a spectacular location . Perfect: Felix found the hotel, lake, gardens and trails to be an adventure playground for his young family . One afternoon, we check our two girls into the kids’ club and climb up the Labyrinth trail (one of eight epic scrambles) to Lookout Tower on the high bluff above the lake. We clamber over boulders, up timber ladders and squeeze through tiny gaps in the cliff band. The 360-degree views are inspirational. The kids’ club is the best we have experienced. Our girls make paper bag whales, cork puppets and chalk drawings, dress up and sing songs, go on pony and boat rides. We use the club as a drop-in once or twice a day, using our free time to explore the 5,000 acres of hotel grounds and the surrounding preserve. Water water everywhere: The hotel sits on the banks of Lake Mohonk in New York State's Hudson Valley . Another afternoon, we check in to the spa; another morning, we ride Eagle Ridge on horseback as turkey vultures, red-tailed hawks and bald eagles soar overhead. In between, we have a ball with the children. We take them out on the lake in pedalos, and walk the lakeside path following a baby deer. On the opposite side of the lake, a path down from the cliff leads to a sandy beach and swimming area. High on the cliff above is the Granary restaurant, a wonderful open-air grill that serves lunch and lobster cook-outs. Rooms are divided between the four sections of the hotel, some traditional, some contemporary. All are comfortable, a good size and most come with private balconies. There are no TVs. Splash: Guests of the hotel can enjoy a day on the lake in canoes, one of many available outdoor activities . The hotel began life as a ten-room drinking inn. Then, 145 years ago, two Quaker twins, Albert and Alfred Smiley, fell in love with its setting and bought it to use as a teetotal retreat for the great and good. It was full from their first season, has played host to five US presidents and is still owned and run by the Smiley family. But grown-ups will be pleased to know the ban on alcohol has long passed.

"A multi-millionaire property developer's son is being questioned over the disappearance of a blonde waitress from a celebrity club popular with Premiership footballers and soap stars. Privately-educated Westley Capper, 37, has already admitted driving  Agnese Klavina, 30, away from the nightspot in the upmarket Costa del Sol resort of Puerto Banus. Police believe 5ft 7in Agnese was forced into the vehicle. And the overweight expat - who has never been publicly named - showed he was in little mood for co-operating by refusing to be questioned after being summonsed to court yesterday. Suspects Westley Capper (left) and co-accused Craig Porter outside court in Marbella yesterday after the hearing. They have both admitted being in the Mercedes with Agnese Klavina before she vanished . Agnese, 30, disappeared after a night out at glitzy Puerto Banus nightclub Aqwa Mist on September 6 . A Cessna private jet owned by John Capper, multi-millionaire father of accused son Westley Capper. The tail fin features his nickname Fred . Agnese with British boyfriend Michael Millis, who travelled to Spain to help the search for the 30-year-old . The Spanish judge investigating Agnese's disappearance from trendy Aqwa Mist, where footballer Ashley Cole, Hollywood star Eva Longoria and boxer Amir Khan have all partied, was last night expected to order a fresh round of DNA tests after his hopes of an early breakthrough in the case foundered. Capper, whose Essex-born dad John specialises in buying and selling luxury properties around the world, has had travel restrictions imposed on him while the investigation against him continues. Co-accused Craig Porter, 33, also declined to answer questions during a closed court hearing in Marbella. The two men left the hearing in an English-plated Range Rover they had left parked in a disabled bay near the court. Agnese, whose British boyfriend, Michael Millis, is a former owner of west London club Westbourne Studios, vanished on September 6 last year after leaving Aqwa Mist with the two Brits. She was spotted shortly before she left talking to a woman of Russian appearance and was wearing a multi-coloured halter neck dress and carrying a large white Louis Vuitton handbag. Friends reported her missing later the same week along with her mother and sister after they flew to Spain when she failed to respond to calls and messages. They discovered her clothes and bank cards were still at a nearby flat where she was staying. Her friends and relatives put up missing posters around Marbella and the neighbouring resort of Puerto Banus. They also set up the 'Find Agnese Klavina' Facebook page linked to a GoFundMe page to help raise funds for legal fees linked to the search. The waitress was spending the summer in Marbella after flying to the resort in May to start work as a receptionist at luxury beach club the Ocean Club. Capper has claimed he dropped her off near a flat she was staying at. The missing person notice for Agnese, who was spending the summer in Marbella before she vanished . Authorities are probing the possibility Agnese was killed and her body thrown into the sea from a motorboat belonging to Capper's family . Capper (left) claims he dropped off Agnese (right) near a flat she was staying at in Marbella for the summer . Agnese was allegedly illegally detained by Porter and Capper, according to police who have studied footage from Aqwa Mist's car park . Porter, from Liverpool, says he fell asleep on the back seat of a Mercedes they left the club in before the drop-off. Forensic experts discovered a blonde hair in the boot of the car during a sweep of the vehicle but were unable to discover who the hair belonged to during initial tests. Further tests are now expected to be ordered on the human hair and samples taken during a search of a motorboat belonging to Capper's family. The vessel was seized in a port in the province of Murcia, around 300 miles east of Marbella. Agnese is pictured partying at Aqwa Mist  shortly before she went missing in September . Authorities are probing the possibility Agnese was killed and her body thrown into the sea from the boat, which left a port in Fuengirola near Marbella days after she vanished. Capper and Porter are currently being investigated on suspicion of Agnese's illegal detention following the recovery of CCTV footage from Aqwa Mist's car park and a damning report by a Cracker-style criminal psychologist claiming her facial expressions show she did not leave the club voluntarily. A doorman at the club was initially arrested alongside them for allegedly obstructing police inquiries - but the case against him dropped after he and the two Brits took part in a police reconstruction of the last night Agnese was seen alive. The criminal inquiry is expected to become a homicide probe if new DNA tests show Agnese was in the boot of the car or on the motorboat. Neither suspect has yet been formally charged with any crime, as is normal in Spain in the early stages of an investigation. A secrecy order had been placed over the case, giving lawyers acting for the British suspects and Agnese's family limited access to information. The order has now been lifted and the distraught mum and sister of Latvian-born Agnese, who was spending her summer working in Marbella after leaving her London home of the past five years, are now expected to be allowed to meet judicial authorities in Spain so they can be briefed on the investigation. Aqwa Mist is one of four Marbella venues owned by international restaurant brand La Sala, whose shareholders include ex-Tottenham Hotspur players winger David Bentley and defender Dean Austin. Footballer Ashley Cole is said to have spent £12,000 on champagne he then sprayed over his friends during a night out at Aqwa Mist the summer before last.

The stars of BAFTA award-winning reality TV soap opera TOWIE are also summer regulars at the club, which bills itself as Marbella's number one party venue. Lawyers acting for the two Brits refused to comment as they left court. A court official confirmed: 'Both suspects declined to answer questions from the judge. 'The investigation is ongoing.' A source close to the case said: 'The judge has indicated he will order fresh DNA tests which may involve the use of Agnese's mum's DNA. 'He had important questions to ask the suspects and obviously would have preferred it if they had agreed to cooperate with his investigation.'

An acquaintance, who asked not to be named, described him as 'mega-rich' and said he owned his own private plane with his name on the tail plate. He is currently understood to be based in Gibraltar. The source said: 'Westley might not look like a multi-millionaire's son but he's never wanted for anything.' Agnese's mum Daiga, in an appeal for information about her daugther's whereabouts in February, said: 'We can't believe this is happening. 'It has now been nearly six months without our daughter - not knowing if she is still alive or where she may be.

A spokesman for the Find Agnese Klavina campaign said in a Facebook post: 'After seven months of waiting the secrecy of the case has finally been lifted by the Spanish authorities and as such the file of the case has been opened. 'We have had yesterday the spectacle of two of the accused men being 'interrogated' at court by the judge. 'Westley Capper and Craig Porter were repeatedly asked to answer questions relating to the case. 'They refused, citing their constitutional right to remain silent. 'Our Agnese has never been seen since [she disappeared six months ago]. 'How can we still not have charges? 'We want justice for Agnese and all the other unfortunate missing people in Marbella.

"A woman who chartered her own weightloss success with body selfies found it so beneficial, she launched an app offering others the chance to do the same thing. Charlotte Li, 26, from London, decided to design Healthy Selfie with her husband Joe after they both achieved incredible results taking photos of their bodies while on a health kick. She said the idea for it came after an over-indulgent Christmas left her feeling ‘fat and unhealthy’. Scroll down for video . Charlotte reveals how taking selfies helped her to stay motivated to get fit and stay in shape . Charlotte said: 'With no holidays on the horizon and hence no impending bikini body exposure to panic about, we needed something else to give us some motivation to get in the gym. 'That motivation came in the form of stripping down to my bra and pants, and taking my first body selfie. 'I was by no means overweight, however, by looking at my body objectively, I wasn’t happy with what I saw and I decided I needed to make a change. 'I started a new fitness programme, and started eating reasonably healthily.’ Joe also charted his own success through a series of selfies before he and Charlotte decided to launch Healthy Selfie. Charlotte continued to take photos each week and would compare them to see how far she had come. She said: 'At the end of a six-week period, I compared the images with the help of Joe’s Photoshop expertise. 'The results were incredible – my body had completely changed – all in complete contradiction to the number on the scales - which had risen as I gained more muscle.' Charlotte and Joe (right) launched  the app after taking selfies  following an an indulgent Christmas . Joe charted his own success through a series of selfies before he and Charlotte decided to launch the app . Charlotte said: 'This was where the idea for Healthy Selfie was born. We wanted to create an app that made tracking and comparing your selfies a quick and easy process. 'By then publishing those photos in a social networking environment, the images become so much more than a self-tracking tool – they become a source of information from which other users can glean ideas and inspiration. 'Your images become testaments to the efficacy of whatever programme, diet, detox or cleanse you’re pursuing.' Charlotte says the app also provides a safe and supportive community for you to upload your pictures too, with users using the comments section to encourage each other on their journeys. Two people who have used the app said it helped them to overcome their own body issues. A student who was told he would never have a six-pack finally achieved his dream. When Harry was at college (left) he was told by his friends that he would never achieve a six pack, now he shows off his super fit body on Healthy Selfie (right) Harry's profile on Healthy Selfie shows how he is getting fitter week by week . Harry Kersley, 20, student: . Harry Kersley, 20, said he used to receive harsh criticism from the other boys at his college but is now proud of his body. Harry was told about the app by a friend at the gym. He said: 'I lacked confidence throughout school at Epsom College. 'The initial reason for starting my transformation was to improve strength as well as fitness for sport. 'However I received harsh “banter” from my peers at school and I recall one friend saying I will never get a six pack. I allowed this to fuel my determination to this day.' Harry says using the app he charted his progress: 'It's given me a great confidence boost, and yes, I definitely feel encouraged to continue posting progress pics. 'If you ever start doubting your progress; looking at old photos make you realise just how much your physique has improved. 'No one expects to become Arnold Schwarzenegger overnight, but the small incremental changes that you don’t notice from just looking in the mirror every day, is what kept me motivated to continue. 'You can't see how much you've progressed if you don't keep a record. I'm now using Healthy Selfie to track my aesthetic progression, and have seen drastic changes in my muscle definition and fat loss. ‘I feel great and definitely in the best physical condition of my life.' Anonymous, 17 . This anonymous anorexia sufferer used Healthy Selfie to chart her recovery process, posting selfies as she regained weight and muscle . A 17-year-old woman – who didn’t want to be named – revealed the app helped her fight anorexia, which started at 14, including helping her to regain weight and muscle. She said: 'I really got into healthy eating because I wanted to lose weight. 'My friend was a synchronised swimmer and she was so toned, I wanted to look just like her. ‘I joined a fitness club at school, got quite strong and pretty toned; I looked good. 'But it became obsessive: my “healthy” eating got so restrictive I was living off salads and fruit. I exercised every day, to the point of collapsing. ‘I ate less and less, thinking that was the key to being healthy, but I was so wrong. 'It took time for the weight to come off, and these habits continued on until I was 16. The user posted pictures of herself in the gym as she trained  to regain a healthy body with tone and muscle . 'I was diagnosed with anorexia. That really shocked me, because I didn’t feel like anything was wrong with me.' The user posted pictures of herself in the gym as she trained hard to regain a healthy body with tone and muscle . She revealed: 'I thought about what I wanted to be like before my eating disorder took a hold of me. I wanted to be strong and muscular, toned and fit.’ She started charting her transformation on Instagram but moved over the Healthy Selfie when it launched in January. She said: 'I think selfies are a great idea, especially for people with eating disorders. 'It allows you to see how much healthier you are.

"Hitting out: Justin Welby said the students killed in Kenya by Islamic militants were 'martyrs' THE Archbishop of Canterbury will today hail the students killed by Islamist militants in Kenya last week as ‘martyrs’, as Church leaders and politicians use Easter to condemn persecution of Christians. Justin Welby will say in his Easter sermon that 148 Christian students slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday were ‘witnesses’ to their faith and suffered ‘cruel deaths’. His comments follow Pope Francis’s denunciation of the ‘senseless’ killings at Garissa University College, in which Christians were singled out and shot. The Pope said in a Good Friday service in Rome that too many were guilty of a ‘complicit silence’ in the face of such attacks. In an overtly religious Easter message, David Cameron says it was ‘truly shocking’ that Christians were still tortured or killed because of their faith in much of the world. Their outspoken comments came as three people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack in the north-east of Kenya, bringing the total number of suspects being held to five. The Kenyan Government said the three, who were trying to cross into Somalia, are associates of Mohamed Mohamud, a former teacher at a Kenyan Madrassa Islamic school, who is believed to have co-ordinated the attack. Meanwhile, a survivor of the killings was found yesterday two days after the massacre. Cynthia Charotich, 19, hid in cupboard and covered herself with clothes, refusing to emerge when classmates came out of hiding at the demand of the Al-Shabaab gunmen. Archbishop Welby will also refer in his sermon in Canterbury Cathedral to other Christians killed in massacres, including in Libya, saying: ‘There have been so many martyrs in the last year.’ 148 Christian studentsat Garissa University College, Kenya, were slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday.

"A teenager who allegedly played naked Twister with her mother during a drunken party has jumped to her mom's defense on social media. The 16-year-old girl took to Twitter days after Rachel Lehnardt, 35, was charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor following the incident at their Evans, Georgia home. The mom-of-five, who admitted to turning towards alcohol during her divorce, also allegedly had sex with a 18-year-old man in the bathroom during the party, used sex toys on herself in front of the youngsters and later awoke to find a 16-year-old having sex with her. But earlier this week, her daughter defended her actions, saying: 'Everyone makes mistakes.' Defense: Rachel Lehnardt, left, was arrested for allegedly hosting a drunken party for her teenage daughter, right, and her friends. Her 16-year-old daughter has now come to her defense on Twitter . 'Yes my mom was arrested,' the girl wrote on her Twitter account. 'Yes she made some mistakes. Yes she is an alcoholic. Yea I've f***ed up too. But nobody deserves this s***. So stop.' As other Twitter users bombarded her with messages, she fought back, saying that her mother 'used to be a great mom'. 'Everyone screwed up at some point,' she wrote. The teen also backed up her mother's claim that she had been raped by the 16-year-old boy. Lehnardt has said she awoke to find the boy having sex with her and immediately threw him off. 'She was passed out drunk and he was wasted of his ass,' the daughter wrote. 'She didn't have sex with a 16 year old she was raped by one [sic].' The teenager also denied that the boy was her boyfriend, as previously reported and claimed by Lehnardt's lawyer. Following the incident, the girl's paternal grandparents learned of the party and Lehnardt lost custody of her five children. In the days after, she researched local Alcoholics Anonymous groups and was linked with a sponsor in an effort to overcome her problems, her lawyer said. Fighting back: The teenager took to her Twitter page to fight back against online criticism about her mother . By her side: She insisted that her mother 'used to be a great mom'. She has struggled with alcoholism . She denied her mother had sex with a 16-year-old and backed up her mother's claim that she had been raped . She told her sponsor about what had led her to AA, including her divorce, the party and losing custody of her children, and the donor then contacted authorities about what she had learned. The sponsor said the mother had allowed teenagers to drink and smoke marijuana in front of her before they played the game of Twister and she had sex with an 18-year-old in the bathroom. She then allegedly returned and used her sex toys in front of the teenagers and showed her daughter photographs of her having sex with her boyfriend,  Augusta Crime reported. Later, when she was asleep, she felt the 16-year-old having sex with her, the sponsor said. The girl later told her mother that she felt guilty because his 10-inch penis was too big for her, so he had to have sex with her mom instead, according to a police report. Lehnardt was arrested last Saturday. She posted $3,200 bond and was released from the Columbia County Detention Center.. Arrested: Lehnardt, pictured in her mug shot, was arrested after she told her AA sponsor about the incident and the sponsor then contacted authorities. Lehnardt said she is working to put it behind her . Struggles: She is pictured walking outside her Georgia home on Wednesday, several days after her arrest . Scene: After the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, she lost custody of her five children . Her daughter's vehement defense comes as her mother also attempted to defend her actions in a lengthy statement through her lawyer on Thursday. According to the statement, Lehnardt had been a life-long follower of the Mormon church and had never touched a drop of alcohol before her split from her husband James, who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder when he returned from Iraq. But following their divorce last year, she began drinking and ultimately broke away from the church, where she had once been a Sunday school teacher, the lawyer said. The lawyer, Shawn Hammond, released a statement shared by Augusta Crime on Thursday, saying Lehnardt was 'extremely remorseful' for what had happened. 'Mrs. Lehnardt acknowledges that due to recent alcohol abuse she engaged in several acts of inappropriate conduct,' he said. 'Although, many of the allegations are exaggerated, she is extremely remorseful for what she allowed to occur in her presence and is obtaining professional and pastoral counseling to ensure that this conduct is never repeated.' Video from KJBF . Split: Her lawyer said Lehnardt, who is a life-long Mormon, turned to drink after divorcing from her husband James Lehnardt, pictured right. He returned from Iraq with PTSD and was later discharged, the lawyer said . He denied that she had thrown the party for the teenagers or provided them with drugs, and said she would be fully cooperating with authorities. 'Mrs. Lehnardt has recommitted herself to her faith and her family,' he continued. 'She is hopeful that her children, members of her faith and others will learn from her poor example as to just how easy it is for people to exercise such extremely poor judgment while intoxicated.' He did not comment on the naked Twister, bathroom sex or sex toy allegations, and simply said reports of the incident had been exaggerated. While Lehnardt said she had been raped by the teenage boy, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent.","Rachel Lehnardt, 35, 'allowed her 16-year-old daughter and her friends drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her Georgia home'

"This is the incredible moment a car being driven by an ISIS suicide bomber detonates mid-air seconds after it is blasted skywards by an explosion on the ground. Video shows the jihadi attempting to launch an attack on Kurdish Peshmerga forces, reportedly near Kirkuk in northern Iraq. But as the car approaches, it hits what appears to be a roadside bomb, catapulting the vehicle at least 100ft into the air. Just as it begins to fall back down to earth, the car detonates like a firework, either due to the explosives on board or the fuel tank igniting. What's left of the car is then seen dropping back down into the massive cloud of smoke that has billowed up from the ground. Blown sky high: Footage shows a suicide bomber's car being catapulted into the air after apparently hitting a road-side bomb while trying to launch an attack on Kurdish Peshmerga forces near Kirkuk in northern Iraq . Explodes like a firework: The car erupts in a ball of flames either due to the explosives or fuel tank igniting . The footage is the latest in a string of videos released by Kurdish forces which show ISIS launching bungled attacks in Iraq. Compilation clips released on YouTube also show militants being killed or injured by back-firing mortars, malfunctioning machine guns and misfiring rockets. It comes as Iraq's prime minister said his country needs greater support from the international coalition so it can 'finish' the Islamic State. Haider al-Abadi said the 'marked increase' in airstrikes, weapons deliveries and training has helped roll back the extremists, but that more is required to eliminate the group once and for all. 'We want to see more,' al-Abadi told journalists yesterday as he boarded a flight to Washington where he will meet with Barack Obama as part of his first official visit to the U.S. as prime minister. 'We can finish Daesh... and we can stop their advance in other countries,' he added, using the group's Arabic acronym. Destroyed: What's left of the car drops back down into the smoke that has billowed up from the ground . 'We are the only country with armed forces on the ground fighting Daesh. We need all the support of the world.' The U.S. and its coalition allies have carried out nearly 2,000 strikes in Iraq since its campaign began in August - as well as nearly 1,400 in neighboring Syria. American officials say the campaign has been somewhat successful, though it is likely to stretch on for years. In November, Obama authorised the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could more than double the total number of U.S. forces to 3,100. The Pentagon has made a spending request to Congress of $1.6 billion, focusing on training and arming Iraqi and Kurdish forces. This wider angle shot shows the scale of the explosion, reportedly near Kirkuk in northern Iraq on April 12 .","Jihadi tried to launch attack on Kurdish Peshmerga forces near Kirkuk, Iraq ."
"Rape: Edwin 'Jock' Mee is accused of attacking several Army cadets while working as a recruitment sergeant . An Army recruiting sergeant raped a teenage cadet after telling her he could help her get a visa from the Home Office, a court heard today. Edwin 'Jock' Mee allegedly told the 18-year-old, from Sierra Leone, that her visa application had been delayed in order to persuade her to have sex with him. He is accused of carrying out sex attacks on 11 victims as young as 15 while working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, between October 2010 and September 2011. One woman told Southwark Crown Court today that she saw Mee, 46, as a father figure after he helped her join the Army. She said: 'He was like someone I could really lean on because, going for some interviews with him, he would ask me everything about my personal life, everything, because he said that is the procedure they need to do. 'So it is like I took him as a father, or someone I can relate to, or maybe understand what is happening to me.' Jurors heard that Mee repeatedly asked the teenager if she wanted to have sex with him - she initially ignored him, but later explicitly told him she did not want to do. The court heard that one occasion when she went to see Mee, he slapped her bottom as she left the office, and she told him 'never do that'. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC asked the woman why she did not tell any of the other recruiters what was going on. The witness replied: 'He always told me not to say anything to anyone because no one will believe me and looking at him, and his status, all these things, I believed him.' Describing the alleged rape, the woman said she had gone in for her final Army selection interview in August 2011 before the conclusion of the process. Around the same time she was trying to renew her visa with the Home Office, and was not aware of any problems with the application before she went to see Mee. She said: 'He said there was a delay for me to pay the money, that if the visa didn't come, I can't go for selection and my date was already fixed. He told me he can help me. 'He told me that because I need to go to selection and my passport was with the Home Office, and he told me that he was going to help and I said, ""How are you going to do that?"" He just said, ""A call that I can make,"" and I said ""Why don't you do it?"" 'He said: ""You know what you can do that will make me do it.""' Base: Mee was working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, pictured . The court heard that Mee then told the woman to wait for the 'boss' who was going to conduct her interview. But he returned a short time later, told her that he would now be talking to her and took her to the kitchen area, jurors were told. Dressed in his Army uniform, Mee allegedly spoke to the woman about her selection procedure and the fact her passport was with the Home Office, before leaving her waiting alone again. The woman said: 'He came back and sat, he started asking me if I was going to have sex with him.' Jurors heard that she told Mee 'no' and that she was simply there to see the 'boss', still believing that there were other people in the recruitment office. When he asked her for sex again he allegedly said that no one would ever know, and later revealed that there was nobody left in the office. The woman told the court that Mee then 'jumped' and kissed her on the lips, before asking her to lift up her skirt and show him her underwear. He then pounced on the woman and began assaulting her, before she told him that she could not breathe. 'I was suffocating because he was on top of me,' the woman said. 'And I told him that I was suffocating, he got scared a bit and that is when he jumped off me, because I wasn't breathing.' After the incident Mee drove the woman home, telling her not to tell anyone what had happened, and said that he was helping her out, the court heard. The woman said she kept quiet about what happened because he was 'a big person in the Army' and she did not think anyone would believe her. Jurors heard that soon afterwards, the alleged victim received a letter from the Home Office saying her visa had been granted, and she thought Mee had been responsible for this. Sergeant: Mee denies assaulting the women between 2010 and 2011 . Mee, who now lives in Scotland, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Jurors also heard that the woman kept a diary in which she wrote entries about her daily life. Writing about the day she was allegedly raped, she said: 'Jock also got a message from the Home Office that they are not going to grant me the extension because I was late to pay the money. 'Jock had to beg for me and he also sent them a letter to appeal on my behalf. I am so thankful to God that Jock helped me out in that. He has always been there for me, if they don't agree he said he will marry me. LOL. 'That is so sweet of him. God, please don't let anything happen to me.' In cross-examination Lisa Wilding QC asked the woman if Mee had offered to marry her 'jokingly or seriously'. 'That is why I put LOL because that is what I thought, because he is telling me all these things that I wasn't aware of,' she replied. In another entry a few days later, she thanked the sergeant for helping her with her application to remain in the UK. She wrote: 'I also thank Jock for making that call to the Home Office. He helped me a lot. If he didn't call, they should have refused me.' Asked why she hadn't told anyone of the rape, the woman explained that she was like an abused child. She said: 'He is just like a father who is abusing a child and the child doesn't know that you are abusing it, and you are torn between love and hate. That is how I felt.' The trial continues.

"At a quick glance, Robert Mugabe appeared to be sporting a new hairstyle and even a pair of earrings when he arrived into South Africa for a state visit today. However, upon closer inspection, it was apparent that the photograph emerged after a bit of camera trickery, and the longer hairdo and dangly earrings did in fact belong to a woman stood directly behind him. The comical image emerged amid claims the president of Zimbabwe is lining up his 24-year-old daughter to succeed him. Scroll down for video . At a glance, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe appeared to be sporting a new hairstyle and even a pair of earrings when he arrived into South Africa for a state visit today, but it was in fact just a cleverly taken shot . It is not the first time an amusing image of the 91-year-old dictator has surfaced, with one of him falling down podium steps becoming an internet sensation earlier this year. The photo, which showed the president taking a tumble after addressing supporters at Harare Airport, was turned into numerous memes showing him in imagined circumstances, such as part of Beyonce's Single Ladies choreography, surfing or running from security forces. However, Mugabe failed to see the funny side and reportedly had no fewer than 27 bodyguards suspended for failing to stop his embarrassing fall. Mugabe arrived into Pretoria, South Africa today for a three-day state visit to the country amid ongoing speculation that his daughter will assume the position of president after him. He had originally planned for his wife Grace to replace him but, due to her deteriorating health, Mugabe is now said to be keen for his daughter Bona to step up. Last year, Mugabe promoted his wife to a senior position within his ruling ZANU-PF party where she led a vicious campaign to remove former vice-president Joice Mujuru from office. Mujuru was long considered a likely successor to Mugabe but she fell out with the veteran leader late last year and was sacked as vice-president in December. It is not the first time an amusing image of the 91-year-old dictator has emerged, with one of him falling down podium steps outside Zimbabwe's Harare Airport (pictured) becoming an internet sensation earlier this year . The photograph, which showed the president taking a fall, was turned into numerous memes, including one which super-imposed him onto Kim Kardashian's iconic 'Break the Internet' cover for Paper Magazine . Other memes which quickly circulated online showed Mugabe taking part in Athletics alongside Usain Bolt . Mugabe reportedly had no fewer than 27 bodyguards suspended for failing to stop his embarrassing fall . Last week, the ruling ZANU-PF party expelled Mujuru altogether for allegedly plotting against the president. The 59-year-old was accused of 'plotting to unconstitutionally remove President Robert Mugabe from office', according to a statement from Simon Khaya-Moyo, spokesman for the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front. She was also accused of 'orchestrating factionalism in the party thereby causing acrimonious divisions' and 'engaging in activities that smack of corruption'. Her allies in government were also fired and expelled from ZANU-PF after Mugabe himself accused her of plotting to oust him. It left experts believing his wife may follow in his footsteps but the 49-year-old has fallen severely ill in recent months and has been taking regular trips to Singapore for medical treatment. In her absence, his daughter Bona has now taken a more prominent role at the Zimbabwean president's side at official events and trips. It is claimed that president Robert Mugabe (centre) wants his 24-year-old daughter Bona (left) to succeed him . Last month, photographs emerged showing her with Mugabe - who is also in poor health - as part of a state delegation that held talks with Japan's prime minister. The move sparked furious criticism from opposition parties and political analysts but a ZANU-PF spokesman insisted the move was not politically motivated. In an interview with Nehanda Radio, Psychology Mazivisa said: 'Madam Bona Mugabe has not done anything nearly as much. 'We refuse to buy into the narrative that for as long as it's President Mugabe doing it, no matter how perfectly lawful it is, it's wrong... It's a barbaric way of doing politics.' But a spokesman for the opposition MDC party said it clearly showed 'that the state has been virtually privatised by the Mugabe dynasty'.","Photo of Robert Mugabe appears to show him with new hairdo and earrings .

"A Banksy mural painted on the only remaining piece of a bombed out house in Gaza could be reunited with the homeless owner who claims he was duped into selling it for just $200. Gaza police have seized the work 'under a court order' from Bilal Khaled, who is accused of buying the piece painted on a door belonging to the Darduna family without telling them its real value. The now homeless family in the impoverished Islamist-run Palestinian enclave says they were 'tricked' into parting with the valuable collector's item by the world famous street artist. Scroll down for video . The Niobe mural has been seized from Bilal Khaled, accused of buying the work painted on a door belonging to the Darduna family without telling them its real value. It is now being held at Khan Yunis public library . The mural painted on the Darduna family's door (left) and the doorway of the ruined house after it was sold . At the end of February, the artist, who chooses to remain anonymous, released an online video showing three works he painted on the walls of Gaza homes destroyed in Israeli air strikes. The disputed graffiti shows Greek goddess Niobe weeping on a metal doorway which was all that remained standing of the Darduna family home. Khaled said it 'will be stored at Khan Yunis public library until this issue is resolved'. Rabie Darduna confirmed this to AFP, adding that the family 'has filed a complaint against Bilal Khaled for fraud and to demand justice in retrieving the graffiti'. Khaled countered: 'I'm going to exercise my rights over this graffiti because I have the paperwork to prove that I own it.' The elusive Banksy produced the artwork during a secret visit to Gaza that was blasted in a summer war last year between Israel and the Hamas movement that runs the territory. It is now the focus of an increasingly bitter dispute between the Dardunas and Khaled. Rabieh Darduna, 33, earlier told AFP he had been approached by a young man calling himself Bilal Khaled and claiming to be a news agency photographer and journalist.

A photographer takes a picture of the mural. The man who bought it claims he has paperwork to prove he owns it, but the Darduna family say they feel cheated by the sale . 'He said it was his agency that had painted the graffiti on the door and other doors, and that they now wanted to recover them,' Darduna said. 'He gave me 700 shekels (around $200) and went off with the door.' Darduna said he later felt cheated for letting the door go for so little when collectors have paid more than a million dollars for a Banksy. The artist's works were seen as a damning critique of Israel's bombardment of Gaza as it battled Hamas, destroying or damaging more than 100,000 homes and killing nearly 2,200 Palestinians, most of them civilians. Banksy's murals also include a giant cat painted on the last remaining wall of a Gaza home playing with a ball of twisted metal. The artist's online video about his trip to Gaza was entitled 'Make this the year YOU discover a new destination'. Banksy is believed to have started out as a graffiti artist in London, although his identity remains shrouded in mystery. His murals have been chiselled out of walls and sold for large sums in the past.","Gaza police have seized world famous street artist's work from Bilal Khaled .

"A Georgia road about 125 miles away from where Duane Allman died nearly 45 years ago took the life of one of the Southern rockers who played on the hit dedicated to the Allman Brothers guitarist. The former drummer and a founding member of the Southern hard rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, Robert 'Bob' Burns Jr, died late Friday in a single-vehicle crash near Cartersville, Georgia.

"It is cold, remote, dangerous, and a hot spot for one of the world's most volatile and entrenched political stand-offs. So it comes as a surprise that the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - located along the no-man's land between the North and South - is next to a burgeoning surf spot for South Korean hipsters, gangsters, ex-pats and its jet-setting adventure class. Photos captured at the site show an eclectic mix of people going about their day-to-day duties, where fishermen and day-trippers are placed alongside soldiers, tanks and their fortified military installations. The DMZ was established in 1953 as a buffer zone to separate the North from the South. Surfer Shannon Aston, from New Zealand, said he felt compelled to start photographing the area while he was living and working in South Korea as a teacher. Mr Aston added: 'The military is ever present and must be respected and everybody does (respect it), but Korea has been divided for decades, so life just goes on. 'There was never much tension, only when people in the north would defect near that coast or security was ramped up after a skirmish or incident between the two countries.' The beaches, often filled with foreigners and day-trippers from the capital Seoul, features an 'overlapping' of military installations along the coast as it nears the border with the north, he said.

"'Discrimination': Gerry Pickens, 28, is suing Orting, Washington, for firing him. He decided to file a suit after vandals sprayed racist graffiti on his car . The first black man ever to be hired as a police officer in a small northwestern town had his SUV sprayed with the N-word over a planned racial discrimination case against town authorities. Gerry Pickens, 28, was fired by the chief of police in Orting, Washington, after just under a year on the town's police force - an act he claims is motivated by racism. Pickens was more used to drugs busts and violent robberies at his previous posting in Atlanta, Georgia - but took a pay cut and moved to quiet Orting, which has just 11 police officers. However, before his probation year was out, Pickens said he had become the butt of racist jokes from residents and his fellow cops - and was eventually fired for reasons he says are down to the color of his skin. The situation came to a head earlier this year, when he woke to find his car daubed with racist graffiti, seemingly prompted by fears he would sue over his dismissal. The vehicle, a Ford Explorer, was filmed by local news station KIRO in the wake of the racist act. On one side, 'n****r' had been sprayed in huge letters. The other side read: 'Sue cheif [sic] and pay'. He later told the King5 TV station: 'I'm in fear for my life because I don't know who in Orting is out to get me'. The incident, at the end of January this year, came to light again after the Washington Post published a long account of Pickens' time in Orting, detailing some of what he sees as racist treatment. 'Sue cheif and pay': Vandals sprayed a misspelled message on the right hand side of Pickens' car dissuading him from legal action. The other side reads 'n****r' He told reporter Eli Saslow that shortly after he started a member of the public played a practical joke on him by calling 911 to report a 'black juvenile' driving a police car after they saw Pickens on patrol. Officers turned it into a joke, continuing to refer to him as the 'black juvenile'. He was also reportedly called a 'token black guy' by colleagues, and feels his vacation requests were handled differently. He also said he was treated unfairly over a complaint that he used a local gym without paying. The allegation - which, according to the News Tribune, was later dropped, saw him suspended from duty. Around the same time, Pickens said, a white officer was subject to an excessive force complaint, but was allowed to keep policing the whole time. Small town: Orting, a Washington town with a population of 8,000, had never had a black cop before Pickens . 'Token black guy': Pickens says that fellow officers picked on him and that he was given harsher treatment than other officers by his superiors . A letter sent to Orting police by Pickens's attorney also said that after he left the force, the chief of police, Bill Drake, 'slandered' his former employee when asked for references by other forces. It claims he 'prevented him from future employment as a police officer.' Drake said he couldn't comment on that allegation due to the impeding legal case. However, the initial letter confirming that Pickens would be fired cited 'unsatisfactory performance'. Other reasons suggested include filing incomplete reports, taking too long responding to an important traffic stop, going home while on duty and not helping an officer in a 'physical altercation'. Allegations: Included in a $5million lawsuit is an allegation that Orting police chief Bill Drake 'slandered' Pickens and stopped him from getting new jobs . According to the Post, Pickens has now filed a suit demanding $5million from Orting - a figure which is more than double the town's annual budget and would equal a payout of around $625 from every single resident. The vandalism of Pickens' car, which is being investigated by a different force to avoid conflicts of interest with Orting Police, remains unsolved. DailyMail.com has contacted Pickens and Orting Police for comment.","Gerry Pickens, 28, was the first black police officer in Orting, Washington .

"A widow has accused Southwest Airlines of leaving her 46-year-old husband to die in the bathroom when he suffered a heart attack on board. Richard Ilczyszyn, a leading financial broker, could be heard 'groaning' and 'crying' by staff on the Orange County-bound plane as it prepared to land. But rather than seeking medical help, the attendants allegedly left the father-of-three in the cubicle and, on landing, letting off all other passengers before calling paramedics. Distraught, Ilczyszyn's wife Kelly, who is a Southwest flight attendant, is filing a wrongful death suit against the airline for failing to act. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Distraught: Kelly Ilczyszyn claims her husband Richard (pictured together with their daughter Sydney) could have survived his heart attack on a Southwest flight if attendants sought medical attention rather than police . Tragic: The leading financial broker was 46 when he lost consciousness on the Orange County-bound flight . Defending their actions, a Southwest spokesman said staff are trained to treat such behavior - screaming and crying in the bathroom - as a security risk. A sheriff's report stated that Ilczyszyn's foot was wedged in the door as he 'groaned' and 'cried' at the end of the flight heading home to Orange County, California, after a business trip. Staff described him to colleagues as 'an unruly passenger,' records reveal. Kelly told CBS News: 'He should have been helped on the aircraft. If they just would have gotten help. 'One flight attendant said she opened the door and she saw the top of my husband's head and his head was down and he was just whimpering, and [she] left him there. 'The paramedics should have met the aircraft. Absolutely. Absolutely. And he would be here today.' Baffled: Kelly, a Southwest flight attendant, said the sequence of events goes against what she would do . Father: She described the pain of having to tell their daughter Sydney that Richard had died . Justice? Kelly has filed a wrongful death suit against Southwest Airlines . As a flight attendant for the same airline, Kelly explained, the sequence of events baffled her. 'I know if a passenger is in distress... we need to help them,' she said. 'We need to figure out, is he okay, does he need medical attention, what's going on. And so I was very confused why they didn't help my husband.' Ilczyszyn's passing was mourned by the financial community. The founder of independent brokerage firm iiTrader, he spent 10 years as a floor trader in Chicago, and often appeared as a commentator on television. Beyond the lawsuit, Kelly said her focus is now on their young daughter Sydney. Breaking the news, she explained, was terrible. 'That was the worst. My daughter and her father were so close. I just said, ""Daddy's not coming home. Daddy went to heaven"".'","Richard Ilczyszyn, 46, died on board a Southwest flight of a heart attack .

Doug Hughes, 61, spent two years planning his stunt, which involved crossing the no-fly zone with letters for all 535 members of Congress. Now under arrest, he has been chaperoned back to his home in Ruskin, Florida, where he will wear an electronic tag until his first court hearing in Washington, D.C., next month. He is expected to issue a statement today and has until 10am on Monday to register with a probation officer. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . House arrest: Doug Hughes, 61, is home in Ruskin, Florida, for his house arrest as he awaits his court date . After a series of interviews, the Secret Service has decided not to prosecute Mr Hughes' wife Alena, who claims she was not aware of the plan. Under interrogation, Mrs Hughes told officers her husband said he was going to Virginia but did not elaborate. The family's attorney Paul Carr told WTPO the saga has been a strain on Mrs Hughes and the couple's 12-year-old daughter. 'After this morning when [Alena] found out she would not be facing any charges, that was a great relief for her,' Carr told the station. 'She knew he was going to leave and indicated he was going to Virginia.' Earlier this week, following the stunt on Wednesday, Mrs Hughes defended her husband as a 'patriot'. 'From the public point of view this is very brave,' Mrs Hughes told WFLA. 'I think he's patriot and I'm proud of him.' However, Mr Hughes, who is charged with violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft, was asked by the Associated Press if he defined himself as a patriot: he said, 'no I'm a mailman.' The mailman has received support on both Facebook and Twitter for the stunt. The 61-year-old even has a fan page on Facebook called 'Doug Hughes is awesome' and many Twitter users have riddled the social media site with kudos for the man. Patriot: Hughes' wife, Alena Hughes (photographed), said she is proud of her husband and said he is a 'patriot' Land: After more than two years of planning, Hughes made it through restricted airspace in a gyrocopter Wednesday carrying 535 letters and landed the aircraft on the Capitol lawn (photographed) Charged: Hughes was promptly arrested for the stunt and charged Thursday with violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft . While, Mrs Hughes says she is proud of her husband and will 'support him no matter what' the Belarus native told NBC that the days following the incident have been 'stressful.' She said that she has not slept much since her husband's stunt and felt betrayed because if something had happened to Hughes it would have affected their family. She and Hughes have a 12-year-old daughter and Hughes has adult children from a previous marriage. Mrs Hughes struggled to describe the situation to the child and told the 12-year-old that her father 'loves his country.' Mr and Mrs Hughes have been married for thirteen years. After meeting online, the two went on a few dates in Moscow and St. Petersburg in Russia. Mrs Hughes moved to the U.S. in 2002 and the two got married. Mrs Hughes said she knew that Doug was interested in politics but had no idea of his risky plan when he bought the gyrocopter two years ago. She told WFLA that she was sure Hughes wasn't doing anything wrong. Struggle: Mrs Hughes struggled to describe the situation to their 12-year-old daughter . Lawyer: Mrs Hughes said her husband had his own lawyer in Washington, but she has hired an attorney, Paul Carr, in Florida to represent her . Mrs Hughes said her husband had his own lawyer in Washington, but she has hired an attorney, Paul Carr, in Florida to represent her. 'After discussing the situation with her, I didn't see any criminal intent,' Carr said. 'In fact, there's a lot of people that would like to approach Congress.' Hughes' stunt raised security concerns as lawmakers said the incident exposed a security gap. The concerns were raised further amid revelations that Hughes was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago and revealed his plan for the stunt to both the Tampa Bay Times -- which has recently come under fire for failing to stop the stunt -- and in a 2013 blog post.","Doug Hughes landed a gyrocopter on the U.S. Capitol lawn on Wednesday .

"Ed Miliband's proposed change in the rules on 'non-doms' would cost Britain billions, experts warned last night. The Labour leader announced plans to overhaul Britain's non-domicile regime, which allows 116,000 foreigners and people with foreign links to pay tax only on money that they bring into Britain. Mr Miliband initially suggested he would 'abolish' non-dom status – but it later emerged that Labour is effectively proposing a time limit on it of between two and five years. Scroll down for video . Crowd-pleaser? Ed Miliband joins crowds in Warwick yesterday, where he announced his non-dom plans . The Tories pointed out that a five-year grace period would exempt up to six in every ten non-doms from the crackdown anyway, because many non-doms do not stay longer than five years. Announcing the policy, Labour aides suggested the change in the rules, which date back to the 18th century, would raise as much as £1billion. But tax advisers immediately disputed this, saying driving non-doms away would in fact cost the Treasury significant sums. With non-doms paying around £8billion in tax and national insurance a year, it is claimed that Labour's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in Treasury coffers. Within hours of announcing the policy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was forced to admit he did not actually know how much extra cash the measure would raise. In a further embarrassment, it later emerged that just three months ago he himself had said such a move would be counter-productive – saying it would result in the country losing money. In a video that emerged yesterday, Mr Balls can be seen telling a local BBC radio station that abolishing the status altogether 'will probably end up costing Britain money because some people will leave the country'. Despite this, the surprise move by Labour wrongfooted the Conservatives, who took several hours to craft a coherent response. The issue of non-doms is a sensitive one for the Tories, because Mr Miliband has claimed David Cameron is close to 'dodgy donors', including non-doms, who support the party. Labour has repeatedly attempted to characterise the Tories as friends of the rich – despite official figures showing the best-off are paying more tax than they did under the last Labour government. Last night, sources close to Chancellor George Osborne indicated he would consider scrapping the right to pass on non-dom status to heirs. Last year, Mr Osborne announced a new £90,000 annual charge for people who are non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes but have lived here for 17 of the past 20 years. Tory officials said it was more effective to hit non-doms with an annual levy than to 'tinker' with the status. The Chancellor said: 'Labour's policy is a total shambles. You have Ed Balls admitting it will cost Britain money and then when you look at the small print it turns out the majority of non-doms won't be affected.' In a speech at the University of Warwick, Mr Miliband insisted non-dom status was an 'arcane' rule dating back to the time of William Pitt the Younger, allowing a 'few people at the top' to 'operate under different rules'. 'There are people who live here in Britain like you and me, work here in Britain like you and me, are permanently settled here in Britain, like you and me, were brought up here, but just aren't required to pay taxes like you and me,' he said. Graham Aaronson QC, who chaired an independent committee which drew up new rules against tax avoidance, said the non-dom regime did need reform. He said he had advised the Treasury two years ago the right to pass it on to heirs should be scrapped, and suggested he also favoured removing the right for British citizens to claim it. But he was scathing about Labour's proposals, which he said would cost the country dear. 'It's either unbelievable deception or the man is completely pig ignorant,' he told the Daily Mail. 'I couldn't believe what I was listening to. This is why politicians have such a bad name. Mr Miliband was describing non-doms born here, brought up here, who go to school here, use our hospitals. The audience would have thought that's what a non-dom is. But it's a very small number. There are those that live abroad, their main family life, home and base but they choose to live in the UK for a month and a half a year. They pay taxes when they're here, they may employ people. It's ridiculous to treat them the same way.' Jolyon Maugham, the QC who advised Labour on its plans for reform, conceded the policy could lead to a flight of wealthy taxpayers from Britain. Yet the Labour supporter was cited by both Mr Miliband and Mr Balls as an independent expert who supports the policy. The QC, who admitted the Tories have a 'terrific record' on squeezing tax dodging, said his own calculations suggested the measure was likely to raise about £1billion, but there was a risk of a 'negative tax yield'. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg defended the non-dom rule, saying it allowed people to come to Britain, some of whom were not 'massively rich'. Simon Walker, of the Institute of Directors, said: 'It's very unclear what additional revenue would be raised, but the UK's international reputation would be put at risk.' Nicholas Leeming, of estate agents Jackson-Stops, said: 'The Labour Party is out to target the wealth creators in this country and will effectively close down London to international businesses and investors.'","Experts warn Ed Miliband's changes for non-doms would cost millions .

"Tiger Woods has revealed his wrist bone popped out after he swung and hit a tree root during the final round of the Masters on Sunday. The 39-year-old was on the ninth hole when he found himself 470 yards away from the pin with the ball nestled in pine straws. However when he followed through, the four-time champion at Augusta slammed the club into a root, causing him to wince and grab his hand in agony. It forced the joint out of place, but Woods shunned medical attention and simply pushed it back in himself. Tiger Woods looks in agony after his club came into contact with a tree root on the ninth hole at Augusta. He later revealed his wrist bone had 'popped out' of place . The 39-year-old is clearly in agony as he is forced to drop his club on the follow through . He then grabs his wrist and winces. After finishing his round he revealed that his wrist bone had popped out - so he was forced to put it back in . His reaction prompted concerns he may have suffered another injury setback. However he managed to shake off the scare and finish his round. Woods, playing in his 20th Masters tournament, ended up at 5-under-par on 283, tied for 17th. 'It hurts; it definitely hurts,' Woods said. 'I didn't know there was a tree root there. I drilled the club straight into it. It didn't move, but my body kept moving. 'There's a little joint that popped out, and I was able to somehow put it back in, which didn't feel very good. 'At least I got it back in; I could move my hand again. It's sore. I'm not going to be lifting any weights for a while.' He also admitted that he may not return to the course for a while. Despite finishing 13 strokes behind 21-year-old winner Jordan Spieth, this was Woods' best finish in a tournament in over a year. Spieth became the youngest winner since Woods when he was given the coveted green jacket on Sunday. After his final putt he went an embraced his tearful childhood sweetheart Annie Verret. The Texan native, whose life-long dream has been to win the Masters, was undoubtedly being watched on television at home by his youngest sibling, Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Ellie has helped to keep Spieth grounded, according to their mother. Speaking after his win, Spieth said: 'It was very nerve-wracking today. I didn't sleep all last night. Just got out here and got in a little rhythm. With two major champions right behind, I couldn't let up. It was the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport. It was remarkable. He added: 'I saw my family and friends right behind the green there, and knew it was going to be a done deal. I'm still kind of in shock a little bit.' Spieth's victory comes a year after he lost a bid to become the youngest player to win the Masters. This year, he did not let anyone get closer to him than three shots following his record start. He closed with a 2-under 70, missing a 5-foot par putt on the final hole that would have set another record.

"Facebook has come under fire after removing a video that shows Aboriginal women in a traditional ceremony because they were topless.

The video had already had 30,000 hits when it was removed after three days on Sunday.

The show's co-creator Rachel Clements told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'I've moved from anger to disappointment to just bewilderment, really,' Clements said. 'I just think it's silly and disrespectful to the women who were dancing for us. 'Out of all the reasons we could have been pulled, nudity is not high on the list. It's ridiculous.' On 12 April, Clements reposted the video on the 8MMM Aboriginal Radio Facebook page.

"Director of the British Museum Neil MacGregor has announced he is stepping down from the job at the end of the year. Mr MacGregor, 68, who has been at the helm of the museum since 2002, said it was 'a difficult thing' to decide to leave. He previously ran the National Gallery and has also worked as a broadcaster - most notably on his Radio 4 series A History Of The World In 100 Objects which was inspired by the museum's collection. Neil MacGregor, 68, pictured at the British Museum, which he has lead since 2002, said it was 'a difficult thing' to decide to leave after 13 years . Mr MacGregor said last night: 'Working with this collection and, above all, with the colleagues here has been the greatest privilege of my professional life. 'But I've decided that now is the time to retire from full-time employment and the end of this year seems a good time to go. 'The new building has been completed, so we at last have proper exhibition space, new conservation and scientific facilities, and first-class accommodation for our growing research activities. 'We have built strong partnerships with fellow museums across the UK, and are rapidly expanding our programme of loans and training around the world.

'It is an exhilarating prospect, and it will start with the new Islamic galleries and with plans for the future of the Old Reading Room.' The museum's chairman Sir Richard Lambert said Mr MacGregor had done an 'outstanding' job. He said: 'The trustees are hugely grateful for everything he has done to bring the collection to life, and to tell its many different stories. We respect his decision to move on, and want to support him in his new projects. 'We are now starting the process of looking for someone to take on what will be one of the best and most challenging jobs of its kind in the world. 'The museum is in great shape, and we are fortunate to have an outstanding team in place to lead its activities and help build its future with the new director.

Britons are so confident of a scorching summer that bookmakers are receiving tens of thousands of pounds in bets on this year breaking records. The record for the hottest day ever in the UK was set more than a decade ago in August 2003 when temperatures hit 38.1C (101F) in Gravesend, Kent. Coral’s price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1, while Ladbrokes has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever.

Ladbrokes is also offering 8/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 in Camden, north London, will be broken by the end of the month. Met Office spokesman Laura Young said: ‘We are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days. 'Unless you are in north-west Scotland, which will see quite a lot of rain, it will be dry and sunny. 'Wednesday will be 22C to 25C (72F to 77F) or higher in places.

The Met Office three-month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer. But thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, the weather we get in April doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect. 'We’re still in the midst of spring, so it’s far too early to say what the months of June, July and August may hold.’ Giant jellyfish are being spotted off Britain earlier than normal thanks to the warm weather, it was claimed yesterday. Kayaker Rupert Kirkwood, a seasoned sea watcher, was stunned to see the giant creatures off Hope Cove in Devon. The barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to 6ft long, were pictured floating next to Mr Kirkwood’s kayak in the sun-drenched blue waters. Up close: Rupert Kirkwood's son Henry had this encounter with a barrel jellyfish near Hope Cove off the coast of south Devon . The species are usually found in more tropical areas such as the Mediterranean Sea. But the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant more plankton is available - and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Floating: The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way . The Red Cross says that anyone who does get stung should not try to use urine to provide relief as the healing properties of this are an urban myth. Vinegar is said to be far more effective. Vet Mr Kirkwood said: ‘No doubt they [are] encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. ‘I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’","Yesterday was officially hottest day of 2015 with a high of 22.7C  - with temperatures rising to 25C today .

"A New York photographer built an elaborate indoor set on a Brooklyn sidewalk for a man to propose to his girlfriend on Valentine's Day. Justin Bettman caught the media's attention a few months ago when he began his 'Set in the Street' project. Bettman, sometimes with the help of designer Gozde Eker, would build sets that, in pictures, looked like the inside of a living room, child's bedroom, or a bathroom complete with a clawfoot tub. Jose Luis proposed to his girlfriend on a set designed and built by New York photographer Justin Bettman . Although it looks like a dining room, the photo shoot actually took place on the edge of the water in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where the couple had their first date . But zoom out of the picture and it was revealed that Bettman was actually building these sets right on the street, using mostly furniture that had been given away or left for garbage. Bettman's work caught the attention of Jose Luis, who saw a feature on the photographer in New York Magazine and sent him an email with an idea, according toPetaPixel. 'I am planning to propose to my girlfriend, and I was wondering if there is a way for you to help me do it,' he wrote. 'As you can understand, I am not the richest man in the world. I am simply in love.' Bettman said after he read the email there 'wasn't even a question' on whether he would say yes. 'Of course I was going to build a set for this guy to propose on,' he said in a video chronicling the proposal. Bettman told Daily Mail Online that Luis' girlfriend thought they had been cast in a photo shoot before Luis got down on one knee and popped the question . The set was built on the edge of the water in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the very spot where Luis and his girlfriend had their first date. Bettman and his crew began building the dining room on the snow-covered ground at 4am, using furniture they had found on Craigslist, friends' apartments and right off the sidewalk. Meanwhile, Luis told his girlfriend that he had submitted them for a casting to be in a photo shoot by a random photographer he found on Craigslist. After Luis revealed to his girlfriend they had been chosen for the shoot, they arrived on the set and Bettman pretended he had never met either of them, the photographer told Daily Mail Online.

'It was pretty surreal to see him get down on one knee and ask her,' Bettman told Daily Mail Online. 'It was emotional for everyone -- my makeup artist started crying.' After the excited girlfriend said yes, Bettman left the set standing, as he does with all his creations. Bettman posted a sign that invited passerbys to pose and take pictures with the set and share their photos on Instagram under the hashtag #setinthestreet, so that people could see how it transformed with both time and different personalities. The photographer now leaves his sets after he finishes his photo shoots, inviting passerbys to take photographs and add their own spin to the backdrops .

"A bowel cancer patient told he had just 18 months to live claims he has been cured by  cannabis oil. David Hibbitt, 33, was diagnosed with the disease in July 2012 and underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery to remove his large bowel. Doctors told him the cancer was terminal - so he decided to try cannabis oil as a last resort and bought it from a local dealer for £50 a gram. Now the father-of-one says he has been cancer-free since his last scan in January  - and puts the class-B drug down to his miracle recovery. David Hibbitt, 33, claims doctors said he had between 18 months and five years to live after being diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. In desperation, he tried cannabis oil, which he now credits with his recovery . He is now looking forward to the future after tying the knot with his partner of six years Heather Martin, 26, at a registry office today. Mr Hibbitt, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'Friends had told me about cannabis oil and I dismissed it at first. I've never been into drugs. 'But in February last year I was told I only had 18 months to five years to live, and I felt I had to try everything I could. 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die.' After going online to research his options, he discovered a lot of information about cannabis oil - and decided to try it. 'I pay around £50 for a gram from a bloke I know who makes it,' he said. 'That lasts me about a month usually. 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy. 'The pain just seemed to disappear and it seems to have done the job. 'I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there.' Mr Hibbitt was diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer after initially being told he was suffering from piles. Mr Hibbitt, with fiance Heather, said: 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die' After undergoing treatment at the Christie Hospital, in Manchester, the cancer returned and he had another operation in July 2013 followed by more chemotherapy. He was given the all-clear before Christmas that year, but a month later he found a lump, and was told the cancer was in the lymph nodes in his groin. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours. 'But at the moment there isn't good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts. 'Researchers are collecting patients' experiences to build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not, although this is weak evidence compared to properly-run clinical trials. 'Cancer Research UK is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabinoid-based drugs in order to gather solid data on whether they benefit people with cancer.' Mr Hibbitt, who works in advertising, added: 'This time they told me there wasn't a lot they could do. 'In July, after doing a lot of research, I got some cannabis oil. I was having chemo, and I was getting to a point where I couldn't really do much, I had no energy. 'In August I decided I'd had enough and I was going to stop the chemotherapy. In October, he had an operation to remove the affected lymph nodes at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. But he chose to carry on taking cannabis oil rather than have any more treatment, deciding against further chemotherapy sessions. Following a scan in January he was given the all-clear - paving the way for him to organise his wedding. Mr Hibbitt, who has a five-year-old son, Ashton, said: 'We never thought this would happen, it's great. Fingers crossed now I will grow old. 'I feel really good and I hope my story will help other people.' His fiance Heather, a nursery nurse, said: 'I didn't want him to take the cannabis oil at first because it's illegal, but I saw the change in him and slowly got used to it. 'He is a determined person and did a lot of research. He wanted to live. 'We are all amazed how well he's done. I can't see my life without him. We have come through a hell of a lot.' Describing the effects of cannabis oil, he said: 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy.The pain just seemed to disappear. I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there' Cancer Research UK says it is aware of patients using cannabis extracts to treat themselves but stressed there is 'no good evidence'  to prove it was safe and effective. The charity is supporting clinical trials into the use of the drug and a synthetic cannabinoid to treat the disease. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours.

"Exactly 19 years ago on Wednesday, Kathy Bush made national headlines when she was arrested and accused of deliberately making her 9-year-old daughter ill for attention. All grown up, Kathy's now 27-year-old daughter Jennifer spoke out for the first time on the anniversary, saying she has repaired her relationship with her mother and believes she was never abused. 'Jennifer made it very clear: She thinks her mother never abused her,' Fort Lauderdale lawyer Robert Buschel, who defended Kathy in her criminal trial and released Jennifer's statement on Wednesday, told the Sun Sentinel. Scroll down for video . Ripped apart: In 1996, at the age of 9, Jennifer Bush was taken from her family after her mother Kathy (right) was accused of making her ill on purpose . Jennifer spent the first years of her life in and out of hospitals, as doctors struggled to find a solution to her near chronic illness that caused digestive issues and seizures. Chronically ill: In the first years of her life, Jennifer was in and out of the hospital as she battled chronic illness. A health care worker later reported Kathy Bush to authorities, suspecting the woman of purposefully poisoning her daughter with extra doses of medicine . Faced with mounting medical bills, Kathy started lobbying for health care reform and would often speak publicly and with publications about her family's battle to take care of Jennifer. Kathy even visited the Clinton White House to raise awareness of the issue. Then, in 1995, a health care worker reported to police suspicions that Kathy may have been intentionally making Jennifer sick by giving her extra doses of medicine. Police and child welfare authorities launched an investigation, and after a year amounted enough evidence to arrest Kathy on child abuse charges. Kathy's lawyer blames the investigation on Menchausen Syndrome by Proxy - a syndrome that had grown in notoriety at the time of his client's arrest. Those with the syndrome enact pain on others in order to draw pity and attention to themselves. After the arrest, Jennifer was taken from her family and put in foster care where she remained until she was 18. After a long legal battle, a jury in 1999 found Kathy guilty of aggravated child abuse and sentenced the mother of three to five years in prison. She served three years and was released in June 2005. Still the two were not allowed to see each other until Jennifer left foster care, at which point she was an adult. Against the odds, the two were able to repair their relationship and they now live close to each other in Georgia. While Jennifer declined to speak on camera about her life today, she issued a statement to news station WPLG, revealing the fact that she is now married to her high school sweetheart and working as a social worker. '[Nineteen] years ago today, on April 15, 199[6], my life was changed forever. That was the day that I was taken from my home and my family, but that day has not changed how close my family continues to be. 'The ten years I spent in Foster Care were traumatic, and I had some devastating things happen to me. 'However, I persevered because of all of the angels that were there for me during these difficult times. These people helped shaped the women I have become today. 'Today, I can proudly say my family is extremely close knit. We have flourished despite the devastating separation....My parents and I have picked up from where we left off, and have a very close and loving relationship.' When asked for comment, Kathy Bush issued her own one-sentence statement: 'We are very proud of Jennifer and our sons, they have all grown up to be fine adults and dedicated their lives to serving others.' [Nineteen] years ago today , on April 15, 199[6], my life was changed forever. That was the day that I was taken from my home and my family, but that day has not changed how close my family continues to be. The ten years I spent in Foster Care were traumatic, and I had some devastating things happen to me. However, I persevered because of all of the angels that were there for me during these difficult times. These people helped shaped the women I have become today. Today, I can proudly say my family is extremely close knit. We have flourished despite the devastating separation. The bond I had with my brothers, prior to being removed from my family, is something that never changed. My relationship with them helped carry me through my years in foster care. My parents and I have picked up from where we left off, and have a very close and loving relationship. Today, I am living my dream as a social worker, and changing the lives of the children, and families I am working with today. I am married to my high school sweetheart, who has walked along side me for the past ten years. I get a lot of joy making memories with my family, and making a difference in my community. Although this isn’t always a happy anniversary, it is a day to celebrate my family and who we are today. My message to foster children: . Growing up in the foster care isn’t an easy task. Actually, the odds are often against you to be succeed in life. I challenge you to rise up against those odds, and be the very best you can be with the circumstances you are facing. Don’t be ashamed or embarrassed to get the extra help that is offered, you will be thankful that you did in the future. There were many times that it would have been easier to give up, but its persevering against the odds that makes it even more fulfilling. Speak up for yourself, be your biggest advocate, and be proactive. At the end of the day we owe it to ourselves. Don’t let your current circumstance shape your future, and never doubt yourself! With respect, . Jennifer Bush .","Kathy Bush was arrested on April 15, 1996 on suspicion of purposefully making her 9-year-old daughter Jennifer ill for attention .

"A motorist in China who was driving to visit his mother saw an injured woman lying by the side of a motorway but decided stopping to help would be too much inconvenience. When the man, named by Chinese media as Mr Zhang, arrived at his mother's house and found that she wasn't home, neighbours told him that she had left early that morning with the intention of meeting him. A sense of dread crept over the driver as he remembered the elderly woman lying by the side of the road, People's Daily Online reported, and when he returned to the scene of the accident he found his mother covered in blood and dying. The driver, named in Chinese media as Mr Zhang, drove past an injured woman who turned out to be his mother . He called police but his mother, from Wuhu, in Anhui Province, died on the way to hospital, it was reported. A neighbour said: 'Mr Zhang is the victim's son. He wells up as soon as he mentions his mother and the accident she was involved in. 'Zhang recalls he set off early in the morning to see his mother who lived in the ancestral village. En route he drove by a hit-and-run scene.' Mr Zhang told local media that he didn't want to stop for the elderly victim because of the trouble it might cause him.

"A mother who is accused of killing her children and then stuffing their bodies in a freezer was removed from court after confronting the father during a parental rights termination hearing. Mitchelle Blair, 35, from Michigan, is charged with with felony murder, premeditated murder and torture. Court officers carrying out a March 24 eviction at the family's apartment found the frozen corpses of 13-year-old Stoni Ann Blair and 9-year-old Stephen Gage Berry. Blair used an expletive Wednesday in juvenile court as visitation between her two living children and their fathers was discussed. Blair also said Alexander Dorsey was 'never there' for his children. Scroll down for video . A mother who is accused of killing her children and then stuffing their bodies in a freezer was removed from court on Wednesday after she started shouting about her one of their father's had not helped her enough . During the parental rights termination hearing at Lincoln Hall of Justice in Detroit, Mich., Blair yelled at Alex Dorsey, father of one of the children found dead in the Detroit home (both pictured) Mitchelle Blair looks at Alex Dorsey, father of one of the children found dead in a freezer of her home . Dorsey is the father of Blair's 17-year-old daughter and was the father of 13-year-old Stoni Blair who was found dead in a freezer. Dorsey, did not respond to her yelling and sat with his hands clasped and stared silently ahead. 'How many birthdays did you miss?' Blair said. 'Never. Never. You understand what I'm saying.' She was removed from the court when she failed to stop shouting, although she returned silently 13 minutes later, reports the Detroit Free Press. State officials are seeking to terminate Blair's parental rights to her other two children, as well as the parental rights of her children's fathers. Blair's two surviving children have been placed into a relative's care. Steven Berry, the father of deceased Stephen and Blair's eight-year-old son, only turned up at towards the end. Both fathers owe thousands of dollars in child support, according to a court document. Wayne County Circuit Judge Edward Joseph required supervised visitation for the fathers, denying a request from attorneys for unsupervised visits with their children because previously each of them had only had visit with their child. Judge Edward J. Joseph presides over a parental rights termination hearing for Mitchell Blair in court . Detroit Free Press reported that after the hearing, Berry declined to comment. Dorsey said Blair had always wanted to see his children and tried to develop a relationship, but Blair would not let him. 'I don't hate her,' he said. 'She's the mother of my children.' Blair initially was charged with child abuse, but more charges had been expected after autopsies revealed the siblings were beaten to death. Investigators believe Stephen died in August 2012 and Stoni died the following May. In a court filing, the state said her daughter described a home where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood and hit and burned with a hot curling iron. Medical exams revealed evidence of abuse, including numerous scars, on the surviving children. Twenty-five scars were found on the boy's back that were consistent with being hit by an extension cord, according to a petition obtained by the Detroit News. Blair's teenage daughter also described how her siblings were killed, according to court papers. 'Blair tortured Stephen for approximately two weeks prior to his death by tying a belt around his neck, throwing hot water on him while in the shower and putting a plastic bag over his head,' the state said, quoting the 17-year-old. Stephen was 'unresponsive' on Aug 30, 2012, and Blair wrapped his body in bed linen and put him in the freezer, the state said. Nine months later, Blair became 'enraged' when Stoni said she didn't like her surviving siblings and strangled the girl with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag, the department said. Blair then made the teen 'put Stoni in the deep freezer following her death,' the agency said.

The apartment was reportedly filled with food and trash and rendered almost 'unlivable', according to the report. Blair's eight-year-old boy also was aware that his sister and brother were killed and subsequently placed in the freezer, the department said. While being questioned, Blair told investigators she placed Stephen 'in a boiling hot tub of water until his feet blistered' because she found out Stephen was allegedly sexually assaulting a relative, according to the Detroit News. Blair also told police that when he died, she wrapped him 'in his favorite blanket' and put him in the freezer, the police report states. The surviving children did not mention sexual abuse when they were interviewed by counselors, according to a juvenile court petition.","Mitchelle Blair, 35, is charged with with felony murder, premeditated murder and torture .

"His pristine white uniform was the epitome of buttoned-up respectability. But that was Prince Harry’s only nod to formality yesterday as he began his month-long visit Down Under. Indeed, the playful royal larked around like a true larrikin. He laughed and joked with wellwishers. He offered handshakes and high fives. And he gurned like a good-un, making himself an instant hit with younger fans. Prince Harry was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, all keen to catch a glimpse of the royal . The Prince pulled funny faces at a young girl waiting in the crowd with her mother, as others snapped photos on their smartphones . 'The people's Prince' continued to show off his playful side, high-fiving a young boy who was waiting behind a barricade . The Prince is in Australia to report for official military duty but he enjoyed his interaction with excited fans . Prince Harry has declared 'selfies are bad' during his visit to the Australian capital of Canberra as revellers scrambled to get a piece of the royal on their camera phones . The prince spent 20 minutes chatting and posing for photographs for crowds in Canberra, where he made a beeline for a youngster with a banner saying ‘Redheads Rule’. Ginger-haired Ethan Toscan, 12, who earned a high five from the royal after he spotted his home-made sign in the crowd, said: ‘He said it was awesome to be a redhead. 'It was a pleasure meeting the prince and being able to shake his hand and give him a high five. I’m over the moon.’ While Harry was clearly eager to please, he didn’t go as far as agreeing to a selfie with a teenage admirer. The prince, 30, smiled as he told the girl: ‘No, I hate selfies ... I know you’re young, but selfies are bad. Just take a normal photograph.’ This seems to be a view shared by his grandmother, the Queen, who has said she finds it ‘strange’ to be greeted by a sea of smartphones at public engagements. Harry joked around with Ethan after spotting his sign and walking over to chat with the 12-year-old boy . Young Prince Harry fan Ethan poses with his 'Red Heads Rule' poster outside Canberra's War Memorial on Monday . Hundreds waited in the rain to see Harry, who was wearing a wristband in support of his charity project the Invictus Games – a sports event for injured service personnel – featuring the slogan: ‘I am the master of my fate.’ On arrival at the Australian War Memorial, he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is likely to be his only public engagement during a four-week attachment to the Australian army, during which he is expected to train on helicopter simulators and join bush patrols in the North. Harry is in the last few weeks of his service before leaving the Army in June. He and Prince Charles will travel to Turkey later this month for the Anzac Day dawn service at Gallipoli, where Commonwealth forces including a joint Australian and New Zealand army suffered heavy casualties during the First World War. There was a potentially awkward moment as Dr Brendan Nelson, director of the Australian War Memorial, asked if Harry had seen the film ‘Gallipoli’. The 1981 movie, starring Mel Gibson, was criticised by some historians for depicting the British as ordering waves of Australian soldiers to their deaths. Harry said he had not seen the film and was told: ‘It’s worth watching.’ One woman grabbed Harry's face and leaned in for a kiss on the cheek, with the Prince happily obliging .

"Nicola Sturgeon has warned David Cameron she will trigger a second Scottish independence referendum if he tries to take Britain to the EU exit door. The steely First Minister, in her first interview with the Daily Mail on the day of her election manifesto launch, said for the first time that she would regard an 'out' vote in the Tories' proposed poll on EU membership as justification to reopen the question of breaking up the UK. She also revealed that she intends to be in London on May 8 - the day after the general election - to personally lead the SNP's negotiating team in the event of another hung Parliament. Scroll down for video . The Scottish First Minister - unveiling the SNP manifesto today - revealed she would regard an 'out' vote in the Tories' proposed poll on EU membership as justification to reopen the question of breaking up the UK . Miss Sturgeon said she - not her predecessor Alex Salmond - would take charge of any talks, even though she is not running for a Westminster seat and he is. 'If there are negotiations to be had I'll be there,' she said. In a wide-ranging interview, the First Minister, riding high on polls suggesting the SNP is on the brink of a landslide unprecedented in modern British politics: . Miss Sturgeon also revealed that she - not her predecessor Alex Salmond - would take charge of any talks, even though she is not running for a Westminster seat and he is . The Scottish First Minister addressed supporters at an SNP rally at a indoor mountain climbing centre in Edinburgh . Miss Sturgeon's manifesto included proposals to seek to thwart the Tories' planned in/out EU referendum by 2017, the first time voters would have had a say on our place in Europe for 40 years. She said SNP MPs would seek to amend an EU referendum Bill to insist on a 'double majority' - meaning that unless England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each vote to leave the EU, the UK would remain a member state. The First Minister, who has previously said merely that 'something substantial' would have to change before the SNP held a second independence referendum, said a Tory government seeking to take Scotland out of the EU against its will would be a trigger. The Scottish Nationalists lost last year's independence referendum by 55 per cent to 45 per cent, having previously suggested it was a 'once in a generation' event. David Cameron speaks to supporters during a Conservative Party rally  in Sandymoor, Cheshire . Miss Sturgeon told the Mail that an EU exit would be 'something substantive... change in circumstances' that would mean a second Scottish independence referendum was necessary. 'It's if there was a vote that ended up taking Scotland out against our will. That's the only concrete example,' she said. 'I'm quite clear: a vote for the SNP at this election, I'm not taking that as a mandate for another referendum. So it would have to be something like the EU situation. 'It's if there was an out vote across the UK and Scotland wants to stay in. I suspect if we were in those circumstances there would be a clamour of people across Scotland to look again at the independence question, whether I'm proposing it or not. 'But what I'm talking about with a change of circumstances, it's not me trying to pluck out the conditions out of thin air. I do mean it - there will have to be a change in circumstances and we haven't even started the process of the 2016 manifesto [for Scottish Parliament elections] yet. 'If I put a commitment to a referendum in any future SNP manifesto, people have to vote for that manifesto so I can't do that lightly. I have to be sure that there is a change of circumstances that has led to people by majority opinion wanting another referendum.' Miss Sturgeon, who received a rock star welcome from party faithful as she launched her blueprint for power near Edinburgh yesterday, was scathing about Labour's economic plans. 'Labour like to talk the langauge of anti austerity but the substance of the proposals is not anti austerity,' she said. 'This is not all about conversations between me and Ed Miliband. I know for a fact there are plenty of folk in the Labour ranks that agree with me on austerity more than they agree with Ed Miliband. 'There will be support. One of Ed Miliband's shadow ministers has said he would never vote for the renwal of Trident. Yes, people focus on talks between the leaders but what I'm saying is that we'll try to forge alliances across the Commons. The Prime Minister today warned that Miss Sturgeon would hold the UK to 'ransom' if the SNP holds the balance of power in May . The SNP have vowed never to strike a deal to keep David Cameron in Number 10 - whatever the result of the election . 'We will prevail on some things, we won't prevail on others. We would like to build those alliances with people of like mind across different parties.' The First Minister said she had been 'surprised' by messages of support from people in England and Wales who said they wished they could vote SNP. 'After the first leaders' debate it pleasantly surprised me. As a proportion of everyone in England it was a tiny proportion but it was a lot - I still get a lot of emails saying ""we wish we could vote SNP"". There are people in England saying ""I wish Labour was saying these things. I wish we had a progressive alternative."" 'That's why I do think David Cameron is making a mistake trying to base so much of his campaign on the assumption that people are afraid of the SNP. People are very frustrated. This is borne out in the polls. There is not a clear enough big enough decision and divide between the two main parties.' Ed Miliband insisted he would not be held to ransom by the SNP . Asked about voters' fears in the rest of the UK at the prospect of a separatist party wielding power, which led to the Mail dubbing her 'The Most Dangerous Woman in Britain', she joked: 'I thought it was possibly one of the nicest things the Daily Mail had ever said about me.' Brandishing a picture in her manifesto of her hugging a small child on the campaign trail, she asked: 'Do I look like one of the most dangerous women in Britain? Come on! I don't think that's how people in England see the SNP. 'That's not to say they agree with us on independence - many do, but many don't - but I don't think many people in England see the SNP as this big bogeyman threat. 'If there are some people that do, I take my responsibility seriously to persuade them that they are wrong and I do accept that I have a big responsibility in how I conduct the campaign and how I speak to people both in and outside Scotland to persuade people that there's not anything to be scared of from having the SNP in big numbers both inside and outside Scotland.' She insisted that she - not Mr Salmond or the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson - would lead hung Parliament negotiations if, as polls predict, the party takes as many as 50 seats and holds the balance of power at Westminster. 'I'll be there,' she said. 'I'm the leader of the SNP, I'll be in charge of any decisions and negoaitions and anything that happens after May 7.' Miss Sturgeon denied that a hung parliament, led by a minority Labour government propped up vote-by-vote by the SNP, would be a recipe for chaos which would further undermine voters' trust in Parliament. 'My experience of being in a minority government - and it's a very direct experience of being deputy leader in a minority government for four years... it can, contrary to what you are saying about reducing trust in politics, can have the opposite effect because the public see politicians having to win arguments rather than votes by sheer force of numbers. The experience of minority government in Scotland was stable - clearly, because it lasted for four years. 'So based on that experience I have a different view of what a minority government situation and I don't think it has to be unstable or ineffective. On the contrary.' Miss Sturgeon said the coalition's fixed term parliaments legislation would strengthen the SNP's hand. It means general elections are held on a fixed timetable every five years, and makes it much harder for an election to happen at other times. Two-thirds of MPs now have to back an earlier election, and governments can lose votes on Budgets, Queen's Speeches and other key legislation without it being seen as a vote of no confidence and triggering an election. 'The Fixed Term Parliaments Act does make it possible to change a government's position without threatening the existence of that government... including a budget, though I must say I'm not going into this trying to block a budget. That's not the mindset we are taking into this. 'But the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, in a House of Commons context, has made the prospect of a minority government a much more viable one.'

"A nervous Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta on Friday to watch her beau Tiger Woods in his quest for a fifth Masters title - and fifth green jacket. And while it was a good day Woods, the golfing great still had some stressful moments and still has a way to go in catching up to leader, 21-year-old Jordan Spieth. Heading into the weekend he is a very, very distant 12 strokes behind a seemingly unstoppable Spieth, with 36 holes left to play. Scroll down for video . Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta Friday to watch boyfriend Tiger Woods (above) play in the second round of the Masters . Vonn (above) looked stressed at times though Woods played a solid round, carding a three-under-par 69 . Woods is still well behind the leader, hot young American star Jordan Spieth (above) This as Woods, competing after a two-month absence to retool his game, showed flashes of his old magic as he fired his best score at the Masters in four years in Friday's second round. The former world number one has been under intense scrutiny after struggling badly with his chipping when last seen on the PGA Tour but he played solidly at steamy Augusta National to card a three-under-par 69. That left Woods at two-under 142, far behind the pacesetting American Spieth, but still delighted to be in contention after working hard to resurrect his game. If Spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in Masters history with Woods . This was Vonn's second day in a row cheering on Woods . 'I'm still right there,' 14-time major winner Woods said of his position going into the weekend . 'I was at a pretty low one (point) in my career,' Woods said after mixing four birdies with a bogey to climb into a tie for 14th when he ended his round. 'To basically change an entire (swing) pattern like that and put it together, put it in a position where I can compete in a major championship like this is something I'm very proud of.' Woods, who plunged to 111th in the rankings as he struggled to return to form following back surgery last year and his fifth swing change, again struggled with the pace of Augusta National's heavily contoured greens. 'I had a hard time getting the ball close to the hole,' said Woods. 'You expect certain putts to roll out, but they're not rolling out.' Watched by huge galleries, Woods made a fast start, hitting a superb approach to seven feet at the par-four first and rolling in the birdie putt as shouts of 'Watch out, Tiger's back' and 'Come on Tiger, let's go' rang out. Spieth, 21, broke the 36 hole record on Friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament, 12 strokes ahead of Woods . His only bogey came at the par-three sixth, his tee shot ending up just off the back of the green from where he had 45 feet to the flag but hit a weak chip that advanced just 20 feet. Woods immediately rebounded in birdie-birdie style, draining a 25-footer at the tricky seventh and hitting his third shot at the par-five eighth to two feet. He birdied the 11th after conjuring a moment of magic from the pine straw to the right of the fairway, a soaring approach settling 12 feet from the cup. 'I'm still right there,' the 14-time major winner said of his position going into the weekend. 'I'm 12 back, but there's not a lot of guys ahead of me. And with 36 holes here to go, anything can happen.'","Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta Friday to watch boyfriend Tiger Woods play in the second round of the Masters .

"Another man was in the car with Walter Scott when he was pulled over for having a broken tail light on his Mercedes, it has been revealed. Police have not disclosed his identity and family do not know who he is, but a police report confirmed the man was detained with Scott and put in the back of a police car, according to CNN. The man, who is not a relative, could be able to shed light on what happened between Officer Michael Slager pulling the pair over - and the beginning of the bystander video which shows Scott being shot dead. The 33-year-old patrolman has been charged with murder after 50-year-old Walter Scott was gunned down last Saturday in North Charleston, South Carolina. It has also been revealed that the officer was allowed to stay with the force, despite being the subject of a complaint that alleged he used excessive force on an unarmed man. Police are now reviewing the earlier case in light of the shooting of Mr Scott. Patrolman Michael Slager calling colleagues on his radio after shooting dead the unarmed father-of-four Walter Scott . Officer Michael Slager, pictured left in his police mugshot, has been charged with the murder of 50-year-old Walter Scott, right . Eyewitness accounts said Scott was involved in a brief scuffle on the ground with the officer who pulled his car over for having a broken tail light. Mr Scott can be seen being shot five times in the back as he ran away from the armed officer in video footage that was captured on a mobile phone at the scene. The incident started at 9.53am when officer Slager radioed into his control saying that he was pulling over a grey coloured Mercedes. Minutes later he appears out of breath as he describes chasing a suspect on foot, who he says is black and wearing a green t-shirt. This is followed by a period of no contact from the patrolmen, despite colleagues en-route to assist asking for his location. Slager then makes a further frantic call to dispatchers at 9.38am after firing eight shots at Mr Scott. 'Shots fired. Subject is down. He grabbed my Taser,' After shooting Mr Scott, Slager can be heard telling his control: 'I need to secure my vehicle.' A second officer, named as Clarence Habersham, then uses his radio to report that the victim has gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. Slager, 33, who is white, initially defended his actions, saying he feared for his life after he alleged Mr Scott had wrestled his Taser from him during a scuffle. But four days later, anonymous cellphone footage emerged that contradicted his account of events. The video showed the officer firing eight shots at Mr Scott from around 20 feet away while he had his back turned and was fleeing. The officer draws his weapon as Mr Scott, 50, breaks free and starts to flee from the scene . The officer fires off eight shots hitting the fleeing father in the back five times . Mr Scott collapses to his knees after being struck after shots were fired . Slager then handcuff's Mr Scott's lifeless body before he allegedly appears to tamper with the scene . Slager, 33,  initially claimed that he feared for his life after Mr Scott wrestled his Taser from him in a scuffle . Sagler then cuffed Mr Scott's lifeless body and was seen dropping an object - possibly his service-issue Taser - by his side. In the video filmed by Feidin Santana there appears to be no evidence of Mr Scott getting hold of the officer's Taser or using it against him. 'I remember the police [officer] had control of the situation,' said Mr Santana. 'He had control of Scott. And Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser. But like I said, he never used the Taser against the cop.' Officer Slager was charged with murder on Tuesday and now could face the death penalty. Today Mario Givens revealed how he made a complaint about Slager in September 2013 and claimed the shooting of Mr Scott could have been prevented. He told how he was awoken before dawn in September 2013 by the patrolman, who was banging on the front door of his family home in North Charleston. Givens, who is also black, said he cracked open his door and asked the officer what he wanted. 'He said he wanted to come in, but didn't say why,' said Givens, now 33. 'He never said who he was looking for.' Officer Slager, 33, can be seen on video holding an object - possibly his Taser - after he shot dead Walter Scott . Officer Michael Slager was caught on video tape on Saturday picking up an object - possibly his Taser - from where the confrontation started with Walter Scott and appearing to move it over to the father-of-four's dead body . Then, without warning, Slager pushed in the door, he said. '`Come outside or I'll tase you,'' he recalled the officer saying as he burst in. 'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway.' He said the pain from the stun gun was so intense that he dropped to the floor and began calling for his mother, who was also in the home. At that point, he said another police officer came into the house and they dragged him outside and threw him to the ground. He was handcuffed and put in the back of a squad car. Though initially accused of resisting the officers, Givens was later released without charge. Angered by what happened, Givens went downtown to police headquarters the following day and filed a formal complaint. He and his mother say several neighbors who witnessed what happened on the family's front lawn also contacted the police, though they say officers refused to take their statements. Asked about the 2013 incident, North Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said the department now plans to review the case to see if its decision to exonerate Slager was correct. 'It could have been prevented,' Givens said of Scott's death. 'If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today.' Authorities refused to say on Wednesday whether other police officers will be charged in the cover-up of an unarmed black father's fatal shooting by a white cop. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey would not answer questions on the involvement of other members of the force in the killing of Walter Scott, 50. The 33-year-old patrolman, who is white, initially defended his actions, saying he feared for his life after Scott wrestled his Taser gun from him during a scuffle when he pulled him over for a broken brake light on Saturday morning. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey (pictured left) refused to say whether other officers were involved in the fatal shooting of unarmed black father, Walter Scott, on Saturday. Police chief Eddie Driggers avoided some questions but did say he had been sickened by video of his officer shooting the man dead . Four days later, anonymous cellphone footage emerged and blew Slager's story wide open. The video showed the officer firing eight shots at Scott, a father-of-four, from around 20 feet away while the man had his back turned and was fleeing. Sagler then cuffed Scott's lifeless body and was seen dropping an object - possibly his service-issue Taser - by his side. The cop was charged with murder on Tuesday and could face the death penalty. During a chaotic press conference on Wednesday, demonstrators grew angry after the mayor took over questions directed at Police Chief Eddie Driggers who stepped back from the podium. Mayor Summey refused to answer questions on other cops' involvement, citing an independent investigation underway by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Slager was fired one day after his murder charge but his wife, who is eight months' pregnant, will still receive insurance from the city until after her baby was born because it was the 'humane thing to do', the mayor said. This as the FBI and the Justice Department's civil rights prosecutors announced on Wednesday there would be a federal probe . Chief Driggers told the press conference that he was 'sickened' by the video and had watched it only once. No other officers had seen what happened at the shooting scene, according to Driggers. When asked why no one had performed CPR on Scott, Driggers then said he believed one cop had taken off Scott's shirt and tried to perform life-saving measures. Driggers said that he had spoken to Walter Scott Sr 'father to father' during a visit to the grieving family's home.","Mystery passenger was detained when he and Scott were pulled over for missing tail light .

"A woman who successfully set up her brother with one of her best friends ended up becoming so jealous of their relationship she tried to wreck their marriage. Husband and wife David and Sandra Greatrex, 53 and 52, from Plymouth, have told their shocking story of harassment, which culminated in David's sister Anne cancelling the couple's wedding using a fake email address just weeks before the big day.

I did not think someone was capable of doing that,' says Sandra of the horrifying moment Anne informed them she'd managed to cancel their nuptials behind their back. 'Everything was paid for so it was a lot of worry,' she added. Luckily, the couple managed to piece their  plans back together in time for their winter wedding though. and they subsequently took Anne to court for harassment. Sandra first met David after his 20-year marriage fell apart and her friend Anne, David's sister, suggested they meet. 'I met Anne for coffee and David came out and I've never let his side since,' she says. 'When I first met him I didn’t realise how important he would become. He’s my everything.' Before long the couple were inseparable. But although Anne's matchmaking had worked, she was not happy about their relationship and started sending Sandra threatening text messages telling her to stop seeing her brother. 'They were hurtful at the time but I couldn’t understand why. Maybe it was jealousy,' says Sandra. ‘My mum had lung cancer and was going through chemo at the time. Anne was sending messages saying, ""Your mum’s dying and you better get back to her"".' Ann Duffy, pretended to be her now sister-in-law and cancelled her brother's wedding . But the relationship continued and Sandra and David became even closer. Then one day Sandra proposed. 'I was joking around - but not,' says Sandra.

But in 2012, Sandra’s mother lost her battle with cancer and a year later David’s mother Celia also became ill and moved in with Sandra and David. But Sandra wouldn’t let Anne in their house, which reignited the rift. ‘I wouldn’t let her come to my house and see her mum because of all the hurtful thing she’s said to me. 'She could come to take her out but not in the house. 'She made a big deal about that and said that I was trying to replace my mum with her mum and that I was taking her away from her.' Then 20 days before the wedding, the couple received a distressing phone call.

I've cancelled your wedding.""' David and Sandra Greatrex at their wedding . Sandra says: 'I was in tears and angry. I wanted to go nuts at her. Everything was paid for so it was a lot of worry. We were up all night. 'I did not think someone was capable of doing that. 'How low can you get? This is your brother getting married. We had paid for everything and I thought she’d ruined it. 'In the morning we rang the registry office and they confirmed that our wedding had been cancelled. 'They said we should come in so they could print everything off for us to give to the police.' Anne had created an email address in Sandra's name to set about jeopardising the couple's plans.

Ann Duffy called Plymouth Register Office 20 days before her brother's wedding and canceled it . Anne was jailed for eight weeks at Plymouth Magistrates' Court.

She was jailed for eight weeks at Plymouth Magistrates' Court and was also given a restraining order against Sandra for an indefinite period. David said: 'It was quite upsetting. She got eight weeks but I believe she only did four.' And of Anne's injunction against coming near Sandra, David says: 'It's the best way – the less we see of her the better.' Sandra says: 'It's jealousy bitterness and anger. To this day if she could split us up she would. 'But we’ve been through so much, I don’t think there’s anything out there that could hurt us.'

"On the run: Clarence Taylor, 44, remains at large after police in Akron, Ohio ordered his arrest in connected to a bizarre 'faked kidnapping' last fall . A man is on the run after police charged him with faking his own kidnapping in a bizarre incident last fall. Police say Clarence Taylor, 44, faked his own kidnapping by duct taping his mouth and tying himself to a tree in Akron, Ohio. On November 1, Taylor's 45-year-old girlfriend called police, saying he had been missing for several days. While she was on the phone with investigators, the girlfriend received a call from another of Taylor's friends who said he had found him tied to a tree with zip ties in a wooded area near Stoner Creek and Pickford Ave. That unidentified man then led police to Taylor, who was strangely still bound to the tree. It's unclear why his friend did not cut him down initially. Police then released Taylor and took him to Akron General Medical Center. Taylor told police that a group of men tied him to the tree after stealing $2,500 from him. He says he was walking down Beechwood Drive when he saw the men with shotguns who abducted took him and took him away in their van. Taylor claimed to have been left tied to the tree for several days, despite not showing any signs of dehydration or injuries consistent with being out in the cold and rainy weather for an extended period of time. Police have since charged Taylor with a first-degree misdemeanor charge of falsification. A warrant was issued for his arrest last month but Taylor remains at large. Police have not revealed the reason for the warrant's four month delay or a motive behind the fake kidnapping. Calls to the Akron, Ohio Police and Summit County, Ohio Sheriff's Office were not immediately returned Monday morning.","A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Clarence Taylor, 44, who remains at large .

"When Scottish student Caitlin McNeill, 21, posted a photo of a blue and black dress that looked white and gold from some angles, it sparked an internet debate so furious even A-listers couldn't resist getting involved. Now another  internet dress furore has begun, this time over the colour of Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon's dress. The SNP stalwart, 44, wore the opinion-splitting ensemble, which has variously been described as blue, grey and green, for her appearance on the BBC contenders' debate last night. Scroll down for video . Was it grey, green or ice blue? Nicola Sturgeon's dress divided opinion on Twitter during last night's debate . Going for grey: A viewer takes to Twitter to insist the dress he saw was grey . Baffling: Another viewer says while he initially thought the dress was grey, he has concluded it was green . But while her policies - and the coalition invitation issued to Labour leader Ed Miliband - made headlines, on Twitter, it was all about the dress. While most plumped for grey, with some noting that she and Mr Miliband appeared intent on co-ordinating their look, others insisted that the colour was green. 'Wait, Nicola Sturgeon's dress in that debate was green?' wrote a viewer named Andy Dowling. 'Looked grey on my telly.' Another, using the name Suze, complained: 'Her dress was teal. Papers have changed the colour, giving a less flattering skin tone (making her look harsh)'. Sports journalist Patrick Kidd also chipped in, writing: 'Let's focus on the most important issue from the debate. Nicola Sturgeon's dress was clearly grey, not blue.' Grey: Many viewers watching the debate thought Miss Sturgeon's dress was grey . Different colour: In a photo taken as she left the studio, Miss Sturgeon's dress appeared to be blue . Going for green: Under the studio lights, Miss Sturgeon's get-up seemed to be green . Back to grey: In this photo of Miss Sturgeon with the Green's Natalie Bennett, it once again looks grey . Not everyone was interested in the change in colour, which is likely to have been the result of harsh studio lights producing a different hue to the one seen in natural daylight, however. One irate viewer tweeted that they were concerned that the frock frenzy might overshadow the SNP's manifesto launch today. Another, named Milly, said the focus on the dress missed the point. 'Are you telling me all people are worried about is Nicola Sturgeon's dress?' she wrote. 'It was a political debate dammit!' The furore over Miss Sturgeon's dress isn't the first time the SNP leader has made headlines for her sartorial nous. Not impressed: One viewer declared her concerns about the debate overshadowing the SNP manifesto . Be serious! Another said viewers debating the colour of the dress were missing the point of the evening . The original: This was the frock that sparked the original #thedress debate . Slick: Miss Sturgeon has been lauded for her dress sense and is seen here at the Scottish Leaders' Debate . Stylish: Miss Sturgeon claims to be uninterested in clothes but admits to a passion for Kurt Geiger shoes . Although the SNP leader claims to be uninterested in splashing out on expensive clothes and bags in the past, she has admitted to a weakness for shoes, albeit Kurt Geiger rather than Jimmy Choo. Those were in evidence at the main leader's debate two weeks ago, when she wore a pair of skyscraper courts by the label with a chic coral two-piece by Glaswegian label, Totty Rocks. Other fashion hits include the glamorous green floral dress and fitted jacket combination she wore to kickstart the SNP's election campaign and the pillar-box red dress worn to address supporters on the eve of last September's Scottish referendum.","Viewers took to Twitter to argue over the colour of Nicola Sturgeon's dress .

"A grieving son was forced to dig his mother's grave after a council 'co-ordination error' meant work had not been done to the burial plot. Clint Gee made the almost six hour journey from his home outside Brisbane to Wandoan in regional Queensland, only to find the local council failed to dig a spot where he could place his mother's ashes. Mr Gee planned to place his mother, Elizabeth Hobbs, who died last year, with his father, Alex Gee, who died in 1964. Mr Gee makes the journey to the site every year to remember his father, and this year he wanted to follow through on a promise he made to his mother to reunite the pair. Clint Gee had planned to reunite his mother, Elizabeth Hobbs, with his father, Alex Gee, who died in 1964 . 'It was shattering,' Mr Gee told Daily Mail Australia. 'Me, my wife, my son, my mum's sister and some other family all made the five and a half hour drive to the cemetery out in Wandoan. 'Then we get out there and there was no hole dug - nothing.' 'Luckily I had a small spade with me and I was able to dig.' 'It was shattering,' Mr Gee told Daily Mail Australia, after he had to dig the hole himself . 'We get out there and there was no hole dug - nothing,' Mr Gee said . Mr Gee said he had organised the day with the Western Downs Regional Council to ensure everything would run smoothly. He also paid a $342 fee, after being upset with the council reduced its usual rate of more than $400. 'The financial side of things bothered me a little from the start, but I bit the bullet and paid the money and filled out all the forms,' he said. Mr Gee, pictured with his grandson, Cody, said the council organisation process was 'a bloody bit stupid' 'It was all a bit bloody stupid, but I had to do it. 'I confirmed it all the day before to make sure it was all ready to go.' Despite the confirmation, the hole had not been dug ahead of time. 'I walked around the entire ground to check they hadn't dug it in the wrong spot,' Mr Gee said. Western Downs Regional Council Mayor Ray Brown apologised to Mr Gee, pictured with grandson, Seth . 'Eventually, I called them and said: 'it's 40 degrees out here, and there's no hole'. I told them I sorted it out and that I'd call them Monday.' Mayor Ray Brown apologised to the family, and provided Mr Gee with a refund. 'Western Downs Regional Council can confirm that after receiving an application from Mr Clint Gee for a second internment of ashes in an existing burial plot, an accidental internal coordination error meant that the planned preparation work at the burial plot were not carried out,' Mr Brown said. Mr Gee makes the five-hour journey to his father's grave-site every year to look after it . 'Council, and particularly the staff involved in arranging the works, again apologise and express sincere regret at having caused distress and upset to Mr Gee and his family.' Mr Gee said he was happy he received the refund, but said he was mainly thankful his had been able to follow through on the vow he made to his mother. 'I'm just at ease it all worked out,' he said. 'Long-term I want to replace the headstone to include my mum, so that's the next part of this process for me.'","Clint Gee travelled six hours to place his mother's ashes with his father .

"A seven-year-old girl was subjected to months of violent punishment by her 'strict' churchgoing aunt before a 'vicious and sustained' beating finally killed her, a court heard today. Shanay Walker's death was the culmination of 'repeated acts of cruelty' at the hands of Seventh-day Adventist Kay-Ann Morris that included having food shoved in her mouth and being struck on the hands with a hairbrush, a jury was told. The youngster, who had 50 separate bruises across her body at the time of her death, was found cold and rigid in her bed by paramedics called to the family home in Bestwood, Nottingham, last July. Shanay Walker, found cold and stiff in her bed in Nottingham last July. Her aunt is currently on trial for her murder. The prosecution claim Shanay was subject to repeated acts of cruelty at the hands of her aunt and grandmother, Juanila Smikle, until she was eventually killed by a 'vicious and sustained attack' last July . Morris told police officers Shanay, who she was the legal guardian for, had fallen down the stairs. But the 23-year-old, who was an aspiring police officer in her teens, was later arrested and charged with murder. Nottingham Crown Court heard how Shanay went to live with her aunt as a five-year-old in 2012 after her natural mother - Morris' sister-in-law - struggled to care for her. However, Richard Pratt QC said she soon became the victim of regular punishments by Morris, and her mother, Juanila Smikle - Shanay's grandmother. She was disciplined for tiny misdemeanours such as failing to eat quickly enough or 'fighting' while brushing her teeth. Jurors were told the schoolgirl faced a range of abuse including being placed in the bath and having water thrown over her, being forced to stand on a landing for 20 minutes, and having the palms of her outstretched hands 'whacked' with a hairbrush. Mr Pratt said that on one occasion, neighbours saw Morris refuse to let a desperate Shanay go to the toilet, and instead taunted her with the ditty: 'I know a song that will get on your nerves'. He added that witnesses questioned by police following Shanay's death described Morris as a 'very strict' parent who frequently made her niece cry by shouting at her. Others told how Shanay was 'hysterical' at times, had 'lost her sparkle' after moving in with 'stern looking' Morris, and went from being a 'bubbly' child when her aunt wasn't around to 'introverted and anxious' when she was nearby. Kay-Ann Morris, who is on trial at Nottingham Crown Court charged with the murder of her niece, seven-year-old Shanay Walker, last July . The court heard teachers at Shanay's primary school had noticed injuries to her which were recorded in Safeguarding Referral forms and then shown to a social worker. But Morris gave explanations for the marks, telling staff a burn mark on the youngster's thigh was because she had stood too close to a radiator. Mr Pratt said she also claimed Shanay 'hurt herself'. He described how in the hours before her death, Shanay was seen running from Smikle's home in Top Valley, Nottingham, barefoot and in her pyjamas. When asked by two schoolgirls playing nearby if she was alright, the youngster replied she wasn't because 'her nana and her auntie were being horrible to her'. She then sought refuge in a local convenience store, where she was collected by the pair - with Smikle allegedly saying 'I don't care if it hurts' when she grabbed her granddaughter by the arm. That was the last time Shanay was seen alive by anyone outside her family. Police were alerted to Shanay's death by Morris' twin sister Kerry-Ann Morris, a serving soldier in the Royal Artillery, who was stationed in Germany. Morris had called her sibling in the early hours of July 31 last year to say her niece had been badly hurt after she fell down a flight of stairs. However, the court heard that after the call was cut off, Kerry-Ann told military police in Germany, who then contacted officers in Nottingham. Mr Pratt said that when police went to the family home, a council flat, they were met by a 'distressed and erratic' Morris who told them: 'Baby not asleep. Baby is dead.' She claimed Shanay had fallen down the stairs and hurt her neck, but that she had been 'alright' and had gone to bed. However, Morris said she later checked on the youngster, and was unable to wake her. Mr Pratt said a 'highly emotional' Smikle arrived at the house a short time later, as did paramedics who noticed straight away that Shanay was cold and stiff. The prosecutor added they also spotted blood staining to her head and extensive bruising on her legs. He said: 'These injuries did not look to him (the paramedic) like they had been sustained during an accidental fall down the staircase. 'He reported his finding to the police officers, more senior officers attended and in due course Kay-Ann Morris was arrested on suspicion of the murder of Shanay Walker. 'Shanay's body revealed the presence of 50 single or groups of fresh blunt force injury. The vast majority of these were bruises which were distributed across the face, torso, arms and legs. 'The most confluent areas of bruising (bruising that runs together) were on the hands, feet, and the buttocks.' The jury heard a post-mortem examination revealed Shanay had suffered a subdural haemorrhage in her brain, which ultimately led to her death. Mr Pratt added: 'We say that Kay-Ann Morris was lying when she told the police officers at the scene that Shanay had accidentally fallen down the stairs. 'It was lie told to try to cover up the truth that she had subjected her niece, a child in her care, to a sustained, vicious and brutal beating. 'Shanay had not simply fallen down the stairs - she had been the victim of sustained violence which caused her death. 'In the days that followed the investigation into the death of Shanay Walker broadened and revealed sadly the infliction of violence and cruelty that night, although obviously more serious that night, was by no means an isolated incident. 'In short, the investigation revealed that during her short life, Shanay had been subjected to repeated acts of cruelty by Kay-Ann Morris and Juanila Smikle.' The court heard that in police interviews after her arrest, Morris made no comment. She denies murder and child cruelty against Shanay and one other child, who can't be named for legal reasons. Smikle denies child cruelty against Shanay and four other youngsters, none of whom can be named. The trial, which is expected to last six weeks, continues.

"The grey ‘stealth’ speed traps could be outlawed regardless of which party wins the general election . Hidden cameras credited with a 25 per cent spike in speeding fines could be banned from motorways within months. The grey ‘stealth’ speed traps could be outlawed regardless of which party wins the general election, it has been suggested. New figures revealed at least 112,000 motorists were given fines or appeared in court for motorway offences last year – a quarter more than in the previous year. The increase has been put down to the introduction of ‘smart motorways’ which use the cameras, known as Hadecs, to police speed limits which are varied according to the driving conditions. This means many drivers are being given the minimum £100 fines despite driving under the national motorway speed limit of 70mph. The Conservatives are already moving to scrap the controversial cameras if an ongoing review criticises their use when it reports back in the summer. And Labour has pledged to repaint them yellow so they are easier for drivers to spot. The grey cameras are becoming an increasing threat to drivers as the number of smart motorways is due to increase four fold over the next 10 years to stretch across 800 miles. But Labour has said if it wins the election, it will issue new guidelines stipulating all motorway speed cameras are yellow and any existing grey ones will be painted. A party source told The Sunday Telegraph there was a loophole which allowed the grey cameras on major roads but not smaller roads. Most of the drivers were caught last year were caught on parts of the M25, M1, M4 and M5. Roads minister John Hayes, who ordered the Highways England review which is due to report back this summer, has said he was concerned about ‘stealth cameras’ and it was important drivers knew where they were. The use of the less noticeable cameras has led to claims that police are using stealth to catch out drivers . And a Conservative source yesterday said: ‘We’ve announced a review into this and if that review shows serious problems, we will take action to stop grey cameras.’ Nearly 113,000 drivers were handed speeding penalties last year according to Freedom of Information statistics provided by 24 out of 45 police forces compared to close to 89,000 in 2013 and almost 55,000 in 2010. If caught by a speed camera, drivers face a minimum £100 fine and three points on their licence, or a court summons. Avon and Somerset police caught 23,086 motorists speeding in 2014 – a rise of 756 on the year before, and Nottinghamshire police fined 9,472 drivers - up from 3,808. And both forces have linked the rises to the use of the grey cameras. A Highways England spokesman said: ‘It has always been up to individual police forces whether to use cameras on the motorway network to enforce the national speed limit.’ As the use of smart motorways is extended from current levels of around 200 miles to 800 miles over the next ten years the number of fines is set to rise even more .","Number of motorists to appear in court has increased by a quarter .

"A Transportation Security Administration agent who was fired in Nashville after becoming obsessed with a coworker - following her, taking videos and photos and breaking into her house five times - was jailed this week as a result of the stalking case. Daniel Boykin, 33, plead guilty to charges of unlawful photography, aggravated burglary, wiretapping, unlawful telephone recording and two computer crimes. In apologizing for his actions in court Thursday, Boykin admitted to repeatedly filming the woman inside a bathroom at Nashville International Airport and was subsequently sentenced to six months prison. At the time of his arrest last year, Boykin was found with 92 videos of the victim — 29 taken from the airport bathroom — and 1,527 photographs. Investigators found additional images taken inside the woman's home of air vents and shelves in the bathroom, which they believe suggested he intended to plant hidden cameras at some point. Obsessed: Daniel Boykin, 33, a former TSA employee, appeared in court in Nashville on Thursday as he was sentenced to six months prison for stalking a colleague. More than 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim were discovered on Boykin’s phone and computer, and he broke into her home five times . Disturbed: Boykin was sentenced Thursday for unlawful photography, aggravated burglary, wiretapping, unlawful telephone recording and two computer crimes. He will be under strict probation for five years once he leaves prison, however will not be registered as a sex offender . He also took photos of her clothing and stole pictures from her electronic devices. The victim, who has not been named, came forward in May 2014. She told authorities that Boykin would watch her dog on the weekends. However when looking at some photos of the dog on his phone one day at work, the woman discovered a cache of photos of herself. 'I was sick to my stomach,' she told the court, according to WKRN. 'I am sure I was as white as these walls. 'So eventually I said I had a headache and had to go home.' Boykin also took to the stand  to say he was sorry. 'I have abused and broken a trust that I can never repair, and for that I am truly sorry,' he told the court. The detective in the case, Andrew Vallee, said he as truly shocked during the investigation. Arrest: Police began investigating Boykin on May 30, 2014, after the U.S. Attorney's Office forwarded a complaint filed by the victim. She came forward after observing videos of herself on Boykin's phone. He was arrest after a search warrant was served at his Nashville apartment . 'This was one of the worst cases I have seen in terms of invading somebody's privacy in their most intimate moments and the most secure place, her home,' the detective told The Tennessean. 'My biggest disappointment in terms of justice was that under current law, (Boykin) doesn't have to register as a sex offender. 'Because my main motivation for justice is reducing the possibility that he will ever do this again to anyone else.' On top of the six months in prison, the sentence includes more than five years of probation with strict supervision and GPS monitoring. The judge also emphasized that Boykin should continue seeking mental health treatment.","Daniel Boykin plead guilty to charges of unlawful photography, aggravated burglary, wiretapping and unlawful telephone recording .
