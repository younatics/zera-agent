"They already have a fearsome reputation as the top predator of their time, but it seems the Tyrannosaurs were also prone to eating each other. A new study has uncovered evidence that a relative of Tyrannosaurus rex, called Daspletosaurus, may have indulged in cannibalism. Paleontologists have found bite marks on the fossilised skull of a juvenile Daspletosaurus, which lived around 75 million years ago. This artist's reconstruction shows a Daspletosaurus feeding on the body of another in an act of cannibalism . While some of the injuries appear to have been sustained during combat with other tyrannosaurs, others appear to have occurred after death. The scientists believe that another Daspletosaurus, which could grow to nine metres (30ft) as adults and weigh up to four tons, fed on the youngster's body. Tyrannosaurus rex and its relatives were more intelligent than previously thought and hunted in gangs which included young and older members, researchers have claimed. Scientists believe they have evidence that the top predatory dinosaurs were highly intelligent pack animals, despite T-rex being popularly depicted as a dangerous but dim-witted loner. This is a myth that has grown up because for many years their fossil skeletons tended to be found on their own, researchers say. The new theory follows an analysis of skeletons of the tyrannosaur Tarbosaurus bataar from 90 sites in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia. Tarbosaurus, a cousin of T-rex that lived around 70 million years ago, was a two-legged predator up to 12 metres long and weighing five tonnes. At least half a dozen of the animals appear to have belonged to a single social group, including adults and juveniles, that died together. The findings help to shed light on the brutal world in which the dinosaurs inhabited. Dr David Hone, a paleontologist at Queen Mary University of London, who led the research said: 'This animal clearly had a tough life, suffering numerous injuries across the head including some that must have been quite nasty. 'The most likely candidate to have done this is another member of the same species, suggesting some serious fights between these animals during their lives.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal PeerJ, were examining the skull of a Daspletosaurus found in a quarry in the Dinosaur Provincial Park close to Calgary, Alberta in Canada in 1994. Daspletosaurus, which means 'frightful lizard', is thought to be a close relative of the more famous Tyrannosaurus rex and roamed north America between 77 million and 74 million years ago. With a massive, heavy skull that could be more than 3ft (1 metre) in length, it would have had a powerful bite and probably preyed on large armoured ceratopsid dinosaurs. The dinosaur latest study was thought to be a juvenile, measuring just under 19.7 feet (6 metres) and weighed around half a tonne. The researchers found numerous injuries on the skull, several of which appeared to match the teeth of tyrannosaurs. The skull of the juvenile Daspletosaurus (above) was covered in bite marks made by Tyrannosaur teeth . David Hone (left) and Darren Tanke (right) studied the fossilised skull at the Royal Tyrrell Museum . One bite to the back of the head broke off part of the skull and left a circular tooth-shaped puncture through the bone. However, there are signs the bone had begun healing, suggesting the injury was not fatal and that the animal lived for some time after it was inflicted. While the researchers cannot say what killed the Daspletosaurus, damage on the jaw bones suggest that a large tyrannosaur bit into the dead creature between one and three times in what appears to be feeding behaviour. Daspletosaurus is thought to have not just hunted but also scavenged for food and the research team say the injuries appear to have occurred after it had begun to decay. Cannibalism is relatively common in the natural world, with more than 1,000 species known to eat their own species. The fossilised skull of Daspletosaurus was found in a quarry in Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada . Daspletosaurus, shown in the artists reconstruction above,  led a violent life the study suggests . Tyrannosaurus rex is also thought to have indulged in cannibalism, according to a study in 2010. Writing in the journal, Dr Hone and his colleague Darren Tanke from the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta, said the Daspletosaurus appeared to have lived a violent life involving battles with other members of its own species. They said: 'Numerous wounds were inflicted during life and despite some considerable damage the animal clearly survived as shown by the evidence of healing. 'These were likely inflicted at least in part by one or more conspecifics and perhaps as a result of numerous separate instances of conflict. 'After death, the animal suffered at least one major bite to the right dentary, and perhaps two more from another tyrannosaurid, possibly another Daspletosaurus. 'The specimen must have been decaying prior to the delivery of the bite to the dentary, and the condition of other material suggests scavenging, rather than simply late-stage carcass consumption.'","Fossilised skull of Daspletosaurus - a close relative of Tyrannosaurus rex - found to be covered in bite marks that suggest it was eaten after it had died .

"A man stuck by a serious bowel infection has been cured after undergoing a faecal transplant, with stools donated by his daughter. Len Barnes shed three stone as he battled the life-threatening condition Clostridium difficile, suffering bouts of diarrhoea. He lost his appetite and endured continuous pain. Despite numerous courses of antibiotics during long spells in hospital, the 75-year-old was showing no signs of improvement. It was then that specialists suggested a faecal transplant. Len Barnes, 57, from Stockton, has been cured of the severe bowel infection Clostridium difficile after undergoing a faecal transplant. His daughter Debbie, left, acted as donor . 'I'd never heard of it before,' said Mr Barnes. 'I thought, ""come on, you're taking the mickey"". 'But my doctor explained that mixing healthy poo with my poo - and transferring it back into my bowel mixed with warm water - would give someone's healthy bacteria the chance to fight with my bad bacteria. And when gastroenterologist Chris Wells raised the issue of finding a suitable donor, Mr Barnes' daughter Debbie stepped in. The 52-year-old's stools were tested to ensure they were suitable and free from harmful bacteria. Mr Barnes, from Stockton, was then admitted to the University Hospital of North Tees. The procedure aims to re-balance the bacteria in the gut, by introducing bacteria from the faeces of healthy people. Once Ms Barnes' stools were approved, they were mixed with water and filtered. The solution was then transplanted into Mr Barnes' gut via an endoscope - a long, thin, flexible tube that has a light source and a video camera at one end. 'I had a bit of sedation but watched it all happening on the screen in the endoscopy unit,' he said. Gastroenterologist Dr Chris Wells performed the procedure at the University Hospital of North Tees . 'I was interesting. I knew it had worked straight away. 'The next day Dr Wells said I could go home and everything was back to normal.' Dr Wells, said: 'Faecal transplantation doesn't sound very appealing but it's a very effective remedy in patients like Len. 'Transplanting faeces from one person to another does seem a bit unusual but actually it's using healthy gut bacteria to fight off infection. 'Our bowels are packed full of billions of bacteria and these play an important role in maintaining health.' Dr Wells said there had been a significant reduction in the number of C-diff cases in the trust over the past few years but it was reassuring to know that faecal transplant was now an option to treat the condition. In March last year the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published new guidelines, naming faecal transplants as a recognised form of treatment for C-diff infections. Experts deemed the procedure is 'safe enough to be used in the NHS'. An analysis of seven studies, involving 558 patients, revealed nearly all patients were cured. In one study, the infection came back in around one in 20 patients within five weeks, compared with more than half of the patients given antibiotics. In another study, the infection came back in around one in 50 patients between 29 days and four years after faecal transplant. Nice concluded it didn't make much difference if the transplant was from a relative or stranger, or if the transplant had been frozen or not.","Len Barnes, 75, lost three stone while battling clostridium difficile .

"John Travolta has broken his silence on the controversial Scientology exposé Going Clear and says he never intends to watch the documentary. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times while promoting his upcoming film The Forger, Travolta said his decades of personal experience in the organization have been nothing but positive--nothing like the blackmailing, physically abusive cult portrayed in the film. 'I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?' he said. Travolta then spoke for the only celebrity whose dealings with Scientology get more screen time in Going Clear than his own, Tom Cruise. Scroll down for video . Spoke out: John Travolta on Monday broke his silence on the Scientology-slamming HBO documentary Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief . 'It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom, I imagine,' he said. 'I've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years...that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative.' Those 40 years Travolta has spent as a Scientologist are addressed head-on in the film, which claims that church elders have blackmailed the 61-year-old into being one of their most visible cheerleaders. But Travolta, despite his refusal to sit through the film, said it's merely a showcase for ex-members 'who were disgruntled with their experiences' with Scientology. 'I've been brought through storms that were insurmountable, and (Scientology has) been so beautiful for me, that I can't even imagine attacking it, . 'Why would I even approach a negative perspective? That would be a crime to me, personally, to do that,' he said. Scientologists hold a 'blackmail file' on John Travolta to stop him leaving the faith, which includes 'damaging material' from his sessions with auditors at the church, the doc claims. Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor - once a member of the Church and the point of contact with John Travolta - described a prison camp where members would be forced to work 30-hour shifts, with around three hours of breaks . The film features a number of allegations about how members are threatened and tortured in prison-style camps and cut off from their family if they decide to leave Scientology. Others belonging to the most senior order of the faith have been forced to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in a fight to secure a chair to stay in the church, it was claimed. The claims have been disputed by the Church of Scientology who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as 'admitted' liars and perjurers and 'professional anti-Scientologists.' Directed by Alex Gibney, Going Clear aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including Travolta and Tom. Perhaps the only celebrity discussed more in the film Going Clear is Tom Cruise, whose marriage to Nicole Kidman the doc claims was picked apart by Scientology elders . It included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive claims about punishments endured by members and how followers have been manipulated. These included descriptions of a 'prison camp', revealed by former member Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor. People put into this camp are forced to do around 30 hours of hard labour, broken up by three hour rest breaks. Spanky was once the point of contact between the Church and Travolta and said she was sent to this 'prison camp', known as the Rehabilitation Project Force which, she claims, is where members are 'reindoctrinated.' The documentary also claimed Scientology chiefs hold a 'black PR package' on Travolta, with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions. During these sessions a trained auditor asked pointed questions such as 'What are you willing for me to talk to others about?' Travolta is said to have requested that his sessions were not filmed, but secret cameras were allegedly installed anyway. As well as the claims about Travolta, former senior members of the faith told documentary makers about the various forms of punishment meted out by leaders. Another form of punishment involved members of the highest ranking order within the Scientology church, Sea Org, whose members are said to be punished by being thrown in 'The Hole'. As well as beatings in 'The Hole', they are allegedly also subjected to demeaning tasks including mopping up the floor with their tongue to force them to confess their crimes against the Church. Others are apparently ordered to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody - fighting each other for chairs which allow them to remain in the church, with losers being expelled. Being expelled from the Church of Scientology comes at a high price, because all friends and family that are still with the religion are forced to cut any ties with departing members. Scientology is believed to be one of the reasons behind the breakdown of Tom Cruise's marriage to Katie Holmes because he was understood to have wanted to send their daughter Suri to Sea Org, according to reports at the time. In an interview with the New Yorker in 2012, Scientology spokesmen denied the claims. The Church of Scientology, which is believed to have around 50,000 members, denied the allegations featured in Going Clear and said the statements included were 'entirely false.' Senior members of Scientology, that are part of the higher Sea Org order, apparently are forced to play musical chairs to Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen to vie for a place in the church, as a form of punishment . Alex Gibney (left) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members and Paul Haggis (right) In a statement it said: 'The Church has documented evidence that those featured in Gibney's film regurgitating their stale, discredited allegations are admitted perjurers, admitted liars and professional anti-Scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims. All have been gone so long from the Church they know nothing of it today. 'Yet Gibney and HBO stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the Church to offer relevant information about them, with more than 25 individuals with first-hand information eager to speak. To this day, neither HBO nor Gibney can deny that they have yet to present the Church with a single allegation from the film so the Church may have an opportunity to respond. The Church never sought special treatment, only fair treatment.' Since Going Clear premiered at the Sundance Festival in January, the church has created a website dedicated to criticising the film and released its own version, called 'Get the truth.' Representatives also branded the documentary a 'bigoted propaganda piece.' Other famous members have also criticised the show. Danny Masterton, a second generation Scientologist and former star of 'That 70s show', said he thought the book the documentary was based on was full of lies. He told eonline: 'I wonder if Sundance would allow a documentary of, like, eight people who hate Judaism. But you know, my religion's fair game, I guess, ""cause it's new"".' At the end of the documentary Gibney lists the people who refused to be interviewed, which included Miscavige, Travolta, Cruise and Kidman. MailOnline has contacted John Travolta for comment.","Travolta spoke out about the Scientology-bashing HBO documentary on Monday as he promoted his upcoming film The Forger .

"Two Pennsylvania bank robbers are believed to have had military training and are being described by the FBI as 'armed and extremely dangerous'. A pair of masked men armed with handguns have robbed three banks in the Pittsburgh area so far this year, most recently on April 10. The unknown men, who are seen on surveillance footage pointing their guns at bank employees' heads, have threatened to kidnapping those at their targets and shoot police. However, the way that the two men handle their weapons has led the FBI to suspect that the thieves are actually former police officers themselves. Scroll down for video . Police believe that the two bank robbers suspected in a string of recent heists may have police or military training because of the way they handle a weapon . Authorities say that the robberies, most recently on April 10 (pictured), have become increasingly violent, with the thieves threatening kidnappings and saying they will shoot police if engaged . Surveillance video shows one masked robber holding his finger stretched along the barrel of his gun, just off of the trigger, a safety method used by law enforcement. The men, who wear dark sweatpants and sweatshirts, are also seen jumping over the counter as they begin their heists. 'These folks have some kind of training in firearms, meaning they could be former military, they could be law enforcement, either former or currents,' the FBI's Patrick Fallon said. 'Street punks don’t usually use holsters,' he told WPXI. The men, both 5'8''-5'9'' are described as in excellent physical condition. One of them climbs behind the counter to collect cash as the other threatens bank employees with a gun . The clothes worn during the robberies are thought to be quickly discarded by the robbers, who have also used a very common car as a getaway vehicle . Authorities warned that the criminals have become increasingly aggressive and violent during robberies on January 24, February 21 and April 10. The suspects are described as white, 5'8'' to 5'9'',  of medium and larger build and in excellent physical shape, according to CBS Pittsburgh. They were recently seen escaping in a nondescript gray Toyota Corolla, one of the most common cars in the world. Both men are believed to be from Pittsburgh because of their accents. Tt is thought that they quickly get rid of their baggy clothing after making a getaway. The FBI is offering $10,000 for information leading to their arrests.","Masked men have robbed three Pittsburgh area banks at gunpoint .

"Twitter suspended more than 10,000 accounts linked to Islamic State militants and their supporters in a single 24-hour period in a fresh crackdown on those 'tweeting violent threats'. Jihad-watchers noticed thousands of accounts vanishing from the social network last week, most of them claiming to be linked to the extremists currently terrorising vast swathes of the Middle East. Now, after questions were asked about what led to  the largest ever one-off cull of ISIS-affiliated accounts, Twitter has confirmed that its purge was prompted because they were being used by tech-savvy jihadis to issue threats of violence. Online savvy: Jihad-watchers noticed thousands of accounts vanishing from the social network last week, most of them claiming to be linked to the extremists currently terrorising vast swathes of the Middle East . Twitter does not publish data related to the accounts it suspends, but NDTV Gadgets reported that the social network's so-called 'violations department' suspended approximately 10,000 accounts used by ISIS militants or supporters of the terror group on April 2. Speaking on condition of anonymity amid fears for his safety, the representative said the cull was prompted in part by the 'large number of reports' received by online activists and members of the public. Without doubt this is a reference to the 'Operation Anti-ISIS' campaign launched by the online 'hacktavist' collective Anonymous, who encouraged members to find and expose thousands of accounts connected with ISIS and report them to Twitter authorities en masse. While the social network says it remains committed to the platform being used as a symbol of free speech, it says it will not tolerate accounts tweeting sickening messages promoting violence. ISIS - the largest and wealthiest terrorist organisation in history - has long used social media to groom and enlist new recruits, spread sickening propaganda, and glorify rape and massacre. Sick: Twitter's so-called 'violations department' suspended approximately 10,000 accounts used by the ISIS militants themselves (pictured) or by supporters of the terror group, on April 2 . Last month it was revealed that web-savvy militants fighting for ISIS could control as many as 90,000 Twitter accounts worldwide, allowing them to spread their sickening propaganda with ease. The terror group is able to 'exert an outsized impact on how the world perceives it' because of its shrewd use of social media and sheer number of online followers, terror experts have concluded. Recommendations in the report by the Washington-based Brookings Institute report include governments and social media companies working together to find new ways to tackle the problem of pro-ISIS accounts spreading horrific murder videos and images and jihadist rhetoric. While Twitter has had success in suspending the accounts, they are effectively playing an exasperating game of whack-a-mole as banned users almost-immediately set up another account. They then encourage ISIS sympathisers who have not yet been banned to share the details of their new profile and within a matter of hours can have thousands of people once again reading their messages of hate.","Thousands of accounts vanished from the social network last week .

"On May 23, 2010, bride-to-be Rachelle Friedman was pushed into a pool. Breaking her neck, she was instantly paralyzed from the neck down. As paramedics rushed around her, friends wept, and her fiancé frantically phoned from three hours away, Rachelle had one question: Could she still have kids? 'It was the first thing I thought of,' Rachelle told DailyMail.com. 'I had no idea what was going to happen to me, or what was going on. But ever since I fell in love with Chris I wanted to have babies with him. When I fell in the pool and they were saying things like ""paralyzed"", I didn't know if I'd be able to carry a child.' Fast-forward half a decade, that question has been answered. Rachelle and Chris Chapman will welcome their baby girl into the world on April 18, thanks to an old friend who asked them to let her be their surrogate. Scroll down for video . Moving: Rachelle Friedman Chapman and her husband Chris (together in the background) are days from becoming parents as their surrogate and college friend Laurel Humes (foreground) reaches her due date . Excited: Rachelle can physically carry children but her blood pressure is too low. So Laurel, whose husband and son are pictured (left), offered to carry the child for them . The baby will be born near Laurel's home in Asheville, North Carolina, four hours from the Chapmans . Rachelle hadn't seen Laurel for nine years but Laurel, touched by her story, reached out on Facebook . Chris and Rachelle confessed they are nervous but excited to welcome the girl, whose name they won't reveal . 'We are both so excited,' Rachelle said. 'Everything has gone so fast. The baby could come any minute now so we've got a bag ready, and the nursery is almost all done. It's amazing.' Though quadriplegic, Rachelle, 29, is able to conceive and carry a child. Her condition means all four of her limbs are impaired, not strictly paralyzed. However, the accident left her with uniquely low blood pressure. Unable to stop taking the medication, which could be damaging to a fetus, she and Chris, 32, started exploring other options. She wrote a blog post on her website about contemplating surrogacy - and a friend from college, Laurel Humes, got in touch. 'I couldn't believe it. I met Laurel at college through Chris but she was a bit older than me and graduated that year. So I hadn't spoken to her in about nine years. 'After I wrote that post, she sent me a Facebook message saying she had been following our story and would love to be our surrogate. Then it all just went so fast. And Laurel has just been so so great.' Rachelle and Chris flew from their home in Raleigh, North Carolina, to Surrogacy Together in California to be assessed and start the process. Half a decade's difference: Rachelle and Chris pictured (left) before she fell into a pool on during her bachelorette party. Now, Rachelle and Laurel (right) have reached a situation neither anticipated . They have built a crib which Rachelle can wheel under, and turned Chris's man cave into a nursery . This is the ultrasound picture of the baby. Chris, Rachelle and Laurel all went to the ultrasound together . Despite the narrow odds, they conceived after the first try. Since then, Laurel has been carrying the child at her home on a farm in Asheville, North Carolina - a four-hour drive from the Chapmans. They admit it's not ideal. 'Unfortunately we haven't had that much time with Laurel and the baby,' Rachelle explains. 'Obviously, as a woman, you want to carry your child. You start to develop those motherly instincts, and the father develops fatherly feelings. 'For both of us it will be a different experience. We haven't had that time with the baby, then one day we're going to come home with a baby. 'It becomes more real when we are around her, when we go to visit. We were at the ultrasounds and she came to the baby shower.' Chris said he never contemplated that their wedding wouldn't go ahead after Rachelle fell . The pair have been dedicated to publicizing their situation to increase awareness about quadriplegia . But everything is in order. They have built a wheelchair-friendly crib that lets Rachelle wheel herself under it. Aside from some pictures on the wall, the nursery - formerly Chris's 'man cave' - is looking baby-ready. The name, though still secret, is set ('I let Chris pick!'). They even traveled over to Laurel's farm on Easter Sunday to take a glowing set of maternity pictures. As Chris remarks, however, 'no matter how much you prepare, you have no idea how to handle it. 'After Rachelle's accident, it took time for us to learn how to deal with it, and we dealt with it differently. 'With this, we are on a level playing field: neither of us know what's coming. And that's the fun of it.' Laurel's due date is April 18, the day after Chris, a teacher, finishes school. However, her own son was born two weeks early, so they're prepared for a rush to make the four-hour drive to the hospital, where they will have their own room. 'When I was getting married I obviously had no idea it was going to happen this way,' Rachelle said. 'But I think we're ready. And we're so excited.'","Rachel Chapman, nee Friedman, was left paralyzed after being playfully pushed into a pool on her bachelorette party on May 23, 2010 .

"A report on the threat posed by Australian foreign fighters has cited the Abbott government's 'troubled relations' with the Muslim community as undermining efforts at countering violent extremism. The Lowy Institute report, released on Thursday, says the large number of Australians fighting in Syria and Iraq represents a 'serious national security threat' but that the risk of an attack on home soil could be mitigated by the right policy response. The new report comes just a day after the news of the death of Melbourne model-turned-jihadist Sharky Jama. The Australian was reportedly killed in Syria while fighting with terrorist organisation Islamic State. Scroll down for video . A report on the threat posed by Australian foreign fighters has blamed the Abbott government's troubled relations with the Muslim community for worsening the situation . Melbourne'sSharky Jama was reportedly shot dead in Syria after joining Islamic State last year . Mohamed Elomar (above) is a boxer-turned-terrorist who fled Sydney to join the Islamic State in Syria . The Department of Foreign Affairs was unable to confirm Sharky's death as its capacity to do so was 'extremely limited'. A spokesman for the department told Daily Mail Australia consular assistance was no longer available within Syria 'due to the extremely dangerous security situation'. He further added Australians who were involved in overseas conflicts were 'putting their own lives in mortal danger'. 'Any Australians fighting with non-state militia in Syria or Iraq should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone,' the spokesman said. 'Australians are strongly advised not to travel to Syria or Iraq; any Australians in either country should leave immediately.' Khaled Sharrouf's fled to Syria from western Sydney. His 14-year-old daughter married Mohamed Elomar . Sharrouf posted a photo last year of his son holding up a severed head, causing international uproar . The new report outlines how returned fighters pose a serious threat to Australians. 'Returned foreign fighters have been involved in many of the most serious jihadist plots in the West, including in Australia,' the report says. 'Returnees from Syria have already engaged in terrorist plots in Europe, and the large number of Australians involved with groups such as IS (Islamic State) and Jabhat al-Nusra raises well-founded fears of an increased threat at home.' While much of the responsibility in dealing with the threat will lie with the police and intelligence services, the report says, it adds that programs aimed at countering violent extremism (CVE) need to be a core element of the response. The report says 'questions remain' as to how any new CVE approach will be implemented by the government, and that 'troubled relations with Australia's Muslim communities mean that its efforts to counter violent extremism are not off to the strongest of starts'. Propaganda prop: Abdullah Elmir, 17, from western Sydney, featured in a high-definition Islamic State broadcast earlier this year . Australian Mahmoud Adullatif, who is known as the 'Playboy Jihadi', died recently while fighting for IS . Melbourne woman Zehra Duman (pictured above) was married to Abdullatif and has threatened Australia . A successful CVE approach should draw on the talent that already exists within relevant communities, the report said, but that 'community co-operation has been undermined' by a lack of information about changes to the government's approach, including funding of grant schemes. 'Moreover, the poor consultation by the government with the Muslim community on much of Australia's new counter-terrorism legislation as well as the Prime Minister's (Tony Abbott) claim that Muslim leaders are not doing enough to speak out against radical ideas have undermined the prospects for effective co-operation.' The report said the Abbott government's introduction of number of CVE programs, such as $13.4 million Living Safe Together initiative, had been welcomed but that there were also valuable lessons to be learned from European countries, which had more experience in addressing the current foreign fighter threat. The wife of Australian terrorist Suhan Rahman (above) also urged people to look up U.S. president Barack Obama's White House schedule and 'take down that treacherous tyrant'","Report into threat posed by foreign fighters blamed Australian government .

Jeffrey Walker told jurors that the Philadelphia Police Department drug squad targeted 'white college-boy, ... khaki-pants types' who were 'easy to intimidate'. That matches the description of some of the drug dealers who have testified in recent weeks in the federal police corruption trial. The witnesses have said the squad stole as much as $80,000 at a time during illegal raids marked by threats and physical violence. Walker, 46, said police brass applauded the drug squad because they made big arrests that made them look good. Squad leader Thomas Liciardello, the lead defendant, 'produced big jobs, a lot of arrests,' he said. 'They liked that, as far as the bosses and supervisors were concerned. It made them look good. It was nothing but a dog and pony show. That's all it is,' Walker said. Liciardello, he said, always got a cut of the money stolen or skimmed from drug suspects, while the others split the 'jobs' they worked, Walker said. He said he first stole money as a uniformed patrolman when he chased a dealer into a house and spotted a large bag of cash on top of the refrigerator. 'I never saw that much money. I was a young kid,' Walker told jurors. 'I took some money, put it in my jacket pocket.' Defense lawyers have attacked Walker's credibility and will no doubt point out on cross-examination the times he admits acting alone, even before he joined the elite undercover drug unit. He also said he developed a drinking problem and became forgetful. Walker joined the department at about 20 and had nearly 24 years in when he was arrested in an FBI sting last year. Before then, he had refused to cooperate when the FBI asked him to speak to them about the unit. But he changed course after being caught in the sting, accused of stealing $15,000 and planting drugs in someone's car. He has been in custody for nearly a year and hopes to avoid a life sentence through his testimony. Walker said he once worked out of the same undercover squad car with Liciardello and Brian Reynolds but was turned out by those work friends as he went through a divorce, weight loss surgery and other personal problems. More than 160 drug convictions have been overturned since Walker pleaded guilty, and scores of civil-rights lawsuits are pending against Walker and the defendants.

"An ancient Buddhist meditation practice could be as effective as modern drugs at beating depression, new research suggests. A study published in The Lancetfound mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) led to similar outcomes as antidepressants when treating the mental disorder. Mindfulness - which teaches people to focus on the present moment – is a growing movement based on ancient Eastern traditions of meditation. Scroll down for video . Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which teaches people to focus on the present moment, has similar recurrence rates as anti-depressants, a study found . Researchers found patients on a MBCT course suffered almost the same rates of recurrence as those taking anti-depressants. Over two years, relapse rates were 44 per cent in the MBCT group compared to 47 per cent in the medication group. This suggests it offers an 'alternative treatment' for those averse to the idea of taking drugs, said the researchers. A course of MBCT treatment typically lasts for eight weeks and mainly relies on meditation but also includes cognitive behaviour therapy and yoga. It's designed to help the patient develop a healthier, more accepting relationship with their thoughts and feelings. Professor Richard Byng, of the Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, said: 'Currently, maintenance antidepressant medication is the key treatment for preventing relapse, reducing the likelihood of relapse or recurrence by up to two-thirds when taken correctly. 'However, there are many people who - for a number of different reasons - are unable to keep on a course of medication for depression. 'Moreover, many people do not wish to remain on medication for indefinite periods, or cannot tolerate its side effects.' The first study of its kind discovered MBCT isn't more effective than antidepressants but could offer similar protection - with no significant difference in cost. Inspired by ancient Buddhist meditation, mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by US doctors to combat stress. The guiding principle is to live more 'in the moment', spending less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems. Techniques include moving the focus of attention around the body and observing sensations that arise – the so-called 'body scan'. A secular practice, it is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures. Professor Willem Kuyken, of Oxford University, said: 'Depression is a recurrent disorder. 'Without ongoing treatment as many as four out of five people with depression relapse at some point.' MBCT was developed to help people who have experienced repeated bouts of depression by teaching them the skills to recognise and respond constructively to the thoughts and feelings associated with relapse - thereby preventing a downward spiral. In the study, 424 adults with recurrent major depression were split into two group at random - half remaining on antidepressants and the others coming off and receiving MBCT. The latter group attended eight group sessions lasting two-and-a-quarter hours and were given daily home practice. Afterwards they had the option of attending four follow up sessions over a 12 month period. The MBCT course consists of guided mindfulness practices, group discussion and other cognitive behavioural exercises. Those in the maintenance antidepressant group continued their medication for two years. All trial participants were assessed at regular intervals over two years for a major depressive episode using a psychiatric diagnostic interview tool. Although five adverse events were reported - including two deaths - across both groups they were not judged to be attributable to the interventions or the trial. Professor Sarah Byford, of King's College London, said: 'As a group intervention mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was relatively low cost compared to therapies provided on an individual basis. As many as four out of five people with depression relapse at some point, experts said. An MBCT course could be offered as an alternative to drugs . 'In terms of the cost of all health and social care services used by participants during the study - we found no significant difference between the two treatments.' Professor Kuyken added that although the MBCT doid not work any better than anti-depressants, the results suggest a 'new choice' for the millions of people with recurrent depression on repeat prescriptions. Study participant Nigel Reed, of Sidmouth in Devon, said: 'Mindfulness gives me a set of skills which I use to keep well in the long term. 'Rather than relying on the continuing use of antidepressants mindfulness puts me in charge, allowing me to take control of my own future, to spot when I am at risk and to make the changes I need to stay well.' Professor Roger Mulder, of Otago University in New Zealand who reviewed the study for then journal, said: 'Because it's a group treatment that reduces costs and the number of trained staff needed it might be feasible to offer MBCT as a choice to patients in general practice. 'We therefore have a promising new treatment that is reasonably cost effective and applicable to the large group of patients with recurrent depression.'","Patients using mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) had the same recurrence rates as people taking anti-depressants .

"A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen and later died Thursday as part of what began with a suspect kidnapping his own wife at gunpoint in Washington. Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates. However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city. Scroll down for video . Critical: A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Shooter: Heavily armed tactical teams swarmed to the campus amid reports the shooter had barricaded himself inside . 'This started and ended in D.C.,' an FBI source told WUSA. The shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once, according to reports. The campus, built in 2006 and employing thousands, was locked down until about 9pm as authorities unsure where the shooter had gone quickly swarmed. According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car. He went to investigate and it cost him his life. Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled . Reports: Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects . The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported. But the gunman trail of violence continued back into DC. Witnesses say some 40 cruisers finally boxed the shooter's green Honda in at 11th and H Streets in Northeast D.C. The barricade caused a collision between the suspect's car and a police cruiser, NBC reports. The suspect was shot several times. Two police officers were also wounded in the showdown, but reportedly had non-life threatening injuries.","A guard was shot and critically injured outside the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters in Suitland, Maryland on Thursday night .

He made off with the dairy's till and about $1500 in cash on Saturday, Stuff.co.nz reports. A man in a 'distinctive' cartoon mask demanded cash from owner's daughter on Saturday . Police were reportedly called to the Union St dairy, in east Christchurch at about 12.30pm, after receiving reports of a masked man demanding cash from the dairy owner's daughter. Christina Chen told reporters her 30-year-old daughter ran out of the shop screaming 'robber!'. The masked man threw the cash register to the ground and took off with the till drawer and up to $1,500. 'Normally they just rob cigarettes and some more things, it's not a big issue,' Chen told Stuff.co.nz. 'But this time they were scary because they wore a mask, and we don't know who it is.' Police say there were no signs of any weapons used but that the robber remained at large. They are asking anyone with information that may help to identify this person to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or to message police online.","Police were called to a dairy in east Christchurch after reports of a robbery .

"Four out of ten British Muslims partly blame MI5 and the police for radicalising British teenagers who then flee the country to join ISIS. A survey of 1,001 British Muslims found that one in four of this cohort had some sympathy with those who decide to join terror organisations such as ISIS. The figures show that among young and female Muslims, one third have sympathy for the Jihadi runaways despite the deplorable images of ISIS atrocities posted on the internet. Eight per cent agreed they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John. Scroll down for video . Four out of ten British Muslims partly blame the security services for radicalising young Jihadis . Eight per cent of British Muslims said they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John, pictured . Six out of ten strongly condemned those, such as Jihadi John, who have joined ISIS. The survey conducted by Survation on behalf of Sky News found that one-third of all Muslims felt they are viewed with suspicion by non-Muslims. It follows a similar poll earlier this year that found more than a quarter of Muslims sympathised with the Charlie Hebdo attackers, who brutally murdered journalists at the satirical magazine's offices in Paris. Yesterday's Survation study of 1,001 non-Muslims, 44 per cent agreed they were more suspicious of Muslims than they had been previously. The pollsters asked Muslims and non-Muslims about whether they felt Islam was 'compatible' with British values and the British way of life. According to the survey, three quarters of Muslims agreed their religion was compatible with the values of British society, with 14 per cent disagreeing. For non-Muslims, less than one quarter viewed Islam as compatible with British values with around half saying the religion was incompatible. One in five followers of Islam believe that British Muslims do not do enough to integrate into society, while 64 per cent believe they do, the pollsters found. Another six per cent felt it was not important for Muslims to fit into British society. Their families: 44% . Government: 15.1% . Religious authorities: 8.8% . Police: 3% . Schools: 2.2% . No-one: 4.6% . Other: 22.1% . 1,001 Muslims polled by Survation for Sky News . The researchers found that one in seven non-Muslims had sympathy for those who have joined ISIS. The researchers found that almost 40 per cent of Muslims agreed that the security services were partly responsible for radicalising young Jihadis, compared with 16 per cent of non-Muslims. Meanwhile more than half of the Muslims surveyed said it was their responsibility to condemn terrorist attacks by Muslims in the name of Islam, while a third said it was not. When it comes to stopping young Muslims joining terrorist groups, 44 per cent felt it was the responsibility of their families to set them straight. More than 15 per cent said it was the government's responsibility, followed by religious authorities (nine per cent), the police (three per cent) and schools (two per cent). The father of one of the three east London schoolgirls who fled to Syria to become 'jihadi brides' blamed the police for failing to keep track of them. Abase Hussen (circled) blamed the police and schools for allowing his daughter to travel to Syria to join ISIS, only for footage to emerge of him at an extremist rally in central London . More than a quarter of Muslims polled in a previous survey said they had sympathy for the Charlie Hebdo attackers . Abase Hussen gave evidence to Parliament refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls’ actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe issued a grovelling apology to the family, only for footage to emerge showing Mr Hussen at an extremist rally in central London. He could be seen standing just feet from one of Lee Rigby's killers while yelling: 'Burn, burn USA.' The survey comes two months after a separate poll found that more than quarter of Muslims said they had sympathy for Charlie Hebdo attackers Said and Cherif Kouachi, who killed 12 on their rampage around Paris. That poll, commissioned by the BBC, also found that 32 per cent of Muslims were 'not surprised' that the massacre took place. And more than 10 per cent of the 1,000 British Muslims interviewed agreed that the magazine 'deserved' to be attacked. The Muslim Council of Britain told the Daily Telegraph: 'For many, current counter-terrorism measures, particularly related to the Prevent strategy, actually lead to greater alienation as Muslims are seen through the lens of security, rather than tackling the scourge of terrorism itself.' The Council said it was pleased that the survey 'once again confirms that Muslims feel British and have a strong affinity with our shared universal values'.","Pollsters questioned 1,001 British Muslims and 1,001 non-Muslims .

"Defense attorneys released some of the training records Saturday for a 73-year-old volunteer sheriff's deputy charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect in Oklahoma. The records for Robert Bates include certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008. Bates' attorneys said the 64 pages of information include records Bates, of Tulsa, copied and kept for himself. Although there are time gaps in the documents provided, some of the records seem to indicate Bates was proficient in firearms and dozens of other training courses. Scroll down for videos . Apology: Robert Bates became emotional as he apologized to the family of the man he shot dead during a botched sting operation on April 2. The reserve deputy appeared on the Today show on Friday . 'For the first time today, we feel like someone's starting to look at the other side of this as far as his qualifications,' Scott Wood, an attorney for Bates, said after the documents were released. Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Bates spoke at length about the deadly incident for the first time on the Today show on Friday, where he was flanked by his lawyer and family members. He also took the opportunity to apologize to the family of the man he killed in the April 2 incident. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said as he became emotional. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' The interview comes just days after Bates turned himself in to face charges of second-degree manslaughter. He was released after posting a $25,000 bond. On the Today show, he recalled how he had been in his car several blocks away when Harris, 44, ran towards him amid a botched undercover gun-sale operation. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after the man. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him. I'm sorry.' Mix up: While on the Today show, he showed where he keeps his Taser (left) compared to where he keeps his gun (right). He said that there have previously been cases of officers confusing the position of the two . The fatally-wounded man can be heard daying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' On the Today show, Bates said he was immediately hit by shock when the gun went off. 'Oh my god, what has happened?' he recalled thinking. 'This was not an intentional thing. I had no desire to ever take anyone's life.' He said that the shock remains with him and he is unable to sleep or concentrate. Bates also stood up and demonstrated where he keeps his Taser on his body - slightly below his chest - compared to where he keeps his gun - on his lower right-hand side near his pants pocket. Today show host Matt Lauer asked him how he could make the mistake, when the two pieces of equipment are kept so far away from each other on the body. Support: He appeared on the Today show on Friday flanked by family members and his lawyer, right . 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates responded. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' The interview follows reports that Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had been allowed to 'play cop' after he donated pricey equipment to the department - a claim he called 'unbelievably unfair'. Bates, who is among several well-to-do Tulsa residents who moonlight as reserve deputies, has purchased five vehicles for the police force. The Tulsa County volunteer deputy disputed earlier this week a Tulsa World report that sheriff's office supervisors were ordered to falsify his training records. Shot dead: Eric Harris, who is pictured with his son Aidan, was killed in the incident on April 2 . Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' The World said at least three of Bates' supervisors were transferred for refusing to go along with the requests, and said it consulted multiple sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, but it gave no indication how those sources were familiar with the situation. Harris' family attorney — who had questioned Bates' qualifications as a reserve deputy — did not return a message seeking comment Saturday. A call to the district attorney's office rang unanswered, and the sheriff's office referred questions to Wood. 'I want to do everything I can to make sure that people know that this allegation of falsified records is not true,' Wood said. His lawyer added that the report was largely based on claims made by a man who was terminated from the department seven years ago, at which point Bates had only been there a few months. Charged: Harris (pictured left) died from his injuries and Bates (right in his mug shot) has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. He faces four years in prison if he is convicted . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. But the sources who spoke to Tulsa World claimed that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork. Bates faces four years in prison if convicted.","Tulsa County Sheriff's Office reserve deputy Robert Bates faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter for the April 2 shooting of Eric Harris .

"An American company claims to have invented a 'teabag' that can turn an ordinary pint of lager into a craft beer the same way  hot water is turned into brew . The Hop Theory 'beer-bag' contains a blend of hops, fruit peels and natural spices, and promises to turn light beer into craft after just two minutes of steeping. However, despite nearly reaching its crowd-funding target, the project has been criticised by professional breweries as being misleading about what constitutes as 'craft beer'. Scroll down for video . Transformation: The Hop Theory sachets promises to turn lager into craft beer in just two minutes . Hop Theory, based in Maryland, is nearing its $25,000 target on crowd-funding site Kickstarter to produce its first blend, claiming it will turn lager into 'craft beer' in just two to four minutes. Bobby Gattuso, who founded the company as a biology student in 2013,  hopes to revolutionise beer drinking. 'Craft beer excels in taste but it's expensive. Light beer is cost effective and low in calories but lacks flavour, and with Hop Theory, an average beer becomes craft.' Emily Williamson of independent brewery Cheddar Ales in Somerset, England, is sceptical to the idea of 'tea bag' beer. 'Firstly, adding hops, flavouring herbs, peels during the brewing process is about stabilizing those ingredients to make them safe for consumption. 'Secondly, and most importantly, the boiling phase is when your wort (the unfermented liquid extracted from the mashing process) concentrates, and flavours, aroma and balance are carefully adjusted  to create the complexity people of our beer drinking generation are after.' New drink: After a short infusion of two minutes, the blend of hops, dried fruit and spices will have changed the taste of a lighter lager into that on par with a craft beer . New ideas: The Relativity blend contains dried and ground orange peel, Cascade hops and ground coriander seeds, and is set to hit the market this summer . Ms Williamson adds that the claim that the Hop Theory sachets can make a lager taste like a craft beer could also 'mislead people'. 'To add a sachet to a pre-balanced, pre-made beer will only add a glimmer of the flavours available in traditionally made beers. 'For example our latest brew, Firewitch Spicy Farmhouse Saison, has had citrus peel in it for over two weeks, which really allows for a multitude of flavours to release into the brew. 'So, without tasting the product, I can only guess that it won't add anywhere near the depth of flavour that the actual brewing process can achieve as it's not inherent to the structure.' Hannah Rhodes, founder of Hiver beers, says: 'Good quality beer is more expensive because avoiding shortcuts and brewing naturally takes time, normally 3 to 6 times longer than that of it's mainstream competitors.' 'Here at Hiver, the honeys we source are fermented at the start of the process along with the cereals, and by not adding honey for flavouring at the end, you get a lovely crisp and refreshing finish and not something that's sweet or cloying or artificial. 'The entrepreneurs behind the Hop Theory have spotted a great opportunity and I honestly think, anything that encourages people to think more seriously about what they eat and drink and experiment with taste, flavour and quality, is a good thing, so I wish them the best of luck.' Their words are echoed by Durham Atkinson, owner of London craft beer pub and brewery Hops & Glory. 'In all honesty, I am not convinced that the attention to the brewing process in craft beer can be outdone in a sachet. 'The countless hours brewers spend watching their boil, trying and testing their beers and tweaking recipes and temperatures countless times I doubt can be solved by this product. I would however give it a go to see if a tasteless lager is improved by the sachet.' Reusable: Each sachet can be used in up to four beers, so keeps both costs and calories down . Guide: A graphic from Mr Gattuso's Kickstarter campaign describes how to use the Hop Theory sachets . Hop Theory's first blend Relativity contains dried and ground orange peel, Cascade hops and ground coriander seeds, with another four blends planned for this year - raspberry, pumpkin, double IPA and peach. Each 5g Hop Theory sachet can transfuse up to four beers, so one bag could keep the drinker going for a session at the pub. The first infusion will take between two and four minutes, but once the bag is wet, any further uses will only take about 30 seconds to transfuse, Mr Gattuso says. 'We have been meticulously fine-tuning the perfect balance of ingredients to create our first blend and are finally ready to begin production. 'Hop Theory is here to add customisation to the beer industry. 'There's only five calories in each sachet, so it improves a light beer without adding pounds or going penniless. 'It took a long time to create the perfect blend but finally Relativity was born and as our first blend, we think we nailed it. It is delicious and refreshing. 'No longer will you have to settle for what's being served or dream about the beer you could be having. 'We simply want to to give everyone control over how their beer tastes.' The first beerbags will be delivered in July this year, and 12 sachets cost $14.95 (£10).","Maryland start-up promises to turn lager into craft beer with 'tea bag'

"A neo-Nazi charged with killing a gay supervisor at a community college said he did so because he hates homosexuality. Stancil, who gave himself fascist face tattoos, is awaiting extradition from Florida to North Carolina, where he is accused of fatally shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane. Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, told Raleigh's WRAL-TV on Wednesday that he killed Lane earlier this week in North Carolina because Lane had made sexual advances to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Scroll down for video . Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, claimed in a prison interview on Wednesday that he had killed a gay college supervisor because he made sexual advances towards his teenage brother . In a telephone interview from a Daytona Beach jail, Stancil said Lane tried to take advantage of his brother. 'He ain't physically touched him, but he was in the proposal to try to and I wasn't going to let that happen,' Stancil said. Stancil said Lane was looking for Stancil on Facebook and found his brother. A Goldsboro police spokesman did not immediately return a phone message on Thursday about that allegation. 'I'd do anything necessary to take care of my family,' Stancil said. He said he has no regrets about the shooting. 'I did what I did, and I've got to live with it. If I get life, I just get life. 'I'm a murderer, you know, what the hell do I got to care? 'I don't give a damn if I go back to society.' Stancil, shot dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane (pictured) and claimed to have killed three others - although police had no reports of unsolved homicides . Stancil said he is a neo-Nazi who is concerned about the future of white children. 'I try to look out for my fellow white people,' he said. 'I don't believe in race mixing.' He was asked if he hates gays. 'Yes, I do, with a passion,' he replied, though he said that was only one of the reasons he killed Lane, who had been his supervisor in a work study program at the college before he was fired for absenteeism. Stancil also told the television station he had killed three other people, including two in the Wayne County area. But the sheriff's department told the station it has no report of any unsolved homicides that match Stancil's account. The accused killer appeared in court in Florida on Tuesday where he admitted to the killing, WRAL reported, despite the judge advising him he could remain silent. He confessed to the shooting in an obscenity-laced statement, saying he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth'. He said Lane, who had been his supervisor at the college's print shop until Stancil was fired last month, had been 'messing with' one of Stancil's family members. Lane was gay, and authorities said they are investigating a possible hate crime. They haven't released a motive for the shooting, but Stancil was dismissed from a work study program at the print shop last month. His mother, Debbie Stancil, said her son was angry over being dismissed from his work-study job for excessive absenteeism. She also said Lane made sexually laced comments to her son. 'He was verbally inappropriate with Morgan at school. Very much verbally inappropriate,' she said. 'He would tell him to stop and he kept on.' The 20-year-old is facing a charge of open murder. Stancil pictured with his mother Debbie at his graduation. She said he is 'rattled and confused and needs mental help'.

"Watching the first male skier to ever clinch four straight World Cup titles fly through snowcapped slopes is impressive enough. But talented Marcel Hirscher added a little extra flare to his downhill slalom run by bringing the pistes alive with a colourful display. The skier teamed up with The Red Bull Media House and Starelation to create the unusual stunt, using coloured powder packed into the poles he swerved around. Rainbow run! Marcel Hirscher performs during the project 'Marcel Hirscher Colours' at Reiteralm near Schladming . Blue eruption! The coloured powder was flung across the slopes as the talented skier went passed . 'It was a surreal experience – simply amazing!' said the four times World Champion skier, Marcel Hirscher . 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website' The process involved 11 cameras, a specially-enhanced slope, and three days to set up before creating the incredible video in one take with the 26-year-old Austrian. Marcel Hirscher slalomed in and out of poles filled to the brim with coloured, biodegradable powder, which erupted upon contact. Six GoPros, and a range of other cameras, including a hand held one by the skier captured the dazzling rainbow effect, which surrounded him at every turn. As the run required more ice than snow, a section of the Reiteralm slopes in Austria had to be watered, so that it could freeze over night in preparation. The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run in one take from a number of angles, before the ice melted. The most difficult part of the incredible video as filming it from all angles, without getting another cameraman in the shot. 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website, 'and create unforgettable images. And I think we succeeded!' 'It was a surreal experience – simply amazing! I couldn't ski with the speed I normally do in races, even though the course was very steep in the first part, up to 75 percent incline,' he explains. 'At each gate I was blinded for a split second because I had to ski through a cloud of yellow and blue.' The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run from a number of angles, before the ice melted during the day . The biodegradable powder was placed in slalom poles along the course, and multiple cameras were set up to capture the effect from different angles .

"Harvey Weinstein's wife has been pictured for the first time this week looking forlorn amid claims her billionaire husband was recorded apologizing to a 22-year-old model for groping her. The  producer, 63, has emphatically denied sexually assaulting Ambra Battilana during a business meeting at his Tribeca office last Friday. But as he fights to throw out the allegations, the New York Daily News reports that police overheard a phone call between Battilana and Weinstein, in which she confronted him - and he said: 'It won't happen again'. The news comes as Weinstein's 38-year-old wife of eight years, Georgina Chapman, was pictured for the first time outside their home in New York City since the scandal broke looking downcast and carrying their four-year-old daughter, India. There was no sign of Weinstein. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Forlorn: Harvey Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman, 38, stepped out looking forlorn amid allegations her husband apologized to a 22-year-old model for groping her. He has publicly denied the incident occurred . Downcast: Looking down, Chapman carried the couple's four-year-old daughter India to their car in New York . Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse on Thursday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police that the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night . But on Saturday the couple were pictured at their Connecticut home. Weinsten was spotted outside the home. Chapman was seen rolling up to the compound in a silver Mercedes-Benz before she went inside. According to the Daily News' source, Weinstein appeared to confirm he groped Battilana during a phone call with the Italian national. 'She said something to the effect that she was uncomfortable with him doing that,' the source told the Daily News. 'And he said something to the effect, ""It won't happen again.""' 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her. The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' Battilana, 22, has claimed Weinstein asked her for a kiss and groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night. DailyMail.com has reached out to his representatives for comment. Battilana also convinced Weinstein to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he knew he was being monitored but following the call and the meeting at the restaurant at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, Weinstein voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Battilana's attorney, David Godosky, said Tuesday is the earliest he expects to hear a decision on whether Weinstein will face criminal charges, according to the New York Daily News. A legal expect told the Daily News that, if the DA decides to prosecute Weinstein, he will likely only face misdemeanor charges. The alleged incident unfolded at Weinstein's Tribeca office after he invited her there for a business meeting on Friday night, hours after meeting her at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. When she arrived at the office, the married father-of-five allegedly asked if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt, she told police. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. She clearly rejected him and he backed off, the New York Daily News reported, and she fled from the building. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she quickly left the building half an hour after arriving, the newspaper reported. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with Weinstein, who is behind hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York. 'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out. She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.' Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Weinstein's camp have dismissed Miss Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . It also emerged that she told Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with €2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Harvey Weinstein to 'discuss business' After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer  Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004.","Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman, 38, was seen looking forlorn .

"Meet the 11-year-old boy with a rare life-threatening disease that means he can't go out in the sun without breaking into a severe rash and his throat can swell so much it almost closes over. Damon Muller has almost doubled in size due to swelling and bloating since he was diagnosed with Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) in November - a rare autoimmune disease that can only be treated with high doses of steroids and a chemotherapy-type drug. The disease has robbed Damon, from Gladstone in central Queensland, of the ability to run, ride his bike and play outside freely in the sun - something his mother Nicci Moynahan says has been very difficult.

"He was held against his will in a foreign jungle for 472 days and feared his al-Qaeda linked captors would behead him. Now more than two years since Australian Warren Rodwell was finally staggered to freedom from the clutches of the Filipino terror group Abu Sayyaf, he believes he may be in for another fight. In an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Mr Rodwell said he fears the Federal government will not award him Victims of Terror Overseas compensation. Scroll down for video . Islamist militants posing as policemen abducted Mr Rodwell from his home in the Philippines by gunpoint on December 5, 2011. He was released in March 2013 when his family managed to raise a ransom . Abu Sayyaf militants are pictured guarding an area prior to a meeting with the Sulu government . Under Australian law, the survivors and families of victims of overseas attacks can claim up to $75,000 in compensation. But for that to happen, Prime Minister Tony Abbott would have to declare his kidnapping a terrorist event. Despite an official from the Attorney-General's Department (AGD) lauding his courage and referring a petition from him to Mr Abbott's office, the kidnapping victim is sceptical it will see action. The AGD did not place any timeframe on when he should expect Mr Abbott to decide on his case. 'The prime minister has no time for doing things like this,' Mr Rodwell told Daily Mail Australia - who attributed part of his situation to his low public profile. Islamist militants posing as policemen abducted Mr Rodwell from his home in the Philippines by gunpoint on December 5, 2011. He was released in March 2013 after his family managed to raise a significant ransom and has spent time since recovering from his physical and psychological injurie . Mr Rodwell (right) is escorted by Philippine police officers as he arrives at a police station in Pagadian City, on the southern island of Mindanao early March 23, 2013, shortly after he was released by his Islamic militant kidnappers . Mr Rodwell walked free on March 23 after being held for 15 months by Islamic militants in the lawless southern Philippines . A government media blackout was enforced during his captivity. The kidnapping victim said he was a 'little bitter' this year that other Australians trapped overseas have obtained considerable attention, including Kalynda Davis, the Bali Nine drug smugglers and journalist Peter Greste. 'I got no attention because I wasn't female and I wasn't a convicted drug smuggler and I wasn't a recognised person in society - just one of these ordinary people.' Some of the 'declared terror events' where Australian victims or families are eligible for compensation include the September 11 attacks, Bali and London bombings and the siege at the Westgate Mall in Kenya. ASIO has officially declared Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organisation. Mr Rodwell is hoping to use any compensation to pay back his brother and sister, who helped arrange the ransom payment that saved him.

"Caretakers of Abraham Lincoln's tomb are on the defensive over an unflattering critique in National Geographic magazine and looming budget cuts that could threaten management of the historic site, even as they commemorate the 150th anniversary of the U.S. Civil War president's assassination. For the state that calls itself the 'Land of Lincoln,' the timing of a ceremony Wednesday in Springfield to mark his death is awkward because Illinois faces a financial crisis and Gov. Bruce Rauner has proposed eliminating the state Historic Preservation Agency that manages sites including the tomb as it currently exists. He would roll the agency into another department. What's more, the popular tourist site was pilloried in this month's issue of National Geographic magazine as having 'all the historical character of an office lobby.' Landmark: In this Feb. 12, 2015 file photo, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner participates in ceremonies honoring President Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln tomb in Springfield, Illinois . Leader: A marker is seen over the burial site of Abraham Lincoln inside Lincoln's tomb within Oak Ridge Cemetery (November 2013 file photo) Killing: President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at a performance of the play 'Our American Cousin' in April 1865 . Recounting the route of Lincoln's funeral train to Springfield for burial, historian Adam Goodheart describes the tomb as 'a disappointment' and reconstructed in 'incongruous Art Deco style.' 'It's strange to think that there is a place where Lincoln still physically exists in the world, let alone that it's a place like this,' writes Goodheart, who is director for Washington College's Center for the American Experience in Maryland. Goodheart's publicist didn't immediately return a request for comment. The hours and days the Lincoln tomb is open have been reduced, and it's staffed with fewer employees since state lawmakers last year cut $1.1 million funding for sites in the Springfield area. On Tuesday — the 150th anniversary of John Wilkes Booth's shooting of Lincoln, although the president was pronounced dead the following day — Joan Boatz and a group of former bridge club friends found the tomb's iron door locked, despite a sign saying the site should be open at that time. Chris Wills, spokesman for the Historic Preservation Agency, said the correct times when the site is open are posted on its website. Pam VanAlstine, president of the Lincoln Monument Association, said she's deeply concerned about what more cuts might mean for the Lincoln site. 'We're all scared to death,' said VanAlstine, who also serves as a volunteer tour guide. 'We don't know how things are going to be run.' She and other supporters of how Lincoln's final resting place is presented to the public said the National Geographic portrayal was unfair. Remembered: Tourists walk out of Abraham Lincoln's tomb and past a bust of Lincoln statue (November 2013 file photo) Shrouded in history: Caretakers of Abraham Lincoln's tomb are on the defensive over an unflattering critique in National Geographic magazine and looming budget cuts that could threaten management of the historic site (February 2014 file photo) 'The author of the piece is certainly entitled to feel underwhelmed by the tomb's interior, but I think it's safe to say he's in the minority,' Wills said. According to the State Historic Preservation Agency, the tomb and its receiving vault have seen more than $2.5 million in recent repairs and renovations, leaving it in what Wills describes as 'excellent physical condition.' The tomb's interior plaster and paint, and bronze and marble construction were renovated last year, and its interior lighting was upgraded for approximately $730,000. The state is currently working on waterproofing the receiving vault, repairing the stone structure's interior, and landscaping to direct water away from the vault, a roughly $390,000 project. Lincoln's tomb was designed by Vermont sculptor Larkin Mead, who won a national contest. It was dedicated by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1874. Originally built on what historians describe as an 'inadequate foundation,' it was reconstructed first in 1899, and then again in 1930 to give the public access to the interior burial chamber. Today, the tomb, a circular structure topped with an obelisk, has its interior sheathed in alternating black and tan marble and is trimmed with bronze. Hallways stretch on either side of a rotunda to the family burial chamber, where Lincoln lies below an inscription 'Now He belongs to the ages.' William Sparks, a visitor to the outside of the tomb Tuesday who took an Amtrak train from Green Bay, Wisconsin, said he had a copy of the National Geographic story with him at his Springfield hotel, but disagreed with its conclusion. 'It's absolutely gorgeous,' he said of the site, even though he didn't get to see the interior of the tomb. 'I don't get (the author's take) at all. This is very impressive.'

"Human remains have been found in the search for a missing college freshman who vanished while home for spring break last month. Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2, when she was on a break from Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia and home in Norfolk. The remains were found outside a residence in Franklin on Thursday morning, police said. Franklin is around 40 miles from Norfolk. The body has been sent to the Chief Medical Examiner's Office to be identified and to determine the cause of death. The FBI is now involved in the investigation, police said. Missing: AJ Hadsell has been missing since March 2 and on Thursday, police announced they had found remains 40 miles from her home. They have been sent to the medical examiner's office for identification . It comes after police focused their search on a pond near Carrsville last week after receiving a tip that her cell phone may be below its surface. Her stepdad Wesley Hadsell was arrested for breaking into a home; he says he was looking for AJ . Two days after the Hadsell vanished, police received a tip that she had been seen on the Virginia Commonwealth University campus, two hours away from where she was last seen by her family. Investigators have previously said there is no evidence of foul play, but her family and friends have said she wouldn't disappear on purpose. Earlier this week, her grandmother, Katherine Hadsell, blasted authorities for seemingly 'doing nothing' to bring the teenager home. And in a twist, Hadsell's stepfather was caught allegedly breaking into a home two weeks after Anjelica's disappearance, an act his mother Katherine says was out of fatherly concern. She told ABC News her son Wesley had heard his stepdaughter could be inside the home. 'As any father would, if you hear that your daughter may or may not be in a house or being held or some of her belongings or at a location, any father is going to try and find out,' she said. He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. Hadsell, 36, had not been named a suspect and has insisted he does not know where AJ is. He faces charges of obstructing justice, possessing ammunition and breaking and entering. Search: Last week, authorities searched a nearby pond near Carrsville (pictured) after receiving a tip that her cellphone might be below the surface. Carrseville is just six miles from where the remains were found . Fears: The 18-year-old freshman vanished while home on spring break from Longwood University . But Hadsell, who had been working in nearby Franklin, around the time of the disappearance, said he was only thinking about his daughter. 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. While searching the property for around 15 minutes, he claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light,' he said. 'It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' The stepfather has aroused local suspicions because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005, his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. Concern: Her grandmother Katherine Hadsell said earlier this week that she did not think police were doing enough to find the teenager. She argued that her son, Wesley Hadsell, had been arrested unfairly . Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR - but he insists that he is now a changed man. And in another twist, Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received texts from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not convinced she was actually messaging the girl. AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.","Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2, when she was home in Norfolk while on spring break from Longwood University .

"Nick Robinson returned to the TV screens last night, with his voice still recovering its strength after his cancer treatment. The BBC's Political Editor announced at the start of March that he would be taking some weeks off for treatment for a rare lung tumour. But he expressed hopes he would be fit again in time to cover 'the election proper'. Last night he returned to the BBC's News at Six to analyse the Labour's party's manifesto from the studio. BBC political editor Nick Robinson made a brief return to TV screens last night (pictured), although his voice sounded weak and strained following his cancer surgery . Mr Robinson's voice sounded weak and strained after his treatment for a bronchial carcinoid tumour which involved surgery to stop cancer spreading to other parts of the body. Afterwards he tweeted: 'Good to be back on air. Don't worry about the voice. It doesn't hurt and I'm not risking my recovery.' He said he was listening to his doctors and speech therapist. His return comes at a vital stage of the campaign, when the parties lay out their programmes for government to voters. The Tories' manifesto is unveiled today and the Liberal Democrats' is on Wednesday. Mr Robinson, 51, who is married with three children, has been sent an outpouring of good wishes, led by Prime Minister David Cameron. In a message recorded for the BBC website earlier yesterday, Mr Robinson said his return was a 'small step' and he did not expect to return to the campaign trail full-time at this stage. 'I'm taking my next small step back to reporting the election after my recent operation. As you can hear, my voice is still recovering and it's got a way to go yet. I'm not ready to go on the campaign trail full-time, but I will be watching this week's manifesto launches and the big opposition parties' debate on Thursday. 'I'll be blogging and I hope doing a little bit of broadcasting like this too. I would like to thank all those people who have sent me good wishes – it's really strengthened me. 'It's a fascinating election with an extraordinarily unpredictable result and I can't wait to get back to reporting it full-time, which, fingers crossed, could be fairly soon.' While he has been away, deputy political editor James Landale has been anchoring the election coverage and intereviewed all the major party leaders - landing the scoop that Mr Cameron would not stand for a third term if re-elected.","The reporter announced early March he would take time off due to tumour .

"At least three terror groups plotting attacks against Britain have changed their communication methods since the leaks by Edward Snowden, it was claimed last night. The Al Qaeda-linked networks have altered their tactics since the fugitive stole intelligence files from GCHQ and the US National Security Agency, according to a report. Extremist websites have also moved to protect their digital communications by releasing encryption programmes for followers, making it harder for extremists to be tracked down. Scroll down for video . Last Week Tonight host John Oliver flew to Moscow to grill Edward Snowden about the leaking of 'harmful' documents and asks him to explain why he did it . Evidence of the harm done to intelligence agencies across the world after the former CIA contractor leaked 1.7million classified documents in 2013 is compiled in the first comprehensive public analysis of the leaks by the Henry Jackson Society security think-tank. The Snowden files revealed details about covert attempts by agencies to view citizens' private information by gathering internet histories, emails, text and call records and passwords. Now the Henry Jackson Society has found that at least three Al Qaeda affiliates are known to have altered their communications. The think-tank has also found other groups using human couriers instead of email and mobile phones. Snowden fled justice in the US to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location . Jihadist websites also released three 'significant' encryption programmes 'within a three- to five-month time frame of the leaks', meaning fanatics are harder to detect and encrypted emails take longer to decipher. Report author Robin Simcox said: 'The focus has been about the so-called mass surveillance by GCHQ and the NSA but these leaks have allowed extremist groups and jihadists to look at our capabilities – what we can and can't do – which has given them a great insight. 'At a time when the range of threats against the West has never been greater, with Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Al Qaeda in Pakistan, it is astonishing the focus has been more on the shortcomings of our intelligence agencies and not the fact Snowden has helped terror suspects drop off the radar. 'He has caused severe damage to our ability to fight extremism.' MI5 director general Andrew Parker has called the traitor's actions a 'gift to terrorists'. On Monday, Snowden revealed he had not read all the top-secret dossiers he stole before handing them to newspapers including the Guardian – a move which has put lives in jeopardy from terrorists. He claims he had to act because the US and other Western governments' policies were a 'threat to democracy'. He fled justice in the US to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location.","Al-Qaeda linked networks have altered tactics since Snowden stole files .

"A Yazidi teenager has told how Islamic State fighters stormed her town with shocking brutality, dragging girls as young as ten  by their hair and carting them off like cattle to become sex slaves. Hanan, 19, was snatched from her family, suffered regular beatings and taken to a warehouse in Mosul, Iraq, where hundreds of women were lined up and hand picked by jihadist militants. She and six others were then taken to a house in a nearby village where they met a fellow Yazidi girl who had been incarcerated there for the last two months, she told CNN's Arwa Damon. The girl told them she had been beaten, handcuffed and raped and their captors warned they would soon suffer the same fate. Scroll down for video . Newly released members of the Yazidi minority, including one girl with an injured leg, wait for medical help after being set free by ISIS near Kirkuk, northern Iraq last week. One Yazidi survivor (not pictured) has told how girls as young as ten were dragged away from their families and raped at the hands of ISIS militants . Hanan managed to escape that night with some of the other girls by jumping out of a bedroom window, but two of them were caught as they fled. Speaking of the moment ISIS attacked her village last August, she said: 'They separated all of us. They dragged us away by our hair. 'The youngest with us was just 10. We were all crying. They said we are going to marry you off, you will forget your family.' Hanan is now recovering at the Shariya refugee camp in Dohuk Iraqi Kurdistan, where hundreds of other Yazidis have fled, but says she shakes with fear every time she sees 'someone with a beard'. Tens of thousands of Yazidis were forced to flee for their lives - many of them into the nearby Sinjar mountains and then into Kurdish-held regions of northern Iraq during the ISIS offensive in August. Relief: 216 prisoners, including 40 children, believed they were being led to their execution, but were instead piled onto minibuses for a handover southwest of Kirkuk. It is not known why they were released . However many were captured by the militants, resulting in the massacre of hundreds of men and the selling into slavery of women and children, after they were first divided up between militants . A magazine published by the terror group, Dabiq, last year attempted to justify the sickening treatment of the Yazidis. Explaining why Yazidis have been sold into sex slavery while those from other groups have not, the magazine claims Islamic Sharia law allows the enslavement of innocent 'polytheists and pagans' but not of those the militants regard as simply heretical. Last week, aid workers reported that a nine-year-old girl was pregnant after suffering horrific sexual abuse at the hands of ISIS militants in northern Iraq. She was among more than 200 Yazidi women, children and elderly who were released near Kirkuk, northern Iraq after being taken hostage last June. According to aid workers, she was 'sexually abused by no fewer than ten men', while in captivity inside the self-proclaimed caliphate.","ISIS snatched dozens of girls after storming the town of Sinjar last August .

"Stone Age man ate mushrooms as part of their diet, a study on ancient tooth plaque has revealed. Anthropologists studying the remains of a prehistoric woman nicknamed The Red Lady of El Mirón have found spores of several mushroom species embedded in her teeth. Discovered in an elaborate grave in the El Mirón cave in Cantabria, Spain, the remains are thought to belong to a 35 to 40-year-old woman who was buried around 18,700 years ago. The images above show some of the microscopic fungal spores from grilled fungi (left) and bolete fungi (right) that the researchers found trapped inside the hardened dental plaque on the Red Lady of El Mirón's teeth . The study now provides the oldest evidence yet that mushrooms were eaten by early humans and helps to shed new light on the mysterious Red Lady. Her body was found in 2010 in the cave stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers with an engraved stone nearby. The Red Lady's remains were uncovered in 2010 during excavations of the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria. After discovering a series of individual bones, researchers  unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed. She was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy', explained the researchers , and would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas.' Herself and her peers would have used stone tools, needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters. They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. A engraved tombstone was found nearby. The pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. Her robust skeleton, which bore few signs of disease, and her elaborate funeral suggests she may have been of high status or even buried in a sacrificial ritual. Now the research looking at the dental calculus - hardened plaque - has helped to shed some light on her diet. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, found her teeth bore the remains of plant pollen, fungi and animals. They found microscopic evidence that the woman had been eating sponge capped, bolete mushrooms and gilled mushrooms from the Agaric group. The researchers also found her teeth bore little signs of decay, suggesting she ate few carbohydrates. Robert Power, who led the research, said: 'These types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants from different environments, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'This finding at El Mirón Cave could be the earliest indication of human mushroom use or consumption, which until this point has been unidentified in the Palaeolithic.' Agaric muchrooms include the distinctive red and white spotted fly agaric, which is poisonous but also has halucinogenic qualities. However, the group includes many common forms of mushroom that are harmless. Bolete mushrooms include Boletus edulis, which is also called porchini. There is some evidence from neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Piedmont in the Italian Alps that suggest psychotropic mushrooms were used in rituals. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of El Mirón Cave, which lies between Santander and Bilbao. This plant fragment was discovered in the hardened plaque on the teeth of the Red Lady of El Mirón . The Red Lady was discovered in the El Mirón Cave in 2000 at a site that has been excavated since 1996 . Haematite comes from the Greek for 'blood' and red ochre (pictured) is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings but the Red Lady was found covered in the substance when her remains were discovered . After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal which as has since faded. Haematite comes from the Greek word for 'blood' and it is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted in this way, and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. However, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual. In Mayan practices, for example, bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods. The entrance to the El Mirón Cave (above) is located in the mountainous region of eastern Cantabria in Spain . The Red Lady was found in an elaborate grave (pictured) and is thought to have been buried 18,700 years ago . Anthropologists who have studied the Red Lady's remains believe she was buried in a tightly bundled fetal position on her left side with her chest facing the cave wall and her back towards a large stone block . The fact she was buried within in what appears to be living quarters has suggested she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. A primative tombstone found nearby also hints at this. During the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif that they suggest represents a pubic triangle, while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers. There is some evidence that the people living in the cave at the time ate large amounts of meat from red deer and ibex but there are few signs of what role plants played in their diet. Mr Power and Dr Amanda Henry, whose work is published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, examined samples of the plaque from the Red Lady's teeth in an attempt to learn more about her. They found chemical signitures that indicate she may have eaten seeds, roots and other plants with low levels of starch. The Fly agaric (above) is one of the most easily recognised  gill mushrooms which formed the Red Lady's diet . The researchers also found the remains of pollen from pine trees and spores from the fungi. It is possible the fungi had been used to help flavour food or as a medicine. The Tryolean Iceman 'Otzi' - who lived around 3,000 years ago - was found to be carrying several types of fungi. Writing in the journal, Mr Power and his colleagues said their findings had shed new light on prehistoric diet of the Red Lady. They said: 'The types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants, including seeds and underground storage organs, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'These findings suggest that plant and plant-like foods were parts of her diet, supplementing staples derived from animal foods.' The cave site of El Mirón is in the Rio Asón valley of Cantabria, Spain. Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide). Research has shown that the site was occupied from the Middle Paleolithic 41,000 years ago up to around 1400AD. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. They predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life. In addition to El Mirón, Magdalenian sites have been found from Portugal in the west to as far east as Poland. The El Mirón site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mirón Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel González Morales from the Universidad de Cantabria.","Anthropologists studied the teeth of a prehistoric woman nicknamed the Red Lady who was found in the El Mirón cave in eastern Cantabria, Spain .

"Xiao Zhengti, five, was born with a congenital liver disease meaning he needed his first transplant at just nine months old . A boy in China born with a malfunctioning liver is now looking forward to living a normal life after both of his parents donated part of their organs to save him. Xiao Zhengti, now five, was born with a  liver condition meaning he had to have his first major surgery at just nine months old, when mother Yang Haiying donated part of her liver, The People's Daily Online reports. But the boy's body rejected the organ, leading to years of trips to hospital, until father Xiao Kunqing was allowed to donate 40 per cent of his liver yesterday, leading to a full recovery. The touching story began in 2009 shortly after Xiao was born to parents from southern China's Hunan province with jaundice, which is common in babies, but doctors became concerned after it did not dissipate within a few weeks. Soon his parents noticed that he had a strange looking bulge in his stomach, and after visits to specialist Guangdong and Shanghai he was diagnosed with congenital biliary atresia. The rare condition occurs where the bile ducts around the liver swell during or immediately after birth, which can cause the tissue around them to scar. While the exact cause of bilairy artesia is unknown, it is usually fatal if left untreated, and in severe cases, such as Xiao's, it may require a transplant. The initial operation took place just nine months after he was born, but complications followed and his body rejected his mother's liver. Mother Yang Haiying (right) first donated a portion of her liver to try and save her son after being found to be a match, but his body rejected it, leading to to repeated trips to hospital for the next four years . Father Xiao Kunqing (left) was also found to be a match for the boy, but surgeons warned against a second operation, saying it carried far greater risks . However doctors eventually relented, and yesterday Mr Kunqing had 40 per cent of his liver removed and transplanted into his son . A year after the first transplant Xiao suffered 200 days of high fever, and spent the next four years moving in and out of hospital. But yesterday at the hospital in Tianjin City, eastern China, surgeons agreed to try a second operation after father Xiao Kunqing offered to donate 40 per cent of his liver. Dr Dong Chong, head of the transplant unit in Tianjin, warned the second operation would be more difficult than the first, and would carry greater risks, but the parents were determined to go ahead. The operation began at 8am on Thursday April 16th, with Mr Kunqing moved to the recovery room at around 4pm after having his liver removed. By 7.30pm Xiao Zhengti’s operation was successfully completed, and he was also moved to recovery. The operation is believed to be the first ever in China where two parents have donated the same organ in order to save their child. Surgeons now say that the operation, which took five hours to complete, was a complete success and they expect Xiao to be home within weeks when he can begin living a normal life . Medics say the operation is believe to be the first in China where two parents have donated the same organ in order to save their child . Dr Dong Chong, head of the transplant unit in Tianjin City, where the operation took place, said he expects Xiao to be home in three weeks and to lead a full and active life . Dr Dong told reporters 'The operation was extremely successful and went according to plan. 'We used microscopes for the intricate operation which normally would have taken just 2 hours but this one took 5. However it was very successful.' He added that he expects Xiao Zhengti to make a full recovery and leave hospital in around 3 weeks to enjoy a happy and active life.","Xiao Zhengti, five, born with  liver condition which caused organ to swell .

"There were 72 unprovoked shark attacks around the world last year, with three people killed in Australia and South Africa. According to the International Shark Attack File, which gathers statistics on interactions between the mammals and humans,the number of worldwide unprovoked shark attacks has grown at a steady pace since 1900, with each decade having more attacks than the previous. However, despite the worrying statistics, only a minority of sharks are any danger to humans, with Great White, Bull and Tiger sharks accounting for the vast majority of attacks. Scroll down for video . The great white shark is the most deadly of its kind, yet there by following rules and recommendations, it's unlikely you will ever meet one . Thirteen-year-old Elio Canestri, who was attacked and killed while surfing off the coast of Reunion a week ago, was killed by an eight-foot bull shark. The young teen was reported to be surfing in an area deemed out of bounds by officials due to the high risk of sharks. Reunion has recorded seven fatal shark attacks in the past five years, more per capita than anywhere else in the world. The International Shark Attack File reports that there were 52 shark attacks in US waters in 2014, compared to 29 in 2015. Australia's 11 attacks was lower than its 12.5 attacks per year average over the past ten years (2004-2013) and the two fatalities were in line with its 1.5 yearly average over the same time period. So are there any simple precautions that can be taken to avoid a shark attack? And what should you do if you come into contact with one? Bright swim gear which contrasts strongly with skin colour can attracts sharks . Don't look like a fish . Even if you think you're in a safe area of water, a rogue shark attack can never be ruled out. Experts warn swimmers not to wear any jewellery or items that reflect the light. As far as sharks are concerned, that flash of light could easily be the sun reflecting off fish scales. This is particularly important if swimming in choppy and unclear conditions which can make it harder for a shark to distinguish between swimmers and prey. Even brightly coloured clothing can cause trouble, as sharks see in black and white and use contrast to distinguish colour, meaning they will pick up the difference between skin and a bright swimsuit. The same can be said for sunburn, causing colour differentiation on skin. Equally, surfers can easily be confused for seals. Lounging on a surfboard in a wetsuit can give the outline of a seal from a shark's point of view. While this is hard to avoid, try surfing in a group and stay alert to your surroundings at all times. Going on a cage dive is the best and safest way of encountering a shark . Use your common sense . It may sound ridiculously obvious, but when people want to experience the ultimate experience on the waves, common sense goes out the window. Put simply, don't swim with shark food. Where there are fish, there could be sharks and sharks eat fish. By swimming or surfing near fishing boats  or areas with sea birds feeding, you're at increased risk of encountering a shark. George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, told MSNBC: 'It really comes down to common sense. We do a pretty good job here in the United States as last year there were no fatalities from shark attacks. 'What we need to do is avoid where sharks are at present.' Try to avoid swimming or surfing near the exits of sewage pipes, the waste released will attract fish, which in turn will attract their predators. It can seem a good idea to take a romantic swim at sunset, but it is actually harder for sharks to spot the difference between humans and prey in darker conditions . Swim in good weather - and during the day . It is easy to think that evening swim from the beach is a romantic way to enjoy your surroundings undisturbed, but dark conditions make it hard for sharks to distinguish swimmers form their prey. The same can be said for murky water and foggy weather. These conditions impair a shark's vision and also a swimmer's making it harder for them to observe their surroundings and stay safe. 1. Always swim in a group. Sharks most often attack lone individuals. 2. Don't wander too far from shore. Doing so isolates you and places you away from assistance. 3. Avoid the water at night, dawn, or dusk. Many sharks are most active at these times and are better able to find you than you are to see them. 4. Don't enter the water if bleeding. Sharks can smell and taste blood, and trace it back to its source. 5. Don't wear shiny jewellery. The reflected light looks like shining fish scales. AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU COME INTO CONTACT WITH A SHARK... If attacked by a shark, the general rule is 'Do whatever it takes to get away!' Some people have successfully chosen to be aggressive, others passive. Some yelled underwater, others blew bubbles. Source: Florida Museum of Natural History . Know where is safe to swim . In countries where shark attacks are frequent, officials should clearly mark areas that are deemed 'safe to swim/surf' and those that are not. Always pay heed to local knowledge, particularly on beaches in the US, Australia and South Africa, where the majority of attacks happened in 2014. Keep in mind that single attacks also happened in Reunion, Japan, Spain, New Zealand, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and the Galapagos Islands. When swimming in open water, avoid areas such as sand shelves and areas between sand bars, where the ground drops away into much deeper water, sharks often frequent these areas. Likewise, channels and river mouths are other areas than can be rich with food for sharks, just like sewage waste pipes, so stay away. It is important for swimmers and surfers to be clued on where is safe to take to the water (file photo) Swim in groups . Swim and surf with friends. It's common sense for in case something goes wrong there is someone there to help, but also sharks aren't as likely to attack a group. To this end, in the unfortunate situation where you come face to face with a shark (see below), the group can work together to enact defensive situations. Going back to back with other divers mean you can keep your eyes on the challenge from all directions and prepare to fight. Use a shark repellent . If you are a regular surfer, meaning you're often in open water in low light and sometimes alone, it can pay off to use a shark repellent. Locals in Hawaii are increasingly placing their trust in technologies that claim to keep the predators away by sending an electric pulse through the water. One particular device, known as the Electronic Shark Defence System (ESDS), has enjoyed massive popularity on the islands. Users strap the devices to their ankles, wetsuits or surfboards. Some are about the size of an oversized watch, others the size of a wallet. They range in price from £249 ($399) to £390 ($649). Researcher Christine Ambrosino told Discovery news the pulse is an effective way to stopping a shark in its tracks. She said: 'As the shark swims toward it, it's like punching them in the face with a cattle prod.' It is important to swim in groups or with one other person to help look out for threats and also put off sharks from attacking . A shark begins to circle, what should you do? There are lots of myths around what you should you if you are unlucky enough to come into contact with a shark. Sharks are said to bite out of simple curiosity; they are known to bite anything that bobs on water just to see what it tastes like. National Geographic rubbish two of the suggested things you should do to ward off an attack; splashing violently and playing dead are no-nos. Splashing violently will only go to attract more sharks towards you, while playing dead leads to resulting in just that - a limp body will simply encourage the shark to tuck in. Instead you should try and attack its soft spots, those being the eyes and gills. George Burgess from the International Shark Attack File said: 'I advise to be as aggressively defensive as you are able. 'Playing dead' does not work. Pound the shark in any way possible. Try to claw at the eyes and gill openings, two very sensitive areas.' There were only three fatalities record from unprovoked shark attacks in 2014, two in Australia and one in South Africa. The International Shark Attack File investigated 130 incidents of alleged shark-human interaction occurring worldwide in 2014. Upon review, 72 of these incidents represented confirmed cases of unprovoked shark attacks on humans. Of the 72 incidents of unprovoked shark attacks around the world last year, there were three fatalities . The 58 incidents not accorded unprovoked status in 2014 included 33 provoked attacks, nine interactions involving a shark biting a motorized or non-motorized vessel ('boat attack'), four incidents regarded as not involving a shark ('doubtful'), one case involving sinking ships or downed aircraft ('air-sea disaster'), two incidents involving post-mortem bites ('scavenge'), and nine cases in which data is unavailable to determine if an unprovoked shark attack occurred ('insufficient evidence'). The 2014 yearly total of 72 unprovoked attacks was lower than the 75 recorded in 2013 and represents the lowest global total since 68 in 2009. However, the number of worldwide unprovoked shark attacks has grown at a steady pace since 1900, with each decade having more attacks than the previous .

"A man has been pressured into resigning from his role as a women's officer at a university student union after public pressure and an online petition demanded that he step down from the position. James Ritchie was voted into the job at the Tasmanian University Union with a clear majority over a female candidate more than three weeks ago. Despite his qualifications for the role and no gender specified in the job description, the reaction to a male being offered the position caused huge opposition which left Mr Ritchie feeling that the negativity impacted on him being able to do the job to the best of his ability. James Ritchie was forced to resign from his role as women's officer for the Tasmanian University Union after public pressure and an online petition opposed the decision to employ a male for the job . 'There has been a lot of public pressure for me to resign, a lot of interest groups that want me to resign,' Mr Ritchie told ABC radio. 'But the main thing for me was I felt my ability to be effective in the role was now diminished and that's the most fundamental thing.' The university's Women's Collective had launched a petition on the website change.org to have Mr Ritchie removed from his role in the TUU. The petition said Mr Ritchie 'was elected to the role of women's officer unconstitutionally and unethically and yet the TUU staff refuses to disqualify his candidacy'. However, TUU guidelines did not state a preferred gender for the role, saying only that 'an interest in higher education and student issues would be advantageous'. The university's student union has now introduced a requirement that candidates sign a statutory declaration confirming they identify as female . The state's anti-discrimination commissioner, Robin Banks, also said there was no legal reason why a man could not occupy the role of women's officer. 'In my opinion, it's irrelevant if (the position is) held by a female or a male. In this election I believe I was the best person for the role,' Mr Ritchie said. 'If you can't get a society where women feel they can approach men about a number of issues and men feel they can approach women about a number of issues, how do you really make progress?' The student union has now introduced a requirement that candidates sign a statutory declaration confirming they identify as female.","James Ritchie was voted into the job at the Tasmanian University Union with a clear majority over a female candidate more than three weeks ago .

"A King Charles Spaniel suffered three degree burns from a pad used to keep him warm during a scan which vets had heated up in a microwave. Twelve-year-old Alfie underwent a general anaesthetic for an MRI scan at the Animal Health Trust clinic in Newmarket, Suffolk. The pet, who is also completely deaf, had the scan, last month after his owner Lynne Edwards from Huntington in Cambridgeshire, noticed a lump behind his ear. Alfie's owner Lynne Edwards, said she only realised something was wrong with the pet when he started to refuse food and found puss oozing from his back . But when Alfie returned from the clinic she realised something was wrong when he started refusing food and found puss oozing from his back. She then took him to a local vet, where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in his back. Ms Edwards, 64, then discovered that a pad used to keep her dog warm while he had the scan got too hot after it was heated in a microwave. She said: 'I just don't understand how it could have been taken from the microwave and then put directly onto Alfie without it being noticed how hot it was. King Charles Spaniel Alfie, who suffered three degree burns after vets place a heat pad on his back that had been warmed in a microwave . 'They have told me that they always warm them up in microwave but after what happened they have promised to change their practice. 'I am glad that they’ve now said they will do that but it took nearly a week for them to stop the practice.' Alfie is now on medication while his wounds heal, but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns. Ms Edwards, an interfaith minister, is now calling on all vets to ensure they heat up the pads correctly and monitor them adequately. The Animal Health Trust confirmed their vets are now using an incubator to heat the pads. A spokesman said: 'We pioneered the use of MRI in animals back in the 1990s and since then we have scanned more than 20,000 animals. 'In the last five years, around 3,000 of these patients would have had heat pads to maintain their body temperature. 'To the best of our knowledge, we have never seen anything like this before in any of the AHT’s patients. 'We understand how upsetting this situation must be for Lynne Edwards and her family, and have carried out a full investigation. 'We have reviewed, and are updating, our Standard Operating Procedure for the use of heat pads. 'We are also standardising the way in which all heat pads are heated at the AHT.'

"Police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place – despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker. Last night the victim, Mike Lane, 40, who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes, condemned the decision by police as ‘pathetic’. He said: ‘They could have made more effort. Everyone is very disappointed. I’ve been told that unless further evidence comes forward, the attackers are not likely to be found. We find it pathetic.’ Attack: Mike Lane,40, who is joint master of the Tedworth Hunt,  on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs . A video of the incident and a dossier of evidence, including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers, was given to Wiltshire Police after the assault. The attack at Everleigh, near Amesbury, took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent, rather than a fox. During the incident, Mr Lane, who is joint master of the Tedworth Hunt, was sent flying to the ground, before being kicked in the head. He was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen. Since the attack he has suffered memory loss. The face of the thug who kicked Mr Lane was captured on video. Following the attack, Wiltshire Police issued the suspect’s photograph, although he has not been identified. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Lane said: ‘I’ve been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence. It’s angered us because we gave them evidence. I’m beginning to lose my trust in the police.’ Wiltshire Police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information, but their failure to identify, charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country. This is the face of the main suspect . On the day of the attack, January 24, about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent. Mr Lane said: ‘I noticed they parked about 250 yards away. Then five came towards us. They were looking for trouble – it was a hardcore element we’d not seen before. ‘They were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face. A scuffle broke out and I slipped and one started kicking me in the head, stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth. I was knocked out for a few minutes. Then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar.’ Mr Lane, who has paid £500 for dental treatment since the attack, added: ‘I feel let down and think the police could have done more.’ Karen Fieldsend, 42, who made the call to police, is furious that the case has been dropped. ‘It’s disgraceful,’ she said. ‘If you had people assaulted in a city centre, something would be done, but in the countryside people forget about it.’ James Cameron, 53, vice-chairman of the Tedworth Hunt, added: ‘Their decision is disappointing, but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings.’ The Countryside Alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice. Last night a spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: ‘We have been unable to move the inquiry further forward. At this stage the case has been recorded as undetected, however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened.’","Mike Lane was beaten by masked protesters armed with iron bars on ropes .

"The time of their lives has turned into the holiday from hell for up to 2500 passengers stranded on a cruise ship, the Carnival Spirit, outside Sydney Harbour and riding a constant flow of smashing waves of more than nine metres. They have been at the mercy of the wild seas since last night, as storms batter the east coast. The massive swell, seen from video images taken from on-board by stranded travellers, revealing just how treacherous and stomach churning the conditions are, out there. One has told the Daily Telegraph that 'there was a large wave that hit at 7.30 last night that tore one of the doors off causing a whole lot of water to come flooding through the deck'. 'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off. 'One crew member has been working here for 10 years and he reckons it’s the roughest he’s seen.'

The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged outside Sydney Harbour this morning. Due to dock at 7:15 the ship is currently sitting off Sydney Heads. The ship has suffered damage in wild weather conditions off the NSW coast. The hand railing and pedestal lighting has been damaged while a cover over the satellite system (above) has also been damaged and removed for safety reasons . The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas .

Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday and have continued unabated, amid reports that there has been some damage. 'High winds have caused minor damage to some external features such as an equipment cover and some partitioning, while heavy rains have dampened some doorway carpets,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'This damage is superficial and has not affected the ship’s operation in any way. Guests and crew are safe and the Captain is ensuring guests are as comfortable as possible.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore and more passengers have been recounting their wild ride. 'It’s not pleasant, it’s been like this all night,' one woman told ABC radio. 'I don’t think many people got much sleep.' Carnival Cruise Lines officials confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that Carnival Spirit was scheduled to arrive 'early this morning' but was unable to do so because of the rough seas. 'The scheduled Sydney arrival of Carnival Cruise Lines’ Carnival Spirit has been delayed due to severe weather which has led to the closure of Sydney port and prevented the Harbour Pilot from boarding the ship,' the statement said. 'The ship is now waiting off the Sydney coast line until the port is re-opened.' And nothing can be done until conditions ease to allow the regulatory process to take place. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port,' Carnival Cruise Lines stated further.

'For guests scheduled to depart for the South Pacific on S512, the Captain is working on a revised 7-day itinerary departing tomorrow, weather permitting. The revised itinerary will visit Isle of Pines and Noumea, but not the originally scheduled port of Mare.'

"The federal government is looking to take a hard line with parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. Under ground breaking reforms, Social Services Minister Scott Morrison will reportedly scrap a provision that allows parents who don't vaccinate their children to claim welfare benefits, including $726 from Family Tax Benefit A, $7,500-a-year from childcare rebate and $200-a-week from the childcare benefit scheme. Scroll down for video . The government are about to annouce reforms that will strip parents of welfare benefits if they don't immunise their kids . Newscorp reported that Prime Minister Tony Abbott will announce the reforms alongside Mr Morrison on Sunday with the changes coming into full effect in January 2016. The controversial change could put millions of dollars back into the federal government's pocket. The way the system works now, children must be immunised to access childcare payments, however,  a 'contentious loop hole' means parents can avoid loosing their benefits by simply signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons. Mr Morrison recently said the rules around welfare payments need to be 'tightened' and that while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society, it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money. 'We've got to think about the health and well-being of all the other children that are put at risk, and it's their health that also matters' 'We've got to think about the health and well-being of all the other children that are put at risk, and it's their health that also matters,' he said. 'And in fact, you know, those parents have taken decisions to immunise their children, and that's obviously the sensible thing to do. We're a free country, and we're for free society, but that doesn't mean you get to take taxpayers' money if you don't want to go along with the rules.' While doctors and pro-vaccination groups are tipped to welcome the reforms as a way to increase the number of children being vaccinated, some immunisation experts are worried the move won't bolster immunisation rates. Currently around 39,000 children under the age of seven are not vaccinated. Currently around 39,000 Australian children under the age of seven are not vaccinated putting them at risk of catching severe diseases . Labor leader Bill Shorten's support will be vital to get the changes through the Senate however he has already indicated there will be bipartisan support for the harsh provisions. He reportedly wrote to the Prime Minister on Friday expressing his concerns over the loophole. Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . These reforms come amid rising concerns about whooping cough outbreaks that have devastated small communities where many children remain unvaccinated. The heartbroken parents of a beautiful four-week-old baby boy who died after contracting whooping cough have appealed to other parents to make sure they get themselves and their children immunised against the deadly disease. Greg and Catherine Hughes, from Perth, set up a Facebook page to honour their son Riley Hughes after he 'passed away peacefully in the arms of his mummy and daddy' at 2pm on March 17, aged just 32 days. 'Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,' Riley's dad Greg wrote on the Facebook page Light for Riley. The newborn, born on February 13, died in Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital as a result of pneumonia-based complications arising from whooping cough. Whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months, four months and six months of age. Booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years. The reforms come amid rising concerns about whooping cough outbreaks that have devastated small communities where many children remain unvaccinated . Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. The Department of Health said vaccinations protect more than 95 per cent of children from measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, polio and Hib, given they finish their courses. 'One dose of meningococcal C vaccine at 12 months protects over 90 per cent of children. Three doses of whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine protects about 85 per cent of children who have been immunised, and will reduce the severity of the disease in the other 15 per cent if they do catch whooping cough.'","The government will announce radical immunisation reforms on Sunday .

"The Long Island mother and daughter found safe and well in New York City's Upper West Side neighbourhood after going missing last month say they had no idea that people were looking for them. Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily, 14, were recognized by the front desk manager of the hotel they were staying at on Sunday, it was reported. They were found at 3am by NYPD officers and are in good health, officials said. Scroll down for video . Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were visiting Manhattan when they disappeared. They have now been found safe and well . Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . Police questioned mother and daughter and now consider the case closed after releasing them. Iona called her mother at 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning to tell her she was ok. 'I'm thankful my daughter is safe. She's had a lot of pressure,' Iona's mother, Diana Malcolmson, told the New York Daily News. 'She just wanted to get away.' Iona claimed she had no idea friends and family members were worried about her sudden disappearance, her mother said. 'She hadn't listened to the news. She didn't know she was causing all this trouble,' Malcolmson said. Iona is in the midst of a nasty battle over the will of her husband, George Costello Sr., 63, who died of a heart attack as he was working on a Southampton barge on Dec. 28, 2012. News of Iona's reappearance comes after more details emerged about the colorful background of her late husband's family, who were in dispute with her over the contents of Mr Costello's will. It was revealed that the mother's stepson has a long criminal record and was jailed again just days after she disappeared, a report suggests. George Costello Jr is currently in jail in Florida on apparently unrelated charges and has been described by relatives as a 'mixed-up' kid.' British-born Mrs Costello and Emily were visiting Manhattan when they went missing on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan, but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Iona's husband died in 2012 from a heart attack, and she is believed to have been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. The New York Daily News reported Iona's stepson Costello Jr, 45, was visiting Hamptons Bay, New York, at the time, and relatives said he has never got on with the family. He has a long history of drug arrests and is currently in Palm Beach Detention Center following an arrest for a 'domestic dispute' when he returned to Florida. His fiance, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the Daily News  it was a 'weird coincidence', but insists she was with him the whole time. Speaking from the prison, he told the newspaper he was visiting his Hampton Bay home at the time and flew home on April 1, two days after the pair went missing. George Jr, who has at least 10 arrests to his name, according to court records, says he didn't have a close relationship with Iona. He said the last time the pair spoke was at his father and her husband's funeral. Police reportedly told Iona's mother there is surveillance video of them leaving a parking garage laughing . Iona's brother-in-law John Costello (right), is facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. Costello's stepson, George Costello Jr (left), 45,  has a long history of drug arrests (mugshot from April) 'She's a hardworking lady who loves her horses and takes care of them really well. She's a good mother,' he told the Daily News. Iona's mother, Diana Malcomson, had also insisted George Jr wouldn't want to harm the pair, but said he was a 'mixed-up kid'. Her brother-in-law is also facing a criminal case. John Costello is  facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. They were reported missing by relatives of the 'quiet Irish family', who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork. Iona, who was her late husband George's third wife and inherited his entire estate along with her daughter, had been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. 'She can't sell anything. She can't do anything because everything is in court,' an unidentified relative told the New York Daily News. 'I don't know if she's having a nervous breakdown. I don't know if somebody has kidnapped them,' the unidentified family member said of the Costellos' long absence from their home and farm. Costello's adult children have argued that the will granting the estate to Iona was improperly executed, according to Novick Law Group. A Long Island court sided with the adult children last year, and Iona Costello is appealing. Amanda Hurwitz, one of George's daughters who now lives in Connecticut, refused to comment to Daily Mail Online on the report or her stepmother's disappearance. The widow's trip into New York was originally only supposed to last for several days. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm said earlier it was strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online  his force did not suspect foul play. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones had gone straight to voicemail. Mrs Costello's family have lived in both the UK and the US, but she is British by birth. Her mother Diana and late father Euan, a stockbroker, lived in Stow in the Wold, Gloucestershire before setting sail for North America in 1958 aboard the Liberte cruise ship. Their plan was to live in Canada but they instead moved to Long Island. The couple returned to the UK at some point and records indicate that Mrs Costello was born in Marylebone in Central London, as was her brother Andrew. Mrs Costello's aunt Gwendoline Preston married Lord William Wynne-Jones, a renowned chemist and former vice-chancellor of Newcastle University.","Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily went missing on March 30 .

"A young cancer sufferer who proposed to his girlfriend hoping surgery would save his life is set to marry in hospital after being told he's too ill for the operation and has just weeks to live. Jack Jordan, 23, proposed to his girlfriend Laura Cant last Christmas from his hospital bed while suffering from leukaemia. The pair planned to wed after a bone marrow transplant, which they hoped would have given them a bright future together. Jack Jordan and his girlfriend Laura Cant, who are to marry tomorrow in hospital after being told he had just weeks to live . However, last week Mr Jordan was given the news that he was too ill to undergo the transplant and has just weeks to live. The couple have now quickly moved the wedding forward and are now set to become the first to marry in  a ceremony at Torbay Hospital's chapel. Miss Cant, 24, of Brixham, Devon, said: “No amount of drugs or treatment has worked for my Jack and he has now been given just a few weeks to live. 'We just want to be married. Jack didn’t want to leave until he was any less than my husband. 'We have the nurses crying and everything. As devastating as this is to both our families, we are all planning on giving Jack the best day of his life. 'He is still my Jack. You wouldn't think anything was wrong except he is very tired. 'He sleeps all the time. In a very, very odd kind of way Jack was relieved when he was told the news last Friday because he doesn't have to fight anymore. Mr Jordan had hoped to undergo a bone marrow transplant to prolong his life but was given the news last week that he was too ill for the surgery . Mr Jordan posted a picture on Facebook of his girlfriend wearing her engagement ring after proposing at Christmas . 'He is absolutely exhausted. I am spending every day and every night in hospital with him. 'I feel very numb. Jack is my strength. He is keeping me going. We are want makes us strong.' The hospital chapel holds about 80 people and will be full of family and close friends. Leukaemia affects a person's white blood cells. White blood cells are the important infection-fighting part of the immune system, made in your bone marrow. Patients with leukaemia produce an abnormal number of immature white blood cells which 'clog up' their bone marrow. This stops bone marrow making other blood cells, which are vital for a balanced immune system and healthy blood. Acute leukaemia comes on suddenly, progesses quickly and needs to be treated urgently. Chronic leukaemia develops more slowly, over months or years. Common treatments for leukaemia include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a bone marrow transplant. It is predicted that 48% of men and 44% of women will survive the disease for ten years or more. Miss Cant added: 'We have been told it is the first wedding that anybody can remember at the hospital chapel.' Mr Jordan had planned the proposal during one of his girlfriend's daily visits to the hospital. She added: 'It could have been in Paris. It was just Jack and me in our own little world. 'When I came in I thought it was odd because he had a new shirt on and shoes on. He was pottering and restless and nervous. 'He told me to sit down and he fumbled around on the other chair. 'As soon as he took the ring box out I burst into tears. He did it properly and got down on one knee even though it hurt. 'He said ""I want you to be my wife. Will you marry me?"" I was shaking so hard. Now I wake up every day still head over heels.' Mr Jordan, who has had a two-year battle with cancer, wrote on Facebook after proposing: 'I’m so proud to call you my fiance Laura. 'You have made my life so much better since you and Lilly came into it. I love you both with all my heart x.' The couple were in the same school year at Paignton Community College and met again around two years later after Laura saw him working in a nearby shop. They got together just after Valentine’s Day last year. She explained: 'As soon as I saw him in the shop I thought ‘oh my god you’ve blossomed since school’. Then I used to find reasons to go down there every day. The couple were in the same school year at Paignton Community College but only started a relationship last year . 'I went in one day and they had a collection bucket for Jack who was ill in hospital. I ran home and private messaged him on Facebook.' Miss Cant was so concerned she decided to make the 120 mile journey to Jack’s hospital in Bristol to surprise him. She said: 'He had no idea how much I liked him. 'It’s not really been an ordinary relationship since day one. 'It’s been hospital appointments and everything we do depends on his blood count.'","Jack Jordan proposed to girlfriend Laura Cant while suffering leukaemia .

"The parents of Elijah Cook were worried he may be born deaf. Hearing problems had run strongly through the genetics of Ahavah and Jason Cook, with both their mothers and fathers deaf. But after the baby boy was confirmed to be profoundly deaf in his left ear and only able to hear 75 decibels in his right, the couple from Andova, Minnesota, were afforded something neither of their parents were. Last month, they were able to experience the moment their son was able to hear for the first time, thanks to a pair of specially-fitted hearing aids. Amazing moment: Elijah Cook was last month fitted with hearing aids that allowed him to properly hear the voice of his mother, Ahavah Cook, for the first time . All smiles: Tests confirmed he was profoundly death in his left ear and only able to hear 75 decibels in his right, but doctors decided to fit him with hearing aids as soon as possible . What's that noise?: Elijah will now undergone a more serious set of tests in a few months, at about seven-months-old, to determine what more can be done about his hearing . Elijah failed his first hearing test just 12 hours after being born in Coon Rapids on January 2. 'When Elijah came back (from the first test), we were expecting good news because we have almost a dozen nieces and nephews that have no hearing issues,' Mrs Cook wrote on the Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota website. Elijah went on to fail three more tests. Then on March 5, at nine-weeks-old, he was fitting with the hearing aids, and the amazing moment was caught on video. 'The first time I saw him blink, I had a lot of emotions,' Mrs Cook said. 'I was trying really hard not to cry. 'I didn't want him to see me cry. I was trying hard to keep it together and just talk to him.' Family: Ahavah and Jason Cook are pictured here with little Elijah and their eldest, daughter Evelyn, 7 . Progress: The mothers and fathers of both Ahavah and Jason Cook were all deaf, so the couple were expecting hearing problems following the birth of their son, Elijah (right) Since then, Elijah has been cooing, smiling and responding to the sounds made by his family, including big sister Evelyn, 7. 'The cooing is the big thing,' Mr Cook said. 'He wasn't very talkative, but ever since he was fitted for his hearing aids he's cooing more, he pays more attention.' Because he is so young, doctors will wait a until Elijah is about seven months old to make further deductions about his hearing. Until then, his parents are happy with the progress and say their experience growing up in deaf families has well-equipped them for the road ahead. The touching family moment was first uploaded to YouTube.

"Britain's public schools are now the very image of tradition but behind their establishment image lies a history of rebellion and revolution. The hidden story of some of the country’s most prestigious and best-known public schools -including Eton – is one of barricades and mutinies so fierce they nearly proved the institutions’ undoing. A new book by former education journalist David Turner, The Old Boys, lays bare the little-known history. Scroll down for video . Eton's famous wall game: The new book was inspired by David Cameron's comparison to Flashman in Tom Brown's School Days . Winchester College experienced six full-scale rebellion in the 18th and 19th Centuries - one over beer rations . Years of research in the schools’ archives has shed light on tales of master’s held at sword-point, mass walkouts and battles so intense they required the intervention of a militia,  the Daily Telegraph reported. There are even records of one gunpowder plot. Mr Turner was inspired to write the book after hearing David Cameron, a former Eton College student, compared to the fictional bully Flashman from Tom Brown’s School Days. A student at Winchester practices fencing: Students used swords, axes and gunpowder in their rebellions . Eddie Redmayne (left) and Benedict Cumberbatch (right) both attended public school, which Mr Turner says is now entering its golden age . Turner writes that he wanted to discover whether or not public schools had plumbed the depths described in the Thomas Hughes novels. After making his discoveries he said if they have not improved, Britain is in serious trouble. From the 18th Century onwards there were a series of full-scale rebellions at the country’s public schools the new book reveals. The frequent violence and the outmoded classics-based education at the schools nearly undid them. Turner explains it was predominantly the rise of the pushy parent at the end of 19th Century which brought the institutions to heel. Now, he says, they do more good than harm in the modern era. George Orwell (left) and Ropert Walpole (right), the first British Prime Minister, are often cited as famous examples of the success of the public school system. Walpole attended Eton during the time of unrest . Eton College as it is now: Mr Turner says in the modern era the schools do more good than harm . In fact Turner’s book places the golden age of the Public School not in the distant past, as might be expected, but in the present day, the Financial Times reports. The Old Boys, Mr Turner says, shows the private school system’s ability to adapt and evolve throughout the ages with public school educated celebrities now in the ascendance. Over a third of the UK’s gold medal winners attended fee-paying schools and Eddie Remayne and Benedict Cumberbatch of Eton and Harrow went head to head this year at the Oscars. The current Prime Minister and future King: Both David Cameron and Prince William went to Eton College . A number of modern days figures are name checked in the book including Mumford and Sons from King’s College with David Cameron providing inspiration for the text. However some individuals' lesser known for their private school background such as UKIP party leader Nigel Farage, who attended Dulwhich College, also pop up. The old stalwarts of public school achievement also feature – the country’s first Prime Minister Robert Walpole and the seven public schoolboys in his cabinet as well as Greorge Orwell, who also attended Eton. The Old Boys is now available to buy. Malborough College's 1851 rebellion coincided with Guy Fawkes Night and began with an explosion . At Winchester in 1710, scholars at mutinied over their beer rations. Just before the turn of the century, two decades earlier, students at Manchester Grammar School were supplied by local people with firearms and and food as they embarked upon a violent two-week standoff with their teachers. The disagreement began over the length of the Christmas holidays. In 1797 pupils at Rugby School took staff prisoner at sword-point and a local militia had to be raised to end the insurrection. In 1818 during the ‘great rebellion’ at Winchester the school’s overall head was held hostage by boys armed with axes. In 1851 a mutiny was timed at Malborough College to coincide with Guy Fawkes Night. It began with an explosion from a barrel of gunpowder. Over the period Eton and Winchester both suffered six rebellions each with five at Rugby School.","Underneath the polished manners lies a history of violence and rebellion .

"The daughters of Mary Kay Letourneau and her former student-turned husband, Vili Fualaau, are now older than their father was when, at age 12, he started an affair with his teacher. On the eve of the infamous couple's 10-year wedding anniversary, Letourneau, Fualaau and their two children, 17-year-old Audrey and 16-year-old Georgia, sat down for an exclusive interview with Barbara Walters on 20/20, which will air on ABC Friday at 10pm. Letourneau, then a 34-year-old married mother of four, pleaded guilty to child rape for her illicit affair with her sixth-grade student, which resulted in two pregnancies. Audrey Fualaau was born while her mother was out on probation in 1998. Her 16-year-old sister, Georgia, was welcomed into the world behind bars after the disgraced teacher was re-arrested and sent back to prison for having another sexual encounter with her former student. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Mary Kay Letourneau, Vili Fualaau, and their two daughters, Audrey and Georgia, sat down for an interview with Barbara Walters on the eve of the couple's 10-year wedding anniversary . Speaking out: The interview will air on 20/20 on Friday - nearly 20 years after Letourneau's arrest for the relationship with her former student . Modern family: Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau's 17-year-old daughter, Audrey (right), was born while her mother was out on probation. Her 16-year-old sister, Georgia (left), was born behind bars . Both girls attend school and sing in a choir in the same district in Seattle where their mother had once taught. Audrey graduates high school in June and is set to start college next fall, while Georgia is currently a sophomore. In an interview with Walters, the Fualaau sisters said their parents have told them how they met, but they were not taken aback by the scandalous circumstances surrounding their mom and dad's relationship. 'There was never a sit-down chat, 'Now is the time we're going to talk to our children about this,' Mary said. 'They seemed to already know ... because they grew up with it. ... There's just never been a 'Wow, we better explain.' Letourneu's 31-year-old husband also opened up about the challenges of building a life together and raising two children. 'I don't think there's ever a full 10 good years of marriage,' Fualaau told Walters. 'You have your ups and downs in marriages. But, you know, what matters is how you pull through all the bad times.' The 31-year-old said that being a young father was difficult. Fualaau, pictured here with his eldest daughter, said that raising two girls as a teenager with help or support was difficult . Goofing around: Audrey, a high school senior, is pictured pulling funny faces at the 20/20 studio during the taping of the Barbara Walters interview . 'I don't feel like I had the right support or the right help behind me,' he said. 'From my family, from anyone in general. I mean, my friends couldn't help me because they had no idea what, what it was like to be a parent, I mean, because we were all 14, 15.' The former Seattle teacher shot to infamy after starting a relationship with Fualaau when he was a 12-year-old sixth-grade student and falling pregnant with his child when he was just 13. After she served a seven-year prison term for the relationship, they married and now have two children together. She also has four children from a previous marriage. Their two daughters, Audrey and Georgia, who are now both teenagers, will join their parents for the interview, ABC News said. While speaking with Walters, Letourneau will discuss her plans to get her status as a registered sex offender lifted, as well as her hopes to teach again one day. She will also talk out about how they make their marriage work despite the 21-year age gap, ABC News reported. Fualaau will discuss his struggle with alcoholism and depression and how he believes he was failed by the system as a minor. After his teacher was convicted, his family filed a lawsuit against the police department and the school district for failing to protect him from sexual exploitation. No damages were awarded. Relationship: The duo first met when Fualaau (pictured in 1998) was in second grade and went on to have a sexual relationship when he was 12 and Letourneau (right in a 1996 school photo) was his teacher . In court: She is pictured listening to testimony in 1998; she went to prison for seven and a half years . Proud: She is pictured showing off her pregnancy bump in a photo released in 1998. She fell pregnant with their first daughter before she was arrested and with their second after she was released . Reunited: Letourneau is pictured with her daughter Audrey during a prison visit in 2003 . The pair originally met when he was in her second grade class and then she taught him again in sixth grade in 1996. As she taught him, their relationship turned sexual and a friend of her husband's ultimately went to the police with his suspicions. But before she was arrested, she fell pregnant with the boy's child and gave birth to his first daughter, Audrey, while she was on bail in May 1997 while waiting for the outcome of her trial. She was sentenced to six months in county jail - although three were suspended - and was ordered to have no contact with the boy. But weeks after he release, she was found having sexual relations with him in her car and fell pregnant with their second daughter. Family: She was married and had four children before the affair. She is pictured, right, with one of her sons . Back together: The couple is pictured during a photo shoot at their Normandy Park, Washington home in 2006. She was released from jail in 2004 and they got married a year later . At home: The couple is pictured with their daughters as they drive near their home near Seattle in 2005 . Letourneau gave birth to the baby while she was in jail after being sentenced to an additional seven-and-a-half years behind bars. She was released from jail in August 2004 and Fualaau, who was then 21, asked the court to have the no-contact order overturned, which it was. The couple got married a year later at a Washington winery - when she was 43 and he was 22. They have been together ever since. While some might compare this story to so many other female teachers in under age sex scandals, Letourneau's long-time family friend, photographer Mark Greenberg, tells the Daily News they've got it all wrong. 'I know there are people out there who find it to be nothing other than this woman broke the law and she's a rapist, and yet there are others who see it as 'love is something that's pure' and here's two people who are enjoying the fruits of that,' he said. Letourneau also made headlines last year after she was booked into Washington's King County Jail for failing to go to court following a 2013 third-degree charge of driving on a suspended license. Going strong: The couple will talk about how they've stayed together despite the 21-year age gap .","Letourneau and Vili Fualaau spoke to Barbara Walters in a 20/20 interview that will air Friday .

Taronga's Asian Elephant herd, including 3300kg Pak Boon and calves Pathi Harn and Tukta, were quick to swoop on the record-breaking pumpkin. 'We're always looking for new foods and enrichment items to challenge and stimulate our extraordinary animals. The adult elephants were no strangers to pumpkins, but keepers were keen to see what they would make of the supersized variety. 'Elephants have many remarkable skills and environmental enrichment is a great way to encourage these skills and arouse their natural curiosity,' said Elephant Keeper, Steve Westnedge. The novelty sized pumpkins displayed at this year's show were served to the Asian Elephants at the popular Sydney zoo . Keepers introduce new foods and enrichment items to challenge and stimulate the extraudinary animals . Taronga's elephants are served a medley of different food items, particularly relishing fibrous palm logs and tough pineapple plant tops. They can eat between 60kg and 100kg in one day. 'When we saw the giant pumpkin in the news, we thought it was a fun opportunity to bring a taste of the Easter Show to Taronga and offer a nutritious and challenging treat to the Zoo's largest animals,' said Steve. The 728 monster, the work of grower Dale Oliver, was the largest pumpkin ever seen in Australasia . The record-holder had enjoyed pride of place at the Great Backyard Pumpkin Challenge in the Flower and Garden Pavilion at the Show, among 50,000 other pieces of fruit and vegetables. The pumpkins would normally be recycled as green waste after the show, but organisers were happy to see them served to some mammoth diners instead.

"Sexy lingerie brand Frederick's of Hollywood has shut down all of its brick-and-mortar locations, now existing exclusively as an e-commerce brand after years of declining sales and struggling to keep up with Victoria's Secret. The Los Angeles-based company has switched to a web-only retail model following the closure of all of its 94 locations, with the brand now encouraging customers to shop online,The Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday. 'We no longer have store locations,' reads the brand's website, which goes on to note that the online store offers the same selection of products. Scroll down for video . New look: Frederick's of Hollywood, which is known for its sexy lingerie (pictured), has closed all of its brick-and-mortar locations . Making it work: The retailer announced on it's website that it 'no longer' has store locations while reminding customers that its 'online store offers the same selection of products' 'As a company, I think they became old and stale,' Ron Friedman, a retail expert at consulting and accounting firm Marcum, told The Los Angeles Times. 'Victoria's Secret has been a home run compared to them.' But Mr Friedman went on to say that Frederick's of Hollywood Group Inc. can still be successful with careful corporate strategy. 'They have to really focus and hire people that really understand the online business,' he noted. Founder Frederick Mellinger opened the pinup-inspired lingerie brand's first store in Los Angeles in 1947 and went on to launch a mail order catalog in the 1960s, later adding sex toys and more risqué attire to the company's offerings. Mr Mellinger, who famously said 'sex appeal is always in style', died in 1990 at the age of 76. A decade later in 2000, his namesake company, which once had pin-up icon Bettie Page modeling its lingerie, declared bankruptcy. After emerging from bankruptcy in 2003, the company went public in 2006. Party's over: The Frederick's of Hollywood store pictured was one of the 94 locations that have been closed .

Two years ago the struggling brand was purchased by a consortium that includes HGI Funding, a subsidiary of New York-based Harbinger Group Inc., and some of its own shareholders. While Frederick's of Hollywood has changed the way it does business, one A-list celebrity has recently been reminiscing about her relationship with the brand. Modern Family star Sofia Vergara, 42, told Vanity Fair that her size 32F breasts and tiny frame make it nearly impossible to find lingerie, so she used to frequently shop at the store when she first got her start. 'My boobs are, like, huge,' she said in the May issue of the magazine. 'My whole life, buying a bra was a nightmare. What I used to do when I moved to LA, I found places like Frederick's of Hollywood that make bras for streetwalkers ... I can't think of the word ... you know... dancers... strippers. Skinny girls with gigantic boobs.' Another fan, 23-year-old Blurred Lines dancer Emily Ratajkowski, who went on to score a plum role in the 2014 thriller Gone Girl, previously modeled for the lingerie retailer.","The Los Angeles, California-based company has shuttered all of its 94 locations after switching to a web-only retail model ."
"A Chinese-born American geologist was deported and returned to his Texas home following his release from prison in China after serving nearly eight years on charges of 'illegally procuring state secrets'. Xue Feng returned to his family in Houston on Friday following his release from Beijing's No. 2 Prison. He served all but ten months of his eight year sentence after getting it reduced for good behavior. Xue Feng returned to his family in Houston, Texas, on Friday following his release from Beijing's No. 2 Prison . The 50-year-old doctor served all but ten months of his eight year sentence at the Chinese prison (pictured) Xue Min (right) waits with daughter Guo Jie (left) for the trial of her brother outside a Chinese court in 2010 . At the time of his release, Xue was the only American citizen serving a sentence in a Chinese prison for the crime of endangering state security, according to the  Dui Hua foundation. The foundation has long advocated on Xue's behalf. Executive director John Kamm said: 'Dui Hua is delighted that Dr Xue has finally been reunited with his family in America after a terrible ordeal,' 'The foundation wishes him every success as he rebuilds his life.' The 50-year-old Xue was detained in November of 2007 and sentenced in 2010 on charges of illegally gathering information on China's oil industry. His case raised questions about whether normal business activities elsewhere might conflict with China's vague state security laws. Supporters also said Xue was physically abused in detention and denied proper legal rights. American diplomats had lobbied hard for Xue's release, saying his alleged crimes didn't warrant the harshness of his sentence. Tong Wei, the lawyer for the jailed American geologist, seen leaving Beijing High People's Court in 2011 . President Obama personally lobbied for Xue's release during a visit to Beijing in November of 2009, the New York Times reported. After a court upheld Xue's conviction in February of 2011, American ambassador Jon Huntsman said: 'This has been a long, difficult and painful ordeal for Xue Feng, but not only for Xue but also for his wife, Nan, and his two kids. 'We ask the Chinese government to consider an immediate humanitarian parole of Xue Feng, thereby allowing him to get back to his family and his way of life.' Xue was born in China and earned a doctorate at the University of Chicago, where he was praised by his advisers for his thoroughness and hard work. After becoming a United States citizen, he returned to his native country to work for US consultancy IHS Energy, now known as IHS Inc. In pronouncing him guilty, the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court said his actions 'endangered our country's national security'. The verdict said Xue received documents on geological conditions of onshore oil wells and a database that gave the coordinates of more than 30,000 oil and gas wells belonging to China National Petroleum Corp. and listed subsidiary PetroChina Ltd.","US citizen Xue Feng returned to his family in Houston, Texas, on Friday .

"Matthew Hall, 25, climbed onto the balconies in of his victims in Manchester's fashionable Northern Quarter district and hid . A fantasist prowler who harassed young women, traumatising them after scaling the walls of trendy apartment blocks where they lived, has been banned from the area nearby for five years. Matthew Hall, 25, climbed onto the balconies in  of his victims in Manchester's fashionable Northern Quarter district and hid, asking when confronted 'am I scaring you?' and 'you're dead sexy - can I come in?' In one case he walked into his victim's bedroom as she slept in the early hours, making off when she switched the light on and saw him. Hall now risks arrest if he enters the area, where each of his terrified victims lived, at any time in the next five years. Jailing him for two years after he admitted two attempted burglaries and one burglary, Judge Martin Rudland said he had 'deliberately targeted vulnerable women' scaling the walls of buildings 'like a cat burglar of old' in a series of 'highly suspicious offences'. Hall stole nothing from the victims. Making the order prohibiting Hall from 'the area known as the Northern Quarter', bordered by Shudehill, Church Street, Dale Street and Newton Street, Judge Martin Rudland said 'we need to protect the occupants of flats.' In the first offence, on June 16, a teenager, who has been left traumatised by her ordeal, spotted Hall hiding behind a clothes maiden on a balcony of a first floor flat at Silver Jubilee Walk, off Oak Street. When she asked him what he was doing, he sat up and 'appeared scared', telling her: 'Don't phone the police, you don't need to be scared of me. I'm just hiding.' He then lied that police were chasing him, the court heard. The victim led him to the front door but a short time later, having returned to her bedroom, saw him again on the balcony. Hall, of Farnborough Road, Miles Platting, has 45 offences on record for dishonesty, violence and breaches . She angrily approached him and he burst into tears, giving her a false name, before climbing down from the balcony. On June 28 a young woman at Vantage Quay, Brewer Street was watching TV at 3am when Hall climbed onto her ground floor balcony. In a ten minute ordeal he twice engaged her in conversation by banging on the window and claiming to have been chased. He told her a false name and repeatedly asked her, 'am I scaring you?', quizzed her about whether she lived alone, and told her she was 'dead sexy', before asking if he could come in. Balconies of the kind Hall scaled in Manchester's Northern Quarter district when terrorising his victims . He has been banned from the fashionable Northern Quarter district (pictured) for the safety of its residents . Police attended after she called officers from behind a locked door, but twenty minutes after they left she spotted him on another balcony.

"Usually a highlight of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia, Alex Perry's name is a notable absence from the schedule in 2015. The designer revealed in February that he would not be presenting a collection at the Sydney event this week, and revealed to Daily Mail Australia on Sunday that he was enjoying 'taking a breather'. Despite this year marking the 20th anniversary of MBFWA, Perry is taking in the fashions from the comfort of the front row, after focusing on his international efforts of late. 'My team and I just need a bit of a breather - we've just finished selling in Paris, and we've had an incredible season over there, so we're busy focusing on international at the moment,' Perry told DMA at the Ellery show on first night of Fashion Week. Scroll down for video . Perry pulls out of presenting: Acclaimed designer Alex Perry opts out of showing at this year's MBFWA . 'We're busy working on Cruise too,' (Perry's popular party dress collection). 'I wouldn’t be standing here talking to you if we were showing on Monday or Tuesday,' he laughs. This is only the second Fashion Week the design powerhouse has missed in two decades. When asked if he will miss the excitement of running his own show, Perry said while he loves it, he's happy to sit back and see it from a new perspective. 'The chances I do get, I love to take in the whole thing, my eyes will be wide open as I sit in the front row,' he says. 'Because I'm not presenting a show I can really look forward to supporting some of my friends like Kym (Ellery) and Johnny (Schembri from By Johnny) they're my two faves  I'm specifically wanting to see.' Fashion favourite: Perry says Kym Ellery (pictured left) is one of his favourite designers showing this week . On Kym Ellery's show, Perry says she had a great cast of models and knew the fashion would be beautiful and all about showcasing shape and new directions. As for what he sees trending this season, Perry said the Australian market is so diverse, anything could happen. 'There are so many different designers with so many styles now, It’s not like it was 50 years ago when skirts are to the knee or something like that, there are so many handwritings, so I think it will all become really apparent after we see them this week.' 'Someone like Kym is so incredibly on point internationally at the moment which is her style, but then Johnny is going to give us some fun, sexy tight stuff.' Fashion flashback: Showing since 1996 , this marks the second time in twenty years Perry won't show . Model moment: Perry with Cheyenne Tozzi (pictured left) who previously starred in Australia's Next Top Model . Perry also believes the Australian market has it's on unique flair, different to fashion internationally that has a more uniform look. 'We definitely have our own signature. I wouldn't say relaxed even though people say that all the time, it’s more we have a different take on fashion. There's a mix of designers that are increadibly accomplished then there are younger designers who take more risks and challenges,' he says. 'And at the same time you can Australian designers anywhere in the world and it stands up in any country you go to and people are intrigued by it when they see girls wearing it.' Taking a break from the runway, Perry now is devoting his time to international enterprises, with a specific focus on the Asian and Middle Eastern market. Front row fashionistas: Perry  front row alongside Marie Claire's Jackie Frank (left) and Kyly Clarke (right) 'Asia is a big expansion market and the Middle East is huge, it’s had unprecedented growth in so while I’m doing stuff in Australia I’m also doing things that resonate in those regions to build brand profile in those countries.' For Perry who also is a judge on Australia's Next Top Model, this also will include more work in TV overseas. He has currently filmed production for Asia’s Next Top Model which is said to broadcast to over 11 million homes in Asia and Middle East via the Star World Network and he's also looking into more TV opportunities there but can't go into the specifics yet.

From A-List to Asia: Perry has just filmed Asia's Next Top Model and plans to work on more TV projects in Asia . As for his fashion empire, Perry believes despite his work in TV, as well as linen and Specsaver lines, fashion is his first and foremost love and while he admits he won't stop at one thing, everything has to have synergy with his fashion brand. 'TV stuff gets a lot of press, but in reality  I’m a fashion designer  and it’s all about the credibility of clothes, so I’m really focused on that because that propels everything else.'","Australian fashion designer Alex Perry won't show at this year's MBFWA .

"Journalist and author of the best-selling book I Quit Sugar has opened up about her own personal battle with mental illness, revealing she came close to taking her own life. During a candid interview Sarah Wilson, 41, explained how anxiety drove her to believe she had reached a stage in her life where she 'couldn't see the point of continuing.' 'My anxiety brought me to a point where I couldn't quite see the existential point of continuing,' she told Women's Weekly Australia. 'I couldn't see a way out.' Scroll down for video . Sarah Wilson opened up in a candid interview about how her battle with mental illness drove her to believe her life wasn't worth living . During the intimate interview Ms Wilson revealed it was a combination of issues, including mounting stress, anxiety, her thyroid disease and distant family, that drove her to believe her life was no longer worth living. She said 'people get on with their lives' and while she hadn't found a husband, nor had children, she felt increasingly isolated. 'I was essentially very alone,' Ms Wilson added. 'My anxiety brought me to a point where I couldn't quite see the existential point of continuing' 'I couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel,' she added. Ms Wilson said while she struggled through her younger years she has recently 'found some peace with it.' In Ms Wilson's eyes, depression and anxiety are intrinsically linked. She thinks we need to acknowledge this link to be better equipped to tackle the increasing rate of Australian women who are being negatively affected by stress and anxiety. Ms Wilson said while she now accepts she is an 'anxious person', when she was younger she watched everybody else coping and felt like she had 'missed out on a guide book to life' Ms Wilson said while she now accepts she is an 'anxious person', when she was younger she watched everybody else coping and felt like she had 'missed out on a guide book to life'.

"'Out of character': Jay Kantaria, 38, had been looking forward to his daughter’s birthday party when he leapt onto train tracks last October . A City high flier jumped ‘feet first’ in front of a train after leaving his job at an investment management company to spend more time with his family, an inquest heard today. Jay Kantaria, 38, from Harrow, north-west London, had been looking forward to his daughter’s birthday party when he leapt onto the tracks at his local station of Sudbury Hill. But a coroner recorded an open verdict on the cause of death, saying there was 'doubt' as to Mr Kantaria's intention when he jumped as a train passed through the station last October. North London Coroner's Court in Barnet was told the businessman had ‘recently’ left his senior position at Baring Asset Management to start a career in property development. The London School of Economics graduate died instantly of ‘a severe traumatic brain injury’ and had to be identified from his fingerprints. Coroner Andrew Walker expressed his ‘deepest sympathies’ to Mr Kantaria’s 37-year-old wife, Monica, and his surviving family. He said Nairobi-born Mr Kantaria had worked as the chairman's assistant at Baring, but had decided to become a property developer. The coroner said the cause of death was ‘a severe traumatic brain injury’, consistent with being struck by a rapidly-moving train. Mr Kantaria had no alcohol or drugs in his system and did not suffer from any known psychiatric problems, Mr Walker added. Location: Mr Kantaria leapt onto the tracks at his local station of Sudbury Hill (above) in north-west London . Train driver Michael Hughes recounted how Mr Kantaria ‘seemed to have a good look at my train’. Mr Hughes said in a statement: ‘I then lost sight of him. When I passed the bridge I saw who I believe to be the same male run to the edge of the platform and jump feet-first.' He added that he felt no impact but immediately activated the emergency brake and called for help. Detective Constable Terry Hancocks from British Transport Police said: ‘The line speed was 100mph. He [Mr Hughes] was travelling at about 85mph’. The investigator said Mr Kantaria ‘appears to move from the platform... and then he is caught by the camera just in the air, before being struck by the train’. The coroner advised Mr Kantaria’s family not to view stills from the CCTV footage. Scene: The businessman died instantly of ‘a severe traumatic brain injury’ at the station (seen from above) Mr Hancocks said: ‘I did speak to Mrs Kantaria. The gentleman had just given up his job to spend more time with his wife and children and it was completely, completely out of character. As far as the family are concerned, it was completely out of the blue.’ When the coroner indicated he was ready to record the death as a suicide, Mrs Kantaria, a senior auditor at JP Morgan Chase, said: ‘He had everything to live for. 'He was looking forward to his daughter’s birthday party the following week. There is no reason I have to believe that he intended his life to come to an end.’ The coroner replied: ‘In the circumstances, I think there is a doubt in my mind about what his intention was, so I am going to leave the conclusion open. Jay Kantaria jumped in front of a train at Sudbury Hill station and died. 'The conclusion, for the reason I have said, is an open conclusion. There is no evidence to suggest he was at risk of bringing his life to an end. He had everything to live for and it just doesn’t seem to make sense.’ Mr Kantaria had also worked at Wellington Management and Halbis CapitalManagement - and had strengths in ‘communication and relationship management’, according to his Linkedin profile.","Jay Kantaria, 38, leapt onto tracks at Sudbury Hill station in NW London .

"Suddenly, at the age of 34 and after 15 years of hoping for the exact opposite, I desperately wanted to get pregnant. My husband Russell was ready to be a father, we were financially secure and after editing a weekly magazine in New York for four stressful years, I was ready to resign and focus on building a family. Eleven months later, when my body was still not doing what I demanded, I got depressed, stressed and scared. Proud mum Sarah Ivens with her two children, William (left) and one-year-old Matilda (centre) 'Have I left it too late to have a baby?’ I’d wail impatiently to Russell as month after month I’d clutch at my abdomen in pain as my period started, filled with a burgeoning dread that my body was failing us. ‘I always put my career first, and travelling and having our dream wedding. Now I’m worried I’m too old.’ I was paranoid that my life decisions had left my baby dreams impossible to reach. During my pre-broody years I’d been bombarded with images of 40-something celebrities, gloating about how easy it had been for them to conceive naturally and quickly. Of course, horror stories in the tabloids tried to persuade me that I had about as much chance of procreating successfully after the age of 30 as I did of making it to The X Factor finals, but I had decided to follow the stars and wear blinkers. The truth, I was quickly discovering, lay somewhere in the middle of the heartbreak, guilt and misinformation women find themselves drowning in as they consider motherhood. Happy family: After years of heartbreak, Sarah and Russell have two children William, (centre) and Matilda . Pregnancy expert Zita West said: ‘I think in a way modern life has done women a disservice. ‘We’re told we can have it all, so women go on the pill while they are building their careers for many, many years, which masks any issues they may have such as polycystic ovary syndrome or endometriosis. 'Then when they decide to have a baby in their 30s, they are shocked if it doesn’t happen as they planned. 'We know that fertility starts to decline at 35 and that age is the biggest factor in a woman’s ability to conceive. Sarah and Russell celebrate their wedding with a dream day in the Cotswolds in 2009 . Expectant parents Sarah and husband Russell prepare for their son William's imminent arrival in 2011 . 'What women need to do immediately is ask their mothers what age they went through the menopause: this is a key genetic factor in your own fertility, and your cycle starts to decline rapidly 10 years before you hit the menopause.’ Eventually, Russ and I conceived - naturally - but at the 13-week scan, the other horrific factor of late motherhood reared its ugly head. Our baby had severe chromosomal abnormalities and had zero chance of survival. I was advised by a series of doctors to have a medical abortion, to safeguard my future fertility and mental state. ‘The sooner we get this unviable pregnancy dealt with, the quicker you can go on to conceive a healthy baby,’ our specialist advised us. This sounds callous, but even through the fog of utter devastation I knew he was being cruel to be kind: I didn’t have too much time. I was turning 35 in one month. A few days later, as I was wheeled into the operating theatre, tears streamed down my cheeks and neck and onto my pale blue hospital robe. Everyone was sad for me, but this was quite a common occurrence for a woman of my dotage. ‘Well, you have left it quite late, haven’t you,’ a few supposed sympathisers uttered in my direction when I was feeling sorry for myself. What had I expected? Preparing to be a new mum, Sarah poses at nine months pregnant with her son William, born in 2011 . Friends were as divided as the media when it came to declaring their true fertility stories. While one friend admits to leaving it too late and worrying herself to sleep each night over the mounting IVF treatment bills (her husband has insisted, scared of debt, she stop with the baby dream when they hit the £50,000 mark); another friend is determined to put off pregnancy until she has passed some professional exams. ‘I’ll only be 37 when I’m done – and if I have to re-sit, I can delay pregnancy another year easily,’ she tells me, perhaps naively. Another friend got joyously pregnant with her first child on the eve of her 40th birthday. Sarah celebrates the joy of having her son, William in 2011, after the grief of having to end her first pregnancy . Her husband – who was depressed at being made redundant – threatened to kill himself if she kept the baby. So she had an abortion, while he suddenly seemed to get better – better enough to leave her for a 20-something woman he met in his new job a few months later. ‘I’ll regret that choice for the rest of my life,’ she recently declared. ‘It wasn’t until my womb was empty and he’d gone that I realised I wanted a baby more than I wanted him.’ Other friends in their mid-to-late 30s are choosing to stick their heads in the sand. ‘If I get to 40 and I’m still single, I’ll get just find a sperm donor,’ is the flippant battle cry of many women I know. Some friends get pregnant as soon as they decide to start trying, of course, and those ones frustrate me the most. There is nothing noble in my frustration; I am despicably jealous – especially when these women don’t appreciate how lucky they are. So what can women who know they want to have children in the future do to safeguard their future fertility? ‘The medical profession is considering lifestyle more,’ says West. ‘Women and men need to look at their eating habits and whether they are under or overweight. 'A Body Mass Index of between 19 and 26 is ideal for protecting fertility health. Take multivitamins. 'Avoid fizzy drinks and processed foods; drink alcohol and caffeine in moderation and stop smoking and using drugs. 'All these things cause free radical damage, which harms your long-term chances of conceiving. 'There are no magic answers here; future parents just need to follow a healthy lifestyle.’ West also thinks women should address any psychological issues they have before trying to become a parent. Sarah's much longed-for son William, tenderly kisses his newborn baby sister Matilda . ‘Modern women are all about not getting pregnant, then suddenly a switch flips in their head at a certain age and they think they should be able to conceive immediately. Yet blockages exist and they need to ask themselves questions to stop their sub-conscious sending negative messages. 'How do you visualise your body? How do you connect with your womb?' asks West. 'I believe acupuncture, hypnotherapy and counselling can help a woman prepare her body for the journey towards motherhood.’ Now I am part of the envy-inducing club: I have two healthy children, a boy and a girl, although I did lose another pregnancy at 12 weeks in between their joyous arrivals. And that wonderful feeling is not something I’d want any woman who desires it to miss out on because she has been lulled into a false sense of security or stress due to the misinformation surrounding the issue of fertility today. ‘One day’ is a long way away. Take control of your options today.","Journalist Sarah Ivens, 39, tells of her struggle to get pregnant aged 34 .

"Cannabis can kill cancer cells and helps shrink one of the most serious types of brain tumour, new advice reveals . Cannabis can kill cancer cells and shrink one of the most serious types of brain tumours, new advice reveals. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the US has admitted, in its revised publication on marijuana, that the drug offers benefits to some cancer patients. The report states: 'Recent animal studies have shown that marijuana extracts may help kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others. 'Evidence from one animal study suggests that extracts from whole-plant marijuana can slow the growth of cancer cells from one of the most serious types of brain tumours. 'Research in mice showed that these extracts, when used with radiation, increased the cancer-killing effects of the radiation.' The term medicinal marijuana refers to using the whole unprocessed plant or its basic extracts to treat a disease or symptom. Currently the drug is not recognised by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medicine. However, studies of the chemicals in marijuana - cannabinoids - has led the FDA to approve two medications that contain cannabinoid chemicals. Currently two cannabinoids, of around 100, are of medical interest - THC and CBD. THC increases appetite and reduces nausea. It may also decrease pain, inflammation and muscle control problems. CBD is a cannabinoid that does not affect the mind or behaviour. It is thought to be useful in minimising pain and inflammation, controlling epileptic seizures and possibly treating mental illness and addictions. In the UK, THC is the active ingredient in the prescribed drug Sativex. It is currently only licensed to treat and relive the pain of muscle spasms in MS patients. Scroll down for video . The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the US has admitted, in its revised publication on marijuana, that the drug offers benefits to some cancer patients, including those suffering some brain tumours, pictured . Scientists are also conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies into the effects of marijuana on: . The new advice from the National Institute on Drug Abuse comes as a group of senators put pressure on the US federal government to recognise the medicinal value of the drug. Medication containing cannabinoids, from marijuana, is licensed to treat MS - pictured on a brain scan - patients in both the US and UK . The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States Act was introduced in March. It proposes moving cannabis from a schedule I to a schedule II drug, recognising it has some medicinal value. The proposed bill does not, however, legalise marijuana in all states, but permits states to set their own policies, the Daily Caller reported. 'It couldn’t be any clearer that marijuana has medical value,' Tom Angell, chairman of the Marijuana Majority, told The Daily Caller. 'When even NIDA and the surgeon general are acknowledging that marijuana can help people who are suffering, it is time for the Obama administration to reschedule the drug. 'The attorney general can initiate that process today, and there’s no reason for him not to, especially when polling shows that such a huge majority of Americans supports medical marijuana.' Twenty-three states in the US currently have laws legalising the use of marijuana in some form. Four states - Colorado, Alaska, Oregon and Washington - have legalised the drug for both medicinal and recreational use. Meanwhile, California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Hawaii and Maine have laws allowing people to use the drug for medicinal purposes.","National Institute on Drug Abuse admits cannabis has medicinal benefits .

"A self-confessed neo-Nazi who allegedly shot dead his gay supervisor was forcibly removed from court on Thursday after swearing at the judge and flipping over a table. The outburst unfolded as Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, made his first appearance at the Wayne County Courthouse in Goldsboro, North Carolina after being extradited from Florida. He is accused of shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane at Wayne Community College on Monday morning before fleeing more than 500 miles south. He was arrested sleeping on Daytona Beach on Tuesday. At the hearing on Thursday, he initially denied a court-appointed attorney, saying he knew he'd get life behind bars when he shot dead his former boss. Scroll down for video . Kicked out: Kenneth Stancil is removed from a Wayne County courtroom in Goldsboro, North Carolina on Thursday after he swore at the judge and claimed he shot dead a man for trying to molest his brother . When the judge repeatedly reminded him that he could get the death penalty for his charge of open murder, Stancil burst into expletives, WNCN reported. 'Yes I know that,' Stancil snapped back. 'But when I knew what I had to do and I knew I got caught, I knew in my mind that I could get life or I could get the death penalty. I knew that.' He then repeated his previous claims that he targeted Lane for making sexual advances towards Stancil's 16-year-old brother. He has said Lane did not touch the boy but intended to. 'You defile my top eight, I will kill you,' Stancil told the court on Thursday. 'Know what I'm saying? If you're a f***ing child molester, a f***ing rapist.' When Judge Ronald O. Jones told him to stop using that language, he answered: 'I don't give a f*** what you want'. Jones ordered him to be removed from the courtroom but Stancil was able to flip over a table before deputies pounced on him and hauled him away. When he returned about 30 minutes later, his demeanor was very different, WNCN noted. He told the judge he would like an attorney and one will be appointed to him on Friday. In court: Stancil, who has multiple neo-Nazi tattoos, made his first appearance in the North Carolina courtroom on Thursday after he was transferred from Florida, where he was arrested on Tuesday . Hauled out: Deputies carried the suspect out and he was much calmer when he returned 30 minutes later . Back home: Stancil is seen emerging from a State Bureau of Investigation plane in North Carolina after being extradited from Florida on Thursday . Stancil is pictured arriving at the Wayne County Courthouse ahead of his violent outburst on Thursday . He was flown by authorities from Florida to North Carolina on Thursday after denying an extradition hearing. Stancil allegedly shot Lane, who worked in the college's print shop, at 8am on Monday before fleeing on a motorcycle. When the bike later broke down, he hitchhiked to Daytona Beach where he was picked up for sleeping on the beach, which is in violation of the beach ordinance. In a telephone interview on Wednesday from a Daytona Beach, Florida, jail, Stancil claimed Lane tried to take advantage of his brother, whom he found on Facebook. 'He ain't physically touched him, but he was in the proposal to try to and I wasn't going to let that happen,' he told WRAL. He added that he has no regrets about the shooting. 'I did what I did, and I've got to live with it,' he said. 'If I get life, I just get life. I'm a murderer, you know, what the hell do I got to care? I don't give a damn if I go back to society.' Stancil, who tattooed his own face with fascist symbols, said he is a neo-Nazi who is looking out for his fellow white people. Gunned down: Stancil, pictured left in his mug shot, allegedly shot his former supervisor, 44-year-old Ron Lane, pictured right, on Monday morning. He said part of the reason was because Lane was gay . Mourning: Students gather at a memorial at Wayne Community College for Ron Lane on Tuesday . 'I don't believe in race mixing,' he said. He added that he hated gay people 'with a passion' - but said that was only one of the reasons he killed Lane, who had been his supervisor in a work study program at the college before Stancil was fired for absenteeism. Stancil's mother has previously said that Lane did not molest the teenage boy because they had never met. Lane's cousin, Steven Smith, told WRAL that Lane never made sexual advances toward children or anyone he worked with. There were no criminal complaints filed by Stancil family members with either the Wayne County sheriff or Goldsboro police, Wayne County investigations clerk Ellen Grice said. There were also no workplace complaints filed against Lane, who had worked at the college for 18 years, Wayne Community College human resources director Ina Rawlinson said. Police have said officers are investigating the possibility that the incident was a hate crime.","Kenneth Stancil made his first appearance in a North Carolina court on Thursday after he was transferred from a Florida jail .

"Driving around in their mother's consular BMW in Miami to shoot up homes and steal hordes of marijuana: this was the indulgent life of two wealthy teenage sons of a Canadian diplomat. But the antics of 15-year-old Marc and 17-year-old Jean Wabafiyebazu were brought to a sudden halt on March 30 when a drugs raid went wrong and the older brother was shot dead. Marc is waiting to discover if he will be charged with his murder. Now, as the details of that night unfold, investigators are learning more about the gangster lifestyle they led - despite attending top private schools bankrolled by their mother Roxanne Dube, Canada's Consul General in Miami. Indulgent life: Jean Wabafiyebazu, 17, (left) and his 15-year-old brother Marc (right) drove around Canada raiding homes and buying drugs, the younger boy has told investigators . Bloody aftermath: The boys and a friend had driven to a house, pictured here with blood on the floor, to reportedly purchase two pounds of marijuana for $5,000. In the shooting, Jean was shot dead . The boys had recently moved to live with their mother in a gated community at the heart of the affluent Coral Way district. Court documents read by the National Post revealed Marc boasted to investigators that this raid was not their first. 'Defendant continued to state that he was from Canada and they had done the same type of thing in Canada and had also done other drug rip-offs in Miami,' the affidavit states. Indeed, Macleans reports that the pair would miss school to drive around with their loaded guns in the back seat. Marc and Jean, who both attended Ottawa's private Lycee Claudel school, were enrolled at different institutions when they got to the U.S.: Jean at $31,000-a-year Gulliver Preparatory School, Marc at the public Palmetto School. According to Macleans, both harbored a reputation for drug abuse - something the boys were already deeply immersed in. It has been widely reported that Jean had a substance abuse problem, tweeting about 'weed' and 'startin off the day wit mah blunt o herb'. Even his father told Global News he 'could tell' Jean was into drugs. But Marc, he insists, was the perfect child. Back story: Details are now emerging about the lifestyle of the boys, privately-educated sons of a Canadian diplomat. When they moved to Miami, Jean (left) was enrolled at a $31,000-a-year school . In court: Roxanne Dube, mother of the boys, is pictured arriving in court before her son's first hearing . High-ranking official: Dube, a one-time Fulbright scholar, was appointed to her new position in November, but only arrived in Miami in February. She was previously the envoy in Zimbabwe . However, in the wake of his brother's death, the younger brother defended their antics and proudly declared to investigators that they cavorted around Ottawa together. On the night of Jean's death they are said to have driven to a house to buy marijuana on Monday March 30 with their friend Jean met at a dance festival, 17-year-old Joshua White. As Marc sat in the car, Jean and Joshua went inside. Minutes later, they were dead and the alleged drug dealer inside, 19-year-old Anthony Rodriguez, was shot in the arm. A grand jury will decide whether to bring murder charges against Marc. Under Florida law, people can be charged with felony murder if they were involved in a crime that leads to a killing — even if a person didn't participate directly in the killing. Police also say Marc Wabafiyebazu threatened to shoot a detective in the head after his arrest, which would be another felony count. Assistant State Attorney Marie Mato said after a brief hearing that the grand jury could decide to charge 15-year-old Marc Wabafiyebazu as an adult. His attorney, Curt Obront, said Wabafiyebazu will plead not guilty to any charges that are filed. 'We will be defending these charges,' Obront told reporters. Dube attended the hearing Wednesday but did not speak with reporters. Marc Wabafiyebazu spoke only to answer a few questions from Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Angelica Zayas, who set an April 20 hearing on the results of the grand jury's work. 'How are you doing this morning?' Zayas asked the boy at one point. 'I'm doing fine,' he responded. 'Don't say anything to anybody about this case,' the judge warned. According to police reports, the Wabafiyebazu brothers — who had only recently relocated from their father's home in Ottawa, Canada, to South Florida to be with their mother — took their mother's personal vehicle to the alleged drug meeting. The personal vehicle carries diplomatic plates, but authorities say Marc Wabafiyebazu is not protected by diplomatic immunity. Crime scene: In this photo taken on Monday, March 30, 2015, Miami-Dade police detectives work at a crime scene in Miami, involving the two teenage sons of Roxanne Dube, Canada's counsel general in Maimi . Gunfire erupted soon after they entered, though Marc was in the car at the time . Police say Rodriguez brought the marijuana — worth less than $5,000 — and negotiations began. Marc Wabafiyebazu said he was waiting outside in his mother's car while his older brother went inside 'to conduct the rip-off,' according to a police report. 'In the process of that rip-off, several shots were fired inside the residence,' killing Jean Wabafiyebazu and Wright. Rodriguez was wounded along with a fourth person, 21-year-old Johan Ruiz, who was shot in the abdomen and is recovering. Police say Marc Wabafiyebazu rushed into the house after hearing the gunshots, but exactly what he did after that is not clear. Police have also said the two dead teenagers apparently shot each other. Authorities have not said where Jean Wabafiyebazu obtained a weapon or weapons they believe he brought to the residence. Anthony Rodriguez (above) was arrested on charges of felony murder and drug possession . Obront said Marc Wabafiyebazu has no prior criminal record. 'This is a tragic situation,' Obront said. 'Our heart goes out to all of the families.' Germano Wabafiyebazu said his sons borrowed their mother's personal car, which has diplomatic license plates, to drive to the house but told their mother they were just going for a drive. He said he was told that Marc rushed into the house after hearing a gunshot. Authorities say Marc will not be protected by diplomatic immunity. Dube and her family, meanwhile, expressed condolences to the family of Joshua Wright, the other deceased victim, and said they just want to be there for the younger son. 'Your grief is our grief,' she said. 'We can only hope that, in time, we will find common purpose towards diminishing the causes of such violent crimes. For now, we just want to be there for Marc, our incredibly caring son who loved his brother very much, and to say goodbye, ever so tenderly and quietly to Jean, our love.' Dube, a one-time Fulbright scholar, was appointed to her new position in November, but only arrived in Miami in February. She was previously Canada's ambassador to Zimbabwe from 2005 to 2008 and also served as a staff member for a Canadian Liberal cabinet minister for more than a decade. John Babcock, a spokesman for Canada's foreign department, said Louise Leger has been named acting Head of Mission on an interim basis. The boys' father, Germano Wabafiyebazu, said he and Dube were divorced a few years ago and that their son Jean struggled with substance abuse. He previously told Global News that he does not think Marc had anything to do with this tragedy, and that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also said the boys kept to themselves, and did not have much of a social life. 'My wife told me they didn't go out,' he said. 'They went to school, went home, went to school.'","Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, bragged to officials that he and Jean, 17, would go on raids together around Canada .

"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts reported for jury duty in Rockville, Maryland on Wednesday - and was not selected. The 60-year-old was called to serve on a case involving a car crash and had to answer a couple of questions about his relatives. However, when it came to a question about the jurors legal experience the sitting Judge refrained from making Roberts answer, saying, 'Obviously we know what you do for a living, sir.' Top judge: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts reported for jury duty on Wednesday in Rockville, Maryland . Roberts sat incognito with the other called jurors and answered questions about his sister in Indiana who is a nurse and his brother-in-law, who works with the Indiana State Police. The only giveaway that he was one of the top judges in the highest court in the land and part of the judiciary branch of US Government was the two security staff he brought with him. According to the Washington Post, Roberts squeezed in with the 50 others jurors and was not selected in the case involving a car crash on Connecticitu Avenue from 2013. Judge Rubin asked jurors to raise their hands if they had certain jobs and when it came to medicine, Roberts said his sister was a nurse.

"This is the moment a four-year-old girl broke down in tears because the 'little ducks' in a nursery rhyme did not come back to their mother. Rilie Carey, from Salem, Oregon, learnt the popular song at preschool and was halfway through eating her dinner when she decided to perform it for her mom, Jessica. She starts by confidently singing: 'Four little ducks went out to play, over the hills and far away. 'Mumma duck says quack, quack, quack, quack, but only three little ducks came back.' But as the rhyme continues - and the number of ducks returning to their mother decreases - her eyes begin to fill with tears. As she gets to the penultimate verse, where 'no little ducks come back', she starts to sob with her arm across her face. At the end of the clip Rilie, who lives with her mom, dad and two-year-old brother, leans in for a hug from her mom - despite being told the ducks do actually return. Mrs Carey posted the video on Facebook alongside the caption: 'My four-year-old daughter learned a new song at school yesterday and can't quite get through it without crying. 'She gets so sad that the mama duck doesn't have her babies!! #allthefeels' The 25-year-old, who met Rilie's father Aaron in 2007, told MailOnline: 'I filmed the video because after I had picked Rilie up from school, she would't stop singing it all day and would start to get emotional near the end every single time. 'I recorded it at dinner time so I could show her dad once he got off from work. 'She is so caring and loving and, as a mother, it made my heart explode watching her get so emotional about the mama duck losing her babies. She's so sweet. 'I just adored it.

"Dope smokers beware: If Marco Rubio or Chris Christie manage to elbow out the competition and win the White House in 2016, they'll crack down on pot in states that have legalized marijuana. The Republican presidential hopefuls told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in separate interviews on Tuesday that they'd enforce federal drug laws and block the sale of marijuana in Colorado and Washington. 'Marijuana is a gateway drug,' Christie said, citing an 'enormous addiction problem in this country.' 'And we need to send very clear leadership from the White House on down through the federal law enforcement. Marijuana is an illegal drug under federal law. And the states should not be permitted to sell it and profit from it.' New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, center, makes a campaign stop at Rockingham County GOP Happy Hour on Tuesday in Newmarket, New Hampshire, with his wife Mary Pat, right. During a radio interview that day, Christie, a candidate-in-waiting, said, 'Marijuana is a gateway drug' and claimed America has an 'enormous addiction problem.' he added, 'We need to send very clear leadership from the White House on down through the federal law enforcement' U.S. Senator Marco Rubio is pictured here on Monday with his wife Jeanette as he announces his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination during a Miami, Florida, event. Talking about weed on Tuesday, he said, 'I think we need to enforce our federal laws' Asked for his position on the topic, Rubio said 'I think we need to enforce our federal laws.' Rubio, who on Monday made official his candidacy, said he believes in states' rights - but laws created by the federal government legally supersede those of the states. 'I don’t believe we should be in the business of legalizing additional intoxicants in this country for the primary reason that when you legalize something, what you’re sending a message to young people is it can’t be that bad, because if it was that bad, it wouldn’t be legal,' the Florida senator said. Questioned about cannabis last year by ABC News' Jon Karl, Rubio took a hard-line stance, saying, 'I think there’s no responsible way to recreationally use marijuana.' 'I don’t want my kids to smoke marijuana, and I don’t want other people’s kids to smoke marijuana,' he said at the time. He refused to tell Karl if he'd engaged in any marijuana-related youthful indiscretions, arguing that his answer would either set a bad example for young people or make him look like a liar. Christie has also forcefully denounced marijuana legalization, saying last March, 'I don't favor legalization. I don't favor recreational use. I don't favor decriminalization. And I don't favor the use of marijuana as a medicine.' Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the first Republican to officially enter the 2016 race, also supports stricter enforcement of current law and has said he is against legalizing weed. He's also said he's willing to have an 'intelligent conversation' about drug policy, however. Other GOP contenders, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who tossed his hat in the ring last week, and former Texas Governor Rick Perry, a presumed candidate, have taken a softer approach to the budding discussion - they're in favor decriminalization. The youngest major presidential candidate this election season, 43-year-old Rubio is presenting himself as a fresh face with forward-thinking ideas compared to candidates of 'yesterday' - a not-so-subtle attack on 67-year-old Democrat Hillary Clinton.

In the course of his conversation with Hewitt on Tuesday Rubio defended his framing of Clinton as past her prime and said he was knocking her 'ideas,' not her age. 'Age is a legitimate issue,' he said, 'not the age of the people, the age of their ideas...I’m just saying that the things that worked in the last century don’t work that well now.' The jobs that served as the base of our economy before 'either don’t exist' now or 'they have been shipped overseas or they don’t pay what they once used to relative to the cost of living,' he said, asserting that 'we have to fully embrace the opportunities of the 21st Century.' 'We need leaders that understand that and have an idea about how the 21st Century can also be a new American century.' He later predicted that Clinton would 'struggle to connect with everyday Americans and their struggles of daily life' on the campaign trail. 'I mean, and that’s a big problem,' he said. 'That’s one of the reasons why her ideas are so outdated. They’re still ideas based on an era that came and went.' Christie said in his interview with Hewitt that he also thinks Clinton is vulnerable and promised, 'If I run, I will beat her.'","'We need to send very clear leadership from the White House...'

"A man who claims he kicked a young mother out of his car when she got too drunk on their date has been arrested for obstructing justice two weeks after she vanished. Ashley Pegram, a 28-year-old mother-of-three, left her Summerville, South Carolina home for a date with a man she had met on messaging service Kik on the evening of April 3. Her sister, Brandy Chance, reported her missing the next day and went through her Kik account, where she found messages from a man who identified himself as 18-year-old Emoney Bon. But when she spoke with him, it emerged he was actually a 30-year-old man, Edward Primo Bonilla. Scroll down for video . Missing: Ashley Pegram, left, has been missing since she went on a date with Edward Primo Bonilla, right, on April 3 after they met online. He has now been charged with obstructing justice . Bonilla told her he had kicked her sister out of the car around midnight. On the messaging service, he had sent Pegram's account a message apologizing for leaving her but making sure she had got home OK, WCSC reported. But surveillance video taken outside a Sunoco gas station on the night of Pegram's disappearance shows her getting out of Bonilla's car, entering the convenience store and returning to the vehicle at 1am. The car then drives away with both people inside, although it is not clear if the person seen in the surveillance footage in Bonilla, WCSC reported. WVTM reported that the blue Hyundai Sonata belonged to Bonilla. He told authorities he believed he had dropped her near the Piggly Wiggly supermarket in Berkeley County. Caught on camera: She was seen inside a gas station convenience store in the early hours of April 4 . Spotted: She then headed back to a car, identified as Bonilla's. He said he later forced her out of the car . Deputies interviewed Bonilla and during a follow-up, he allegedly gave false and misleading information, but they would not provide further details. 'At this point, foul play is a definite possibility,' Dorchester County Sheriff's Captain Tony Phinney said. Bonilla has been charged with obstruction of justice and he was given a $400,000 surety bond during a court appearance on Thursday. Pegram's sister, Brandy Chance, said the missing woman's children, aged 13, eight and nine months, are devastated. 'Her little baby's having nightmares,' she told ABC News 4. 'The oldest one is having depression. And I can't do anything, I'm not really good for comforting now, you know.' Have you seen her? Pegram is a mother to three children who are devastated by her absence, family said . Chance added that her sister would often go on dates with men she met online, and even though she told Pegram it was dangerous, 'she just didn't listen'. Pegram had been mourning the death of her boyfriend, who passed away in a traffic accident in January, but her family does not believe she would hurt herself. 'She loves us too much,' Chance said. The 28-year-old is 5ft1 with brown har and brown eyes. She was wearing a black shirt, blue jeans and black flip flops with sparkles.

"A woman allegedly beat her boyfriend with a bat at their first face-to-face meeting following two years of online dating. Haley Fox, 24, of Turner, Oregon, fractured 26-year-old Samuel Campbell's skull with a baseball bat at her home last Wednesday. She has been charged with first-degree assault. Fox and Campbell, of Adger, Alabama, had been in a relationship for around two years after meeting online. Haley Fox, 24, of Oregon, (left) allegedly fractured the skull of her 26-year-old online boyfriend Samuel Campbell (right) skull with a baseball bat because she didn't want to date him anymore . Earlier this month, he moved to Oregon to live with Ms Fox, according to a report from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. Campbell went to his girlfriend's home on April 8, to meet in person for the first time. According to the police report, Ms Fox led him to a table outside of the residence where he sat down to drink wine. She then asked him to close his eyes and struck him three times from behind on the head with a metal baseball bat. The 26-year-old victim suffered cuts to the head that required staples and a fractured skull. Fox told investigators that she decided to hurt Campbell because she did not want to be his girlfriend. Investigators learned that an additional party was present and may have witnessed the assault.  Jennifer Beaumont, 26, has been interviewed but her involvement is yet unclear. Fox was arrested on April 9 and charged with Assault I. She has yet to enter a plea, posted bail and was released from custody. Campbell was treated and released from Salem Hospital.","Haley Fox, 24, of Turner, Oregon, fractured 26-year-old Samuel Campbell's skull with a baseball bat at her home last Wednesday .

"A mother-of-two has been jailed after stealing almost £80,000 from her dying parents to go on shopping sprees - leaving her elderly father in debt and too poor to afford a telephone. Christine Lillico, 47, from  Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, was trusted with looking after her elderly parents' bank accounts as their health deteriorated with age. But instead of using the money to care for John and Audrey Air she plundered their life savings to bankroll her own lifestyle. Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard mother-of-two Christine Lillico, 47 was supposed to look after her elderly parents' bank accounts - but instead stole almost £80,000 from them over a six year period . By the time her fraud was discovered Lillico had stolen a total of £78,000. Newcastle Crown Court heard in the last months of his life Mr Air went without a telephone and basic amenities, while suffering the shame of being in debt for the first time in his life because of his daughter's crimes. A judge has now sent Lillico to jail and ordered she pay her brother John Air junior £39,000 - which would have been his inheritance has she not stolen it. Sentencing her to 20 months behind bars, Mr Recorder Baird said: 'You were trusted by your parents to look after them in their elderly years. 'They had modest savings which had taken all their lives to accumulate through hard work. 'Over a period of six years you plundered those savings. 'The result of that was when your father died in 2014 he was in debt, something he had never been in before and that is something that caused him great distress.' The court heard Lillico spent some of the £78,000 on shopping sprees in B&Q (file image) Christopher Knox, prosecuting, explained how Mr and Mrs Air, from Ashington, had both worked in the coal industry and had pensions. The couple gave their daughter control of their bank accounts after they sold their home for £95,000 and moved in to a sheltered flat, as their health began to fail as they grew older. 'The couple lived very sensibly,' said Mr Knox. 'By 2008 there was at least £55,000 in a savings account.' The court heard Mrs Air, who had suffered from dementia, passed away in October 2010 and Mr Air died in July 2014. But the court heard Lillico had been raiding her parents' accounts since 2008. Debit card transactions were made at various shops including JD Sports and B&Q. The accounts had also been used to pay for photography services and to buy an XBox and cash was also withdrawn from the banks and cheques written. The court heard Lillico is of previous good character. She pleaded guilty to three charges of fraud. It was calculated the amount of money Lillico stole amounted to what she and her brother would have inherited between them. The judge made an order under the Proceeds of Crime Act that she repay the half she owes within six months. Nigel Hedley, defending, said Lillico was hit by financial problems after a difficult divorce. 'She was a woman of good character. She had a very traumatic divorce and encountered severe financial difficulties.' He also said Lillico had been suspended from her job as a medical secretary as a result of her crimes, but that she would be able to pay her brother the money she owed by re-mortgaging her house.","Christine Lillico, 47, stole almost £80,000 from her parents over six years .

"A 77-year-old woman was left partially blind after a lightning bolt struck her as she sat in her car. Despite the dramatic and rare event, the woman's injury was not detected straight away. Rather, her hairdresser noticed several days later that she had suffered minor burns on her scalp. Later that day the pensioner noticed her eye sight was blurred - she could barely see with her right eye. A few days later, she visited the opticians and was referred to see opthalmologist Mohit Gupta,  who works at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, England. The 77-year-old woman was struck by lightning while she sat in her car. Days later, after her vision became blurred, a scan of her retina revealed she had a hole in her retina . Mr Gupta scanned the patient's retina, using a relatively new technique known as optical coherence tomography (OCT). The case report into the woman's treatment, published by the journal BMJ Case Reports, reveals Mr Gupta discovered a hole in the patient's macula, a part of the retina that is responsible for around 90 per cent of a person's vision. Dr Permesh Dhillon, a medical internist and colleague of Mr Gupta, said the woman's case reveals how important it is that medics check the vision of anyone struck by lightning. He told LiveScience: 'In the future, if patients are struck by lightning, it should be a routine process to refer them to an ophthalmologist to have an eye assessment.' He said the retina does not conduct electricity well, suggesting the injury was caused by the heat produced when the bolt struck. The woman was prescribed eye drops, but suffered an allergic reaction to them. She later underwent surgery to repair the hole in her macula, after two months of poor vision. Dr Permesh Dhillon, a medical internist at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, said the heat from the lightning bolt is thought to have burned a hole in the woman's retina. It was eventually treated, via surgery . The operation involved removing the jelly part of the eye, which touches the retina, and injecting a gas bubble to push the layer at the back of the eye back together, Dr Dhillon said. He added his patient was 'quite fortunate in that only her retina was affected, and only in one eye'. Between 30 to 60 people each year are struck by lightning in the Uk. Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the US sees an average of 51 people injured by lightning each year. Only around 10 per cent of those struck by a bolt are killed. Dr Dhillon said there have been reports of lightning strikes affecting other parts of the eyes, resulting in cataracts, burns or swelling.","Woman was struck by lightning in her car in Boston, Lincolnshire .

"A British athlete has become the fastest man to run 16,300 miles around the world despite being attacked by bears, hunted by packs of wild dogs, and run over twice. Kevin Carr, 34, from Woolacombe, Devon, ran more than a marathon a day every day for almost two years, crossing 26 countries and getting through 16 pairs of shoes to complete the feat. He began his epic voyage at Haytor on Dartmoor in July 2013 and returned yesterday after 621 days, one quicker than the previous record, held by Australian Tom Denniss. Scroll down for video . Kevin Carr, 34, from Woolacombe, Devon, has become the fastest man to run around the world completing the 16,300-mile mission in 621 days, beating the previous record by a day . Mr Carr ran across five continents during his epic 621-day challenge beating the previous record by a day . Mr Carr set off from Haytor on Dartmoor in July 2013 and returned last night after 621 days, during which he ran the equivalent of a marathon a day, crossed 26 countries and got through 16 pairs of shoes . Mr Carr was also the first man to complete the gruelling endurance run unsupported, and instead of a team carrying his equipment, he pushed it along himself in a buggy . Mr Carr also became the first man to complete the voyage unsupported by a team, instead pushing all of his kit along in a stroller that weighed twice as much as he does. He said: 'I've pushed my tired legs through most of Europe, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US. 'I have encountered some pretty scary things along the way, from packs of wilds dogs in Romania to the most extreme weather conditions imaginable. 'Most frightening of all however was coming face to face with bears. One of the bears stalked and then actively came for me. Mr Carr's journey took him through Australia, New Zealand, Europe, India, the US and Canada - though he said the highlight was the Andes mountains . Mr Carr pushes his buggy full of equipment, which weighed twice as much as him, through Dunedin in New Zealand during the middle of his adventure . The route took Mr Carr through most of Europe, including Lithuania (pictured). After crossing the finish line he said he had lost three stone during the trip . 'I used bear banger explosives that someone had given me and, after three misfires, thankfully my fourth attempt sent the bear packing.' He said during one 300-mile stretch full of bears and wolves he relied on people with short-distance radios to keep a check on him to make sure he wasn't eaten. He added: 'I've had to endure a lot of suffering too. I had severe heatstroke in India and have twice been hit by cars. 'I knew the size of the challenge but it was a little bit more of a headache dealing with the logistics and the traffic. Mr Carr's trip also took in Stockholm - not the capital of Sweden, but a tiny town in Wisconsin, with a population of just 66 . Mr Carr takes in the scenery by a river in Ohio, showing the pedometer on his wrist that he used to keep track of his speed, distance, and route . The voyage took him to locations all over the world, from Alabama, US (left), to Chile, South America (right) 'It was a bit harder than I had anticipated and took me a bit longer. 'I didn't have much time to lament on loneliness as I was concentrating on the traffic and where I was going to sleep that night and find a shop. 'The worst thing I faced was indifference from fashion savvy people looking at a sweaty dishevelled man pushing a pram down the road.'","Kevin Carr, 34, ran equivalent of a marathon a day for nearly two years .

"A man who launched an online campaign to help him destroy his brand new $49,000 Jeep will read out a 'not sorry' apology to the company on national television tonight. In June last year,  Ashton Wood raised $18,000 online so he and 300 people could destroy his car after Jeep refused to pay a full refund for the car or replace the vehicle which he claimed had suffered 21 separate mechanical problems. During a failed settlement between the manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Jeep, and Mr Wood, one of the requests made by the car company was for the disgruntled buyer to publish an 'apology' in a national publication. However, because no one would publish the apology, he will instead read it out on the ABC's 'The Checkout' tonight. Scroll down for video . Ashton Wood issued this apology to Jeep after the car company requested he apologise for criticising them . The Queenslander launched a public campaign last year asking others to help him destroy his car in protest . Compiled by Mr Wood and the ABC's The Checkout, the apology reads: 'My personal apology to Jeep: I'm Sorry. 'Dear Jeep, I'm sorry. I'm sorry my Jeep broke down before it even left the dealership. 'I'm sorry it had 21 problems. I'm sorry it had to be towed four times. I'm sorry I wasn't more grateful for your offer of a new battery. 'I'm sorry you wouldn't offer me a replacement or refund. But most of all, I'm sorry I bought a Jeep.' Mr Wood launched a Kickstarter campaign last year in an effort to raise $22,500 - the amount Chrysler offered him to buyback the car - and allow donors the chance to be involved in the car's destruction. He is now campaigning for the United State's Lemon laws to be introduced in Australia. Pictured: 'lemon car' drivers protest against vehicle companies who refuse to refund or replace their cars . Mr Wood's extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems . The extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking. He claims years of campaigning the car manufacturer to refund or replace his car, which he bought from a Sunshine Coast dealer in Queensland had proved fruitless. Despite successfully destroying his vehicle, Mr Wood - who could not afford to challenge the international car company in court - has refused to back down. Along with a number of consumer led organsiations Mr Wood is campaigning for the United States' Lemon Laws to be introduced in Australia. These included the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking . He said that Lemon Laws state 'that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked' 'Lemon is the old term which was used to mean a really bad car. In the U.S. they have had the Lemon Law's in place for about 35 years, we don't have it,' Mr Wood told Daily Mail Australia. 'They differ from state to state but in Kansas, where they have the most strict version, is states that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked. 'It's a lot clearer than Australian consumer laws which just says that the product should be fit for purpose and the dealer should do the right thing. 'I'm not done yet. I want to keep the pressure up until the government sits up and takes some responsibility and reviews this law.' Consumer laws have somewhat improved since Mr Wood's story came to the public's attention, by including a notion of 'major failure'. However, they still remain unclear about a car owner's rights when their vehicle has a number of smaller problems like Mr Wood's. After Mr Wood's car was destroyed, a fire was lit to bring the rubble to nothing but scrap metal . Along with Lemon Laws for Australia and Lemon Vehicles in Australia, Mr Wood has launched several petitions and staged a number of events campaigning for more specific laws that address the holes in the legislation. They have sent out Lemon Law stickers to hundreds of Australians with 'lemon cars' in order to 'put pressure on the government and show that the movement is gaining momentum'. A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner'. Mr Woods car was destroyed over four hours with the help of 300 people who wielded bats and sledgehammers and shot bow and arrows at it at a demolition derby last year. More than 300 people turned out to either witness the public smashing or to take part in it . A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner' 'The car was spinning in the air with the auger through the top of the roof,' Mr Wood said. 'The whole car lifted two, maybe three foot off the ground before we crushed it and lit on fire.' He said the 'Pièce de résistance' was putting a flame to it and watching it burn before burying the scrap heap and laying flowers at the head of its makeshift burial plot. 'The serious side to it is that I shouldn't have had to destroy a $50,000 car,' he said. 'If the law was there today and if Chrysler group respected and looked after its customers then it wouldn't have had to happen.' Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000. Despite knowing he could make $28,000 by selling it himself, he said felt uncomfortable with the option. Mr Wood's apology can be seen in full on Thursday night at 8pm on ABC's The Checkout.

"Former NFL running back Lawrence Phillips is suspected of killing his cellmate in a Central California prison, it has emerged. Phillips, who was jailed in 2005, is serving a sentence of more than 31 years for choking his girlfriend in San Diego and driving his car into three teens after a pickup football game in Los Angeles. On Monday, prison officials revealed he is suspected of killing Damion Soward, a 37-year-old inmate from San Bernardino County serving 82 years to life for a first-degree murder conviction. Nebraska's Lawrence Phillips Phillips is suspected of killing his cellmate in a Central California prison . Soward was found lifeless on Saturday morning in the cell he shared with Phillips, 39, at  Kern Valley State Prison. He was later pronounced dead, prison spokesman Lt. Marshall Denning said in a statement. Phillips was once one of the nation's top college football players at Nebraska. He played for the St. Louis Rams, until being released in 1997 for insubordination. He also played for the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers. It wasn't clear if Phillips has an attorney. Prison officials said they suspect a second inmate at the prison of killing his cellmate. It's unclear if the two are related. John Munoz, a 24-year-old sentenced to 42 years on for sexual battery and other charges in Los Angeles County, is suspected of killing cellmate, 41-year-old Rattanak Kim, who was serving a sentence of 35-years to life for conspiracy to commit murder in San Diego County. Prison officials are investigating both deaths along with the Kern County Coroner and Kern County District Attorney, prison officials said.

"A 7ft 8in tall man  so embarrassed by his height he hid at home for 'half his life' has found love with a woman three feet smaller than him. Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28, developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for years. But true  happiness eventually found the shy Brazilian - who has come to be known as 'the gentle giant' - in the form of Evem Medeiros, a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online. Scroll down for video . Half his size: Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28 (right), who at 7ft 8in tall has come to be known as 'the gentle giant', married Evem Medeiros (left), a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online . 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size.' The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life. 'I get asked a lot about this and at first it annoyed me but nowadays it's normal and I am used to it. I take it in good humour,' explained the real-life Goliath. 'Some people like to talk about my shoe size and then imagine how big my member might be. 'I think the size of my feet is false advertising. Our love life is normal. We adapt. Lying down everyone is my size.' Happier times: Joelison developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for year . Joelison grew up in a small rural village in Paraiba, northern Brazil and was bullied from a young age due to his height. He got in trouble for fighting his tormentors and later decided to quit school altogether, much to the disappointment of his mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45. She said: 'From a young age I knew there was something not quite right with Joelison. 'When he was a baby and only a few months old the baby shoes stopped fitting his feet properly and I'd always have to go and buy more and more. 'I thought ""there’s something wrong here"" but the doctors said he was just a big baby and would stop growing eventually and so we waited for him to stop growing - but he still hasn’t stopped. True love: 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size' Joelison's mother added: 'When he got to eight years old I knew he was growing at an abnormal rate and by the time he was 14 he was already 6ft 4in. 'We lived in the rural zone and nobody knew him. For half of his life he had been hidden away. If anyone came to our house he was so shy he would hide so they wouldn’t see him. 'I was really worried.' Doctors later discovered he had a benign tumour on his pituitary gland that was causing his body to produce uncontrolled amounts of growth hormone. Joelison initially refused to have it removed as he didn't want to spend three months in hospital recovering, even though he was warned it would eventually kill him. But in 2007, after some convincing from his family, he agreed and had it removed using less invasive laser surgery performed through his nose. The successful operation helped slow his growth but he still sprouted another four inches to his current height of 7ft 8in. Long and the short of it: The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life, which he says they have 'adapted to' With the gigantism under control, Joelison's confidence grew. The computer games fan finally took a step into the public conscience and was eventually crowned Brazil's tallest man. One TV show took such pity on his plight they made him seven pairs of shoes to fit his enormous size 23 shoe size and custom shirts and shorts to fit his bulky frame. Joelison, who used to work in a gold mine as well as a plantation before leaving due to his health issues, now makes a living appearing in commercials for frozen ready meals. As a celebrity in his homeland he began to attract admirers, including new wife Evem. She contacted him on Facebook to wish him happy birthday and they swapped numbers before starting a committed relationship two months later. Mum: Joelison's mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45 (left), admits she's found it hard to adjust to her son's wife, claiming, 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him' 'She was basically my first woman. The first woman of my life. I was 28,' said Joelison. 'I thought everything about her was beautiful - but especially her eyes. 'She is very caring. She doesn't show it when the cameras are here but she is caring and truthful. She has never lied to me.' Just a year later they were married and it didn't take them long to start trying for a family. But Evem, who hopes to find work as a hair stylist, was initially wary of getting intimate. 'I had a certain amount of fear,' she said. 'I was afraid it wouldn't work out. But it was fine. We have a normal love life.' She added: 'We want to have a family so I track my dates, times, temperature, everything. All I have to do is call him and he understands what is going on. 'I have polycystic ovaries and so there are months that I don't ovulate. I've done my exams and already know that my condition makes it more difficult to get pregnant. 'But he hasn't done his tests so we need him to go and do it so we can see if the problem really is just me.' Joelison and Evem are currently trying to start a family, but having difficulty due to Evem's polycystic ovaries . Aside from family planning they also struggle to work together on basic chores like cooking, cleaning and shopping as Joelison's height makes it tough for him to stand up for long periods of time. His new relationship has also caused friction with his mother, who is finding it hard to let him have his independence after 28 years. She said: 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him and when I had to share him with someone else it really wasn’t easy. But as a mother I want him to be happy. 'With his treatment, I’m still the one who takes care of that, I haven’t delegated it to that girl yet. 'But I will once she gets used to things.' Joelison still has monthly injections and four types of daily medication to control his condition and is likely to need even more care as he gets older. However, he has still plans to fulfil many of his dreams, including having a family and travelling abroad. He also finally finished his high-school education last year after studying at home. On top of this, he is soon due to fly to a Paris convention where he will meet others with gigantism, including the tallest man in the world, Sultan Kösen from Turkey. And Joelison, who is thought to be the third tallest man in the world, says he is looking forward to the novelty of being smaller than someone for once. 'The most interesting thing is going to be standing face to face with someone,' he said. 'The last time I did that I was a child.'

"As Andy Murray and Kim Sears prepare for their nuptials in his home town of Dunblane on Saturday, the local residents are also getting ready for the big day. The inhabitants of the Scottish cathedral town have gone into overdrive for wedding of their most famous resident, lining the streets with bunting and creating special-themed produce in many of the stories. Since the Wimbledon champion announced his plans to say 'I do' at the cathedral, there have also been plans to line the streets with well-wishers as the couple make their way to the venue. Andy Murray and Kim Sears are preparing to marry in his home town of Dunblane this weekend . Messages to the happy couple are in many of the shop windows and several business owners have already sent gifts to either Andy, 27, or his bride-to-be ahead of the big day. Lesley Anderson, 52, who owns Point Nouveau Bridal shop in Dunblane, sent a crystal-covered garter to Kim Sears six weeks ago and received kind a thank you note which said it was 'gorgeous'. The ivory-coloured piece is hand-embroidered on the inside with the couple's initials and wedding date and was designed by Nicola Ure from K C Bridal specialists in Falkirk. A handmade card featuring Andy and Kim, 27, on the front drawn by local artist Lorna Brown accompanied the garter. Local shops and shop owners are preparing their shop fronts to reflect the great day . Many of the local businesses have decorated their shop fronts with colourful bunting . The card shows Andy in his kilt holding a tennis racket and Kim in her dress along with their Border Terriers. Kim's reply to the gifts read: 'Dear Lesley and all at Point Nouveau Bridal. 'Just a little note to say a huge thank you for the gorgeous gift Nicola made for me. 'It was very kind of you and I hadn't found a garter yet so thanks ever so much. 'Also, that card of Lorna Brown's is absolutely fabulous! It really made us giggle, especially our two little dogs in the background!

Kim replied with a handwritten note (right . Lesley is close friends with Andy's grandmother, Shirley Erskine, 83 and gave the garter and card to her to take to Kim. She said: 'Out of the blue we got this beautiful card. To be honest we never ever thought we would hear very much at all so when we got this beautiful card we were chuffed to bits. 'I was absolutely delighted. This was such a personal thing. We were really, really chuffed. Andy continues to maintain a close bond with the town - after winning Wimbledon,  he shook hands with all the shop owners on the Dunblane High street. When Murray, 27, says 'I do' on April 11, the guests wishing them well will be largely a gathering of close family and friends. A local butcher has poems about the happy couple in the shop window . Murray's status as one of the world's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from A-list celebrities such as James Corden to the Prime Minister and even the Queen. But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman. Indeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.' A sign telling people about parking restrictions around Dunblane Cathedral ahead of Andy's wedding to Kim . Murray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such. 'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. '[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. 'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.' There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple will hold their nuptials . Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend. For the 27-year-old's many fans and friends in the town,  at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns. Kim shows off her engagement ring at the Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia, last January . The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Andy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim's been pretty much doing it' 'I've tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven't been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn't think I was going to. He added: 'It's a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now. She seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change.'","Andy Murray and Kim Sears are getting married in Dunblane this weekend .

"We know him as 'Success Kid' - the toddler with a clenched fist and look of satisfaction who's become the internet's most positive meme. But now Sam Griner is eight years old and is using his online fame to help out his sick dad. His mother, Laney Griner from Jacksonville, Florida, set up a GoFundMe page to raise the $75,000 her husband, Justin, needs for the kidney transplant and years of subsequent medications. 'Please help us reach our goal so that Justin may get the pre-treatments and transplant he desperately needs,' she wrote on the fundraising page. Scroll down for video . Plea: Sammy Griner is pictured with his 39-year-old father, Justin, who needs a kidney transplant . Famous face: Sammy is better known as the face of the 'Success Kid' meme. His mother snapped the photo - which actually shows him just moments before trying to put sand in his mouth - when he was 11 months . 'His mother died from this disease, please help us write a different story for Justin and his son, Sam.' By Tuesday afternoon, the page had raised more than $38,000 of the goal. Although Griner initially decided against using the notoriety of 'Success Kid' to help raise funds, she eventually spoke to The Daily Dot about the campaign because of her fears for her husband. Justin, 39, discovered his kidneys were failing before the birth of their son and he now spends about four hours a day, three days a week undergoing dialysis, Mrs Griner told ABC News. He is unable to work and never has energy, she said. The longer he is on the dialysis, the higher the chance that he could develop complications. 'Six years on dialysis is getting to be a long time,' she said. 'It's wearing on him.' Sign of success: His face has since been used to create the internet's most positive meme, pictured . Grimace: An image shows Sammy, who is now eight years old, posing beside a t-shirt bearing his face . The funds will supplement the money Medicare puts towards the procedure. The family will also need $12,000 for just the first year of medications, although he'll be on drugs for the rest of his life. It is also not yet clear where the kidney will come from and so the family is also using the GoFundMe page to ask strangers to see if they could be a match. So far, no friends or family members have proved a match, she told The Daily Dot, and getting on a list for a deceased donor can take at least five years. 'We certainly prefer a living donor because the prognosis seems to be much better,' she said. 'We're certainly not opposed [to waiting for a donor], but obviously, the sooner the better for us all.' To help raise awareness about her husband's need for a kidney, she turned to her son for help. Mrs Griner had snapped the photo of Sammy on the beach when he was 11 months old. The image looks as if he is punching the air - but she said he was actually about to put sand in his mouth. Close: Justin, pictured, discovered his kidneys were failing before Sam was born and receives dialysis . Appeal: The boy's mother, Laney, said she initially didn't want to use the boy's famous face to raise funds because she wanted the focus to be on Justin, but she said she just wants to see him healthy . She put the photo on her Flickr page in 2007 and two years later, she noticed that it was being used for memes before eventually becoming the beloved 'Success Kid' meme around 2010. His face has featured on billboard, TV commercials and t-shirts, which Mrs Griner called both 'weird' and 'awesome'. 'By now, it's just out there,' she said. 'What am I going to do? At least it's positive. Without that happening, how much could I get this recognition about my husband's kidney transplant?' There are more than 100,000 people waiting for a kidney transplant in the U.S., and of the 29,531 kidney transplants carried out last year, 23,715 were from living donors, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.","Sam Griner was just 11 months old when his mother snapped him clenching his fist on the beach and posted the image online .
Years later, she learned it had become the popular 'Success Kid' meme .
Sammy's father, Justin, has been on dialysis for six years and is in need of a kidney transplant so the family is now appealing for help .
They have set up a GoFundMe page to try to find him a kidney and to raise the $75,000 he will need for the procedure and medication ."
"A new mother who 'died' for 11 minutes during her son's birth woke up four days later with no memory of ever being pregnant or having her baby. Hilary Wilson, from Whitchurch, Shropshire, was technically dead for a terrifying 11 minutes after suffering a severe cardiac arrest as her son, Felix, was being born. The 41-year-old woke up four days later, with absolutely no idea that she had been pregnant, or that she had given birth to Felix just days earlier. It was only when she saw a picture of her new baby wearing her children's hand-me-downs that she realised he was her son. Hilary Wilson had a cardiac arrest during a Caesarean section  and 'died' for 11 minutes. When she woke up, she had no idea she had been pregnant or given birth to her son Felix (pictured now at nine months old) Mrs Wilson only realised she had a son when someone showed her a picture of Felix wearing a baby grow that her other children had worn when they were born, and it 'clicked' that he was her son . The mother-of-three has defied the odds and made a remarkable recovery, despite being given just a 30 per cent chance of survival and an 85 per cent possibility of brain damage. Mrs Wilson, a translator, said: 'When I woke up, my friends and family would talk to me about Felix, but I had no idea what they were on about. 'I was trying to make sense out of everything - I didn't know where I was or what had happened - I had no idea that I'd ever been pregnant or just had a baby. 'It wasn't until my sister showed me a picture of Felix that things very slowly started to fall into place. Her older sons, Sebastian, six, and Lucas, four, had both worn a white baby grow with blue piping when they were newborns. 'Felix was wearing it in the picture - so I thought he must have been mine,' said Mrs Wilson. 'I knew no one else would have one like it, so when I saw him wearing it, I thought he must be mine. 'I made the conscious decision to believe what everyone was telling me, even though I'm not quite sure I'd accepted it just yet.' An amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but serious condition that occurs when amniotic fluid — the fluid that surrounds a baby in the uterus during pregnancy — or fetal material, such as hair, enters the maternal bloodstream. An amniotic fluid embolism is most likely to occur during childbirth or immediately afterward. Signs and symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism might include: . Source: Mayo Clinic . She added: 'When I met him when he was six days old, I didn't really feel like he was mine - I wasn't interested in holding him, and I was happy for my mum to give him cuddles instead of me. 'It wasn't until I was well enough to go back to the maternity ward and could breastfeed Felix that I really started to bond with him. 'Slowly, vague memories of being pregnant and giving birth returned, and I gradually started to feel the instinct to look after him. 'Now, Felix and I have a wonderful relationship, and the whole ordeal almost feels like a dream.' Mrs Wilson suffered an amniotic fluid embolism. This is where the amniotic fluid – the liquid inside the sac in which the baby grows - or other matter from the foetus, such as hair, cells or other debris, gets into the mother's bloodstream. The condition can lead to seizures, coma, and cardiac arrest, where electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic and it suddenly stops pumping blood around the body. Mrs Wilson had been in labour for 12 hours when doctors decided to perform a Caesarean. Just as baby Felix, now nine months, was being lifted out of the womb, Mrs Wilson went into cardiac arrest. She said: 'I remember feeling sick, and seconds later I had a cardiac arrest. 'They did CPR on me for 11 minutes and I had adrenaline injected into my heart. 'I lost four fifths of my blood because they hadn't finished the surgery on my C-section - I had to have a blood transfusion and was put on life support. 'I woke up four days later and had no idea what was going on - all I knew was that I was in a lot of pain. Mrs Wilson  was given just a 30 per cent chance of survival. Thankfully she made a remarkable recovery and is now at home with her family ((from left to right) Felix, Lucas, four, Sebastian, six, and husband Barry . Mrs Wilson can only remember vague details of being pregnant or Felix's birth. But he is now a 'perfectly healthy, smiley little baby', she said, and they are 'completely bonded' 'I was trying to make sense of everything around me, I thought maybe I was paralysed, or that I'd died - I eventually decided that I must be having a nightmare. 'I remember someone telling me that Felix was fine, but I was so confused - so many people would visit me and mention him, but I had no clue who they were talking about.' Family and friends showed Hilary photographs of her new son, but she remained confused and unable to recall any details about him. She said: 'I knew that the pain I was feeling was coming from my stomach, so when people talked about the baby, I thought it would make sense that my tummy hurt if I'd just had a Caesarean. 'But I wrestled with the idea of believing it, because whilst it all made sense, I couldn't remember. 'My sister showed me a picture of Felix on her iPad, and when I saw the baby grow he was wearing, something clicked. 'It was very strange - one minute I would have a grasp on reality, and the next I would be all over the place again.' Mrs Wilson finally met Felix for the first time when he was six days old, but she still struggled to accept that he was her baby. Mrs Wilson said she burst into tears when she saw Felix for the first time (he is pictured in hospital). She said: 'I was sad that such a little baby had been all on his own for the past week' 'After that he was brought in once a day, but the bonding process only really began when I was able to breast feed him. 'The nurses had used a breast pump on me while I was sedated, so I was still able to breast feed. 'I was so pleased that my husband allowed the medics to do that - breast feeding is really important to me, and it allowed me to bond with Felix. 'I finally started to truly accept that he was mine.' After spending two weeks in hospital, Mrs Wilson and Felix returned home. 'I can only vaguely remember my pregnancy and giving birth - some things come back to me, but I'll see pictures of me before I had the baby, and I had no recollection of him. 'The past 12 months are pretty hazy, but I have to accept that I may never get my memories back. 'It's bizarre to look back on what happened, it's almost like a dream. 'Life is never going to be the same again - the day Felix was born was like a re-birthday for me because it's given me a whole new perspective. 'It's made me realise how precious life is, and I'm grateful for every single day I have.'

"A senior Islamist party official convicted of crimes against humanity has been executed in Bangladesh. Mohammad Qamaruzzaman was hanged around 10.30pm on Saturday inside a jail in Dhaka. The assistant secretary general of the Jamaat-e-Islami party headed a militia group that collaborated with the Pakistani army in the 1971 independence war and was behind the killing of around 120 unarmed farmers, prosecutors said.

"Amy Murray (pictured) assaulted a woman during a screening of Fifty Shades of Grey after people became annoyed with her for laughing at the sex scenes . A single mother was arrested during a screening of Fifty Shades of Grey and led from the cinema in handcuffs after drunkenly assaulting a fellow film-goer who was annoyed at her for laughing at the sex scenes. Amy Murray, 23, of Brightlingsea, Essex, rowed with fellow cinema-goers during a screening of the adult-only film after people sitting in the row in front of her and her friend became annoyed at them. An argument broke out and Murray hit Jessica Deadman, 23, while drunkenly gesturing with her hand. Police were called to the Century Cinema in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, on February 18 just before the end of the film. Simon Bravery, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was rude to people and appeared to be fairly threatening in her language towards them. 'In the end she was challenged and told she would be removed. 'This kind of behaviour continued for 20 minutes. Other people present were disturbed by her actions.' He said following an argument Murray swung her hand and hit Ms Deadman, who had been watching the film with friends. Paul Baker, defending, said: 'Miss Murray is a single parent of a four-year-old son and is someone who rarely goes out. 'A friend of hers bought a ticket to go to the cinema on this particular date. 'Miss Murray was reluctant to go but her friend persuaded her to. 'Her friend wanted to make an evening of it and they went to a local public house and alcohol was consumed by both parties. 'While in the cinema they continued to drink alcohol and by the time the incident happened she was in a pretty poor state of sobriety. 'She and her friends were finding the content of the film somewhat amusing but people sitting in the row in front of them took exception to the hilarity they were finding. 'At that point an argument broke out and there was a frank exchange of views.' Police were called to the Century Cinema (pictured) on February 18 just before the end of the erotic film after an argument broke out and Murray hit Jessica Deadman while drunkenly gesturing with her hand . Mr Baker said that Murray hit Mrs Deadman while drunkenly gesturing with her hand and that she accepts she was reckless. Speaking following the case, Miss Murray said: 'I'm remorseful and embarrassed. I'm a single mum and don't get out very much - and had drunk too much. 'I'm very sorry about what happened.' Murray admitted charges of assault and being drunk and disorderly when she appeared before magistrates in Colchester. She was given a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £50 compensation and £100 in costs.

Billy Thompson was last seen on Saturday at Sugar Bear's home in McIntyre, Georgia, where Mama June's daughter Jessica was preparing to go to prom. Since then Billy hasn't been seen and he isn't returning any phone calls or texts. Scroll down for video . Reality star 'Mama' June Shannon and her estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson have filed a missing persons report after his older brother disappeared three days ago . Billy Thompson, center, was last seen on Saturday at Sugar Bear's home in McIntyre, Georgia, where Mama June's daughter Jessica was preparing to go to prom . The family have filed a report with the local police department and are especially worried because Billy has been struggling to find work and recently suffered a difficult split from the mother of his children, reports TMZ. The family's popular reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was cancelled by TLC after photos emerged of Shannon spending time with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel. June's oldest daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, has accused McDaniel of repeatedly abusing her when she was just a child. In the wake of the cancellation, Thompson's younger brother - Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson – revealed to The National Enquirer  that Shannon had indulged in a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and older brother Billy back in 2007. 'June said all of the kids were out of the house and Billy came over to visit them,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer in December. 'Billy happened to see her in her undergarments. He then told June, ""If you are dressed like that when I get back, I'm going to have sex with you.""' Billy, pictured with June's daughter Jessica on the day of Mama June and Sugar Bear's wedding in May 2013 hasn't been seen since April 11 and isn't returning phone calls or texts . Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson, above, claimed in December that Mama June had enjoyed a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and his older brother Billy . Poodle then says that when Billy came back June was 'naked in bed and they ended up having a threesome.' When asked about the incident, Billy said he 'couldn't remember.' In the wake of the Enquirer's revelation, Poodle posted a text message exchange he had with June in which she reportedly told him; 'IM GOING TO CONFRONT EVERYONE ON EVERYTHING BCYES YOU HAVE STARTED SOME LIES.' She then reportedly wrote; 'OH AND YEAH YOUR FAKE DATE WITH NATIONAL ENQUIOR WHEN YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT ME BILLY AND SUGAR BEAR IT'S OKAY BC THAT IS MY PAST.' Mama June didn't respond officially to the claims, and Uncle Poodle refused to back down. 'I would be more than happy to take another polygraph test (based) on what June told me,' he said. 'If she denies it.'","'Mama' June Shannon and Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson have filed a missing persons report after his older brother disappeared three days ago .

"Tinder has added the ability to let people add their latest Instagram snaps to their profile. The firm's latest update automatically shows the latest pictures posted to Facebook's site. Tinder also said it had improved its mutual friends feature. Scroll down for video . Tinder will now display the last 34 pictures of a person's Instagram feed - and allow users to see more. Simply open Tinder, go to your new profile, and connect it to your Instagram account with a single tap - your Tinder profile will automatically start displaying your recent Instagram photos. Tinder only displays the last 34 photos, users can venture out to the app for a look at the full library. 'You asked, we listened,' the firm said. 'We’ve made some exciting new changes to your Tinder profile including a slick, new Instagram integration and more common friends.' The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. 'Now there’s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story (we got sick of having to do that, too).' It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. 'And in case you were wondering, Tinder won’t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings.' Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its 'mutual friends' feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. 'This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe,' Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out ‘Tinder Plus’, a premium service allowing people to ‘undo’ a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app. Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of ‘likes’ a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them ‘You’re Out of Likes’, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But, below this clock, a big red button says ‘Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus’. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around £1.49 a month to as high as £14.99 - but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay £17.88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping £179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying £162 more than others over the course of a year.

"The time is around 9pm on a Thursday and 7,000 people are chanting ‘YES! YES! YES!’ in a pitch-black car park in London’s Docklands. It’s been raining and the ground is damp, but we are all in our bare feet, which are going numb on the cold, hard concrete. Undeterred, we keep going. There’s a drum pounding in the distance and we keep step with its beat. Marianne Power attended Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminarwhich claims to ‘discover how to identify what it is you really want' The mood is tribal. I feel as if we’re on our way to a ritual killing. Maybe our own. We’ve already signed waivers warning us that what we are about to take part in could result in ‘physical or emotional injury, paralysis, death . . .’ and we’ve spent the past half-an-hour being told what we need to do to avoid hospitalisation. I feel sick with anticipation, but there’s no way out — the huge crowd keeps pushing me forward. Then, the chanting stops and a hush fills the air. We are faced with our fate. It glimmers grey and red in the darkness: lanes of burning hot coals, which we are to walk over. Yes, actually walk over — with our bare feet. We have spent the past two hours preparing for this moment — being whipped into something called ‘peak state’, a place where you are so mentally strong that you can do anything. The idea is that, once you overcome the fear of walking on coals of between 1,200 and 2,000 Fahrenheit, you can ‘conquer the other fires of your life with ease’. But I don’t conquer anything with ease. It’s not in my nature. ‘Am I really doing this?’ is all I can think. But yes, I am. For the past year, I’ve been on a self-improvement mission. Fed up with a life spent worrying, single and broke, I’ve set myself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month. Marianne (pictured) has set herself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month and this month she chose that of Anthony Robbins . And, when it comes to the self-improvement world, Anthony Robbins is the king. Everyone from world leaders — Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev — to athletes such as Serena Williams and actors including Hugh Jackman seek his counsel. He even helped Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. His IS a classic rags-to-riches story. Determined to transcend his poor childhood, he became obsessed with self-improvement. He’d listen to motivational tapes on his way to his job as a janitor, before going on to give motivational talks himself. Fast forward to today and he is a bestselling author and hugely successful business man, whose net worth is in the region of half a billion dollars. He charges $1 million to coach private clients — which is why the rest of us have to settle for listening to him in a concert hall. Anthony Robbins (pictured in the 1990s) charges $1 million to coach private clients and is the 'king' of the self-improvement world . According to his website, Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminar would help me ‘discover how to identify what it is you really want, break through any barriers that might be holding you back, increase your energy and mental clarity, and infuse passion into your life’. Big promises. But the fortysomething woman next to me in the queue to get in promises that he can deliver. She has been three times before, she tells me. ‘When you walk over those coals, something changes,’ she says, her eyes wide. ‘I can’t explain it, but it’s just amazing.’ She has all the fervour of a fanatic. Two physiotherapists from Windsor join in our conversation — they’ve been sent here by their boss. ‘He went last year and got a lot out of it,’ they say. ‘He was on a high for weeks.’ And ‘high’ is the perfect word for the atmosphere. As we file into the arena, there’s chaos as people rush to get good seats — but no one sits in them. They’re too busy dancing along with the music blasting from the speakers. It’s like being at a One Direction concert. After half-an-hour, Tony walks on stage and the screaming goes off the scale. People can hardly contain themselves in the presence of the 6 ft 7 in mountain of a man. With his Hollywood tan, white teeth and lantern jaw, he looks like something that a Mills & Boon writer would dream up. And just to add to the effect, his chiselled face is blown up to God-like proportions on massive screens behind him. It takes minutes for the applause to die down enough for him to speak — but when he starts, he doesn’t stop. His basic message is that anything is possible if we just get our minds and bodies into what he calls the peak state. He says we are all defined by our limiting beliefs and that if we get rid of these then ‘the impossible just gets done’. He is the King of the Catchphrase: ‘It’s impossible to love yourself when you’re not being yourself’; ‘Change your story, change your life . . .’ These nuggets come out of his mouth from 1pm to 9pm. He doesn’t take a tea break and neither do we. It’s extraordinary — I’ve never seen anything like it. Just the sheer energy of him. I find myself thinking that he is the living embodiment of human potential, then I realise I’m swooning. Even world leaders like Nelson Mandela (left) and Bill Clinton (right) have sought the advice and counsel of Anthony Robbins . I turn to the Norwegian man next to me and say: ‘I think I’m in love . . .’ He smiles and says: ‘Me, too.’ We are all under his spell and will do anything he says, including hugging and high-fiving strangers, and punching our fists in the air while yelling: ‘Yes, yes, yes!’ It’s just so un-English. There are moments when I look around at the collective madness and feel as if I’ve become part of a cult, but I have to make a decision: get embarrassed or go with it. I go with it. As the day goes on, we examine our ‘limiting beliefs’. I identify mine as being bad with money and always getting sick. And then he asks us to visualise what life would be like if we got rid of these limiting beliefs. I imagine being healthy, energetic and productive, someone who just gets things done without always worrying about the things that can go wrong. I imagine my bank account being in the black and owning a property. To build on this vision, we’re taught how to get into a peak state by thinking of the best moment of our lives, the moment we felt strongest and most at peace. I think of times with loved ones and professional achievements that I’m proud of. Each time we do we are told to ‘make a move’, so every time we make that move in the future, these memories will come back. I pump my fist in the air, again and again and again. I can’t believe I’m doing it — it’s so not me. I feel as if I’m in the film Rocky. And then the time comes to walk on fire. We’re told to take off our shoes and socks and march out of the conference centre to the 8 ft lines of coal in the car park. Robbins is said to have also helped well-known face including Princess Diana (left) and former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher (right) A part of me wants to run away, but a bigger part of me knows that I can do this. Then I’m standing in front of the coals and two men are instructing me to shout: ‘YES!’ I do. They say ‘Make your move!’ and I pump my fist in the air. Then, I go for it. I put my foot on the coals and after that I remember nothing — until my last step, when I could feel heat. I have half-a-second of panic when I realise what I’m doing — but, by then, my feet are on the cold square of grass put at the end of the fire and my feet are being hosed down by helpers. It’s done. I’ve walked across a bed of hot coals. Two weeks later, I still cannot answer those questions, but I find myself having the same thoughts as the woman I met in the queue at the start of that day. That strange moment of collective hysteria, when we walked over hot coals, has changed something within me. If I can walk on fire without barbecuing my feet, what else can I do? I’m very keen to find out. To follow Marianne’s self-help journey, go to helpmeblog.net .","Marianne Power decided to live by a different self-help guru each month .

"An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) – a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph'. Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus, . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'. Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years'. The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown . 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different ""Lord's suppers"" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times: ‘I think I’ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb.’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected.’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection, which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab, while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The James Ossuary is kept in a secret location by its owner, who lives in Tel Aviv.","Geologist ran 150 chemical tests on ossuaries and 'Jesus Family tomb'

"ISIS has publicly beheaded six men accused of exploding a car bomb 'which killed innocent people' in the Syrian city of al-Mayadin. The terrorist group's latest barbaric video shows a large crowd gathering to watch the bloody execution of the men it claims are soldiers fighting for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. They are all marched to a small wooden stump and instructed to kneel, before an Islamic State militant carries out brutal retaliation by taking their heads off with a sharpened blade. Scroll down for video . Murderous: A gruesome video has emerged showing a masked Jihadi (pictured) beheading six men accused by Islamic State of exploding a car bomb in a Syrian city it controls . Gruesome: One by one, the alleged soldiers of Syrian President Bashar Al Assad's regime are marched to a wooden stump and killed in front of a large crowd of men and young boys (pictured) Killer: The executioner calmly wipes the blood from his sharpened blade after the fourth beheading in the six-minute propaganda video which was filmed in the city of al-Mayadin . One by one, the alleged fighters are paraded in front of men and very young boys and their are heads carefully placed on a wooden platform, before they are taken clean off. The shocking video surfaced on ISIS' vast social media channels. The footage cuts from the merciless killings to shots of injured children and adults - allegedly from the car bomb the doomed men exploded in the city. The beginning of the six-minute long propaganda video - posted online on April 5 - depicts a seemingly normal day in the ISIS-held territory in eastern Syria. Men gather to pray at a local mosque, shackled captives are herded into the backs of trucks and men are flogged in public for unknown crimes. The footage sharply cuts to the complete destruction of an al-Mayadin neighbourhood where locals frantically retrieve body parts from the rubble, extinguish fires and carry the wounded to shelter. An announcer then tells a furious horde the men are Alawites, a derogatory term used by Islamist fundamentalists to describe President Assad's soldiers. Executed: A masked ISIS militant announces to the crowd that the men (pictured) have been sentenced to death by an Islamic Court 'for waging war on God' Cruel: As a large crowd gathers, the Jihadi (pictured) says: 'Whoever kills the Muslims and spills their blood, their reward is slaughter' Destruction: The executions of the men was retaliation for the car bomb they allegedly exploded in a al-Mayadin neighbourhood (pictured) - killing children and civilians . He says the execution is 'qisas' - or retaliation - for their alleged attack and imposed by the Islamic court for 'waging war on God and his messenger'. Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi - a Research Fellow at the Middle East Forum at Kings College London - translated the militant's speech for MailOnline. In front of the amassing crowd he says: 'Whoever kills the Muslims and spills their blood, their reward is slaughter.' 'Just as God Almighty said: ""Strike them upon their necks and strike from them every fingertip"" for this evil element that blew up its car there and terrorised the Muslims.' Al-Mayadin is one of two locations where ISIS has opened 'recruitment offices' to induct children into their ranks, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Caliphate: The beginning of the video released on ISIS' social media channels depicts everyday life in its state, which includes the public flogging of men who committed unknown crimes (pictured) Breeding ground: Islamic State has allegedly recruited over 400 child soldiers from the eastern Syrian city of al-Mayadin where the militants proudly fly the notorious black flag used by Islamist terror groups . It reported that as of March 23 at least 400 young children from the city and nearby al-Bokamal had joined the terrorist group's Ashbal al-Khilafah, 'the cubs of the caliphate'. These offices convince and attract children who live in ISIS-controlled territory and who go to its closely monitored and propaganda-fueled schools and mosques. They are encouraged to come to the squares where brutal executions, whippings, crucifixions and beheadings are routinely carried out. But the number of foreign fighters joining Islamic State in the first three months of 2015 is believed to be the least since it self-declared a global 'caliphate' in 2014, SOHR claims.","'Soldiers' were sentenced to death by Islamic Court 'for waging war on God'

"Nigel Farage (above) faced claims of a ‘cover-up’ last night for censoring a poll that suggests he is on course for a humiliating personal defeat in the General Election . Nigel Farage faced claims of a ‘cover-up’ last night for censoring a poll that suggests he is on course for a humiliating personal defeat in the General Election. The secret Ukip-commissioned poll, leaked to The Mail on Sunday, shows that Farage has fallen behind his Tory opponent in the Kent seat he is contesting. And he is in danger of finishing third, with Labour catching up fast. If the poll is accurate, it could end Farage’s political career as he has vowed to resign as Ukip leader if he fails to win South Thanet. The ComRes poll was commissioned last month by multimillionaire businessman and former Tory Arron Banks, who defected to Ukip last year and gave the party £1million. Ukip hoped the Thanet poll would echo an earlier one showing Farage heading for a famous victory, and they planned to use it to whip up more support. But when the result came through, Farage had a shock. It showed Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay, a former Ukip activist, on 30 points, one ahead of Farage, with Labour only one behind. Farage was so alarmed he gave orders for the findings to be hushed up to avoid causing panic in Ukip ranks – and encouraging his rivals. Ukip officials spent last week trying to deny a cover-up. But yesterday, a spokesman finally admitted it had buried the survey, claiming the results were ‘unreliable’ and that it was a ‘rogue poll’. The censored poll is not the only sign that the wheels may be coming off Farage’s bandwagon, nationally and locally. The party won last year’s European elections with a sensational 27.5 per cent of the vote, compared to 24 for the Conservatives. But nationally Ukip’s support is now down to 14 per cent, while the Tories have risen to 34. Ukip hopes of becoming a major parliamentary force received a huge boost when two Tory defectors, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, won stunning by-election victories last year in Clacton and Rochester respectively. The poll showed Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay (left), a former Ukip activist, on 30 points, one ahead of Farage. Above, Mackinlay is pictured with Sol Campbell campaigning . However, the decline in support for Ukip has led to most pundits predicting they will end up with a maximum of five MPs in May. If the censored poll is accurate, Farage may not be one of them, and that will leave Ukip in search of a new leader. Farage raised the Thanet stakes dramatically when he said in his recent autobiography that he would stand down as leader if he loses. ‘The consequences of me failing to secure a seat for myself in the Commons would be significant for me and the party,’ he wrote. Graphics show the results of the censored Thanet poll (above) and the growing support for the Conservatives (below) ‘It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat of my own. What credibility would Ukip have in the Commons if others had to enunciate party policy in Parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest?’ He added: ‘Am I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms pub? No – if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.’ If he resigns, Carswell, considered almost certain to retain his Clacton seat, is one of the favourites to succeed him. It could lead to a change in direction for Ukip: Carswell was horrified by Farage’s comments about banning immigrants who are HIV positive. Carswell could face a fight from the more telegenic Ukip Euro MP and former journalist Patrick O’Flynn. David Cameron has made stopping Farage in his tracks in Thanet one of his top Election priorities. The constituency was the first stop last week on Samantha Cameron’s Election tour itinerary. Tory-supporting former England footballer Sol Campbell visited Thanet yesterday to help the anti-Ukip campaign. Ukip has accused the Tories of using ‘dirty tricks’ against Farage. They rejected claims that photographs purporting to show him drinking in a pub in the constituency were in reality taken in a pub 70 miles away. A Ukip spokesman said the ComRes poll’s headline figures greatly understated Farage’s support because it included people who were not likely to vote and who tended to lean towards the traditional parties. ‘The poll shows that among those likely to vote, Nigel Farage is seven points ahead of both the Conservatives and Labour in South Thanet.’ A Conservative spokesman said: ‘The fact that Ukip commissioned this poll but then tried to cover it up when they didn’t like the results shows their true colours.’ ComRes declined to comment. ComRes interviewed 1,003 people in South Thanet between March 13-18.","Ukip-commissioned poll shows Farage in danger of finishing third .

"An enormous diorama which shows the full extent of the Battle of Waterloo has gone on display to mark the 200th anniversary of the conflict. The model contains more than 30,000 figures, and illustrates all the key moments of the battle which allowed the Duke of Wellington to defeat Napoleon's forces. It was built in the 1970s, but fell into disrepair before being restored to its former glory just in time for the battle's bicentenary, which falls on June 18 of this year. Scroll down for video . Model: This diorama shows the full extent of the Battle of Waterloo, which took place almost exactly 200 years ago . General: Napoleon, pictured riding a white horse, is shown directing his troops in the unsuccessful attempt to defeat the British forces . Victor: Wellington, wearing a blue jacket with his right arm outstretched, won the battle and has been known as one of Britain's greatest generals ever since . Light-hearted: The diorama shows little vignettes such as a British soldier relieving himself against a tree . The 25sq/m model has 21,500 soldiers and 10,000 horses, illustrating not just the major military events of the battle but also a number of light-hearted vignettes. Despite the enormous scale of the diorama, the number of troops featured is just a third of the true number who were killed or wound in the battle - and less than 10 per cent of the total number who took part. It is on display at the Royal Green Jackets Museum in Winchester, where it will serve as the centrepiece for the commemoration of the Battle of Waterloo. The diorama was not intended as a snapshot of the battle at any one point, but instead it depicts five different key stages in the progress of the conflict. Crucial: One of the key moments depicted is the battle for Hougoumont, a fortress which was successfully defended by Wellington . Melee: The British forming a square in the face of attacks from Napoleon's troops . Charge: The Scots Greys making an intervention in the battle, whose 200th anniversary is this year . Indomitable: A farmer successfully defended his vegetable patch even as the battle raged all around him . Busted: Two British soldiers are depicted trying to sneak off with their regiment's entire ration of gin . The first is the Battle for Hougoumont, a castle successfully defended by Wellington, followed by the attempt by d'Erlon Corps to attack Wellington's centre, which was repelled by Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Picton. Next is the Charge of the Heavy Brigade, the Allied cavalry offensive that scattered the French infantry, then the unsuccessful French cavalry attacks on Wellington's centre and right flank. The final crucial moment depicted is the attack of the Imperial Guard, Napoleon's last desperate throw of the dice, which led to the guard being forced to retreat for the first time ever. Both the Duke of Wellington and Napoleon Bonaparte can be found on the model astride their horses directing the battle. There is also a grim depiction of Major General Sir William Ponsonby meeting his end - being speared by a group of French lancers. Grim: Major General William Ponsonby being cut down by a group of French lancers during the battle . Onslaught: French troops trying to break through the gates of Hougoumont, as the British guard the walls . Help: A wounded soldier being escorted off the battlefield by his wife, who was apparently acting as a camp nurse . Family: Women and children in the back of a cart on the edges of the Waterloo battlefield . Quagmire: Men, carts and horses get stuck in a muddy pit and try to haul their equipment out . Lighter moments include a Belgian farmer defending his prized vegetable patch while the battle rages around him, two English soldiers getting drunk on gin and an infantryman relieving himself against a tree. A large French fighter who was known as 'The Enforcer' can be seen trying to break down an English barricade with an axe. Museum curator Vere Hayes said: 'There are so many vignettes within the diorama. 'One of my favourites is the gardener at Hougoumont. He and his family meant to escape before the battle but left it too late. He is portrayed on the model protecting his cabbages. Many French attackers saw him during the battle and laughed at his actions. 'The 200th anniversary of Waterloo is a landmark commemoration of a decisive victory that brought peace to Europe after years of conflict. 'Whilst thousands will be making the trip to Belgium to participate in and witness re-enactments on the battlefield, we can bring the battlefield to Britain.' Late arrival: Von Blucher leading the Prussian troops onto the battlefield, in a decisive intervention . Repair: The diorama was in a poor condition before being restored ahead of the anniversary . Spruced up: These images show how the figures were covered in dust before their recent restoration . Conservation: Kelvin and Mary Thatcher used a vacuum cleaner to help remove the grime which had built up . Conservationists Kelvin and Mary Thatcher spent five months cleaning the figures on the diorama, and glued back together scores of severed limbs, lost swords and displaced cannonballs. Mr Hayes added: 'The diorama was made in the 1970s by Valhalla Models and acquired by the museum in the 1980s. But it never had a top put on it so has got extremely dusty over the years. 'Kelvin and Mary Thatcher took it apart in 16 sections and took four sections at a time back to their home in Norfolk where they cleaned each individual figure using an air hose and a vacuum cleaner. 'They have done a fantastic job and it is great to be able to see the incredible detail so clearly.' The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time. France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington. The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am. The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Blücher arrived at the head of a Prussian army. This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender. The battle forced Napoleon from the throne of France, leading to his exile on St Helena - but Wellington later admitted it was 'the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life'. Despite the popular image of Waterloo as a heroic endeavour, it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed, with the French bearing the brunt of the losses.","Diorama at the Green Jackets Museum in Winchester shows the extent of the battle in June 1815 .

But a year later, after intensive recovery, both men have returned to the sport they love - and Mr Carey has even retraced his steps to successfully jump from the bridge. Austin Carey (bottom) and Jay Rawe (right) were left with broken vertebrae after a base jump off Pennine Bridge in Idaho went wrong and the fall almost killed them, one year on both have returned to the sport . Mr Carey was told he may never walk again after being injured, but he recovered to return to the jump this year . The pair had been attempting a risky 'totem pole waterfall' manoeuvre when Jay lost his balance and pulled out his friend's parachute and landed inside of it. The jump on March 24 last year was being recorded by spectators and they watched as the pair spiraled to the beach below. Stunned spectators - who recorded the near-fatal fall - could only gasp in horror as they spiralled onto the beach below. Both suffered fractures to the spine - and Mr Carey was told he might not walk again. Last month - almost a year to the day - the 23-year-old retraced his steps by successfully base jumping again from the Perrine Bridge. He said: 'It was such an amazing feeling to be back there after everything I had been through and all the work I have put into making my dream of jumping again a reality. Mr Rawe suffered fractures to his spine after he plummeted 500ft to a river bank when the fall went wrong . 'Because of what happened to Jay and me I've accepted death as a possibility - but I can't dream of a life without doing what I love.' Mr Carey, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, has no memory of the fall but Mr Rawe remembers it clearly. He said: 'I remember standing on Austin's shoulders and getting ready while our friends held him there. 'Austin gave the 3-2-1 countdown and I remember falling backwards and trying to jump onto the handrail, missing it, hitting the diving board and starting to flip. 'I grabbed his pilot chute and tried to unwrap his bridle from around my leg. I then landed in his parachute, looked up and saw the sky above me and his canopy flapping around. As Mr Carey jumped off the ledge of the bridge, Mr Rawe (left, top) got his foot stuck on the railings, the pair then began to tumble towards the river bank 500ft below (right) without their parachutes opening properly . As they fell Mr Rawe got stuck in Mr Carey's parachute (left) and the pair got closer to the ground (right) By standers saw Mr Rawe trying to untangle himself from the parachute (left) and Mr Carey a crumpled heap (right) after the pair spiraled at speed towards the ground below the base jumping site . 'The sound was significantly different from any other base jump and I remember thinking how I needed to get out of that position. 'I kicked my feet over my head, fell out, and remember spinning at the ground as it got closer and knowing that we were gonna hit. 'Next thing I remember is waking up and sitting upright to catch the breath that had been knocked out of me. There were people all around, calling the emergency services, making sure we were staying still.' The pair were taken to hospital and had to undergo emergency 10-hour surgeries. Mr Rawe added: 'Seeing it on film the first few times made my stomach drop out like I was riding a roller-coaster.' Mr Carey was recovering in hospital weeks after the fall and said moving his legs caused him immense pain . Both men had to undergo emergency 10-hour surgery for injuries to their backs, Mr Rawe's is shown . He suffered fractures and damage to his vertebrae and a sprained right ankle in which the ligament was completely 'torn off the bone'. Mr Carey's injuries were more serious. He fractured his vertebrae, and suffered an incomplete spinal cord injury. Some of his vertebrae was almost split in half by the impact. The pair had done almost 500 base-jumps between them when they were injured. Mr Carey had to have a thumbnail-sized piece of bone removed from his spinal cord and Mr Rawe had some of his vertebrae fused with titanium. While Mr Rawe, from Florida, battled back onto his feet within a few weeks Mr Carey faced the prospect of never walking again. After months of rehabilitation Mr Carey started to improve and became determined to get walking again . The base jumper was left in a wheelchair and began undergoing painful therapy to learn to walk again . After seven months in a wheelchair Mr Carey was able to walk again, having trained in his high school pool . He spent three months in a back brace and seven months in a wheelchair, taking every opportunity to workout in his high-school swimming pool to strengthen his body. He said: 'The recovery process was insane. At first I could barely get out of bed because of the pain. The whole time I would feel severe nerve pain that would make me scream in agony for hours. It felt as though someone was holding a taser to my legs.' He was treated at the Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center Hospital, Idaho and Mr Rawe at St Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center, Twin Falls and Tampa General Hospital, Florida. Almost a year to the day of the near fatal jump Mr Austin returned to the bridge to do it again successfully . The 23-year-old avid base jumper says he wants to continue the sport and may next try wing suit base jumping . This time there were no problems and the 23-year-old sailed to the ground, determined to continue the sport . Both have now made unexpected recoveries and returned to base jumping, despite being involved in the near-fatal accident. Mr Carey, a fitness coach, said his mother raised concerns about him returning to the sport. He said: 'She is the strongest, most giving person I will ever meet. If something happened to me again I can't imagine what she would go through. But she knows how much this means to me and how much joy it gives me.' Mr Carey said he plans next to try wing suit base jumping. Mr Rawe made a remarkable recovery from the fall and around six months later was back base jumping . The 25-year-old began base jumping last October and went to Fayetteville in West Virginia to base jump . In October 2014 Mr Rawe returned to the sport at Fayetteville, West Virginia, and said he has no plans to put down his parachute. 'Giving it up never really seemed like an option to me,' he said. 'My family would like me to stop out of the fear that I will injure myself again - but life is too short to not do the things that I love.'","Austin Carey and Jay Rawe were involved in near-fatal base jump last year .

"A 63-year-old former air hostess has won a £14.5m London mansion from her 'immensely wealthy' 90-year-old Saudi Arabian ex-husband following a legal battle based on a Victorian law. The property, in north west London, which has 'superb views' over a London park, was one of five properties which the successful property developer bought during the couple's 14-year marriage. The couple's main marital home had been a £26m 'palatial residence' in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for which 40 members of staff were employed to keep it ticking over. A 63-year-old former air hostess has won a £14.5m London mansion from her 'immensely wealthy' 90-year-old Saudi Arabian ex-husband following a legal battle at the High Court (pictured) But, after their divorce, the woman - who did not have any financial input into the properties - moved into the townhouse, claiming her right to live there as one of their matrimonial homes. Despite her husband's attempts to evict her from the home, and force the sale of the heavily-mortgaged property, the wife has now been allowed to keep it as part of a complex legal settlement. The 'opulent' maisonette - which was originally three flats converted into one large home - was at one point worth £22m, but is now worth a 'disappointing' £14.5m, the court heard. The husband, who is said to be worth £600m and  blows up to £10m per year, was also made to give his wife their 'holiday' property in Cannes, which is worth 17m Euros. The judgment, made at the high court, was based on the woman's claim to a right to marital property under the 1882 Married Women’s Property Act. The judge ruled that she should be awarded around £10m on a 'needs light' basis. That was based on £3.5m for London housing, £2.25 million for a replacement holiday home and a further £500,000 to cover the outgoings on both properties. The court heard that both homes had significant mortgages, meaning they would have respective equities of £3.5m and £5.2m if they are sold. But the judge refused to grant the woman the £205,014 she was seeking annually to spend on jewellery, handbags and cars. The woman had claimed she needed £566,045 per year for her £75,000 wardrobe, as well as £25,000 to spend on jewellery. She also needed £25,000 for shoes and another £25,000 for handbags and accessories, she claimed. The couple married in the Central London Mosque (pictured) in 1979 when the man, a property developer, was in his mid-50s and the woman was in her late 20s. They divorced twice, once in 2002 and once in 2013 . The judge recognised that the woman's standard of living had been  'lavish and exceptional' during the marriage but said that it was 'not reasonable' to expect that to continue. He added: 'If the wife exceeds this figure, she will have only herself to blame.' The judge also pointed out that, had it been an entirely English case, the woman would have been entitled to £44million - the figure she originally sought - out of total £287.5million in assets. He said that even though she was 'clearly not a lady of business', she was the homemaker and mother, which made her contribution to the marriage equal to her husband. 'The authorities make it clear that she is not to be discriminated against for the way in which the parties organised their respective roles,' he said. The woman, from Lebanon, took the legal action against the businessman at the High Court in London. Had the same case been heard in Saudi Arabia, the woman would have been entitled to all but nothing. The couple married at the Central London Mosque in 1979 when the man was in his mid 50s and the woman was in her late 20s. They divorced in 1999, before remarrying in 2002. They then separated again in 2013, before divorcing in Saudi Arabia. The court heard that the main marital home had been in Saudi Arabia, where her rights would have been very different. But she was allowed to bring the case in London because the family had spent most summers during their marriage in the capital to escape the 'intolerable' Saudi Arabian heat, making it one of their matrimonial homes. Their children had also gone to nursery here during the holidays and the woman had lived here for at least one year when the case was brought. The court heard the husband owned properties in Paris, which sold for 15million Euros in 2013, and Beirut, which sold for $15.5m. His wife had kept the profit from the Paris flat, he said. Details of the case emerged in a ruling by Mr Justice Moor following a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in November. The row broke out when the pair were reunited in 2002, with the wife alleging that her husband had promised to transfer her some of his properties. The court heard that the husband, said to be a member of several London clubs, had indeed transferred different properties to other members of his family, including his wife. But the judge rejected the claim that he would have promised to transfer his wife any properties for any other reason than tax, insisting he was still the 'beneficial owner' of the property. He said: 'It is inherently improbable. He is a Saudi businessman with great stature. I cannot conceive that he would willingly part with all his residential property. Why should he? He had no intention of losing control of his various residential properties.' The judge also found that the wife had 'embellished and altered her recollection to suit her case'. The Married Women's Property Act 1882 was an act that significantly altered English law regarding the property rights of married women. Among the laws it introduced, it allowed married women to own and control property in their own right. It came following an 1836 Caroline Norton court case which highlighted the injustice of English property laws, and generated enough support that eventually resulted in the Married Women’s Property Act. Many of the elements have since been superseded by subsequent family law statutes.","House in London was one of five properties the man - worth £600m - owned .

"What the hell am I doing, I ask myself, as I stand shivering on the brink. It’s April and my first proper swim of the year. The North Sea stretches before me. I dip a toe in. It’s absolutely freezing . . . of course. I wobble over the sharp shingle, into the waves, until I’m waist-deep. Gasping for breath, I take the plunge. And, within seconds, making frantic strokes, I’m swept up and I’m swimming. And it is glorious. Scroll down for video . Sarah Foot says her affair with open water began on Hampstead Heath after a local swimming pool closed down, and has taken her to swimming in the North Sea off the coast of Suffolk (pictured) I’m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek, racing crawl - I’m that woman with the white-hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke . You don’t have to be watching Poldark for a dip in the sea to set your heart racing. I love to swim. Miserable winters, exams, love affairs . . . I’ve swum through them all, wherever I can find the water. Most of the time this means municipal pools from which I emerge reeking of chlorine and praying I’ve avoided verrucas. So best of all has to be swimming outdoors, and here on the East coast in Suffolk it is now warm enough — just about — for the sea. And despite the greyness, the appalling cold, and the downright bleakness of the North Sea here, I’m in heaven. The poet Byron — who was every bit as proud of his phenomenal swimming prowess as his verses — called the experience a ‘buoyancy of spirits I never feel on any other occasion’. I don’t have to swim the four-mile-long Hellespont between Asia and Europe as he did to know what he meant. I, too, am buoyed up in every way. Yet I’m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek, racing crawl. Nor am I that hardy chap I read about recently, known as the ‘human polar bear’, who swims round icebergs in the Arctic. A 30-minute dip leaves me exhausted. I can’t even dive. You need look no further than Aidan Turner in Poldark to see how a dip in the ocean can set pulses racing . I’m that woman with the white-hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke. But in the water I don’t care. And, for me, that’s the magic of swimming. I am completely free. For a few precious moments, all my troubles wash away. Nothing bothers me and my whole world flows ‘swimmingly’. Of course, it would be easier to get in if it weren’t so damned cold — nudging a steely 8C (47F). Yet however enticing it is to bask in languid, tropical waters along with colourful fish, and laze about in Mediterranean and Caribbean seas, give me the Atlantic any day. Because, for me, the most perfect swim of all is in Scotland, off the Hebrides. What I love is the emptiness, the menthol cool of the water. On the Isle of Islay I have found deserted bays and swum completely alone or just with those I love, the sea crystal-clear and only the sound of the curlews and the water lapping over the rock pools. It’s not warm, of course, but immersed in that wild sea is the closest to beauty I have ever been. Why does it affect me so? Freud, not surprisingly, had a view on a love of swimming. He believed it disguised a desire to return to the amniotic waters of the womb. But that’s the sort of Freudian thing he would say. I prefer the thoughts of novelist Jane Austen, so much more restrained, who simply declared swimming ‘delightful’. She found the combination of sea air and sea water ‘nearly infallible’ and ‘a match for every disorder’. To the Romans, swimming was a most manly, heroic occupation, so much so that they defined an ignorant man as one who ‘neither knows how to read or swim’. Caligula, the cruel and brutally wanton Roman emperor, deemed himself a god but his contemporaries whispered he was a wimp — behind his back, presumably — because he couldn’t manage a front crawl or even a doggy-paddle. I came across a similar attitude when I lived in London and finally plucked up the courage to swim in the famous, natural, spring-fed ponds on Hampstead Heath. The exclusive ladies pond is in a picture-perfect setting, surrounded by trees and wild flowers. But I was scared to go in. The problem was I couldn’t see the bottom. The water was so black and deep, my thoughts would turn black and ominous too, imagining drowning and wondering how many rats were lurking in the murky shadows. But one day, the local indoor pool I used was unexpectedly closed. So I braved the pond. And it was a revelation. I felt I was swimming through silk. I never knew water could be so soft and I forgot about the rats and the unknown depths. And with all the passion of a convert I became so keen on the fresh water and splashing about with ducks I was determined to swim there all year round. Poet Lord Byron (left) was a prodigious swimmer, once crossing the four-mile Hellespont from Asia to Europe, while Jane Austen praised the sea air and water as 'a match for every disorder' I bought neoprene gloves and shoes and, as autumn came and the temperature dropped, I invested in a wet-suit. Because although there is something to be said for the way you emerge from cold water stinging and tingling as if heated by a feverish drug, I’m not hardy enough for swimming through liquid ice. But, unfortunately, I was not allowed to wear my new wetsuit — ‘not in the spirit of the ponds’, I was told by the strict Hampstead matriarchs who police it. And my passion faltered and I had to wait again for warmer weather. The coldness of our climate meant that, for centuries in Britain, swimming in the wild for pleasure was considered close to madness. The sea and rivers were regarded as sources of disease rather than pleasure. And the Church saw swimming as a rather sinful pursuit, possibly because Romans treated it as the opportunity for more erotic activities than a few hale and hearty lengths. But then, at the end of the 18th century, George III gave swimming the royal stamp of approval by taking dips in the sea off Weymouth, accompanied apparently by a band who struck up God Save The King every time he popped his head out of the water. In 1824, Britain’s first swimming society was formed by a group of Old Etonians. The David Camerons and Boris Johnsons of their day initiated non-swimmers by taking them out onto the River Thames and chucking them in. The Victorians had more gentle ways of learning to swim. A Boys Own Paper of 1879 suggested learning from frogs — by catching one, putting it in a bowl of water and then lying your body across a table and imitating the way it moved. George III brought swimming to fashion in England after years of scepticism from prudish members of the church . Whatever methods people learned to swim they were effective and, as more people took to the waters, something had to be done, in the name of modesty, about the habit of swimming naked. A cover-up campaign began, much to the annoyance of Francis Kilvert, a West Country curate who, in 1872, complained about the ‘detestable custom of bathing in drawers’. He loved ‘the delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked to the sea’. Forced to put on underwear (red and white striped) to conceal himself, he complained that: ‘If ladies don’t like to see men naked, why don’t they keep away from the sight?’ Indeed given the hysteria generated by Poldark actor Aidan Turner’s quick Cornish dip, watching men swimming seems to be a pleasure that has never dimmed. Personally, I hate being seen swimming, though others clearly don’t. On the nearest beach to me, the determinedly old-fashioned Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast, I watch doughty local residents wander through the town in great towelling robes for a morning dip, proudly showing off bodies leathered and tanned by years of immersion in the sea. They are following in the footsteps of the composer Benjamin Britten, the town’s most famous resident, who extolled the virtues of cold water ‘just to wake you up’. On a good day, he’d manage as many as five ‘bathes’, as he called them, fitting them in between rehearsals and lunch, as well as late at night in the moonlight. His love affair with water lasted through his whole life. He composed the piano piece Early Morning Bathe, which captures all the initial pain and ultimate pleasure of a swim off the English coast — that ‘it’s lovely when you’re in’ feeling. But the problem, for me, is the indignity of actually getting in and out of the sea. It’s bad enough trying to keep your feet as you stagger in. But, unless it is unusually calm, there’s not a hope of emerging from the surf with the composure of bikini-clad Ursula Andress in the Bond film Dr No. As I get out, the waves can be so pebble-filled-heavy I’m often hurled flat on my face and have to scrabble over the stones on my stomach. But the humiliation of looking like a seal heaving itself onto dry land is worth it for the joy of that swim. So I will continue to confront the North Sea, take delight when the temperature climbs a few degrees as we head into summer in the weeks ahead and then grit my teeth again as it plummets back into winter. Because I know from experience that, whatever the season, once I’m swimming, I’m reminded, however briefly, how wonderful it is to be alive.","Sarah Foot began swimming outside after a dip on Hampstead Heath .

"Sitting front row at Fashion Week is a coveted position. Not just for the best view in the house and the chance that your neighbour might be a celebrity or Anna Wintour... but for the goodie bag. Stars, buyers and fashion editors in the 'FROW' are often showered with gift bags stuffed with treats from the show sponsors. The Maticevski show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia on Tuesday went above and beyond to impress guests, with front row attendees given a personalised tablet. But a few of the highly-prized gifts went missing when someone with sticky fingers - perhaps a disgruntled second row guest - decided to snap them up for themselves. Scroll down for video .

Jessica Mauboy, model Maddison Brow, and GQ editor Nick Smith were among those who had their Lenovo tablets stolen from their seats. It should be easy to spot the culprits though, as each of the tablets had been customised with wallpaper bearing their name. Celebrities including Lindy Klim, and Jordan and Zac Stenmark were pictured fawning over their personalised Lenovo tablets before the show started. Not a bad goodie bag: Each front row guest was given an $899 Lenovo tablet with their gift bag at the show . Perks of the job: Fashion editors including Elle editor Justine Cullen were among the lucky recipients, and were quick to share their haul on social media . Show organisers had a few back-ups of the $899 tablet on hand that were not customised to give to the theft victims. Despite the drama, the show was a spectacular success, with an A-list turn-out and dazzling creations gracing the catwalk. Toni Maticevski, whose designs are beloved by Jennifer Hawkins, Abbie Cornish and Jess Hart, presented a glimmering display complete with gold, glitter, mesh and tulle.

Neckless: Models were seen to be keeping necks hidden in Maticevski's neutral couture  dress line . Soft summer: Models wear a pastel palette with soft, summery tulles, transparent fabrics and flowing designs . Maticevski, who began his career with bridal gowns, stuck to his signature wrap look but branched out this season with new metallic and pastel palettes and a mix of bold and conservative cuts. The star of the couture collection though was the glittery, gold metallic asymmetrical dress that not only brightened up the dull  warehouse backdrop but wowed the audience with it's high cut, off the shoulder metallic design. Also featured alongside the  asymmetrical number was a opalescent mesh two piece top and skirt with a gold, triangular panel starring centre front. Maticevski's got the Midas Touch:  A gold, glittery asymmetrical dress steals the show at Toni Maticevski . The right mesh: A pearlescent mesh two piece also featured in the gold range as shown at Toni Maticevski . Showcasing also in the metallic range was glimmering opaque black maxi skirts, coats and pants. The designs all featured stiff black fabric and wrap designs, with skirts featuring tulle underlays and models wearing transparent black bows in their hair. In addition to the metallic line, Maticevski also created a playful, light, pastel collection for Spring/Summer that features transparent white and lilac overlays, apricot tulle and pretty pink prints. Models in the pastel collection replaced bows with flowers but keeping to their slick buns as seen throughout. 50 shades of grey: Maticevski's classic couture range had models wearing long,  grey coats and dresses . Black tie: Models match with bold black outfits, heels, bows and furrowed brows . The last range in the collection featured classic, neutral couture pieces with signature folds, asymmetrical lines and frills in abundance. The main colours of the monochrome collection were gunmetal, white and  black and models were seen carrying  transparent domes with flowers inside or wearing clear ball-shaped necklaces to tie in with the pastel, summery collection. Shapes also varied in the final line, with a mix of conservative long trench coats and ankle-length dresses and high-cut, daring just above knee styles.","Jessica Mauboy and GQ editor  among those who had tablets stolen .

"A fiery stoush has erupted between the chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's media empire in Australia and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss. During a tumultuous day of proceedings at a corporate tax inquiry in Sydney today, News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke was peppered with questions from Greens senator and party leader Christine Milne about why The Australian newspaper operates as a business when it is not profitable. When Mr Clarke defended the newspaper as the 'finest national newspaper operating in Australia', Ms Milne flatly told the inquiry, 'you and I won't agree on that'. 'You're a minority,' Mr Clarke fired back. 'Not from the number of people who buy your newspaper,' Ms Milne responded. Scroll down for video . A fiery stoush erupted News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss . Clarke was peppered with questions from Greens senator Christine Milne about why The Australian newspaper continued to when it is not profitable . As Christine Milne made her opinion about The Australian newspaper clear, News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke fired back: 'You're a minority' 'Not according to sales,' Greens Senator Christine Milne responded . 'I'm sorry?' Mr Clarke asked. 'How many do we sell a day? 'You sell a very small number,' Ms Milne responded. Mr Clarke also rejected allegations recently published by Fairfax Media alleging $4.5 billion had been siphoned from Mr Murdoch's Australian operations to the United States virtually tax free. He told the hearing the report was 'hopelessly wrong', arguing the stories were 'either deliberately misleading or no idea; looking at the author (business correspondent Michael West), I would say both'. In her questioning, Ms Milne also alleged The Australian was run for ideological purposes. Mr Clarke, who argued the paper examined policy, accepted her contention. It has been previously reported that the national broadsheet lost $30 million in the 2012/13 financial year. The paper was reportedly hoping to half that loss in the 2013/14 financial year. Also at Wednesday's hearing, the inquiry panel heard that the Australian arms of technology giants Google, Apple and Microsoft are being audited by the Australian Tax Office.

Executives from the three major companies confirmed that they were being investigated. Google Australia managing director Maile Carnegie said the company made $58 million in revenue in 2013, and profits of just more than $46 million, but paid $7.1 million in tax. Earlier, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan continued to refuse to reveal the identities of a number of companies suspected of avoiding tax by shifting billions of dollars offshore. Committee chairman Sam Dastyari had written to Mr Jordan on Tuesday requesting he reveal the names. But Mr Jordan refused, and in a response sent to Senator Dastyari and tabled at the hearing on Wednesday, defended the decision on the grounds that naming the companies would undermine public confidence in the tax system. 'The Treasurer has been consulted about making these PII (public interest immunity) claims, and has endorsed them being made by me as an independent statutory office holder. The grounds of the PII claim are as follows,' the letter said. 'Disclosure of the information will have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient operations of the ATO, contrary to the public interest.'","News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke gave evidence at a corporate tax inquiry today .

"A new study has suggested the oral contraceptive pill could shrink parts of the brain that govern a woman's emotions . For the 100 million women worldwide on the contraceptive pill, the side effects are familiar. Mood swings, headaches and nausea, while more serious complications include blood clots and breast cancer. But scientists in California have added another potential cause for concern to the check list. Their new study has found the oral contraceptive shrinks two key regions of the brain, changing the way they function. The findings suggest the synthetic hormones found in the Pill cause these alterations in brain structure and function. Furthermore the ingredient is thought to suppress the natural hormones that occur when women take the Pill. Neuroscientists at UCLA examined the brains of 90 women, 44 of whom took the Pill, and 46 who experienced natural cycles. They found the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cigulate cortex were thinner in those women taking the contraception. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex plays an important role in regulating a person's emotions and their response to rewards. As a result the changes noted by researchers could, they say, be responsible for increased anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced by some women on the Pill. Meanwhile the posterior cingulate cortex governs the 'internal state', or inward-directed thought, helps process emotions and retrieve memories. Nicole Petersen, the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post: 'Some women experience negative emotional side effects from taking oral contraceptive pills, although the scientific findings investigating that have been mixed. 'So it's possible that this change in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex may be related to the emotional changes that some women experience when using birth control pills.' Researchers said they do not yet know if these changes to the brain are permanent, or if they only last while a woman is taking the Pill. Dr Petersen said more research is needed, but added that this study is the first step. The latest study comes five years after research by the Royal College of General Practitioners revealed Pill-users have a 12 per cent reduction in their risk of developing cancer. Scientists at UCLA found the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cigulate cortex were thinner in those women taking the contraception. They believe it could account for increased anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced by some women taking the Pill . The researchers studied 46,000 women across four decades, and found those on the Pill were less likely to die of cancer, heart disease or stroke. It contradicts past studies that have linked the Pill to breast cancer. The risks associated with taking the Pill are increased if a woman smokes, has a family history of thrombosis, is severely overweight, diabetic, has a high blood pressure or high cholesterol level. The study was published in the journal Human Brain Mapping.","UCLA study found the Pill shrinks two parts of the brain linked to emotion .

The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound cliché, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores . In the past, check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers, but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. They also want more organics and local produce. 'There's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods, especially among younger consumers,' says Willard Bishop's Jim Hertel. 'They're suspicious about food additives and so sure 'less is more,' that they buy gluten-free even if they're not allergic to gluten.' 1 Wegmans . 2 Publix . 3 Trader Joe's . 4 Fareway Stores . 5 Market Basket (Northeast) 6 Costco . 7 Raley's . 8 Sprouts Farmers Market . 9 Fresh Market . 10 Stater Bros. 11 WinCo . 12 Hy-Vee . 13 H-E-B . 14 Aldi . 15 Whole Foods Market . 16 Fry's . 17 Harris-Teeter . 18 King Soopers . 19 Fred Meyer . 20 Food City (KY, TN, VA) 21 Hannaford . 22 Meijer . 23 Dillons . 24 Smith's Food & Drug . 25 Lowes Foods (NC) 26 ShopRite . 27 Schnucks . 28 Food 4 Less . 29 County Market . 30 QFC . 31 Kroger . 32 Save Mart . 33 Ingles . 34 IGA . 35 Bashas' 36 Marsh . 37 Piggly Wiggly . 38 Tom Thumb . 39 Giant (PA) 40 Cub Foods . 41 Shoppers Food & Pharmacy . 42 BJ's Wholesale Club . 43 Big Y . 44 Ralphs . 45 Target/SuperTarget . 46 BI-LO (GA, NC, SC, TN) 47 Sam's Club . 48 Brookshire's . 49 Vons . 50 Albertsons . 51 Price Chopper (Northeast) 52 Food Lion . 53 Weis . 54 Giant Eagle . 55 Winn-Dixie . 56 Giant (DC, DE, MD, VA) 57 Randalls . 58 Safeway . 59 Jewel-Osco . 60 Stop & Shop . 61 Acme . 62 Pick 'n Save . 63 Tops Markets . 64 Shaw's . 65 Pathmark . 66 A&P . 67 Walmart Supercenter . 68 Waldbaum's . 1 Wegmans . 2 Publix . 3 Trader Joe's . 4 Fareway Stores . 5 Market Basket (Northeast) 6 Costco . 7 Raley's . 8 Sprouts Farmers Market . 9 Fresh Market . 10 Stater Bros. 11 WinCo . 12 Hy-Vee . 13 H-E-B . 14 Aldi . 15 Whole Foods Market . 16 Fry's . 17 Harris-Teeter . 18 King Soopers . 19 Fred Meyer . 20 Food City (KY, TN, VA) 21 Hannaford . 22 Meijer . 23 Dillons . 24 Smith's Food & Drug . 25 Lowes Foods (NC) 26 ShopRite . 27 Schnucks . 28 Food 4 Less . 29 County Market . 30 QFC . 31 Kroger . 32 Save Mart . 33 Ingles . 34 IGA .

"Hassan Munshi, one of two teenagers feared to have crossed into Syria to join ISIS, is believed to be a relative of Hammaad Munshi (pictured) The families of two teenage boys who are thought to have traveled to Syria are 'in a state of profound shock' and deeply worried about the safety of their 'ordinary Yorkshire lads'. The boys who have been named as 17-year-olds Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal are believed to have traveled to the embattled country after heading to Turkey on March 31. Hassan is supposedly related to Hammaad Munshi, who was arrested by counter-terrorism police at the age of 15 back in 2006. He was later convicted over his role in a brutal plan to murder non-Muslims,The Times reported. A statement released on behalf of the two families said: 'Both families are devastated by the events of the last few days and in particular, we are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of our loved ones. 'Our number one priority is to get Hassan and Talha back home with their families and we implore anyone who may have any information whatsoever to get in contact with the police. 'Naturally, we are in a state of profound shock and are trying to come to terms with the predicament we find ourselves in and we hope and pray that no other family finds itself in our situation.' The pair from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, have not been in contact with their families for several days and cannot be reached on their mobile phones. Hassan's alleged relative Hammaad was only 15-years-old when he joined a terrifying Islamic State faction who were targeting the Royal Family. Hammaad was arrested on his way home from a chemistry exam in 2006 and found with two bags of ball-bearings - key material for a suicide vest. He was locked up for two years under the Terrorism Act in 2008. The statement added: 'These were just two ordinary Yorkshire lads who enjoyed the things that all young people enjoy at their age. 'Both Hassan and Talha had a promising future as an apprentice and an A-level student respectively, and we are praying they will be back with us soon and are able to realise that future. 'We would implore all parents to be extra vigilant, although as we found, it's near impossible to know your children have been groomed and brainwashed. 'Syria is a frightening war-torn place and we need to urgently educate our young children about the dangers posed by those who prey on impressionable teenagers.' The Times now reports that the two 17-year-old boys told their relatives they were going on a school trip - but instead used the Easter holidays as a 'window of opportunity' to flee Britain. They are thought to have boarded a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester Airport to Dalaman in Turkey on March 31, said West Yorkshire Police. Both families have reported the boys missing to police although British authorities now fear that the pair have managed to cross into Syria from Turkey. Scroll down for video . 'Seeking jihad': Two teenage boys from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, are believed to have fled to Syria to join Isis militants, seen here taking control of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus . A family friend said they were in a state 'of total disbelief' and they were 'broken and inconsolable'. The south Dewsbury area has been linked to a number of extremist plots and was home to the ring-leader of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan. According to The Times, a member of one of the families said: 'We don't want to talk.' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, from West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for the safety of these two boys and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. 'Syria is an extremely dangerous place and the public will be aware of the dangers these boys may face. 'The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those that come under the control of Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return.' The force said it has been supporting the missing teenagers' families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the North East Counter Terrorism Unit. The disappearance of the two teenagers follows the arrest of nine Britons by Turkish authorities attempting to sneak into Syria across the Turkish border. The boys are from the same town as London 7/7 suicide bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan (pictured) Waheed Ahmed, 21, from Rochdale was arrested with his aunt, cousins and four children while attempting to get into Syria. After the arrest, anti-terror police raided the home of his father, Shakil Ahmed, a respected Labour councillor for the town. Munshi's family comes from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, where his grandfather Yakub Munshi ran the town's sharia court. The schoolboy, who was studying for his GCSEs at Westborough High School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, was traced through his online conversations with 'cyber terrorist' Aabid Hussain Khan. In one MSN chat, they argued how best to sneak a metal sword through airport security. Munshi had painstakingly scoured the internet for details on how to make napalm and grenades. He claimed he had only done the research out of curiosity but handwritten notes hidden under his bed revealed his burning desire to travel abroad to become a martyr. Munshi also had a library of videos, documents and audio clips showing acts of jihad, mujaheddin fighters and Al Qaeda preachings. Khan, who acted as an administrator on an extremist website called Activion Publications, downloaded information on the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince Edward, the Countess of Wessex, The Duke of York and the Princess Royal. Munshi was convicted of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism. Khan was found guilty of possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism but cleared of a similar charge. A third man, Sultan Muhammad from Manningham, West Yorkshire - Khan's cousin - was convicted of three similar charges and one of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism.","Families of Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal, both 17, released statement .

"An image of a woman breastfeeding her toddler while sitting on the toilet with her trousers around her ankles has caused a storm on the internet. Originally posted on Instagram and then shared on the Facebook page of Life of Dad, which describes itself as 'the social network for dads', the picture has now been shared more than 25,000 times and has been liked on Facebook more than 211,000 times. Alabama-born mom-of-two Elisha Wilson Beach, is pictured breastfeeding her daughter in the image. The picture has divided those who've seen it with many criticizing the mother for her unapologetic approach to multi-tasking. Wilson Beach is the wife of TV actor Michael Beach, known for his roles on Sons of Anarchy, Third Watch and ER. Scroll down for video . The chaos of motherhood laid bare: Mum-of-two Elisha Wilson Beach, from Los Angeles, shared this photo of herself breastfeeding her toddler daughter while on the toilet. The image has since gone viral . Unapologetic: Elisha Wilson Beach posted the image alongside a series of hashtags to explain her reasons for posting the image including #confessionsofamom, #ididthat and #iamnotsorry . Debate: The image, which has attracted more than 25,000 shares on Facebook has provoked debate . Alongside the image are the words: 'This is motherhood and it ain't always pretty. What's your #momtruth? #motherhood #motherhoodaintpretty #tmi #confessionsofamom #ididthat #iamnotsorry' The snap has divided the internet community with much of the online furore focused around hygiene. One Facebook user, Amanda Martin, wrote: 'I would never ever breastfeed my child in the bathroom. It's unsanitary regardless. 'Stick your kid in the crib until you're done, or pump it and give it to them.' Another, Karen Bryce, chimed in: 'How can you say this picture is beautiful? I think its very distasteful. 'Would you allow your partner to take a picture of you while doing the toilet? And then post it for all to see?' On Twitter, the image has also been doing the rounds with one user,@SeanKessie, saying: 'So disgusting, see photo of a mother breastfeeding her child while using the toilet.' While another, @WillTwerk4Food, expressed their dismay at the whole scene saying: 'It's the breastfeeding...the tampons on the floor...her being on the toilet...just everything.' Wilson Beach is the wife of TV actor Michael Beach, best known for his roles on Third Watch, Sons of Anarchy and ER . Divisive: Many people took to Twitter to voice their opinions on the image including @SeanKessie, who called the shot 'disgusting' This user, @WillTwerk4Food, complains about the general disarray of the bathroom as well as the nursing . There were also plenty of comments suggesting that Wilson Beach wasn't actually breastfeeding and that it was her elbow in the shot, something which the mother herself quickly cleared up. Posting her own riposte to the criticism on Facebook, she said: 'This is my picture and yes I am breastfeeding. 'I shared it on Instagram knowing that some people would think it's TMI but it's reality. Wilson Beach, who describes herself on Instagram as 'a mom, wife, arts educator, foodie, nauralista and more' adds: 'Everybody complains that social media is full of people pretending to live picture perfect lives and I see so many mothers doubting themselves based on those photos. She continued: 'Well, this is reality and so many mothers are doing this exact thing right now. Motherhood ain't pretty but then that's what makes it so beautiful.' The overwhelming reaction has been supportive though with many praising Wilson Beach's honesty for showing how demanding life can be with a young child. In 2014, students at the University of North Texas created When Nurture Calls campaign encouraging mothers not to retreat to the bathroom when nursing their children . On Facebook, Katrina L Pleasant-Wheatley wrote: 'This pretty much sums up mommyhood', while another user, Alicia Ringsaker, added: 'To the people calling this unsanitary or gross, most people brush their teeth in the bathroom and leave their toothbrushes in the bathroom. 'How is this gross and not that? Breasts are way more sanitary in the bathroom than your toothbrushes.' There was also love for Wilson Beach on Twitter, with ‏@joytammy writing: 'What is wrong with this photo? This beautiful mother was pictured breastfeeding her baby in the toilet.' Last year, a powerful ad campaign showed women nursing their babies in toilets in a bid to persuade people that women shouldn't be shamed into retreating into public bathrooms to breastfeed. The When Nurture Calls campaign was launched to show 'mothers who have been harassed to the point where they feel they have no other option but to nurture their baby in the restroom as to not offend anyone.' It pointed out that 'a baby should never be nurtured where nature calls.'","Picture shows Elisha Wilson Beach nursing her child while on the toilet .

"Some of the most common pregnancy cravings are chocolate, ice cream or even pickles. But one unlucky woman from New York had a craving for something rather unusual and potentially very damaging - rocks. For Silvia, star of the series My Extraordinary Pregnancy, suffered from pica, an eating disorder that makes people crave non-food substances. In the Discovery TV show My Extraordinary Pregnancy Silvia revealed how she suffered from pica during her third pregnancy meaning she wanted to eat rocks . In the programme that followed Silvia throughout her pregnancy, she is seen picking up tiny rocks from out side of her house, saying: 'I feel really upset and guilty, I feel ashamed but I have to do it.' The New Yorker is then heard saying: 'Over here are the ones that are easy to break,' as she walks around the garden. Silvia says on the show which airs on TLC: 'If I could trade with someone that's craving pickles or sushi I would do it, I would love that, I would trade that any day. 'When I see certain kind of rocks my mouth waters. Literally. It's like when you see something you really really want to eat. 'I try not to look down at the rocks and I try not to go by construction sites Because my system goes haywire and I get so excited. I want to eat some, I want to eat some, you know.' Dr Robert K Silverman Silvia's obstetrician explains: 'Pica is just eating any substance that is not food. It can be as simple as something like ice or it could be as complicated as eating nails. Silvia picks up the rocks outside her house, she is seen picking the ones that are small and soft . Silvia finds the rocks outside in little piles and then hides them around her house . 'We've talked about the risk of taking in pebbles, there are all different kind of diseases that you can get, there are all different types of parasites. 'And the fact that they can fill up their stomach can cause an obstruction. Pica can be very dangerous.' Silvia says: 'Obviously I need to stop, I've tried just about everything they've told me to try, I've tried eating corn starch, I've tried eating different type of candies that got the same consistency, but nothing so far has helped.' Silvia is seen hiding her tiny rocks around the house, behind lamps and behind the curtains, or even in a tea cup in the kitchen. But she is worried about the effects her bizarre eating habits are having on her unborn child: 'I could go the whole day without eating which is not healthy because the baby is not gaining the weight that he is supposed to be gaining. 'I'm not gaining the weight that I'm supposed to be gaining, there's no nutrition going in my body.' 'I've had a lot of stomach pains from eating rocks which is kind of scary, I worry about mine and the baby's health.' Silvias obstetrician says that pica can be very dangerous when, like Silvia, you are eating rocks . A pregnant Silvia plays with her two little boys in her garden ahead of their new arrival . Silvia's partner Estevan tells cameras: 'It's frustrating because everything she consumes the baby consumes, so when she has pains it's all because of this stuff that she's eating. You can't digest rocks.' When he decides to throw some of her rocks away Silvia reveals that it makes her feel anxious and stressed. Silvia said: 'He worries because he doesn't want me to hurt the baby, when he does find out I'm eating something he just feels like he's not doing enough. Estevan says: 'It's like being in a relationship with someone who does drugs, the hiding spots, the little drugs stashes here and there, the sneaking around. 'It does get frustrating but arguing about it is not going to help the situation.' Silvia says that she tried everything to stop her cravings but nothing worked . Silvia's partner Estevan is worried about her and what her rock eating habit is doing to their unborn child . After having stomach pains, the programme follows Silvia as she goes to the hospital and she admits that with her baby almost due she's been trying to keep herself away. When it's time for Silvia to give birth surgeon Jodi Wallis says: 'Pica in pregnancy is a concern because of the mom not getting other nutrients which she may need to get. 'Things that we'll look for in Silvia's baby is making sure the baby is healthy nutritionally and making sure that the baby doesn't have iron deficiency because that would be the biggest risk. Thankfully when the tiny tot is born he's completely healthy, the couple are thrilled with their bouncing baby. Silvia says: 'I'm so excited that he's okay.'","Silvia, from New York, developed a non-food craving while pregnant .

"A killer who was mistakenly let of jail by bungling prison staff mid-way through his murder trial posted a video of himself brandishing a meat cleaver on his Facebook page. Martynas Kupstys, 26, spent three hours sitting on a bus stop across the road from Lincoln Prison after staff told him he was free to go in August 2014. The killer was on trial at the time for the murder of Ivans Zdanovics along with his brother-in-law Andrus Giedraitis at Lincoln Crown Court. Convicted murderer Martynas Kupstys, pictured, posed on video brandishing a large meat cleaver . The Lithuanian killer, who was jailed for life at Lincoln Crown Court, also waved a saucepan threateningly . Both men were this week jailed for life following the murder in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in January 2014. Before the murder, Kupstys posted a video of himself brandishing a large meat cleaver and waving it at the person behind the camera in a threatening manner. He also uploaded a photograph of himself standing beside a waxwork of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. The judge in Kupstys' original trial abandoned the hearing after eight days following the blunder costing the tax payer thousands of pounds. During his retrial,  Lincoln Crown Court heard that Kupstys sat at a bus stop outside the prison and went into a local hospital to use the toilet until prison staff went looking for him. Martynas Kupstys, pictured, was jailed for life for the murder of Ivans Zdanovics by Lincoln Crown Court . It was only when the prison bus arrived at the court that officials realised a mistake had been made. Giving evidence during his retrial, Kupstys told the court: 'I thought about running away. I thought about many things. I could go home, I could return to my friends, but I understood it cannot be that I was released. I should go to the court. 'I was released by mistake. I told them I was supposed to be at court. I was told everything was fine. I was told everything was in order and I was being released.' When asked about his brief period of freedom, he replied: 'I enjoyed the sunshine for a few hours. I sat on the bench 20 or 30 metres from the prison gate. I thought that they had released me by mistake and they should come and get me and take me back in. 'I was out of the prison for about three hours. There came a time when the prison officers came and fetched me. Many prison officers.' The mistake happened three weeks into the first trial which cost approximately £3,000 a day. The victim was found dead in his burnt-out home in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in January 2014. A post mortem confirmed that Zdanovics died from smoke inhalation. Kupstys was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 25 years while his co-accused Giedraitis was also given a life term with a minimum of 21 years. Government inspectors criticised the prison in 2012 who found it was severely over crowded by 50 per cent. A Prison Service spokesman told the Telegraph: 'All of the recommendations raised in an externally led investigation have been implemented by HMP Lincoln. A wider investigation into this incident, which will consider disciplinary action, is still ongoing.' Kupstys also posted a photograph of him imitating a pose beside a waxwork of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler .

"A warning for a tsunami as big as one metre (three feet)  forecast to hit islands in Japan's far south after a 6.6 magnitude earthquake struck off eastern Taiwan was cancelled on Monday. National broadcaster NHK said waves were possible on several islands in the southern Okinawa chain after a very shallow quake centred on Yonaguni in the southwest, near Taiwan. Witnesses said buildings swayed in Taipei but there was no visible damage in the Taiwan capital. General view of Ginowan city, north-east of the capital of Okinawa Prefecture in Japan ©Kazuhiro Nogi (AFP/File) 'We are issuing warnings via the radio,' Satoshi Shimoji of the Miyako City government told NHK. 'We want residents to get as far as possible from the sea,' he said. NHK said the tsunami -- an irregular wave that alters the sea level, and not necessarily a huge event -- were believed to have already arrived at remote Yonaguni, although no details were yet available. Live footage from coastal cameras showed sea levels had apparently not risen in several harbours within the warning zone. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said in a statement that 'based on all the available data... there is no tsunami threat from this earthquake.' Map locating the epicenter of a 6.6-magnitude quake that hit the southwest edge of Japan's Okinawa province, near the coast of Taiwan on April 20, 2015 . The US Geological Survey said the 6.6 magnitude quake, which Japanese authorities had originally put at 6.8, struck 71 kilometres (44 miles) east of Hualian, Taiwan at 0143 GMT. Japan sits at the confluence of four of the earth's tectonic plates and registers more than 20 percent of the planet's most powerful earthquakes every year. Strict building codes and a long familiarity with the dangers mean that quakes that might cause devastation in other parts of the world are frequently uneventful in Japan. However, occasional disasters prove exceptionally deadly, and more than 18,000 people were killed by a huge tsunami that smashed into the northeast coast in 2011 after a huge 9.0 magnitude earthquake.","A tsunami warning for islands in Japan's far south has been cancelled .

'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. In the invasion of Iraq by a US-led coalition, the military developed a set of playing cards to help troops identify the most-wanted members of Saddam's regime. This was mostly high-ranking members of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party or members of the Revolutionary Command Council. The cards were officially named the 'personality identification playing cards'. Each card contained the wanted person's address and, if available, the job they carried out. The highest-ranking cards, starting with the aces and kings, were used for the people at the top of the most-wanted list. Saddam, who was number one on the most wanted list, was the Ace of Spades. The aces of clubs and hearts were his sons Qusay and Uday respectively, who were both killed in Mosul in 2003. The ace of diamonds was Saddam's presidential secretary Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti. He was executed in June 2012 after being sentenced to death by the Iraqi High Tribunal. Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the pack of cards. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But on Friday, a car bomb killed three people outside the US consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against ISIS, which claimed the attack. No US personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department, which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound. ISIS also claimed responsibility for two car . bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on . Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs . in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in . Erbil,' the group said via its news agency. Such attacks are relatively rare in Kurdistan, which has . managed to insulate itself from the worst of the violence . afflicting the rest of Iraq.

"From solar-powered models of the Queen to a £1,200 Wedgwood bust of Prince Charles, there's no item of royal memorabilia too big or too small for royalist Margaret Tyler. The pensioner, 71, has been collecting royal-themed knick-knacks for more than 40 years and now boasts a collection worth £10,000. But squeezing it all into her small terraced home hasn't been easy and her gargantuan collection now fills four whole rooms, including one dedicated to Princess Diana alone. Scroll down for video . Passionate: Margaret Tyler, 71, has amassed a vast collection of royal memorabilia . Despite having a home that quite literally bursts with items, Mrs Tyler, a mother-of-four, says she has no plans to stop collecting and describes it as 'a labour of love'. 'There's loads of royal magazines that I read, so I get up at about 4.30am to keep up with it all,' she reveals. 'I'm retired but I don't think I've actually ever worked so hard in my life. It takes a lot of work [to maintain] but it's a labour of love.' As well as collecting royal memorabilia, Mrs Tyler, a retired charity worker, is also obsessed with meeting the real thing and says she spent six days outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in London when Prince George was born. 'I was there for six days,' she beams. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting.I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.' Extensive: Her collection includes china, a solar powered Queen and thousands of photos . Got it! A copy of the Duchess of Cambridge's £450 Issa engagement dress is in the collection . Although Mrs Tyler, who considers the Royal Family and extension of her own, didn't shake hands with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on that occasion, she has met a number of senior royals, among them the Queen. 'I've met a lot of them,' she reveals. 'I've met the Queen, I've met Prince Andrew and Prince Charles so I've been very lucky.' But despite considering herself lucky to have met so many royals, it is collecting that is her real passion and she has amassed around 10,000 items over 40 years. These are stored in four rooms, each with a different royal theme. Her drawing room is devoted to the Queen, while another, known as the Sandringham Room, has been turned into a £75-a-night B&B for royal enthusiasts. Her front room contains items created for every royal event in the past century, among them the 1953 Coronation and the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, while another space, dubbed 'the Memorial Room' is devoted exclusively to Princess Diana. Meeting: Mrs Tyler has met several members of the Royal Family including the Queen and Prince Charles . Favourite: Princess DIana remains one of Mrs Tyler's favourite royals and has an entire room to her name . Homage: Mrs Tyler in her Princess Diana room. Her favourite painting is seen on the back wall (centre) Inside are some of her most prized possessions, among them a Diana handbag, a set of Diana-themed matrioshka dolls and a stained glass window that Mrs Tyler commissioned in 1998 - a year after the princess' death. The room also boasts a fresco of the late princess painted on the ceiling and a large oil painting of Diana with her sons William and Harry. 'I think that says it all about Diana,' she says of the painting. 'She was a mother first and foremost.' Nevertheless, items devoted to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also occupy a considerable amount of the floor-space, as do the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. And while much of the collection might be made up of novelty items picked up at London markets, other items, such as a £450 Issa dress identical to the one worn by the Duchess of Cambridge for her engagement announcement, didn't come cheap. Despite the outlay and her rapidly diminishing space, Mrs Tyler says she will go on collecting royal memorabilia 'forever'. 'Enough is never enough,' she beams. 'It's an ongoing story isn't it? When William and Catherine's baby is born, it will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. 'It doesn't stop dead. You can't pretend that life isn't going on for them. Anyway, I just love it! Not even the dusting gets me down.'","Margaret Tyler, 71, has been collecting royal novelties for 40 years .

"A retired major general is among 1,000 British service personnel requiring psychiatric treatment after taking an anti-malarial drug issued by the Ministry of Defence. New figures released by the MoD show that since 2008, 994 personnel have been treated for mental health issues after having been prescribed Lariam. Despite Lariam - the brand name for the drug mefloquine - being banned by the U.S. military due to concerns over side effects, the MoD has ignored appeals to stop prescribing it in what critics say is an escalating 'scandal'. Major-General Alastair Duncan (pictured) is currently in a psychiatric unit after having been given the drug prior to a deployment in Sierra Leone . According to The Independent's Jonathan Owen, retired Major General Alastair Duncan is currently in a psychiatric unit following a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder episode four months ago. Maj-Gen Duncan was given the drug Lariam before a deployment to Sierra Leone. His wife Ellen told the paper: 'If 1,000 troops have reported the effects then you can be sure there are others who have not. I know personally of several and anecdotally of many more. The long-term effects of this will be more and more in evidence over the coming years.' Mrs Duncan's comments follow those from string of former military servicemen who have hit out at the MoD over its continuing use of Lariam. General Lord Dannatt told the paper it was 'extraordinary' the MoD continued to prescribe Lariam given the weight of evidence about its side effects, and urged it to use other anti-malaria medicines. Lariam's use by the U.S. military has also been closely scrutinized. The drug has been heavily discredited by the country's medicine watchdog. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns Lariam can cause serious mental health issues and should not be taken by anyone suffering from depression. These include anxiety, seizures, paranoia, hallucinations, and depression. In 2013, the organisation gave it a 'boxed warning' - the most serious of its kind - due to the neurological and psychiatric side effects associated with it. It stated: 'Neurologic side effects can occur at any time during drug use, and can last for months to years after the drug is stopped or can be permanent.' It went on to state that such symptoms interfered with patients' daily activities and ability to work, and in some cases were noticed after having taken only one or two doses. The U.S. military banned Lariam after it was linked to the case of Robert Bales, a soldier who massacred 16 Afghan civilians. Mefloquin is used to treat malaria and was developed by Army researchers towards the end of the Vietnam War. It gained support among the fighting forces because it works in areas where mosquitoes developed resistance to an earlier treatment, chloroquine, and requires just one tablet a week, not the daily dose needed with other medications. Side effects include seizures, depression, hallucinations, violent behaviour, feeling that others want to harm you, thoughts of hurting or killing yourself and many others. Almost four decades after inventing it, the U.S. Army pushed it to the back of its medicine cabinet. The about-face followed years of complaints and concerns that mefloquine caused psychiatric and physical side effects. In recent years, the Army slashed by almost 75 per cent the amount of mefloquine it prescribes, even as it sent thousands more soldiers to malaria-prone Afghanistan. Soldiers who had suffered from traumatic brain injuries were particularly advised against using it. 'Mefloquine is a zombie drug. It's dangerous, and it should have been killed off years ago,' said Dr. Remington Nevin, an epidemiologist and Army major who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain.","Almost 1,000 personnel required psychiatric treatment after taking drug .

"A group of Muslim migrants have been arrested for 'aggravated murder' after allegedly throwing 12 Christians into the Mediterranean sea during a recent crossing from Libya, Italian police reports. Witnesses say a fight broke out on a rubber dinghy carrying more than 100 African migrants from Libya to Sicily, after which the men were thrown to their deaths. A group of 15 men have now been arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate,' Palermo police said in a statement. Murders: A fight over religion broke out on a boat carrying 105 migrants from Libya, after which 12 men 'professing the Christian faith' were thrown to their deaths. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centers after disembarking from in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily . Italian police say they were informed of the alleged attacks by a group of Nigerian and Ghanaian survivors upon their arrival in Palermo, Sicily yesterday. The survivors said they had boarded a rubber boat on the Libyan coast on April 14, which had 105 passengers aboard. During the crossing, a fight broke out over religion, with the group of Muslim passengers threatening the Nigerians and Ghanaians after the latter declared themselves to be Christians. 'The threats then materialised and 12 people, all Nigerian and Ghanaian, are believed to have drowned in the Mediterranean,' the police statement added. The 15 migrants arrested over the attack on their arrival in Palermo are from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau. A group of 15 Muslim men, from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau, have now been arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate'  (not pictured) Italian Red Cross operators give first aid to immigrants as they arrive  in the Italian port of Messina  yesterday . This week, Italian coastguards intercepted more than 42 boats attempting to make the crossing to Europe . The police statement said their motive for the attack was that the victims 'professed the Christian faith while the aggressors were Muslim.' This followed reports earlier today of a shipwreck feared to have cost 41 lives off the Italian coast. Four men, two Nigerians, a Ghanaian and one from Niger, who had been rescued while floating in the Mediterranean by an Italian Navy helicopter reported the shipwreck once they arrived in the Italian port of Trapani today. They said had left Tripoli in Libya on Saturday and stayed adrift for four days. The new tragedies come just days after aid agencies reported 400 presumed dead in the sinking of another ship near the Libyan coast. The deaths have raised calls for a more robust search and rescue of the seas between Libya and Europe amid a surge in migration between the Middle East and Africa toward Italy.","Migrants from Nigeria and Ghana drown after being thrown overboard .

"It is a miracle she survived. With 18 broken bones, a broken nose, a ruptured kidney, a ruptured liver, missing teeth, and a fractured rib, Christy Mack was unrecognisable as she fled her Las Vegas home on August 8, 2014. It was the climax, the former porn star claims, of an abusive on-off relationship with MMA fighter Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, known professionally as War Machine. Now, nine months later, she has to wear a wig and glasses, and is still undergoing reparative dental work - while fighting to see Koppenhaver convicted of attempted murder. The journey, she tells ESPN, has been monumental. Scroll down for video . Recovering: Nine months ago, ex-porn star Christy Mack was in hospital fighting for her life (left). Now she is on the road to recovery, and has to wear glasses and a wig (right) after her boyfriend allegedly beat her . Relationship: Mack, 23, claims Koppenhaver, 33, became abusive months into their one-year relationship . 'I didn't look in the mirror for weeks,' she said. 'Just feeling my face, I knew it wasn't right. So when I'd look in the mirror, it's not me - that person wasn't me. It's so hard to go every day without being you anymore.' Mack, 23, claims Koppenhaver, 33, became abusive four months into their one-year relationship, which started fast. When they met on a photo shoot set, she had pneumonia and he offered to look after her, bringing pizza to her hotel, she told ESPN. 'It was an amazing connection. I feel in love really quick,' she said. Injuries: Mack posted this message on Twitter soon after the attack to show how she had been hurt . Bruised: Mack published this picture of her leg in the wake of the attack . Beaten and swollen: As well as the shocking images, Mack posted a description of the evening, claiming Koppenhaver had also cut off her hair with a blunt knife in the scuffle . Happier times: Mack says they met on a photo shoot when she had pneumonia and he offered to care for her . She said she believed, after the first attack, that it would never happen again. Around six months later, a male friend Corey Thomas was sleeping in her bed when she says Koppenhaver, who had a spare key, burst in. Koppenhaver allegedly beat Thomas then told him to go, but not to phone 911. Then, prosecutors allege, he approached Mack with a kitchen knife. He beat her and used the knife to saw off her mohawk, she told police. Injured: Mack, who has agreed to be identified in reporting of the case, was left with broken bones and a ruptured liver by the attack. She is pictured testifying against her former boyfriend in court last fall . Objection: A prosecutor asked that the court record that Koppenhaver was laughing and shaking his head as Mack said that he sexually assaulted her . Cuffed: Koppenhaver has maintained his innocence and tweeted that he was also beaten by another man . War Machine: Koppenhaver, who has legally changed his name to War Machine, will be tried this fall . It wasn't until he went to the kitchen that she was able to flee to a neighbor's house, it is claimed. Koppenhaver maintains his innocence. Throughout court proceedings, he has dismissed the 26 charges against him as 'heart breaking', insisting he was a victim. He took to Twitter days after the alleged attack to say that he had gone to propose to Mack but 'ended up fighting for my life'. 'I only wish that man hadn't been there and that Christy & I would be happily engaged. I don't know (why) I'm so cursed. One day truth will come out,' he wrote. Mack, who had already been a supporter and donor for women's right groups before her attack, slams the critics who targeted her with abuse that suggested she got what she deserved. 'It wasn't OK for people to say I got what I deserved when they had no idea what my struggle was.' The court will resume the case this fall.","Christy Mack, 23, claims ex-boyfriend Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, 33, beat and raped her until she almost died at her home on August 8, 2014 .

"With temperatures creeping up, let’s celebrate with some ice cream. In fact, why not make your own? The choice of ice cream makers has never been wider. MANDY FRANCIS tried out the best brands on the High Street with some enthusiastic help from her children Stanley, 13, and Florence, eight. The Swan Come Dine With Me Ice Cream & Gelato maker is best for dinner parties . BEST FOR DINNER PARTIES . Swan Come Dine With Me Ice Cream & Gelato maker, £49.99, argos.co.uk . How does it work? This minimalist, cube-shaped machine looks sleek and impressive. The removable bowl — which has an inner, freezable gel layer — has to be frozen for eight hours before you put it back in the machine, then add the mixing arm, pop on the lid, and turn it on. As it starts to churn, you slowly pour in the mixture according to the recipe included — a basic one of egg yolks, cornflour, sugar, double cream and vanilla extract which has to be cooked and cooled in the fridge. Check the progress every five minutes or so, switching it off when it’s reached the texture you want. Is it any good? At two litres, this has one of the biggest capacities we came across, so it’s perfect for dinner parties and family gatherings. Unusually, the bowl rotates on this machine, while the mixing arm stays still — which looks clever, but creates a huge amount of noise. Stanley and Florence kept popping in to ask if it was ready — not because they were looking forward to eating it, but because they wanted the racket to stop! Fortunately the clattering was over in 20 minutes and the light, fluffy ice cream was really tasty. Verdict: Nice ice cream, shame about the noise. Having to keep a close eye on the machine until the ice cream is the right texture is a pain, too. Rating: . BEST FOR KUDOS IN THE KITCHEN . Sage Smart Scoop by Heston Blumenthal, £349.99, sageappliances.co.uk . How does it work? Sleek and polished, this looks like a breadmaker but weighs in at a huge 12.5 kilos (26lbs). Unlike other machines, it’s self-refrigerating (so there’s no need to freeze the mixer bowl before use). The leaflet recommends using a chocolate creme Anglaise (custard, to us regular folk) made from cream, milk, egg yolks, dark chocolate and sugar, which is cooled and poured into the bowl which sits within the machine. Then you pick from the 12 consistencies the machine can make (including sorbet, frozen yogurt, gelato and ice cream), turn it on and let the rotating paddle whip it together. Thirty minutes later, a litre of your favourite ice creamis ready. Is it any good? Beautifully smooth and truly delicious. We all licked our bowls clean. Best of all, the machine signalled that it was ready by playing a retro ice cream van jingle, which the kids adored. Verdict: A fantastic ice cream maker, but bulky and expensive. Rating: . The Sage Smart Scoop by Heston Blumenthal is a fantastic ice cream maker, but bulky and expensive . BEST BUDGET BUY . Shake n Make Ice Cream Maker, £14.99, thefowndry.com . How does it work? This looks more like a large plastic takeaway cup. Half-fill it with crushed ice and four tbsp of salt, then place your ice cream mix, a 50/50 blend of milk, single cream, flavouring and sugar, in the metal cone-shaped container which sits inside, screw it together and shake vigorously for three minutes. A neat, individual portion of ice cream should be waiting inside. Is it any good? A doddle for the children to use, and educational too — they loved learning how salt helps make the frozen dessert (it allows the very cold, melting ice to cover a greater area of the metal cone, if you’re interested). So we were disappointed to find little more than a frothy milkshake, despite three minutes of serious shaking from Florence. Stanley took over for two minutes, but the resulting thin, rock hard layer of vanilla ice cream had to be chiselled off the sides. A second attempt, with a four-minute shake, gave a more palatable result. Verdict: A fun gadget, but for all that effort, it’s a bit leaky and you only get a small portion. Rating: . Mandy's best for budgets is the Shake n Make Ice Cream Maker (left) but for kids the giant plastic 'ice cream cone' (right) from John Lewis is perfect . BEST FOR CHILDREN . Chill Factor Ice Cream Maker, £12.99, johnlewis.com . How does it work? This giant plastic ‘ice cream cone’ had the kids salivating before we’d even started. You simply freeze the soft, rubbery cornet section, which is lined with thick freezable gel, for four to six hours, then use the lid to measure out the ingredients recommended in the leaflet — in our case, just single cream, strawberry sauce and a little sugar. Then you tip the ingredients into the frozen cornet, screw the container back together and give everything a shake. Finally, you remove the top section of the lid and squeeze the cornet repeatedly for 30 seconds to encourage the ice cream to freeze and churn, before diving in — you can eat directly from the container with the long-handled spoon supplied, saving on washing up! Is it any good? It’s surprisingly well-made, considering the price, and really easy to use. We were all amazed at how quickly it transformed the contents into a sweet but slightly lumpy soft-serve ice cream. Clever. Verdict: A cute, well-made gadget that children will love. Rating: . Cute, pink and compact, this machine is designed to produce a smaller, 500ml portion of ice cream (that’s the same size as a tub of Ben & Jerry’s or Haagen-Dazs) BEST FOR PERFECT PORTIONS . Lakeland Mini Ice Cream Maker, £19.99, lakeland.co.uk . How does it work? Florence fell in love with this as soon as she saw it. Cute, pink and compact, it’s designed to produce a smaller, 500ml portion of ice cream (that’s the same size as a tub of Ben & Jerry’s or Haagen-Dazs). The removable bowl-shaped base also fits neatly in to my packed freezer. Once it’s thoroughly frozen (which takes about eight hours) you slot the lid, motor and paddle together and fix them on top of the base. Then you flick the on/off switch and slowly pour in your ice cream mix, in our case a cooked custard recommended in the handbook, made from whole milk, double cream, egg yolk, sugar and vanilla paste. Your ice cream should be ready in 15-20 minutes. Is it any good? As you’d expect from Lakeland, this is a high-quality, no-fuss product that delivers — neatly and without too much noise. The only downside? You need to keep an eye on it to get the texture of the ice cream just right. Verdict: A basic but handy little ‘everyday’ gadget. Rating: . BEST FOR RETRO FANS . Gourmet Gadgetry Retro Diner 3 in 1 Slush and Soft Serve Ice Cream Maker, £59.99, Robert Dyas . How does it work? At first glance, this Fifties-inspired machine looks more like a blender (or ‘a bubblegum dispenser’ according to my children). In fact, it makes and dispenses both soft-serve ice cream and slushy drinks, and has a tall aluminium ice cylinder inside the plastic vessel. First, you fill the aluminium cylinder with salt, ice and water, then put on the lid and set it to start mixing. As the paddles rotate, you pour your ice cream mixture — mine was a blend of condensed milk, double cream, whole milk, sugar, vanilla extract and mashed fresh strawberries — into the plastic casing, and watch as the combination of the icy central cylinder and stirring starts to create ice cream. At first glance, this Fifties-inspired machine looks more like a blender (or ‘a bubblegum dispenser’ according to my children) Once the ice cream looks ready, which takes approximately 12 minutes, turn the machine to ‘dispense’ mode for a stream of velvety soft ice cream. Is it any good? Super-easy to use, but quite noisy. We also had to remember to top up the ice as it melted before the ice cream had formed. But the kids loved dispensing the result, which comes out ‘Mr Whippy’ style. And they declared it ‘delicious’, although it melted too quickly for my liking. Verdict: A statement gadget — but it’s noisy, and you need to be quick before the ice cream melts. Rating: . BEST FOR A QUICK TREAT . Zoku Ice Cream Maker Bowl, £19.99, domu.co.uk . How does it work? A brightly coloured, plastic and metal bowl that allows you to make a portion of ice cream by hand. Freeze the metal bowl section that sits within the plastic casing for 12 hours in your freezer, return it to the plastic case and pour in your ice cream recipe. We used the recommended chocolate recipe, made with a little whole milk, cream, sugar, cocoa powder and a pinch of salt. Stir the ingredients and scrape the sides of the bowl continuously with the spatula-style spoon supplied and the frozen bowl will produce a delicious ice cream in under ten minutes. Is it any good? Stanley loved the idea of this, and he thought the bowl looked ‘cool’ once assembled (praise indeed from a 13-year-old). Yet after five minutes of stirring, he started to lose heart, as did I when the mixture splashed messily over the sides. After a bit more scraping and stirring, a solid white film of ice cream started to form on the steel bowl, and five minutes later, he had a generous portion of lovely, soft ice cream, into which he sprinkled a little grated chocolate. Simply delicious! Verdict: A fun, but slightly messy way to make and personalise your own ice creams. Requires elbow grease. Rating: .

"Imminent arrival: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured with Prince George . They could have been any mother and child. The pony-tailed young woman sitting on a hay bale at a petting zoo with her little boy perched on her knee wore barely a trace of make-up. The only giveaway that she was someone special was the diamond and sapphire ring sparkling on her left hand. While some other mothers nudged one another in disbelief as Kate and Prince George cooed over the new-born animals, staff at Snettisham Farm Park, Norfolk, are so familiar with the Duchess of Cambridge she knows many on first-name terms. Helped by his mother, her prominent bump hidden beneath what appeared to be William’s green Barbour coat, Prince George tenderly gave a bottle of milk to one of the farm’s new-born piglets. If it seems to be a picture of a typical middle-class day out, that is no accident as this is exactly the informal, away-from-the-cameras upbringing William and Kate want for their children. That is why they are turning their new country bolt hole, Anmer Hall, on the North Norfolk coast, into a secluded fortress home, far from prying eyes – and far removed from traditional Royal protocol. Anmer is set to become their principal residence over the next few years as William focuses on family and his new flying career. For him, a life of peace and quiet is far preferable to his own pressure-cooker upbringing under the global spotlight. Royal aides have confirmed that the Cambridges will head to Anmer after the birth (they will spend the first night at Kensington Palace) – as will Kate’s mother, Carole, to help with childcare and housekeeping. Kate will be taking a longer maternity leave this time round and The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the pilot Prince plans to scale back his black-tie charity commitments so that he can enjoy more time at home. ‘His focus for the next two years is on family and flying in that order,’ a close friend revealed. Already the couple have immersed themselves in a notably more domestic – not to say middle class – life style than many Royals, with under-the-radar shopping trips to nearby market towns and evening dinners in country pubs. A noticeable part of the mother-and-child day out at Snettisham was the absence of fuss and preferential treatment. The Duchess’s security detail, stationed a respectful 50 yards away, left Kate and George to enjoy their morning in peace. It was a sunny Monday earlier this month, just days after the couple finally moved into Anmer Hall. And Kate and George were enjoying one of their last days out together before the arrival of the new Royal baby. Scroll down for video . Family home: William has created a secluded retreat for Kate, George and their new arrival at Anmer Hall, in North Norfolk . According to one farm source: ‘Kate comes here a lot with George. She is absolutely lovely and George is delightful. There is never a fuss when she’s here. ‘If she wasn’t pointed out to you, you wouldn’t know she was here. She goes about her business like any other young mum and dotes on her child. Little George is lovely, extraordinarily social and other children seem to fuss over him. They have no idea who he is.’ According to a close friend of Kate’s: ‘She can’t wait to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Both she and William love the country and it’s where they want to raise their family.’ It’s not hard to see why they want to escape the confines of Apartment 1A, Kensington Palace, their official residence. Fiercely private, the Cambridges are faced with the problem of being both public figures and private people. William has a complicated relationship with the media, dating back to his mother’s tragic death. He despises the paparazzi and has threatened legal action against any individuals taking unofficial photographs of his family. Pregnant Kate and young Prince George have enjoyed meeting the new-born animals at Snettisham Park Farm . Prince George and his mother are also regular visitors to the children’s play area at a nearby village . As a result, Prince George is rarely photographed in public and has not made an official appearance in this country since leaving St Mary’s hospital 21 months ago. This is no mistake. It is part of William’s strategy to shelter his family and he has a team of qualified aides and lawyers to advise him on privacy laws. Of course, William and Kate are also keen to enjoy the fruits of their two-year £1.5 million remodelling of their new home, with its ten bedrooms, swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds. Their official residence will remain Kensington Palace, but Anmer Hall will be their de facto family home for at least the next two years as William embarks on a new career with the East Anglian Air Ambulance Service. As part of the costly renovations – which also included installing a new roof, a state-of-the-art kitchen and a conservatory – William had the driveway to the property, which used to belong to his close friends the Van Cutsem family, rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees. Security is paramount and the outhouses have been converted into dwellings for the couple’s security staff. At Anmer Hall, Prince George can enjoy playing in the garden and William can cycle freely around the country lanes. Kate loves shopping in the locals villages of Burnham Market, Holt and Holkham and locals often see her playing with George at a play area in a nearby village. Moving to Anmer has afforded the couple the peace and freedom William especially has always craved. The tiny hamlet where they live is so small there isn’t even a pub, just a social club where the couple sometimes mingle with locals at its film nights. The residents of the blue-doored cottages, part of the Sandringham estate, are fiercely protective of their new neighbours. Remember, too, that some of William’s happiest childhood memories are of when his mother ripped up the stuffy Royal protocols and introduced her two young sons to ‘normal’ life by taking them to theme parks, go-kart tracks and public beaches – trips echoed by Kate and George’s visit to the petting zoo. The Duchess of Cambridge enjoys shopping in picturesque North Norfolk villages such as Holt (pictured) Friends say they are considering sending Prince George to a local nursery or playschool. While a Royal aide says it is ‘a bit premature’, the couple will soon have to think about the option for their son. The couple have already become central to the elite group of aristocratic locals known as the ‘Turnip Toffs’. Prince George’s godfather William Van Cutsem and his wife Rosie live in Hilborough, 40 minutes away, while the Duke’s old friends the Duckworth-Chad family live at Pynkney Hall near King’s Lynn. William’s friend, Etonian Archie Soames is often at the family seat, West Barsham Hall in Fakenham, less than an hour from Anmer Hall, and the couple socialise with Baron Howard of Rising’s children Annabel, Charlie and Tom who William plays football with. The Duke’s cousin Laura Fellowes and her husband Nick Pettman also live in West Norfolk. The couple already have a list of favourite pubs. Two weeks ago, they shared a dinner with six friends at The Crown in nearby East Rudham. William, seated at the head of the table next to his heavily pregnant wife, organised the supper to celebrate them finally moving to Anmer. ‘William and Kate have friends in Norfolk, and they enjoyed a private dinner in a dining room,’ reports a source. ‘They wanted a night out and they can do it here. The locals are very protective of them, as are the pub owners. They organise special tables out of the way of prying eyes and escape routes so they are never seen coming in or leaving.’ The couple have been seen dining at the Dabbling Duck in Great Massingham, the King’s Head in Great Bircham and the Rose and Crown at Snettisham. While they are relaxed, their discreet security detail of five protection officers remains on high alert. Friends say the plan is for Carole to move in to look after her daughter once William resumes work following a fortnight’s paternity leave. The Duke, 32, will be stationed at Cambridge Airport when he is fully trained to fly a powerful EC145 T2 helicopter. He is said to be ‘enormously excited’ about flying again, but it will be a challenge juggling his new career with official duties. William will be based at Cambridge Airport as part of his duties with the East Anglian Air Ambulance Service . The Cambridges have already enjoyed dinner with friends at one of their locals, the Crown Inn at East Rudham . The Mail on Sunday has been told that William has implemented a number of changes to his diary and will be cutting back on black-tie charity events in particular. Instead, a friend insisted, he plans to continue with the informal, more intimate charity work he loves. A spokesman for the Duke said he remains committed to his charities, adding: ‘The Duke’s intent is to work as full time as possible. He starts flying in the summer and his roster will take into account his official engagements. These will be broadly consistent with previous years.’ Meanwhile, his family will be staying in the background. Princes William and Harry were filmed as toddlers playing the piano in the Kensington Palace nursery with their parents, but William and Kate have refused to allow the cameras into their home. Pointedly, Prince George fulfilled his only official engagement on the other side of the world in Wellington during the couple’s tour of New Zealand and Australia. That short yet charming photocall has been his sole appearance in the public eye. Diana strove to create as ordinary a life as possible for her boys and William wants the same for his own children. He has seen the charm, security and joys of a happy family life with the Middletons and it is what he desires for his own family. Both he and Kate realise such a dream is far more realistic far from the madding crowds at Anmer Hall.","William and Kate are turning Anmer Hall into a secluded fortress home .

"We all know the time-consuming hassle of having to hoover the house, so it is perhaps no surprise to find that sailors on board this Russian aircraft carrier also got bored of sweeping the decks. What is perhaps more surprising is their solution to the problem, which involved strapping an old jet engine to the front of a tractor, and using the contraption as a huge leaf-blower. The crew of the Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's largest warship, came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing. Russian sailors on board the Admiral Kuznetsov, the country's largest  aircraft carrier, have come up with an inegnious way of cleaning the decks, by strapping an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor . Debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines, so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck, but the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother . Even a single stray nut or bolt, if sucked into one of the fighter plane's engines, could spell disaster for the pilot, and cause millions of dollars worth of damage. Usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects, using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up. But with 14,700sq ft of deck space to check and recheck every single day, the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother, and took a more direct approach. According to blog Foxtrot Alpha, the sailors have attached an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor, before fitting the front end with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the ship's deck. The vehicle is then driven up and down the 1,000ft-long deck, blowing all debris overboard. The massive Kuznetsov is the jewel in President Putin's military fleet, carrying a total of 18 fighter jets and 17 anti-submarine helicopters. The ingenious crew members fitted the old MiG engine with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the deck, and use the contraption like an enormous leaf blower, sending debris overboard . The Kuznetsov has a deck spanning 14,700sqft, so rather than search the entire thing by hand, Russian sailors built themselves a giant leaf-blowing machine instead . Bristling with anti-aircraft cannons, rocket batteries, gatling guns and underwater missiles, it weighs in at 43,000 tons and carries 1,690 crew. However, that is nothing compared to the US Nimitz Class aircraft carriers, the tenth and last of which, the George HW Bush, was commissioned in 2009. The ship weighs 102,000 tons, is powered by two on board nuclear reactors and is capable of carrying almost 6,000 crew and air company who pilot its 90 aircraft and helicopters. The UK's largest carrier in the HMS Queen Elizabeth, weighing in at 65,00 tonnes, it carries 40 jets and helicopters, along with 1,600 crew. The Kuznetsov is the largest carrier in the Russian Navy, built it 1985 it carries 18 fighter jets, 17 anti-submarine helicopters and 1,690 crew .","Debris on carriers can get sucked into jet engines, causing deadly crashes .

"The continents of North and South America came together much earlier than previously thought, according to researchers who found evidence in rock deposits from ancient rivers in Colombia of the land bridge that connected the long-isolated landmasses. The two continents are linked at Panama, but there has been a debate about when this land bridge first appeared, with most experts placing its formation at about 3 million years ago. The new study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, presents evidence that the Panama land bridge formed at least 10 million years earlier. Before the Isthmus of Panama rose from the sea by tectonic and volcanic action, the Central American Seaway linked the Atlantic to the Pacific as one great ocean. The various continents, sitting atop huge plates akin to jigsaw puzzle pieces sliding over Earth's mantle, have slowly moved around the globe during the planet's history. They have separated, drifted and joined numerous times in a process called plate tectonics. South America became an isolated landmass when it separated from Africa. Likewise, North America broke apart from Europe and headed on a gradual collision course with South America. Until then, a deep water channel called the Central American Seaway separated the continents. The researchers base their estimate on the presence of small grains of a mineral called zircon unearthed in ancient river bedrock in northern Colombia that originated in Panama and were 13 million to 15 million years old. These grains suggested the land bridge must have existed at that time, they said. 'We contend that a bridge, perhaps a transient one, was present since 13 to 15 million years ago,' said geologist Camilo Montes of Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, who led the study. 'Beds younger than about 13 to 15 million years contain abundant zircon grains with a typically Panamanian age,' said Montes. 'Older beds do not. 'We think these zircons were deposited by rivers flowing from the Isthmus of Panama when it docked to South America, nearly 10 million years earlier than the date of 3 million years that is usually given for the connection.' The various continents, sitting atop huge plates akin to jigsaw puzzle pieces sliding over Earth's mantle, have slowly moved around the globe during the planet's history. They have separated, drifted and joined numerous times in a process called plate tectonics. South America became an isolated landmass when it separated from Africa. Likewise, North America broke apart from Europe and headed on a gradual collision course with South America. One of the most dramatic results of the joining of the two Americas was the mixing of the animals living on the respective landmasses, with various creatures crossing the land bridge to invade the other continent. The event is known as the Great American Biological Interchange. After the Isthmus of Panama formed, animals and plants could move back and forth between continents, the Great American Biological Interchange. Smithsonian scientists are debating when this happened. South America had a unique animal population, with exotic marsupials including saber-toothed predators, as well as elephant-sized ground sloths, car-sized armadillos, camel-like creatures with elephant trunks and giant flightless, carnivorous 'terror birds.' North America had a quite different and impressive array of placental mammals including saber-toothed cats and other feline predators, huge short-faced bears, wolves and various herbivores including big elephant relatives and horses. The two continents continue to move together. 'Yes, the plates are moving today,' Montes said. 'They never stop.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Researchers had previously believed continents connected 3m years ago .

"The rampant Scottish National Party has extended its huge lead over Labour, polling showed last night. Detailed constituency surveys suggest Labour faces an unprecedented wipeout. Jim Murphy, its Scottish leader, and Douglas Alexander, its chief election strategist, are among those on course to lose their seats. Jim Murphy (left), Labour's Scottish leader, and Douglas Alexander (right), the party's chief election strategist could lose their seats . The nationalists are also on course to wipe out the Liberal Democrats in Scotland, with even Charles Kennedy, their popular former leader, now 15 points behind in his Highlands constituency. The survey of eight constituencies, by Lord Ashcroft, revealed swings to the SNP on a scale which would be unprecedented in modern European politics. The survey suggests Labour could lose all 41 seats it won in 2010. Tactical anti-SNP voting by supporters of other parties could save some. There are 59 seats in Scotland. Mr Murphy is nine points behind in his East Renfrewshire seat with the SNP buoyed by leader Nicola Sturgeon’s strong performance in two TV debates. That means there has been a 26.5 per cent swing away from Labour since 2010. Labour conceded that ‘no gloss’ could be put on the polls and warned that if the findings become reality then ‘David Cameron will walk back into Downing Street again’. Conor Pope, of party supporters’ website LabourList, said: ‘If previous Ashcroft constituency polling in Scotland could be described as an earthquake, the poll the Tory peer had dropped this afternoon will require an entirely different word. A cataclysm perhaps. ‘If this is an earthquake it’s certainly not the kind that rattles the windows in the middle of the night, it’s the sort that razes whole cities. ‘If Lord Ashcroft’s polling is correct, there’s a risk that Jim Murphy could lose his seat to the SNP. At the last poll he had a slender one point lead over the SNP, that has now turned in a matter of weeks into a nine-point lead for the SNP. That’s well outside the margin of error. The rampant Scottish National Party, led by Nicola Sturgeon (pictured), has extended its lead over Labour . ‘What was once a Labour/Tory marginal could well fall to the forces of separatism. Such a result would be a painful – almost existential – blow to a Scottish Labour Party that is already battered and bruised.’ Yesterday, Mr Murphy launched a desperate attempt to regain support by abandoning his Blairite views in a bid to win over left-wing voters. Mr Murphy unveiled Labour’s Scottish election manifesto in Glasgow as he declared ‘the party of John Smith and the party of Donald Dewar is back in business’. Overlooking the Tony Blair ‘New Labour’ era, during which he served as a minister, he allowed retiring Labour MP David Hamilton to whip the crowd into a frenzy by attacking Margaret Thatcher and laying into the SNP with the battle cry: ‘They are nationalists, we are socialists.’ Mr Murphy himself vowed to introduce socialist-style ‘redistributive’ policies, as he accused the SNP of stealing Labour’s clothes.","Polling shows Scottish National Party has extended its lead over Labour .

"An elderly British couple who fell victim to pickpockets as they returned to their hotel in Benidorm incredibly got their belongings back after confronting the duo - and it was all caught on camera. Brian and Joan Ogden, from Wigan, had been out to eat and were on their way back into the Hotel Don Pancho when the organised pair collaborated to take a wallet. CCTV footage from the hotel shows the thief in a purple top reaching into the pocket of Mr Ogden, 80, while her accomplice attempts to block the view of Mrs Ogden, 78. But they weren't to be fooled. A pickpocket (right in the purple top) follows Bruce Ogden into the Hotel don Pancho in Benidorm .

The pickpocket is then shown handing the wallet to her accomplice after taking it from Mr Ogden . Grainy CCTV footage outside the hotel shows Mr Ogden get the wallet back from one of the thieves . After the pickpocket in purple sneakily handed the wallet to her cohort, Mr and Mrs Ogden followed the crooks out of the hotel and in a short exchange asked for the wallet back, and got it. The Ogden's son Mick said his parents were tougher than they look. 'They'd been for something to eat before they got the bus back to Alicante, before they flew home,' he recounted. 'I got a call from them saying they'd been robbed, then we found out what happened - these scumbags had followed them right up to the hotel. 'They'd been following my mum and dad for a bit, and my mum saw them so she hung back as they got to the door, and saw one of them put their hand in my dad's pocket. 'So she runs back after them and gets their stuff back. When they rang me, they thought they'd lost their credit cards, but nothing was lost.

I've been coming for years and have never seen anything like this before.' Hotel Don Pancho's guest relationship manager, Ana Labord, said pickpockets are a problem in Benidorm 'especially when tourists go to the busy open markets' but there is little that can be done. 'I showed (the Ogdens) the images, we have many security cameras and they were right by the entrance, you can see they were followed from the main road then down the walkway,' she said. 'Usually they don't go that far as there are cameras, but I guess they must have had a bad day. They tried to pickpocket them, but they realised and asked for their things back.'

She added that the Ogdens were brave to have confronted the thieves, an action she wouldn't necessarily recommend. 'Everyone has to make their own decisions,' she said. 'I personally wouldn't confront a thief like that but in this case they did, and you can see it worked out, they clearly did the right thing as they got their wallets back. 'Everybody should be careful, and sometimes you shouldn't confront them, but in Benidorm it's not violence that's a problem, just the pickpocketing like any other busy tourist area.'","Brian and Joan Ogden were robbed as they returned to their hotel .

"A new HIV treatment pioneered using an antibody to attack the virus could lead to a new vaccine to prevent the infection. The first results to emerge from patient trials reveal the experimental therapy can dramatically reduce the level of virus in a patient's blood - their viral load. The scientists behind the discovery believe their findings offer new strategies for fighting or even preventing HIV infection. The antibody was designed by researchers to block the key viral protein receptor that is needed to infect human blood cells. As a result patients injected with the neutralising antibody during the trials saw a 300-fold reduction in their viral load. Scientists at the Rockefeller University in New York believe a new antibody therapy could pave the way for an HIV vaccine after clinical trials revealed the treatment resulted in a 300-fold decrease in the amount of HIV, pictured, in sufferers' blood . In a person infected with HIV, there is an ongoing battle between the virus and the body's immune system. As the body produces new antibodies that target the virus, the infection mutates to escape, managing to stay a few steps ahead. The team of scientists at Rockefeller University in New York now believe that using synthetic antibodies that attached to the surface of proteins on the outer membrane of the HIV virus, could offer an alternative treatment to the anti-retroviral drugs currently used. They hope the breakthrough will result in new therapeutic vaccines. HIV antibodies previously tested in humans had shown disappointing results, but the antibody tested at Rockefeller University belongs to a new generation of broadly neutralising antibodies that potently fight a wide range of HIV strains. Healthy gay men should be given anti-retroviral drugs to 'slash the number of cases of HIV', a groundbreaking study published earlier this year suggested. The Proud study, conducted in England, provides the first evidence that preventative HIV treatment is highly effective in a real-world setting. It showed that pre-exposure to the HIV drug Truvada can reduce the risk of infection in men-who-have-sex-with-men  by as much as 86 per cent. Previous research had suggested that preventive treatment might cut HIV infection rates but it was unclear whether such an approach would work in practice. 'One antibody alone, like one drug alone, will not be sufficient to suppress viral load for a long time because resistance will arise,' said Dr Marina Caskey, co-first author of the study. 'What's special about these antibodies is that they have activity against over 80 per cent of HIV strains and they are extremely potent.' The research showed the new antibody therapy was effective against 195 of 237 HIV strains. The immune systems of people infected with HIV naturally produce broadly neutralising antibodies in 10 to 30 per cent of sufferers, but only after several years of infection. By that time, the virus has typically evolved and mutated to a point rendering the powerful antibodies ineffective. However, by isolating and cloning these antibodies, researchers are able to harness them as therapeutic agents to use against HIV infections that have had less time to evolve. As part of the new study, uninfected and HIV-infected people were given a single dose of the antibody intravenously, and monitored for 56 days. At the highest dose level - 30mg per kilo of weight - all eight infected people treated showed up to a 300-fold decrease in the amount of HIV virus measured in their blood. Most of those participants reached their lowest viral load just one week after treatment. The study marks the first time the new generation of HIV antibodies has been tested in humans. Dr Marina Caskey, co-first author of the study, said: 'What's special about these antibodies is that they have activity against over 80 per cent of HIV strains and they are extremely potent.' (File picture) Dr Caskey said further trials could result in the antibodies being used in conjunction with existing anti-retroviral drugs to maintain better control over the infection to prevent the onset of Aids. She said antibody therapy might require treatment once every few months, compared with daily doses of antiretroviral drugs, currently the front line treatment for the virus. Besides the possibility of treatment, the study also raises hopes for an HIV vaccine. Dr Caskey said that if researchers can induce an uninfected person's immune system to generate potent antibodies such as that tested, it might be enough to block the HIV infection before it can be established. The study was published in the journal Nature.","New antibody blocks protein receptor needed to infect human cells .

"Ted Cruz is personally against the legalization of marijuana but the Republican presidential candidate said this weekend that he believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want - even though they directly conflict with federal law. Cruz implied during a conversation with Daily Mail Online on Saturday that if he ascended to the highest elected office he wouldn't make his attorney general enforce federal laws pertaining to marijuana in states that have approved sales and consumption of the drug. The position stands in contrast to the views of at least three of his GOP competitors, who last week said that while they believe in states' rights to self-determination, they'd lay the hammer down on Colorado and Washington for flouting federal law. Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted CruzCruz implied during a conversation with Daily Mail Online on Saturday that if he ascended to the highest elected office he wouldn't make his attorney general enforce federal laws pertaining to marijuana in states that have approved sales and consumption of the sticky icky . Cruz, pictured here on Sunday in Litchfiled, New Hampshire, at the Londonderry Fish and Game Club, is personally against the legalization of marijuana but said this weekend he believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want - even though they directly conflict with federal law . Asked Saturday during a New Hampshire campaign stop if he would direct his attorney general to enforce federal pot laws, Cruz said ‘yes’ before providing a lengthy answer that indicated he would not. He first said that ‘if the attorney general and the president disagree with federal drug law they should come to Congress’ because Republicans and Democrats can come together on the issue of drug reforms. ‘But it is lawless for the attorney general simply with a stroke of a pen to say we will not enforce these federal laws we disagree with.' He was referring at that time to Eric Holder's Justice Department's decision to look the other way when it comes to minor drug offenses across the country. He then said: ‘There is a different circumstance when you have states that a democratically adopted law that legalizes marijuana.' 'When that happens that's a change in the legal standard, and then you have to apply conflict of law standards,' Cruz, the former solicitor general of the state of Texas, said. 'In my view the question of legalizing marijuana should be a question for the states. Now personally I don't support legalization. If it came up for a vote in the state of Texas, I'd vote no. But I respect the genius of the framers of our Constitution,' he added. Cruz's stance on the issue presents a problem the politician who has said the 'most dangerous' aspect of President Barack Obama's tenure ‘has been lawlessness, the unwillingness of the president to follow federal law or the Constitution.’ Article Six, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, better known as the Supremacy Clause, clearly states that laws established by Congress are 'the supreme law of the land' and the Supreme Court has consistently ruled in favor of the federal government. A strict Constitutionalist who has made a career for himself by bashing Obama for straying from its principles, Cruz's promise to respect the founding document has been at the center of his campaign for presidency. During his gaggle with reporters on Saturday after his speech at the First in the Nation conference in Nashua, New Hampshire, Cruz levied the attack on Obama's lawlessness, then, a minute or two later, in response to another question, said he would not vote in favor of the president's attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch when her name comes up for consideration in the U.S. Senate. The reason for his 'no' vote, he said, is the support for the president’s lawlessness that she demonstrated at her confirmation hearing. The role of the attorney general he said, is 'to remain faithful to the rule of law and the Constitution and the American people’. Cruz was then asked if he’d make his own attorney general follow the rule of law when it comes to federal marijuana policy. JUST SAY NO: Cruz's position stands in contrast to three of his GOP competitors - Marco Rubio, left, Chris Christie, center, and Lindsey Graham, right - who said last week that while they believe in states' rights to self-determination, they'd lay the hammer down on Colorado and Washington for flouting federal law . Cruz shakes hands with Adam Prendible, 8, of Bedford, New Hampshire, at his Sunday stop. Cruz was in town for the First in the Nation forum, held Saturday in Nashua . Daily Mail Online followed up on the statement in an email to Cruz's presidential campaign and pointed out that the constitutional scholar  seemed to arguing that states’ rights should supersede federal law in this specific ‘circumstance’ -  marijuana policy - and that he'd legally get around the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by claiming that ‘conflict of law standards’ should apply. It further pointed out that the Obama administration's alleged violation of Article II of the Constitution, the section that pertains to the executive branch, is not dissimilar from Cruz's own intentions. Lawyers for the Justice Department have argued in court that the president was within his legal right to act on immigration. Daily Mail Online also pointed out that Cruz's competitors for the GOP nomination - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a likely 2016 candidate, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, an announced contender - were asked a similar question about weed on conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt's show last week and they were clear in their answers. 'Marijuana is a gateway drug,' Christie said after Hewitt asked him if he'd crackdown on weed sales in Colorado and Washington . Citing an 'enormous addiction problem in this country,' Christie said, 'we need to send very clear leadership from the White House on down through the federal law enforcement. 'Marijuana is an illegal drug under federal law. And the states should not be permitted to sell it and profit from it.' Asked for the same thing by Hewitt, Rubio said 'Yes, I think we need to enforce our federal laws.' Rubio, who is also a lawyer by trade, said he's a believer in states' rights, 'but they don’t have a right to write federal policy as well.' Stating for the record his own sentiments on weed, Rubio then said, 'I don’t believe we should be in the business of legalizing additional intoxicants in this country for the primary reason that when you legalize something, what you’re sending a message to young people is it can’t be that bad, because if it was that bad, it wouldn’t be legal.' A CANDIDATE'S BEST FRIEND: Cruz posed for pictures with potential supporters and their pets. A former solicitor general of Texas, Cruz's stance on pot resents a problem the politician who has said the 'most dangerous' aspect of President Barack Obama's tenure ‘has been lawlessness, the unwillingness of the president to follow federal law or the Constitution' Accompanying Cruz on the trip was his wife Heidi. She's pictured here on Sunday at the Londonderry Fish and Game club . In a separate interview with Daily Mail Online, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who is expected to join the race at the end of May, said he 'would not embrace legalizing marijuana.' Asked if he would crack down on states deploying their own standards for weed sales as president, Graham said, 'The federal law preempts the state law. We just can't just take the law and do what we can't.' In response to Daily Mail Online's email, a spokesperson for Cruz said in a statement: 'Just because federal case law allows the federal government to assert the Supremacy Clause to try to displace state law, does not mean that in every instance the federal government should do so.' The response indicated that Cruz, if president, would not force his attorney general's office to go after states that legalize pot because he doesn't think the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution should be applied in areas where voters have said they want to get high without repercussions. 'The Framers of our Constitution understood cooperative federalism--the overlapping spheres of authority between the federal and state governments--and federal law enforcement can and often should respect and incorporate state law,' the statement from Cruz's campaign continued. 'The voters of the states of Colorado and Washington have made the decision to legalize marijuana, and that is a change in law that alters the appropriate enforcement of federal law.' She also made clear that Cruz is of the opinion that the Department of Justice 'lacks the authority to simply refuse to enforce current federal law' in states that have not passed their own marijuana laws. The couple went to church on Saturday in Auburn, New Hampshire, at the First Assembly God .","Cruz is personally against the legalization of marijuana but believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want .

"Roman Abramovich has bought Tel Aviv’s Varsano Hotel for 100million Israeli shekels (£17.1m). The Chelsea owner, who frequently visits Tel Aviv on business, is expected to convert the 19th century building into his Israeli home. Covering 1,500 square metres, the hotel complex is listed as a preserved building. It consists of a main building with a large lobby, dining room and two studio suites, and six more bedrooms in three separate villas surrounded by gardens.

Abramovich has been trying to buy a home in the fashionable Neve Tzedek quarter of Tel Aviv since 2008 when he had a $30m (£20.5m) bid for Chelouche House, formerly the neighbourhood school, turned down. Neve Tzedek was built in the late 19th century north of Jaffa, and links the ancient port to Tel Aviv’s financial district, which was built in 1906.

Abramovich owns five luxury homes and a mega-yacht as he continues to grow his impressive empire . Until the 1980s the area was full of slum properties but in recent decades gentrification, together with the Israeli high-tech start-up boom, have seen Neve Tzedek become one of Israel’s most expensive quarters. Businessman Eyal Kamir and real estate agent Oren Katz are understood to have brokered the deal, and Tel Aviv law firm Yigal Arnon & Co acted on behalf of Abramovich. Journalists who phoned the Varsano Hotel were told that it is not taking any more bookings. Abramovich and his wife Dasha Zhukova, who are both Jewish, are frequent visitors to Israel. Only last year, Abramovich made headlines by booking all 111 rooms in an Israeli hotel in the Negev desert to entertain his guests during the Passover holiday, and over the past year he has invested in four Israeli companies. Now Abramovich can host guests in his own hotel. What does the man who has everything get himself? Roman Abramovich is worth more than $9billion (£6.1bn) but the Russian tycoon is seemingly trying his best to get rid of it...

Chelsea Football Club . Abramovich paid £140m for Chelsea 12 years ago, and since then they have won 12 major honours including three Barclays Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2012. During his time at Stamford Bridge, Abramovich has spent north of £840m on player transfers. His contribution has not gone unnoticed, and manager Jose Mourinho even thinks he has helped the sport: 'He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football.' Chelsea's 1-0 win against Queens Park Rangers last week was Abramovich's 700th game. Chelsea owner Abramovich is a regular at Stamford Bridge to see his team play in the Premier League .

"Apology: Clydesdale chief Debbie Crosbie whose rogue staff misled the Financial Ombudsman . A High Street bank has been hit with a record £21million fine after being caught falsifying documents to avoid compensating victims of mis-selling. Now there are calls for criminal charges to be brought over an extraordinary cover-up lasting more than two years at Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks. Rogue staff misled the Financial Ombudsman – deliberately obstructing its investigation into payment protection insurance complaints. They deleted records and tampered with evidence to make it look like the customer was never sold PPI, or they lied about not being able to trace documents. Politicians called for a police investigation into the wrong-doing, which took place between May 2011 and July 2013. Mark Garnier, a Tory former member of the Treasury committee, said: ‘This all took place well after the financial crisis, when banks said they had changed. Clearly they haven’t. ‘It would be unacceptable if criminal charges are not brought against the people who perpetrated this. An example must be set.’ Labour’s John Mann said those who falsified documents could be guilty of fraud or forgery. ‘The police or the Serious Fraud Office should look at the evidence, because clearly there is a possibility of fraud or forgery which cheated people out of compensation,’ he said. It is a criminal offence under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 to falsify documents. Mr Mann added: ‘This behaviour is reprehensible and shows the lengths some banks have been prepared to go to mislead regulators. ‘The police really need to look into this – fines are not enough.’ Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks are part of the same group and owned by National Australia Bank, with around three million customers and just under 300 branches. Clydesdale holds the banking licence for both in the UK. According to the City watchdog, the worst of the cover-up – which lasted from May 2012 to June 2013 – resulted in up to 42,200 PPI complaints being rejected unfairly and up to 50,900 customers receiving inadequate compensation. In one case a married couple were cheated out of a £5,100 pay-out because the lender lied to the ombudsman that it had not been able to trace records of them having bought PPI. In reality, it never looked for them in the first place. The FCA said the bank had an ‘inappropriate policy’ for its complaints handling in 2011– instructing staff not to search for PPI complaints relating to loans and mortgages that had been repaid more than seven years prior to the complaint. Clydesdale also failed to trawl back through credit card statements dating before 2000 for customers mis-sold PPI alongside a credit card. This resulted in some customers being short-changed on compensation pay-outs, or missing out entirely. But the wrongdoing escalated in May 2012 when a team of staff started to provide false information to the Financial Ombudsman when it was investigating complaints on old PPI policies. This included deleting any reference to PPI on documents related to a customer. Staff also tampered with computer records to make it look like that documentation had been destroyed. This information was then printed out and sent to the Financial Ombudsman. The City watchdog said management at the bank were not aware this was going on. Georgina Philippou, of the Financial Conduct Authority, said: ‘Clydesdale’s failings were unacceptable and fell well below the standard the FCA expects. Fined: The FCA investigation found 'serious failings' in the way Clydesdale handled its PPI complaints . ‘The fact that Clydesdale misled the Financial Ombudsman by providing false information about the information it held is particularly serious and this is reflected in the size of the fine.’ Clydesdale and Yorkshire’s failings were so serious that the £20.7million fine dwarfs the next biggest penalty handed out for PPI, which was £7million imposed on Alliance & Leicester in 2008. The policies were meant to protect customers with loans who lost their jobs or became too sick to work. Labour's John Mann said those who falsified documents could be guilty of fraud or forgery . But they were widely sold to customers who would never have been able to claim – including the elderly and those with existing medical conditions. High street lenders – which made huge profits from selling PPIs – have been forced to set aside £24billion to compensate customers. Clydesdale has so far set aside just over £800million, of which £291million has been paid out – with average settlements of £2,900. But its bill is set to grow as it is forced to revisit 180,000 old cases. The cost of PPI mis-selling is expected to spiral as complaints continue to flood in. Lloyds has racked up a bill of more than £12billion so far – around half the amount put aside by the entire industry. The Financial Ombusdman continues to be swamped by 4,000 complaints a week, but banks complain that claims management firms – which bombard customers with nuisance text messages and phone calls – are driving many people to make bogus PPI complaints. Clydesdale said it had taken disciplinary action against the staff involved. Acting chief executive Debbie Crosbie said: ‘We deeply regret any instance which led to the Financial Ombudsman Service receiving incorrect or incomplete information from us. ‘These practices were not authorised or condoned by the banks. As soon as this issue was discovered, we took immediate steps to stop it; we made the regulator aware and rapidly introduced strict new monitoring procedures.’","Staff at Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks misled the Financial Ombudsman .

"The Baltimore Police Department has used secret cellphone surveillance equipment 4,300 times since 2007 - amid claims it is ordered to withhold such evidence from prosecutors, a court heard. A detective from the department said officers used a device called Hailstorm, which can identify phones from a 360-degree antenna from about a city block away. Police use it to trace stolen phones or to find people. The details, revealed in court, resemble the original plot of HBO’s hit series The Wire, the crime drama based in the same city, which featured electronic surveillance of drug dealers. Baltimore Police used cellphone surveillance equipment 4,300 times since 2007, a court heard. The case resembles parts of the plot of The Wire (pictured), which featured electronic surveillance of drug dealers . Testifying on Wednesday, Baltimore police Detective Emmanuel Cabreja said the department is under orders by the US government to withhold evidence from criminal trials and to ignore subpoenas in cases where the device is used. Cabreja said under questioning from defense attorneys that he did not comply with a subpoena to bring the device to court because of a nondisclosure agreement between the Baltimore police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 'Does it instruct you to withhold evidence from the state's attorney and the circuit court of Baltimore city, even if upon order to produce?' asked defense attorney Joshua Insley. 'Yes,' Cabreja replied, saying he spoke with the FBI last week about the case. The Baltimore case surrounds a carjacking and robbery. Nicholas West and his co-defendant, a juvenile, pleaded guilty on Wednesday. Yet the case, like a handful of others in the city, has raised questions among defense attorneys and even a circuit court judge over the use of the cellphone-tracking equipment. The Hailstorm, made by Florida-based Harris Corp., can sweep up cellphone subscriber-identity data by tricking phones into thinking it's a cell tower. It is an upgraded version of the Stingray surveillance device. Hailstorm is an upgraded version of the Stingray surveillance device (pictured) manufactured by Harris Corporation, of Melbourne, Florida . That data is then transmitted to the police, allowing them to locate a phone without the user even making a call or sending a text message. 'This is a very expensive and very invasive technology developed for military use, now used on the streets of America,' said Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has fought for the release of these types of records. 'The public has a right to know how taxpayer dollars are being spent, and if our constitutional rights are being respected,' he said. The FBI declined to immediately answer questions about the case last night. Police across the country have largely been kept silent on how they use the devices. A detective from Baltimore (pictured) said officers used a device called Hailstorm, which can identify phones from a 360-degree antenna from about a city block away in distance . Because documents about Stingrays and Hailstorms are regularly censored in public records requests by citizens and journalists, it is not entirely clear what information the devices could capture - such as the contents of phone conversations and text messages, what they routinely capture based on how they are configured, or how often they might be used. Cabreja  said Hailstorm can identify phones from an antenna from about a city block away in distance. He said no content, such as text messages or phone conversations, is captured in the process. Some judges have pushed back against state and local government agencies in criminal trials and freedom-of-information requests involving the surveillance devices. In Baltimore, Circuit Judge Barry Williams presided over an earlier trial in which the police apparently used a surveillance device to collect evidence on a robbery suspect. At a November 2014 hearing, Williams lost his patience with a state prosecutor after a police technician wouldn't answer a defense attorney's questions about the device - citing the same FBI nondisclosure agreement. 'You don't have a nondisclosure agreement with the court,' Williams told police Detective John Haley, part of the department's advanced technical team. 'Answer the question.' The prosecutors instead withdrew the evidence, avoiding a contempt citation and questions about the equipment's use.","Hailstorm equipment used by department 4,300 times since 2007, court told .

"The winter of 2014-15 won't be easily forgotten in Boston after the endless snow broke countless records and the city had to pay volunteers $30 an hour to help dig out the battered city. The shere volume of snow that fell earlier this year, nearly 65 inches fell in February alone, means that huge piles of the white stuff still remain. Except the remaining 'snow' isn't very white any more but rather a disgusting black color riddled with trash including broken pieces of glass, plastic shards and goodness knows what else.

"The prospect of a 'Blukip' alliance between David Cameron and Nigel Farage is now just as likely as a coalition between the SNP and Labour, Nick Clegg claimed today. The Deputy Prime Minister said there was a 'very real danger' that Ukip and Northern Ireland's DUP could hold Mr Cameron to 'ransom' in the event of a second hung Parliament. Mr Clegg's remarks come after Mr Farage  held out an olive branch to the Prime Minister last night - as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible Labour government. The Lib Dems released a new campaign poster this morning warning of the danger of a 'BluKip' alliance between the Tories and Ukip . The Ukip leader called on Conservatives to vote tactically for him in seats where they cannot win in order to help keep the Tory leader as Prime Minister. And in the strongest hint yet that they could work together, Mr Farage dropped his demand that the Tories ditch Mr Cameron before any post election deal. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the remarks showed that the 'mood music' had changed in the Conservative Party. He said: 'Only yesterday there were reports of Nigel Farage opening 'back channels' with the Tories to discuss a post-election pact. 'The Tory right wing has been waiting for its moment to reclaim the Conservative Party for years. 'And, with the help of MPs from UKIP and the DUP, that moment may be about to come.' Mr Clegg added: 'Everyone knows that David Cameron and Ed Miliband won't win this general election outright. 'That means that someone else will hold the balance of power on 8 May. The prospect of a left wing alliance between Labour and the SNP has been well covered.' The Deputy Prime Minister said there was a 'very real danger' that Ukip and Northern Ireland's DUP could hold Mr Cameron to 'ransom' in the event of a second hung Parliament . But he added: 'What's equally possible is an alliance that will drag Britain further and further to the right: BLUKIP – a bloc of right wingers from UKIP, the Conservatives and the DUP that could hold the balance of power. 'There is a very real danger that Nigel Farage and his friends could hold David Cameron to ransom.' It comes after Mr Farage issued a direct appeal to Tory voters yesterday. Mr Farage said he believed many were in 'their hearts' closer to his position of wanting an EU referendum as soon as possible without any attempted re-negotiation. Mr Farage also revealed that he has already held informal discussions with Tories about potential post-election arrangements. Yesterday, as he launched his party's manifesto, Mr Farage called on Mr Cameron to join with him to lock Ed Miliband and the SNP's Alex Salmond out of Downing Street. The Lib Dem leader's remarks come after Mr Farage (right) held out an olive branch to the Prime Minister (pictured in Glasgow this morning left) last night - as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible Labour government . Ukip has reduced its list of targets to just ten seats as it has been squeezed in the polls, but Mr Farage believes in seats such as Great Grimsby and Dudley North it has a better chance than the Tories at snatching them from Labour. Asked if it was time that Conservative supporters realised that Ukip could help them stop a Labour government, Mr Farage said they needed to vote tactically. He said: 'One of the things I have completely failed to understand is how the Conservatives would want to say vote Ukip get Labour in constituencies like Grimsby and Rotherham and Dudley North and all those Labour seats in which we are the challenger. I just don't understand it.' He warned that a Labour-led government backed up by the SNP 'would not be a very good thing for the country'. DUP leader Nigel Dodds could help prop up the Tories in power in the event of another hung Parliament . Asked if he and Mr Cameron could 'lock out' Mr Miliband and Mr Salmond from Downing Street, he replied: 'Well if that were possible then we would try and do that.' Mr Farage previously said that Mr Cameron would need to step down as Tory leader before he could do any sort of post-election deal. But yesterday he said there would be no problem working with Mr Cameron personally. He said: 'Albeit reluctantly, David Cameron has been forced into making a pledge on a referendum. There are circumstances in which we could do a deal with him but the referendum has got to be a proper one and not in 2017.' Mr Cameron a fortnight ago urged Conservative supporters who have defected to Ukip to 'come home' and pleaded with them not to use their vote in the General Election as a 'protest'. Yesterday asked what his message was to Tory voters, Mr Farage called on them to work with him to bring forward the referendum Mr Cameron has promised on EU membership by 2017. He made a reference to comments by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, that any meaningful renegotiation would not be possible until 2019. He said: 'I've said from the start there is no re-negotiation of any value whatsoever and it would appear that my old mate Mr Juncker is backing that up. 'The idea that we would need to wait for two or more years for a referendum is not something that I find acceptable.' Mr Farage said he would also want the Tories to match his commitment to Nato's target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence.

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio says  he wants to see an outlined vision of where Hillary Clinton plans to go  before giving up an endorsement for her presidential campaign. As campaign manager for Clinton's successful 2000 Senate run, de Blasio said on Sunday it is important for her to define her campaign message, and that he wants to see her vision for addressing income inequality. 'Not until I see — and again, I would say this about any candidate — until I see an actual vision of where they want to go,' de Blasio told NBC's Meet the Press about an possible endorsement for Clinton. 'I think she's a tremendous public servant. I think she is one of the most qualified people to ever run for this office. And by the way, thoroughly vetted, we can say that. But we need to see the substance.' Scroll down for video . New York Mayor Bill de Blasio says he wants to see an outlined vision of where Hillary Clinton plans to go with  before giving up an endorsement. He also said he wants to see her vision for addressing income inequality . As campaign manager for Clinton's successful 2000 Senate run, de Blasio said on Sunday it is important for Clinton to define her campaign message (Clinton and de Blasio pictured together at the Wildlife Conservation Society Gala in June 2014) While he said Clinton has a very progressive history, which is seen through her work with children and families, he noted that the income inequality in the U.S. is 'out of control' and that it has to be addressed by candidates. '[A plan] has to include progressive taxation. It has to include increases in wages and benefits. It has to include the willingness to tax the wealthy so we can invest infrastructure, so we can invest in education again,' de Blasio told NBC. 'That's what I think progressives and everyday Americans will be looking for from Hillary and all other candidate.' De Blasio said that  Clinton's work that proved to be successful during her 2000 Senate run would be repeated in 2016 - highlighting her previous efforts to effectively listen to what was happening to everyday people . He said that going into this year as a candidate, Clinton has a 'tremendous opportunity' to present a progressive vision as a result of how different circumstances are compared to when she ran in 2008 - with the economic crisis that impacted so many Americans. De Blasio also noted that a lot of the work that proved to be successful from her 2000 Senate bid would be repeated this year, citing her efforts to listen to what was happening to everyday people. 'I think that's going to be more necessary this year than ever before, because people in this country are hurting,' said de Blasio. 'The Great Recession set people back on their heels in a way we have not seen in decades and decades. 'I think it's important for Hillary to hear those stories of the American people. I think it will make her a stronger candidate.'","De Blasio, Clinton's campaign manager during her 2000 Senate run, said on Sunday he will not give up endorsement until he sees a vision from her .

"As attempts to break a world record go, it was pretty impressive. A Chinese team took a kite measuring an astonishing 6,000 metres (3.7 miles) to a kite flying festival - aiming to break the world record by a massive 1,000 metres. But they had overlooked the fact that their kite was so big, it posed a danger to passing aircraft. The kite, dubbed 'centipede with a dragon's head', was set to fly at the Wulong International Kite Festival last Saturday in Chongqing in south-western China, according to People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video . Flying high: Half of the 6,000-metre-long dragon-themed kite took to the sky in Chongqing last Saturday . Skilful: The kite weighs 200 kilograms and requires three experienced kite flyers to manoeuvre . However, Chinese aviation authorities ruled that the dragon-themed kite - which is made from 2,000 separate pieces and weighs a whopping 200 kilograms - could not be flown, and the team were forced to fly only half of it. The weather at the kite flying festival in Chongqing undoubtedly played a part, with a heavy mist reducing visibility not only for pilots but for spectators who had turned up to witness the annual event. Each of the 2,000 pieces bears the Chinese characters 'China Dream' and it takes eight hours to get the full-length kite airborne. Wang Dongming, one of the three kite flyers, said special sturdier rope made from kevlar - which is also used to make bulletproof vests - had to be used to thread the  kite. Mr Wang said: 'Big kites and kites that are used for trick flying are usually built from this kevlar rope to prevent the line from snapping in the wind.' In order to secure the pieces on the kite, craftsmen only used bamboo that was more than three years old which can resist severe wind. Colourful: Kites of all shapes and shades take to the sky in Chongqing during the four-day-long festival . Although the kite did not fly full-length, organisers of the festival still claimed that they had broken the Guinness World Record for the longest kite in the world. The previous record is reported to set by a 5,000m-long kite made by craftsmen in Weifang in eastern China last spring. Professional kite flying teams from over 13 countries participated in the four-day-long Wulong International Kite Festival, including representatives from China, New Zealand, the UK and Italy.

"An Indian-style bungalow that was built in Sussex in the Victorian era and preserved to maintain its 1880s facade has gone on the market for £1million. Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park near East Grinstead has been lovingly upheld to how its first owners intended it in the 19th Century. With wood paneling on indoor ceilings and a large veranda at its front, the unique property is one of the first ever bungalows built in the country. It has gone on the market for £985,000, with historians eager to put it forward for listing to further protect its heritage. Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park in East Grinstead has gone on sale for almost £1million. The property is one of the last surviving bungalows in Britain that were built on the design of Victorian houses in India . An early photograph of the house shows how it has been lovingly preserved by its owners since its construction in the late 19th Century . Inside, original oak panelling adorns the ceilings and walls. The double height living room is one of the house's main features with a quirky gallery serving as a make-shift office . A sketch of the property's main sitting room shows how its Victorian design has been maintained to how architects originally intended it . Built in the 1880s by RA Briggs, known as Bungalow Briggs, the property is not all split over one level as modern bungalows are today. At the time the term was used to describe small, country homes used by the wealthy upper classes as a retreat to escape the heat of pulsing Indian cities. The design soon infiltrated British architecture. Briggs, a renowned architect, published his interpretation of the style in the 1891 book Bungalows and Country Residences. A hallmark of the traditional Indian-Victorian bungalow was a large veranda at the front of a property like the one found at Pleasaunce Cottage. Set over 2,542sq ft, the house has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and a cellar. The main sitting room is double height with a gallery and the original inglenook fireplace. Its current owner has lived in the property for more than 30 years, having bought the house in 1983. Unlike bungalows as they are referred to today, the property is set over three levels. The original term was not exclusive to one-storey properties, instead referring to mountain retreats favoured by the Upper Classes . An architect's drawing of the property in the 20th Century. Historians are eager to put the house forward for listing to further protect its heritage . One of the house's most distinct features is its large veranda at the front. These were a common feature among Victorian properties in India . The house's current owner said she fell in love with its unique design and layout when she bought it in 1983 and has tried to preserve its character . Other unique features which make the property so notable are two stained glass windows that have Victorian messages inscribed on them . One of the four bedrooms in the house that is set over more than 2,000sq ft. Original oak and wood flooring has been maintained . The property has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and two bathrooms, one of which is en-suite. It is being sold for £985,000 . 'It’s a great place, I fell in love with it 32 years ago and I still love it after all these years,' said Marian Parker, 60. 'The big drawing room is double height and has this little gallery which I use as a study. The room opens on to the veranda and is a lovely room with lots of light in summer but it also has an open fireplace and is really cosy in winter. 'It looks very different from the front to the back. From the front it looks like a normal bungalow but when you go round to the back it looks like a three-storey house because you can see the cellar.' With two stained glass windows and an original oak panelling in the hall and lounge, historians are eager to put the property forward to be listed. Dr Kathryn Ferry, an architectural historian and author of the book Bungalows, said: 'This is one of the earliest surviving bungalows in Britain and certainly one of the most important. 'What makes this one so significant is it was part of a bungalow settlement as if built in India on a hill station where the colonial British went to escape from the heat of the cities, sitting on their verandas in the cool breeze. 'There are a couple of bungalows in the development left but this one is the most original. 'Bungalows weren’t about single storey living, they were more of a leisure house and this exemplifies that. Bungalows aren’t just boring suburban homes. 'It is not listed but it ought to be. We can’t put it forward for listing yet in case it puts off buyers. But hopefully whoever does buy it will appreciate its importance enough to support a bid to list it.' The house is being sold  by Hamptons International for £985,000 and has not yet attracted any offers. A view of the property from one of its gardens. It is set over almost one acre of land in the Sussex countryside in East Grinstead .

"Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure. The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007 I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn’t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn’t that much more, but when you’re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from 2011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012, 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children — she has an 8-year-old step-daughter and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'","The actress, 29, says she had to pay out of pocket for her 2007 abortion because she couldn't tell her mother .

"Izaak Gillen (above), seven months, was taken to hospital on April 6 with a skull fracture while at his babysitter's Oregon City home. He was pronounced dead the next day . A seven-month-old boy's death has been ruled a homicide after he suffered a skull fracture while in the care of his babysitter and later died. Izaak Gillen of Oregon City was taken to Randall Children's Hospital on April 6 with the injury and was pronounced dead the next day, said Oregon City Police Sgt. Matthew Paschall. Detectives began investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident and concluded he was at the babysitter's house when he sustained a skull fracture, according to OregonLive. Justin and Stacy Gillen, the boy's parents, said on Wednesday in a statement that they are deeply saddened by the loss of their son and that they plan to donate some of his organs. 'Izaak was an inquisitive and curious little boy, who explored the world with a twinkle in his eyes and a smile on his face,' the couple said. 'He was our happy beautiful little baby. Although this is a tragic event, we take some comfort knowing Izaak was able to save the lives of other children by donating 3 of his organs. 'In his seven months, Izaak touched many lives.' No arrests have been made in the incident and investigators are still looking into what led up to Izaak's injury, according to the Portland Tribune. The incident occurred on April 6 when authorities were called to the babysitter's home on 9th Street around 1pm. Izaak was then taken to the hospital where it was discovered he had a skull fracture, said Paschall. The state medical examiner's office determined the child's manner of death was a homicide after conducting an autopsy. Paschall told Koin 6 News that the parents are coping as best as they can following the incident, and that they have been 'great in helping with the investigation and doing everything they can to make sure we get all of the facts straight'. He also said he is confident no other children are in danger following the incident saying investigators and detectives have taken steps to ensure everyone is safe. 'Ultimately the goal is to arrest who is responsible for this and hold them accountable,' said Paschall.

"Comments sections and social networks across the web are littered with antisocial users who repeatedly abuse and provoke people to get a reaction. These so-called 'trolls' have even been known to cause mental distress to their victims. But now a team of researchers has studied millions of such online posts to identify common traits among these users. And it has built an algorithm that can recognise a potential troll with an accuracy of 80 per cent by scanning their comments. Experts studied 40 million posts by 1.7 millions users on news site CNN.com, political news site Breitbart.com and gaming site IGN.com.  The researchers then divided users into those most likely to be banned, called Future-Banned Users (FBUs), and other users dubbed Never-Banned Users (NBUs) The research was carried out by PhD students from Stanford and Cornell University, led by Justin Chang, in a paper called Antisocial Behavior in Online Discussion Communities. The team examined three large online forums including general news site CNN.com, Breitbart.com, a political news site, and computer gaming site IGN.com. Within these communities members that repeatedly violate community guidelines can be banned, either temporarily or permanently. Over an 18-month period, the team studied the content and deletion rates of 40 million posts and 100 million votes posted by 1.7 million users across these sites. From this data they were able to divide users into two groups. Posts made by antisocial web users, or trolls, are less readable in terms of language and coherency. Trolls are more likely to veer off-topic and have fewer similarities in terms of language and content compared to posts by other users. Trolls are also less likely to use positive words than other users, they swear more, and use less tentative or conciliatory language such as 'could', 'perhaps', or 'consider'. In terms of activity, the study found that trolls make more comments each day, and post more times on each thread. They purposefully try to create discussions, or actively respond to an on-going discussion. Trolls were also more likely to have had posts deleted than other users and over the 18 month study period, the number of deleted posts by FBUs increased. People who, over the course of the study, were subsequently banned from the sites, or were likely to be, were classified as Future-Banned Users (FBUs). Users who weren't banned during the study, and didn't exhibit signs that suggested they would be in the future, were known as Never-Banned Users (NBUs). Once these users were split up the researchers looked at four features to identify common traits among the FBUs and NBUs. The first was called 'Post features' and included studying the content of a post. 'Activity features' included how often a user posted in the forum, while 'Community features' looked at votes on individual posts that suggest a person or opinion's popularity. Lastly, 'Moderator features' looked at how many posts had been moderated or deleted. The findings suggest that posts written by FBUs are 'less readable', tend to veer off-topic and have fewer similarities in terms of language and content compared to posts by NBUs. The researchers compared the average text similarity of a user's post with the previous three posts in the same thread. 'We find that the average text similarity of posts written by FBUs is significantly lower than that of NBUs, suggesting that FBUs make less of an effort to integrate or stay on-topic,' said researchers. The team also found that while there was no consistent trend with respect to the use of words containing negative emotion among posts made by FBUs, they are less likely to use positive words. Posts made by antisocial web users, or trolls, are less readable (centre) in terms of language  and coherency and are more likely to veer off-topic and have fewer similarities than posts by other users (left). Trolls are also less likely to use positive words (right) than other users, and they swear more in posts . In terms of activity, the study found that trolls make more comments each day and post more times on each thread. They purposefully try to create discussions, or actively respond to an on-going discussion . FBUs are also more likely to swear and use less tentative or conciliatory language such as 'could', 'perhaps', or 'consider'. In terms of activity, the research also found that FBUs purposefully try to create discussions, or actively respond to an on-going discussion. As a result they spend more time in individual threads than NBUs. Previous research found that post frequency was a signal of low quality discussions. On Breitbart and IGN, trolls were more likely to reply to others' posts, but on CNN, they were more likely to start new discussions. Still, across all communities, FBUs appear to be 'effective at luring other users into potentially fruitless discussions', which is a sign of troll-like behaviour, said the study. Trolls were also more likely to have had posts deleted than other users and over the 18-month study period, the number of deleted posts by FBUs increased. These traits are unlikely to help recognise a troll in their own right, but when combined, the researchers found they could be used to identify a troll with 80% accuracy . FBUs contribute significantly more posts per thread they participate in, according to the results. Trolls were also more likely to have had more posts deleted than NBUs, and over 18 months, the number of deleted posts by FBUs increased. These individual identifiers and traits are unlikely to help recognise a troll or antisocial behaviours in their own right. However, when combined the researchers found they could identify a troll with an accuracy of 80 per cent. 'Understanding how antisocial users may steer individual discussions can help us better quantify their influence on other users,' concluded the researchers. 'Our initial explorations suggest that FBUs cause discussions to veer off-topic: replies to FBUs were significantly less similar to preceding posts in a thread than replies to NBUs. 'One could also investigate the effects of having multiple antisocial users participate in a discussion.' But they recognised the algorithm's accuracy rate meant that one in five antisocial users are undetected and further works needs to be done to boost this rate and work out effective ways of dealing with the trolls. The findings are published in arXiv.","Researchers studied 40 million posts made by 1.7 million web users .

"A 17-year-old girl arrested after her severely malnourished four-month-old daughter was hospitalized and the corpse of a three-year-old child was found at a North Las Vegas home will not face criminal charges. The unidentified teenager is a victim and was released on Monday from juvenile detention into the custody of county child protective services, said Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson. 'This child is a victim in this case and can best receive appropriate and necessary services through the dependency court system and family services,' Wolfson said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Jondrew Megil Lachaux (left), 39, an ex-convict and Kellie Cherie Phillips (right), 38, have been arrested on felony charges in the alleged abandonment case of three children in a North Las Vegas home . North Las Vegas police Officer Aaron Patty said the four-month-old child was released from a hospital and turned over on Monday to the custody of Clark County Child Protective Services. Police in North Las Vegas are continuing to probe what they have described as a three-generation case of child abuse involving the girl's mother, Kellie Cherie Phillips, 38, a man she described as her stepfather, Jondrew Magil Lachaux, 39, and the discovery of the couple's three-year-old daughter dead in the back seat of a broken-down car in the garage of a home on Wood Thrush Place. Phillips and Lachaux have six children together while the teenager is from another relationship. Lachaux, an ex-convict, was arrested April 7 and Phillips was arrested April 8 on allegations that they abandoned the teenager and the toddler in a North Las Vegas house and took their other five children to Oakland, California. The other children — ages one, four, seven, eight and nine — were found with Phillips in good health. They have been placed in the custody of family services. Lachaux allegedly sexually assaulted the teenager and she had become pregnant, but she did not know, reports the Review Journal. Phillips and Lachaux, who are not married, were being held pending court appearances this week on felony charges of child abuse. The teen told police that her mother didn't know she was pregnant with Lachaux's child when the rest of the family left last year in a crowded rental car. She said she gave birth at home last November with no medical care. The girl told police her sickly three-year-old sister died several weeks ago, and that Lachaux returned to the house in late March and moved the decomposing corpse to an old Mercedes sedan parked in the garage, covering the corpse with old pizza boxes. A police SWAT team broke into the couple's house (above) and discovered the corpse of the three-year-old girl . Lachaux kicked the teen out of the house, police said, and she lived for several days in public places including the Las Vegas Strip and McCarran International Airport before someone noticed the sick baby and summoned authorities. The infant is recovering after being hospitalized in critical condition for severe malnutrition and hypothermia, police said. The girl told investigators the child survived on watered-down baby formula. Records show that Lachaux served prison time in Nevada from June 2006 to August 2008 on a coercion conviction and that he and Phillips were involved in a legal dispute in Reno's family court until 2010.","Unidentified teen was released on Monday from juvenile detention into custody of child protective services, district attorney said .

"FBI director James Comey has caused huge offense to a key U.S. ally by using language that suggested that Poland was an accomplice in the Holocaust. Poles are waiting to see if Comey would issue an apology — something that hadn't happened by late Monday. Polish Foreign Minister Grzegorz Schetyna said he expected him to say sorry so the matter can be settled. Comey said last week, 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil. 'They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do. That's what people do. And that should truly frighten us.' FBI director James Comey, pictured at a news conference last month,  has caused huge offense to a U.S. ally by using language to suggest that Poles were accomplices in the Holocaust . Comey's comments are particularly offensive to Poles not only because they had no role in running Auschwitz and other death camps where Jews were murdered during World War II, but because they were themselves victims of the Third Reich. In all, 6 million Polish citizens were killed during the war, about half of them Jewish and the other half Christians, with many Polish priests, members of the intelligentsia and political resistance killed in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Poland also had a committed anti-Nazi resistance movement and Polish fighters fought alongside the Allies throughout the war. Poles see themselves as heroes of the war who have never been properly recognized, making comments like Comey's hurt even more. Comey originally delivered the remarks on Wednesday at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in arguing for the importance of Holocaust education. The speech was adapted for an article published in The Washington Post on Thursday. U.S. Ambassador Stephen Mull attends ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in front of the monument to the Heroes of the Ghetto, in Warsaw, Poland, on Sunday, April 19, 2015 . The Polish reaction was swift. On Sunday, the U.S. ambassador to Poland, Stephen Mull, was called to the Foreign Ministry in a formal act of protest on the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Mull, a well-liked figure in Poland, went into damage-control mode. 'Saying that Poland and any other country other than Nazi Germany were responsible for the Holocaust is a mistake, is harmful and is offensive,' Mull said. 'Director Comey certainly did not mean to suggest that Poland was in any way responsible for those crimes.' In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf later echoed that sentiment, saying that 'Poles certainly bore a huge brunt of the barbarism of Nazi Germany.' 'Director Comey certainly did not intend to suggest otherwise, did not intend to suggest that Poland was in some way responsible for the Holocaust,' she said. The FBI had no immediate comment on the matter. Polish leaders all had something to say about the controversy. 'To those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of World War II,' Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz said on Sunday. 'I would expect full historical knowledge from officials who speak on the matter.' Not all Poles behaved heroically during the war. Anti-Semitism was deep in the 1930s and some Poles pointed Jews out to the Nazis, who often could not tell Jew from non-Jew. There were also some cases of Poles murdering Jews during the war. But collaborating was never the official state position, as it was with Vichy France, for instance. In fact, during the war, the Polish underground army had a program to save Jews, called Zegota. And Poles caught denouncing Jews to the Nazis were even killed by the Polish resistance. President Barack Obama caused a similar controversy in 2012 when he used the wording 'Polish death camp.' Poles feel that that wording implies Polish complicity, and Obama later expressed 'regret' for the gaffe. 'In referring to 'a Polish death camp' rather than 'a Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland,' I inadvertently used a phrase that has caused many Poles anguish over the years and that Poland has rightly campaigned to eliminate from public discourse around the world,' Obama wrote at the time. 'I regret the error and agree that this moment is an opportunity to ensure that this and future generations know the truth.' The entrance to the Auschwitz death camp in Oswiecim, Poland. There was a Polish program to save Jews, called Zegota, and Poles caught denouncing Jews to the Nazis were even killed by the Polish resistance .","FBI director James Comey suggested in remarks last week that Poles were accomplices during the holocaust .
Comey's comments are offensive to Poles as they had no role in running death camps and were themselves victims of the Third Reich .

"Egypt’s oldest pyramid was built almost 5,000 years ago but a similar structure  hidden beneath rubble could be up to four times older. If true, the claim could rewrite prehistory and shed light on an obscure yet powerful and advanced ancient civilisation. Geologist Dr Danny Hilman believes that a site in West Java is revered because it hides an ancient temple built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago. Scroll down for video . A geologist claims that the world's oldest pyramid is hidden under rubble (pictured) in West Java, which if true, could re-write pre-history in the region and shed light on a powerful and advanced ancient civilisation . The Megalithic site of Gunung Padang was discovered in 1914 and is the largest site of its kind in Indonesia. It is nestled among volcanoes, banana palms and tea plantations, at 2,903 ft (885 metres) above sea level some 75 miles (120km) south of Jakarta. Chunks of volcanic rubble jut out up from the stepped hillside, which is considered sacred by the Sundanese people who live locally. Geologist Dr Danny Hilman believes the  site is culturally important is because it is an ancient pyramid which was built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago. He suggests that it may have been built for worship or astronomy. The megalithic site of Gunung Padang (pictured) was discovered in 1914 and is the largest site of its kind in Indonesia. It's nestled among volcanoes banana and tea plantations, at 2,903 ft (885 metres) above sea level . Chunks of volcanic rubble stick up from the stepped hillside (pictured), which is considered sacred by the Sundanese people who live locally. Geologist Dr Danny Hilman thinks the reason the site is so revered is that it is an ancient pyramid which was built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago . If the structure in West Java is revealed to be a 20,000-year-old pyramid, it will be the oldest on Earth. In 1996, archaeologists discovered pyramids on the Atlantic coast of southern Brazil that sate to around 3,000 BC, making them a few hundred years older than Egypt's oldest pyramid. But both civilisations built them for religious reasons. The Brazilian pyramids are made from shells and were probably built in phases over decades or even centuries, The Independent reported. For years, experts thought the pyramids were simply piles of domestic rubbish. Egypt’s oldest known pyramid is the step pyramid of Djoser, which was built in around 2,700 BC. It was built by a master builder called Imhotep for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser and is composed of six steps. the ancient structure was rocked by a pyramid in 1992, leaving it unstable with a large hole in its domed roof, but restoration is underway. If this is true, prehistoric people would have had to manoeuvre chunks of volcanic rock onto terraces built on the mountainside and stack them on top of each other to create a pyramid – a considerable feat of ancient engineering. Dr Hilman, a senior geologist at Indonesia’s Centre for Geotechnical Research, says that proof of the structure’s organisation lies underground. His excavations have been backed by the Indonesian government, which recently decreed that the upper part of Gunung Padang is 'the largest megalithic structure in south-east Asia,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported. President Yudhoyono dubbed the dig a ‘task of history…of important value to humanity.' and it has yielded some ancient artefacts. Dr Hilman said: ‘People think the prehistoric age was primitive, but this monument proves that wrong.’ He believes such a pyramid would be proof of an advanced ancient civilisation in Java and said that the majority of the stepped site is man-made, perhaps built by generations over a matter of centuries. The geologist is now working to establish the authenticity of the site. Some rocks were originally stuck together with a form of ancient glue and have been carbon dated to be around 7,000 BC. Dr Hilman said that the ruins hide walls and rooms with steps and terraces below, which are evidence of a complex building. Dr Hilman said: ‘People think the prehistoric age was primitive, but this monument proves that wrong.’ Some rocks were originally stuck together with a form of ancient glue and have been carbon dated to be around 7,000 BC.

The structure is covered with massive rectangular stones of volcanic origin. It has been subjected to multiple geoelectric surveys, where ground penetrating radar and samples have been used. From this, he believes the terraced hill is 328 ft (100 metres) thick and is made up of a number of layers. He said that so far man-made structures have been detected 49 ft (15 metres) underground. Experts dated rock between nine and 13 ft (three and four metres) below the surface as 6,500 years old and 12,500 years old below the surface. However, Dr Hilman’s controversial findings are disputed and 34 Indonesian archaeologists and geologists have submitted a petition criticising the projects’ methods and motives. They say that the excavation threatens the preservation of the site as it is and are annoyed at the prospect of involving civilian archaeologists in the excavation. Volcanologist Sutikno Bronto believes that the structure isn’t a pyramid at all, but the neck of an old volcano and that the stones surveyed have been weathered by nature instead of being cut by humans. Another anonymous expert is sceptical that such an ancient civilisation could have been advanced enough to build a pyramid so many thousands of years ago, when  tools recovered from a nearby cave, dating to 7,000 BC were very primitive. The terraces are bordered by retaining walls of stone (pictured) that can be accessed by 400 steps rising around 311 ft (95 metres).

"Assault: Dr Sahar Hussain attacked two Tube workers because she didn't want to miss the last train home . A GP attacked two Tube workers while screaming 'I'm a doctor' because she did not want to miss the last train home on a Friday night. Dr Sahar Hussain, 53, panicked when she was unable to get through the gates at Leicester Square station, and started ranting at staff. She denied assaulting the two workers, saying she was worried about being stranded on her own in central London because she is a Muslim woman. But Hussain has now been found guilty and ordered to pay a total of £2,250 in fines, compensation and court costs - and she could face disciplinary action from the General Medical Council. In video footage captured on her own mobile phone, Hussain could be heard to shout: 'I'm a doctor actually, I work for the NHS. I'm a doctor. Get me through the gate, I'm going to miss my train.' City of London Magistrates' Court heard Hussain arrived at the station around 11.30pm on June 20 last year, trying to get home to Woodford Green after socialising with friends in the West End. When she was refused entry by the automatic gates, she demanded that ticket seller Malcolm Shaw let her through before lashing out at his colleague Indira Ramsaroop, who was trying to help. Hussain, originally from Iraq, screamed and shouted at Mrs Ramsaroop as she thrust a camera phone into her face before grabbing her by the arm. The 24-year-old Transport for London worker was then chased by the doctor as she tried to flee to the control room, bumping her head on the way. In the video on Hussain's phone she was heard shouting: 'This woman is on something, she's not sober is she? You're in work and you're not sober. Get me through the gate.' During the scuffle Hussain, a mother of one who helps train GPs at two universities, also grabbed Mr Shaw by the arms, leaving him with scratches. Mrs Ramsaroop was close to tears in court as she told how she had to take almost two weeks off work following the incident, adding: 'I had a lot of sleepless nights. It had an impact on myself with customers when I came back to work. 'I have felt very let down to have been threatened and been running away in my place of work. It actually affected me for a very long time and I got quite ill just at the worrying and fear.' Row: The assault took place on a Friday night at Leicester Square station in central London . Hussain admitted losing her temper, telling the court: 'I'm very sorry about the way I expressed myself with my agitation and frustration.' District Judge Quentin Purdy found her guilty of two counts of assault by beating, saying: 'The evidence is overwhelming. You completely lost your self-control. 'Unusually for the sort of incident this court regularly deals with, there is no hint of intoxication in any way. 'But the explanation is there. You were anxious about missing the last train, concerned about being late for work or unable to work the next day, cultural embarrassment by being left in London as a married Muslim woman. 'It was completely out of character, but as we have all seen, you acted in an unpleasant and hysterical fashion towards numerous members of staff.' He said she had subjected Mrs Ramsaroop to 'completely unjustified violence', as well as 'humiliation' for falsely suggesting she was intoxicated at work. The judge added: 'You have lost a great deal by your lack of self-control. Your good name is now lost with these two convictions for assault.' Hussain was fined £500 for each assault and ordered her to pay £500 compensation to Mrs Ramsaroop, £200 to Mr Shaw, £500 prosecution costs and a £50 victim surcharge.","Dr Sahar Hussain was unable to get through the gates at Leicester Square .

"A  reporter once described it one of the 'dirtiest, wildest, toughest neighborhoods anywhere', though the grime around New York City's Times Square has since been replaced with the shine of electric advertisements and thousands of tourists. But photos of the area's 'notorious' dive bar,Terminal, have been preserved by the bartender and photographer who served drinks to pimps, prostitutes and destitute New Yorkers floating around the Port Authority bus terminal. Sheldon Nadelman, 80, who worked at the bar from 1973 to 1982, would meet and photograph the women as they came in at eight in the morning for three shots of cognac before going out to walk the streets. Photos taken from behind the bar at Terminal Bar, a 41st Street and 8th Avenue watering hole open until 1982, show a side of Times Square that has disappeared in the glare of Coca Cola advertisements . Sheldon Nadelman, a young bartender who is now 80, would watch as prostitutes hid behind newsstands and trash cans to avoid being seen. Reflections in the bar windows show pictures of boxers hung on the walls . Terminal Bar, which was located on the block now occupied by the New York Times headquarters, saw an combination of people floating around the Port Authority bus terminal . Nadelman, whose thousands of photos have been digitized by his son Stefan, watched as pimps and prostitutes gathered outside of his bar . 'It was a zoo. You had every hustler, every pimp, every wino. They were all at Terminal Bar,' Nadelman told the Daily Mail Online by phone. His amateur work, which includes thousands of portraits from the period, often focused on the street trash can he could see from the bar, where a cross section of Times Square's hustlers and homeless stopped for a rest. Nadelman, who lived in Greenwich Village before leaving the city to raise his children, snapped genuine  shots as sex workers hid behind newsstands to avoid police at the terminal across the street and watched as the lives of many who entered his bar slowly fall apart. 'The street eats them alive,' Nadelman said of his bar's clients, which included a combination of gay men, cross-dressers, actors and alcoholics all mixing together in a small patch of Midtown Manhattan not yet known for commercial glitz. The photographer said that women would come in to the bar early in the morning to get shots of cognac before going out to work the streets . The area around Times Square used to be known for violence and prostitution. Though there are still sex shops on 8th Avenue, grime in the area has been replaced with chain restaurants and tourist attractions . Nadelman's voyeuristic shots were often captured through the open door of his bar, allowing him to see a candid cross section of 1970s New York not available in project that took place over a shorter time period . Hundreds of photographs from the 1970s and early 1980s capture the mood and fashion of a New York in Midtown Manhattan that no longer exists . He would hang portraits of his customers on the wall, and made a little pocket money selling them or $5 a pop. Three decades later, the photographer now lives in southern New Jersey, and visitors to Times Square are more likely to be asked if they want to see a Broadway show than propositioned by a prostitute. However, his son Stefan decided to digitize his father's shots, keeping alive the stories of bar regulars and passersby that would be lost to history as selfie sticks became more common in the neighborhood. The trash can outside of Terminal on 41st Street and 8th Avenue played a supporting role in the stories of many passersby, who used it as a place to rest . Nadelman, who would meet many of the pimps, prostitutes and others who gathered around Terminal Bar, watched as many of their lives took turns for the worse . The bar's clients included a combination of gay men, cross-dressers, actors and alcoholics who mingled together in a neighborhood described as the 'dirtiest, wildest, toughest anywhere' A prostitute nicknamed Red (right) was one of the luckier stories captured by Nadelman. She received enough money to stop working on the street after her 'john' (left) died . While the fate of many of its customers is uncertain, Terminal Bar itself closed in 1982 after Nadelman's father-in-law and bar owner Murray Goldman decided that $125,000 a year rent was too expensive. Nadelman then completely took himself out of New York  'It was like circumcision, gone', he said of his move to suburbia, and now views his time at the bar as a 'different world', though is reminded of the 70s by the occasional sex shop still on 8th Avenue. The building where Terminal once stood is now occupied by the New York Times, which paid $24million for its first year at the 41st and 8th Avenue juncture in 2010, according to Bloomberg. Art gallery owners have talked of bringing Nadelman into the new, expensive New York for a show, though he is uninterested in recognition and says going back to his old stomping grounds is a 'schlep'. The photographer keeps his photos, as well as his paintings, up on the walls of his house  for his personal recollections. 'Yesterday, it's always on my mind,' he said.

The area formerly occupied by the dive bar is now taken up by the New York Times, which pays millions of dollars to lease floors on a block that includes upscale grocery store Dean & Deluca . Times Square is now often mobbed with tourists from all over the world and features advertisements on bright electronic screens rather than signs for dingy bars .

Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Facebook-owned virtual reality (VR) experts Oculus said at the firm's annual F8 conference in San Francisco said The Matrix provides the best sense of what virtual reality could someday be like. He said our brain never sees the real world, but instead infers it based on the 'sparse' data it receives and used a series of optical illusions to make this point. For example, he explained that humans only have three colour sensors, we can’t see infrared or ultraviolet and we have a blind spot in each eye. ‘Our visual data is actually astonishingly sparse and even if we were able to accurately record and process every photon that reaches our eyes, we’d still have too little data to be able to reconstruct the world accurately,' he said. He used the recent black and blue/white and gold dress as an example. ‘Our visual system takes its best guess and sends that to the conscious mind,’ he continued. 'The way that the brain compensates for the limited data it receives is by maintaining a model of the real world that it constantly updates as new data comes in.

The pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them . 'And it is that model, not the real world, that you experience and trust implicitly. We are inference machines, not objective observers. He then showed a red and blue pill on hands that were shown on a yellow background to give an example of how this inference model breaks down. The colours of the pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them. And even when a person knows that the pills are grey, they still see them as red or blue. ‘Your visual system isn’t interested in whether the photons coming from a tile on a random image are red or blue or grey,' Mr Abrash continued. 'Knowing that didn’t keep anyone from being eaten by lions on the Savannah. What it is interested in is identifying potentially relevant features, in the real world, under a variety of conditions. 'Your visual system constantly corrects for the colours in the scene. It is reverse engineering reality rather than just recording it.

"Getting a selfie with a celebrity appears to be the latest craze, but two scuba girls from California prefer to take their photos with some more colourful creatures. Divers Margo Sanchez and Stephanie Adamson have been snapping exotic underwater life for nearly a decade. The recent addition of a selfie stick has helped them get incredible shots next to some of the most dangerous sea creatures in the ocean, such as sharks and sting rays. Scroll down for video . Under the sea! These snap happy scuba girls have taken the selfie stick to new depths by taking a series of extraordinary underwater photos with exotic sea life . Fish are friends, not food! Having the extendable pole  allows the animal a comfortable distance from the photographer while being photographed . Dude! Despite having travelled as far afield as Papua New Guinea, the Maldives and Virgin Islands to take these incredible photos, the selfie stick is only a recent edition to their trips, enabling them to take incredible turtle selfies . The intrepid divers from San Diego, California, have made it their life mission to travel the world to take snaps with everything from turtles, puffer fish to sting rays and baby squid . While selfie sticks may be recent fad,  divers Margo Sanchez and Stephanie Adamson have been snapping photos of marine animals for the best part of a decade . The pair who co-own the diving school, Scuba Girls, loved taking photographs of the beautiful animals underwater, but found they could not easily be in the picture too. Since investing in the fad item, they have been able to mount a GoPro camera to the end of the pole and obtain incredible lasting memories of their dives, whilst keeping a distance away from the creatures. Margo said: 'Since Stephanie and I were always taking photos and videos of each other, the challenge was often finding a way to get the photographer in the photos too. 'Several years ago we started using GoPro cameras. 'With these small cameras we started to find ways to get into the photo even when they were taking the shot - hence the selfie. 'Because we had to stretch out our arm to take the selfie, it was still a challenge getting the surrounding sea life and the photographer in the shot. 'Then one day a company made the selfie stick - and everything changed.' Pipefish selfie! Before the selfie stick, the co-owners of California-based diving school Scuba Girls, seldom took pictures of themselves underwater with the animals as the equipment wasn't available . With the ability to use a GoPro camera from an extended vantage point, the diving instructors now take every opportunity they can to take selfies with underwater animals, including eels (pictured) Now that's a selfie! A photograph with a stingray is added to their list in this extraordinary shot . The snap happy girls from San Diego have an impressive dive history, having travelled to Papua New Guinea, the Maldives and Virgin Islands. They mainly have harmless encounters with marine life, but have to be on their guard when around more dangerous creatures like lionfish, sting rays, sharks and eels. Stephanie said: 'We have to be very careful and respectful with different sea life. 'There are some creatures that sting or bite, and some sea life is delicate and can be injured if not treated with caution. 'Having the extendable pole most often allows the animal a comfortable distance from the photographer while being photographed. 'But yes, it can be an adrenaline rush, no doubt about that.'

"Air crash investigators have recovered more body parts from the site where MH17 fell in eastern Ukraine after the Boeing 777 was shot out of the sky nine months ago. The Dutch-led team this week also found personal possessions including jewellery after the plane was downed by a suspected Russian-made BUK missile, killing all 298 passengers and crew on July 17, 2014. In all, 16 containers of fragments of the Malaysia Airlines plane were filled so far this week. Dutch and Malaysian investigators and local authorities examine debris at the MH17 plane crash site . Chilling: MailOnline's photographer spotted the burned and torn passport of loving wife and mother Mabel Anthonysamy Soosai, 45, one of the 298 slaughtered when MH17 was downed over Ukraine on July 17, 2014. Her family in Kuala Lumpur has given MailOnline permission to publish the picture . The investigators searched for body parts and debris at a location that was previously considered unsafe . The finds came several days after MailOnline revealed how possibly key evidence and personal possessions were left lying in fields so long after a crash which shocked the world. MailOnline also found a charred passport of a Malaysian mother killed in the horror. Relatives of Mabel Anthonysamy Soosai, 45, whose husband and son were also killed, called for urgent action to clear the site, return items to bereaved families and bring those responsible for the carnage to justice. 'It broke my heart to see the picture, her passport still in the debris of the plane,' said her brother Clement, 47, in Kuala Lumpur. 'But thank you so much for finding it and telling us about it.' Also spotted at the site by MailOnline were a bracelet made of beads, a pair of sunglasses, ripped clothing and random pages from guidebooks in a reminder that many of the murdered passengers were heading to Kuala Lumpur on holiday. Investigators have renewed their search for body parts and debris in eastern Ukraine this week . A vehicle carries away debris from the site of the plane crash near the village of Grabove, in self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic . Many small parts from the plane - such as controllers for the in-flight entertainment systems - were visible among MH17's burned remains. Investigators say they were prevented from working properly in the locations where MH17 hit the ground due to fierce fighting between pro-Moscow rebels and Ukrainian military forces. The new finds of human remains were collected this week by the Dutch - working with Malaysian, Australian and Ukrainian colleagues - at a site previously inaccessible to the investigators, it was revealed. Head of the Dutch recovery mission Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg said: 'More remains have been found in both parts of the so-called ""burn sites.""' Jean Fransman, spokesman for the Dutch Department of Justice, added: 'The mission was again able to recover human remains and personal effects at two sites.' A statement said that 'personal effects were given to the members of the mission by the local population - it was jewellery'. An investigator wheels away parts of debris from the site of the plane crash in eastern Ukraine . Grim: Alongside Mabel's passport, many small parts from the plane - such as controllers for the in-flight entertainment systems - are visible among MH17's charred detritus . Haunting: Personal belongings of victims are still littered around the field - and possibly crucial evidence -because the crash scene hasn't been cleared nine months after the Malaysian Airways flight came down . A local official had told MailOnline how the 'smell of death' hung over the area nine months after the crash . The latest search operation had resumed yesterday after being halted for winter, and centred around the Petropavlivka, some 10 kilometres (6.25 miles) west of Grabove and Granovo where most of the debris fell. A local official had told MailOnline how the 'smell of death' hung over the area nine months after the crash. Officials of the rebel Donetsk People's Republic were also at the site during the search which will last several weeks subject to a ceasefire holding in the region. 'A group of Dutch and Malaysian experts is working in the DPR,' said Aleksey Kostrubitskiy, local emergencies minister. 'Today 10 per cent of the area - two places where fragments had fallen and there was fire - was worked over. 'Sixteen containers of fragments have been loaded. 'Units of the [DPR] emergencies ministry will go there every day and 10 staffers of the emergencies ministry will be involved.' The Dutch-led team was forced to leave the crash site in August amid shooting close to the crash site. Souvenir: A shot glass bought as a reminder of what should have been a jovial trip lies on the ground . A sign indicating the entrance to the site in eastern Ukraine is forbidden is displayed as Dutch and Malaysian investigators search for debris . The debris collected by the investigators will be initially sent to Kharkiv in Ukraine, before being taken to the The Netherlands . A week long recovery operation in November was delayed by fighting between separatists and Ukrainian troops. Representatives of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have also faced acute problems accessing the crash site to secure key evidence. After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site. The debris collected by the investigators will be initially sent to Kharkiv in Ukraine, before being taken to the The Netherlands. Forensic experts in the Dutch city of Hilversum have identified bodies of 296 victims of the crash. Two victims - both from the Netherlands - remain unidentified. The probe team is due to issue its report into the crash later this year. After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site . A preliminary report in September, which apportioned no blame, said the plane 'broke up in the air probably as the result of structural damage caused by a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside'. Kiev and the West have claimed that separatists or Russian forces, using a BUK surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow, were responsible for the shooting down of MH17. The Kremlin strongly refutes the charge, and senior Russian sources have claimed that a Ukrainian warplane blasted MH17 out of the sky. 'Now that we are at an advanced stage of the repatriation mission, the (criminal) investigation and prosecution will occupy a more central place,' said Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur this week. Leaks suggest that investigators suspect regular troops rather than rebels were involved in the shooting of a BUK missile, and that these soldiers 'might have changed their identities or even been executed by Russian secret service in order to hide everything'. Moscow also denies it has ever had troops in eastern Ukraine, a claim the West finds implausible. Investigators examine the crash site of the MH17 plane, next to a sign reading 'no entrance' Putin's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accuses the Western media of ignoring sightings by locals of a Ukrainian military aircraft in the vicinity of the stricken flight. Dutch broadcaster RTL reported that shrapnel collected from the crash site and tested by independent international forensic experts, including defence analysts IHS Jane's in London, say it matched the explosive charge of a ground-to-air BUK. Alleged intercepted phone calls between rebels seem to back up the version that the plane was downed by a BUK crew using equipment smuggled in and out from Russia. If this could be proven, it would blow apart the Russian denial of involvement in eastern Ukraine quite apart from its assistance that it had nothing to do with the downing of MH17. But as one source close to investigators said: 'It looks like key evidence and witnesses, namely the BUK missile and its crew, have been hidden deep inside Russia which is in denial over this whole episode. 'Probably the inquiry report will blame the attack on a BUK missile, but seeing anyone face justice over this crash is quite another matter.' The dead from MH17 comprised 192 Dutch citizens (one also had U.S. citizenship), 44 Malaysians, including the 15 crew members, 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, ten Britons (one also had South African citizenship), four Germans, four Belgians, three Filipinos, one Canadian and one New Zealander.","Investigators have found more body parts from where MH17 fell in Ukraine .

"A bride-to-be was left fighting for her life when her lung collapsed after she had been taking the contraceptive pill. Emma Dickson, of Edinburgh, thought she would be planning her wedding to her fiance Dougie, 26, but ended up talking to him about her funeral when she was rushed to hospital and told she had developed blood clots which had moved to her lungs. The 31-year-old had two blood clots in her lungs, which led to a condition which caused her left lung to collapse - just a month before she was due to get married. Doctors told her she had developed the clot as a result of taking the contraceptive pill. Mrs Dickson developed blood clots, which can be caused by the synthetic hormones in the contraceptive pill, that then moved to her lungs and caused a pulmonary embolism. It left her with bruises on her arms (right) Emma Dickson was meant to be planning her wedding but ended up thinking about her funeral after she was taken to hospital with a collapsed lung, which developed from complications caused by the contraceptive pill . Mrs Dickson, a care home nurse, felt certain she was going to die. There was also a risk the clot could have moved to her brain, causing a stroke. She eventually recovered in hospital but will now have to take blood-thinning medication for the rest of her life which have caused her hair to fall out and severe headaches. It is also uncertain whether she will be able to have children. 'I was just really horrified. It surprised me how quickly everything went downhill,' she said. 'You just never think it's going to happen to you. You take the pill to help you, to keep you responsible. 'You never imagine you're going to end up with a collapsed lung and planning your funeral. 'On the leaflet that comes with the pills it says that one in 1,000 women experience problems with clotting. I never considered the risks. I think I was just unlucky. 'I'd been taking a popular brand of the pill for over a decade with no side effects. It was difficult getting my head round the idea my pill might be to blame.' Mrs Dickson was taken to Causeway Hospital, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, after she experienced sharp pains on November 2 last year. After a CT scan, doctors told her she had two blood clots in her left lung - known as pulmonary embolisms -  and that the clots had developed after she had been taking the contraceptive pill. The pill can increase the risk of blood clotting because it contains a synthetic version of oestrogen which can very slightly thicken the blood, leading to clots. Mrs Dickson's blood clots had developed in her pelvis, moved around her body, and had then become wedged in the lungs. These clots then led to a pleural effusion, a condition which causes fluid to accumulate between the lungs and chest wall. The two pulmonary embolisms became lodged in Ms Dickson's lungs, causing a condition known as pleural effusion which leads to fluid accumulating around the lung and can make them collapse . Mrs Dickson was in a wheelchair after she was discharged from hospital and now must take blood thinning drugs for the rest of her life to reduce the risk of further clots developing . As this fluid collected, Mrs Dickson's left lung then collapsed. There was also a risk the clots could have travelled to her brain, causing a stroke. She was given a lot of strong painkillers, antibiotics, oxygen and blood-thinning medication to dissolve the clots. Surgeons eventually managed to re-inflate Mrs Dickson's collapsed lung and nurse her back to recovery. She said: 'The reason that I did not go into hospital at first was that I was embarrassed. I didn't think it was anything serious. 'If the clots had reached my brain, I could have had a stroke and could have died. Mrs Dickson is pictured with her husband Dougie when she was discharged from hospital in Ireland . A month after being discharged from hospital Mrs Dickson was finally able to plan her wedding . The couple are pictured on their wedding day in Edinburgh after Mrs Dickson was released from hospital . 'All my plans of a beautiful wedding suddenly seemed so trivial, and I was actually thinking of what I wanted to happen at my funeral. I text Dougie to say I loved him because I genuinely thought I wasn't going to make it. It was a horrible conversation to have. 'We were not sure whether we would be able to celebrate our wedding or plan a funeral. We did not know what was going to happen.' One month after she was admitted Ms Dickson managed to have her dream wedding. The pill can raise blood pressure. At first taking the combined oral contraceptive pill can cause headaches, nausea and mood swings. Although the risk of stroke in young women is generally low, pregnancy and contraceptive pills are both significant stroke risk factors, according to the Stroke Association. The combined pill is made up of a particular type of oestrogen and progesterone, called progestogen. Oestrogen can make the blood more likely to clot - causing deep vein thrombosis (in the leg), as well as clots in the lungs or brain, causing a stroke. It has been linked to thrombosis and breast cancer. Research has suggested there is a slightly higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer, but this risk level is returned to normal after 10 years. But her recovery has come with consequences, as she has to inject herself with a special blood-thinning medicine just to keep her alive. Ms Dickson had been taking the pill Clairette for three years and is now no longer allowed to use it as she cannot take anything with oestrogen in it, as it is 'too risky'. One in 1,000 women who regularly take the pill are at risk of developing clots. Ms Dickson added: 'The blood-thinning medication I am now on causes severe headaches, nose bleeds, hair loss, nausea and extreme fatigue. 'If I want to have a family, I will have to switch medication and inject myself on a daily basis, because my current medication can cause birth defects.' She has taken no action with the regards to the pills, as the Clairette brand has stated potential risks in the leaflet. She added: 'The risks are in the leaflet. It's just a remote possibility. There is nothing wrong with the pill. I just did not think it would affect me.'","Emma Dickson was taking the contraceptive pill and then was taken to hospital after suffering with sharp pains last November .

"A new hard-hitting campaign is aiming to highlight the misery of homeless women who are unable to access proper sanitary care. The Homeless Period project hopes to shred the taboo around females living on the streets and their monthly cycle, and is encouraging people to donate tampons and towels to their local homeless shelter. A campaign video  tells the story of a woman called Patricia, who slept rough on the streets of Brixton for six months and was forced to use makeshift sanitary products while menstruating. Scroll down for video . The Homeless Period campaign shines a spotlight on the plight of women living on the streets who don't have access to proper sanitary care during their periods . The team behind the campaign, Oliver Frost, Josie Shedden and Sara Bakhaty, wrote hard-hitting messages on cardboard boxes and photographed them on the streets of London . Using marker pens on cardboard boxes, the video writes the words of Patricia as she speaks them; focusing on how depressing she found it to not be able to access hygienic menstruation products. Patricia, who used to sleep on the 137 bus in Brixton Hill, says that when her period came, she would use 'ripped up cloth' as a  sanitary towel. She has since been housed in a flat by South London homeless charity Spires. Among the cardboard placards held up are the words: 'Why does a woman have to rip up a cloth put between her to protect herself from bleeding?' Another is written with the words: 'I used to feel very depressed. It used to get me down.' The project was started by Oliver Frost, Josie Shedden and Sara Bakhaty, who met while working as interns at an advertising agency. The trio told FEMAIL that they began the campaign as a way of drawing attention to the amount of women who live on the streets after realising that society considered homelessness to be a 'male' issue. The campaign has prompted supporters to start their own collection boxes for tampons and sanitary towels: this (pictured above) was one of seven boxes collected in the workplace of Twitter user Sarah Wyatt . While homeless shelters receive funding for condoms, there is currently no government funding to supply charities with aid for sanitary products . They said that they were surprised to find that approximately 26 per cent of people who access homelessness services are women. Oliver Frost adds that periods seem to be a forgotten issue when it comes to living on the streets. 'It's that for many people, it's never even crossed their minds. As we say on the campaign site ""It doesn't bear thinking about… and that's the problem"".' While there is public funding for condoms to be supplied to homeless shelters, there is no financial aid for tampons and sanitary towels. Nearly 81,000 people have signed a petition to lobby the government for better funding to buy sanitary care. Frost says he hopes that the petition will 'promise a more long term solution to the issue, and the amount of funding it would need is relatively small.' The group aims to present the petition to the Secretary of Health or if they reach their 150,000 signature target before a new government is elected, then to lobby Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of the NHS. A campaign video includes the voice of Patricia, who lived for six months on the streets of Brixton. She says she was forced to used ripped up cloth as a makeshift sanitary towel . Frost said donations are key to the campaign's success: 'For us, the hope is that #TheHomelessPeriod will become a platform for people wanting to help with donations. 'We've had people from around the country contact us with their own local initiatives and fundraisers for the campaign. Our side is in promoting those efforts and connecting them with other people who want to help.' Supporters have been dropping boxes of tampons and towels into their local homeless shelters, with one donor, Sarah Wyatt, so inspired that she has set up a crowd-funding page to encourage more people to donate. On her gofundme page, Wyatt says: 'I recently read an article about the lives of homeless women and the difficulties they face when they have their period. 'I had never really thought about it that way before, these women have little or no access to sanitary products. I decided to do something and did a collection in my workplace which got an amazing response.'","Campaign focuses on lack of sanitary care for women living rough .

"A federal appeals court has upheld the conviction and death sentence of a Washington man who confessed to raping and killing his 14-year-old stepdaughter in 1995. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed that the Washington Supreme Court did not act unreasonably when it rejected Clark Elmore’s claim his constitutional rights were violated at trial. Elmore, who was convicted of killing Kristy Ohnstad in Bellingham after he said she threatened to reveal he had molested her as a child, received the federal court's ruling on Wednesday. Clark Elmore’s conviction for killing and raping his 14-year-old stepdaughter in Washington in 1995 was upheld . The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed the Washington Supreme Court's (above) decision was correct . Ohnstad, a middle school student, was the daughter of Elmore’s live-in girlfriend, the Seattle Times reported. After she went missing, Elmore pretended he was grieving and helped organize a search party to find her. Elmore is the second-longest serving inmate on the state's death row after being sent there in 1996 . He eventually admitted killing her in a graphic taped confession. Elmore claimed his rights were violated during the trial because his attorney gave him bad advice and the jury saw him in shackles. The three-member panel's ruling against the 63-year-old convict was unanimous. The panel wrote: 'We hold that the Washington Supreme Court’s resolution of Elmore’s constitutional claims was not unreasonable. 'The district court did not err in denying Clark Elmore’s challenges to his conviction and death sentence, and we therefore affirm the district court's decision. 'Clark Elmore committed a truly monstrous crime. 'A state that has chosen to impose the death penalty can surely reserve it for such an offense.' The ruling does not mean Elmore will now be executed as Governor Jay Inslee has declared a moratorium on the death penalty. Elmore is the second-longest serving inmate on the state’s death row - he arrived there in 1996 - although he is now effectively serving a life sentence due to the moratorium on executions. He may still ask the US Supreme Court to review the 9th Circuit court’s opinion .","9th US Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed Elmore's conviction Wednesday .

"Whether it’s a greasy spoon in his hometown or one of the world’s most celebrated attractions for tourists, TripAdvisor’s most prolific reviewer is going to write about it. American expat Brad Reynolds has become the travel website’s top contributor, writing more than 3,300 reviews and uploading nearly 40,000 photos in just five years. The 38-year-old critiques every hotel, restaurant and landmark he visits on holiday and in his current home of Hong Kong, providing opinion and travel tips that have been read by millions of travellers around the world. Scroll down for video . Brad Reynolds, pictured at India's Taj Mahal, is TripAdvisor's most active user with 66,000 contributions in just five years . The 38-year-old, who now lives in Hong Kong, gave a five-star review of 'amazing' Pushkar, India after attending its camel fair . Originally from Edmond, Oklahoma, Brad and his wife, Jill, are avid travellers – taking about four ‘sizeable’ trips every year, in addition to weekend trips to places such as Macau. Posting under the username BradJill, Brad averages nearly two reviews a day and has made more than 66,000 contributions to the website, including 3,355 reviews, 21,000 forum posts and seven videos. He has posted reviews from 394 cities and 46 countries, with a map on his TripAdvisor profile claiming he has travelled more than 600,000 miles and visited a third of the world. A good number of his reviews have been written for attractions in Hong Kong, Macau and London, where Brad and Jill lived for a few years before moving to Asia. Russia is one of the roughly 80 countries the Oklahoma native has visited (pictured: Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia) Brad Reynolds had nothing but good things to write after visiting this Three Rondavels viewing platform in South Africa . Writing critiques has become an almost daily hobby for Brad, with each one taking anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete. While some people collect stamps or create scrapbooks, he gets his kicks from helping fellow travellers and preserving his travel memories. Brad, a director at an English language learning centre, told MailOnline Travel: ‘We were just like most people and we just lurked on the website for several years before signing up. ‘Travel is a very important hobby for us and we spend a lot of time researching and we take a lot of notes. When I get back and start writing reviews it becomes more of a daily habit. ‘Part of reviewing is a little bit selfish for me. I like recording my travel memories. I used to do a travel journal, but that has been replaced by reviews. ‘What I’m hoping to accomplish with the community is to try to put notes together that help people to make informed decisions on their own to determine if they want to see certain things or eat at a certain restaurant.’ So far Brad Reynolds has given just 12 one-star ('terrible') ratings, and he has handed out five-star reviews to top attractions . Brad, pictured at New Zealand's Franz Josef Glacier, writes an average of nearly two reviews a day, spending up to an hour on each one . This map on Brad Reynolds' TripAdvisor profile claims he has visited 34 per cent of the world and travelled more than 600,000 miles . So far he has given just 12 one-star ('terrible') ratings, including a café in Thames, New Zealand, which served a ‘very bad milkshake’ and a Hong Kong burger joint that made a ‘terrible hamburger served at premium prices’. Brad wrote that the thick chocolate milkshake, priced at NZ$4.50, at Bayon Expresso was 'the single worst milkshake I can remember', describing the 'disgusting' concoction  as a ‘highly liquid and odd-textured drink’ that was ‘the polar opposite of thick’. He was just as unforgiving with his review of the HK$100 burger at The Butchers Club, writing that the fast-food favourite was ‘a disaster’ thanks to a patty that was ‘devoid of any natural beef juice or flavour’ and ‘terrible ingredients’. Some of his two-star ('poor') reviews include Speakers' Corner at London's Hyde Park (asking in his review 'How long will places like this remain relevant in the future?') and the New York Stock Exchange ('Have a look at the facade and side entrance and move along'). Brad and Jill are deeply passionate about travelling the world and say they go on holiday 'as much as humanly possible' Writing critiques has become an almost daily hobby for Brad, with each one taking anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete . But Brad has handed out plenty of five-star ratings for everything from London's Tower Bridge and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC to the Berlin Philharmonic and Budapest's Liberty Bridge. And no destination or cafe is off-limits. He has written reviews for a Nando's in London, a Starbucks in Hong Kong and a McDonald's in Dubai, which he gave a 'poor' rating, writing that his Sausage Egg McMuffin was 'quite poor in food quality, even by McDonald’s international standards'. Brad joined TripAdvisor in 2009, but didn’t write his first review until 2010 when he and Jill, a doctor, were touring Saint Petersburg, Russia and were motivated to write a positive review after eating a ‘delicious’ slice of cheesecake at a restaurant. Despite devoting countless hours to his reviews he hasn’t developed any fatigue. He said he tries to make his reviews as informative as possible, but isn’t afraid to give a one-star rating if the hotel, restaurant or attraction wasn’t up to snuff. He also doesn’t regret any of the things he has written, adding: ‘We don’t do a lot of cheerleading and we try to keep the emotions out of the reviews. Brad estimates that he will write as many as 150 reviews based on the couple's recent two-week holiday in Italy . Brad and his wife, Jill, have travelled to exotic destinations around the world, including rice terraces outside Sagada, Philippines . ‘When I write a review I try to be more objective and informative and highlight the things that will be more important to the people who will visit. ‘There are times when things fail to meet the expectations I might have of them but I don’t tend to slam them unless it’s a very, very bad experience.’ This spring the couple toured Italy, stopping in Rome, Florence and Venice during their two-week holiday. Brad, who has visited about 80 countries and has lived in Hong Kong for nine years, estimates that he will write as many as 150 reviews based on their experiences at hotels, restaurants, museums, churches and piazzas in Italy. Despite devoting countless hours to his reviews Brad isn't fatigued; he said he tries to make his reviews as informative as possible . The number of reviews he writes ultimately depends on the destination. If it’s a big city, he will likely have dozens of places to write about. But when they visited a game reserve in South Africa the review count was low. Brad doesn’t pay much attention to the word count, as the length of each review varies. He said: ‘If it’s a museum like the British Museum it’s going to be longer with tips and advice for other visitors. If we’re visiting a small pizzeria in Rome the review won’t be so long.’ Brad Reynolds said he used to spend a lot of time writing about his travels in journals, but now writes reviews to preserve his memories .","American expat Brad Reynolds wrote his first review in 2010 while visiting Saint Petersburg, Russia .

"The Volkswagen Westfalia Camper is associated with the Seventies, the Summer of Love and nature-loving hippies. Now the iconic van is about to get greener because the bus is being reborn as an electric vehicle, a Volkswagen board member revealed. No images of the new vehicle have yet been released, but Dr Heinz-Jakob Neusser suggested that battery packs would be hidden under the vehicle's floor and a small electric motor will drive its front wheels. The iconic Volkswagen Westfalia Camper (pictured here including an extendable roof) is about to get greener, because the bus will be reborn as an electric vehicle, a Volkswagen board member revealed . The Volkswagen Westfalia Camper ceased production in 2003, and while VW has rolled out two concept 'microbuses' in recent years, neither have the charm or iconic good looks of its original. Speaking at the New York International Auto Show, Dr Neusser didn’t give any specific design details away, but said that the new version will share some features with the Westfalia Camper, because the placement of the motor and batteries will allow designers to borrow aspects of the original 1950s design. Speaking at the New York International Auto Show, Dr Neusser didn’t give any specific design details away, but said that the new version will share at least three key features with the Westfalia Camper. Volkswagen has unveiled two prototype 'microbuses' including the Bulli (pictured) in recent years . No images of the new vehicle have yet been released, but Dr Heinz-Jakob Neusser suggested that battery packs would be hidden under the floor in the vehicle and a small electric motor will drive its front wheels, making the new Camper van more environmentally friendly than its predecessor (an example is pictured) No images or name has been announced for the Westfalia Camper version 2.0. It's expected to be an electric vehicle with batteries stashed beneath the floor. A small electric motor will drive its front wheels. Compact technology will enable designers to keep 1950s features. A concept is expected to be revealed in two to five years’ time. 'It’s easy to bring battery space into such a vehicle, because you can put them under the floor. We have these systems already,' he told AutoExpress. By eliminating the need for a conventional petrol engine, VW's designers could position the cabin further forward, to mimic the layout of the original. Engineers are currently working on the concept car and Dr Neusser said that the design will go into production if it’s financially viable. It's expected that the concept will be revealed in two to five years time. The German automaker resurrected its beloved Beetle in 1997, after various iterations of the model were made for over six decades, between 1938 and 2003, suggesting it may repeat this success story with the VW Camper. Engineers are currently working on the concept car and Dr Neusser said that the design will go into production if it’s financially viable. VW also unveiled four prototype Beetles at the US auto show, including the orange Beetle Wave (pictured) which features fabric patterns from the 1950s and 60s as well as a wooden dashboard . It unveiled four new concepts for its Beetle car, including two coupés and two cabriolets. One of them is the Beetle Cabriolet Denim, which comes in ‘stonewashed blue metallic’ with a denim-like texture on the soft roof, while the orange Beetle Wave features fabric patterns from the 1950s and 60s as well as a wooden dashboard, which the company says ‘reflects the American spirit on the East and West coast beaches of the USA’. The Beetle Pink Edition is simply pink, but the R-Line Concept is a sporty version with a 2.0 TSI engine, wrap-around body panelling, a black diffuser and large rear spoiler.

"President Barack Obama threw off the gloves and took a direct punch at one of his possible successors, likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker, in an interview airing this morning. Responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office, Obama told NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep that such an approach 'would be foolish.' 'And, you know, perhaps Mr. Walker, after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy, will feel the same way,' the president added. Walker fired back at Obama on Twitter, saying, 'Americans would be better served by a President who spent more time working with governors & Congress rather than attacking them.' Scroll down for video . Foolish: In an interview with NPR, Obama said likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker may change his 'foolish' position on a deal with Iran 'after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy' Obama's jab at Walker departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term . Obama's jab at Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term. The current administration has been more willing to weigh in, however, when a presumed Republican candidate threatens to dismantle one of the president's prized domestic or foreign policies, which, in the case of Walker, was the nuclear arrangement with Iran. 'I am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedents of presidential power that they won't start calling to question the capacity of the executive branch of the United States to enter into agreements with other countries,' Obama told Inskeep during their Monday afternoon chat following the NPR host's invocation of Walker's past comments. 'If that starts being questioned, that's going to be a problem for our friends and that's going to embolden our enemies.' Continuing, Obama said, that 'would be a foolish approach to take' and slammed Walker. A cadre of probable Republican presidential contenders have spoken out against the Obama administration's laboriously negotiated pact with Iran to stunt the growth of the country's program. Walker is the only one to say he would not honor his predecessor's deal with Iran and the international community if elevated to presidency, however. 'If I ultimately choose to run, and if I’m honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing — not just for the region but for this world — we need is a nuclear-armed Iran,' he told radio host Charlie Sykes last week. 'It leaves not only problems for Israel, because they want to annihilate Israel, it leaves the problems in the sense that the Saudis, the Jordanians and others are gonna want to have access to their own nuclear weapons.' Obama has said on repeat that he believes a diplomatic agreement with Iran that shuts down, in theory, its pathways to developing a bomb will be more effective  than a military option. Obama was responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office. Walker is currently the governor of Wisconsin . Swatting Walker away: Obama takes part in the White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn, which included a spot of tennis . 'We're now in a position where Iran has agreed to unprecedented inspections and verifications of its program, providing assurances that it is peaceful in nature,' he told NPR, touting the accord that representatives of his administration and five other countries reached with Iran. Furthermore, the global community will have assurances that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranious 'remains in a place where they cannot create a nuclear weapon,' he said. 'This deal is the right thing to do for the United States, for our allies in the region and for world peace.' Obama said 'it's a hard argument to make that we're better off right now' having 'no insight' into Iran's facilities 'and letting them rush towards a bomb.' And if Iran doesn't change its behavior, Obama said the U.S. will 'still have the options available to me - or available to a future president that I have available to me right now.' Included in that portfolio will be the ability to reinstate financial sanctions on the country at any time nuclear experts at the International Atomic Energy Agency determine its broken the rules. Other areas of the plan remain fuzzy and will await clarification in a final round of talks, scheduled to take place by the end of June. Already a fissure between the United States' and Iran on sanctions - the U.S. will only commit to gradual relief that can be 'snapped back' into place while Iran is taking the stance that restrictions should be removed immediately and permanently in exchange for nuclear concessions - has emerged since the countries announced the preliminary agreement last Thursday. Obama told NPR his administration still isn't sure it 'can button down' all the issues standing in the way of a long-term agreement and it will have to 'work very hard in order to complete a deal.' And while he characterized Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demand that a final deal force Iran to recognize his country's right to exist as a 'fundamental misjudgment' of the political waters, Obama noted that one of the most 'profound' differences between America and Iran 'is the vile, anti-Semitic statements that have often come out of the highest levels of the Iranian regime.' 'So what I would say to the Israeli people is you are right to be suspicious of Iran. There's no reason why you should let your guard down with respect to Iran,' he said. 'But ultimately, Iran is deterrable, and it is deterrable not just because of Israel's superior military and intelligence capabilities but also because you got a really strong ally in the United States of America.' Shifting to the topic of Cuba briefly, Obama confirmed that he was considering removing the Latin American country from the U.S.' list of countries that sponsor terrorism. 'Understand that the criteria is very straightforward. Is this particular country considered a state sponsor of terrorism, not, do we agree with them on everything, not whether they engage in repressive or authoritarian activities in their own country,' he said. 'And so those standards, those criteria are the ones that are going to be measured against the current activities of the Cuban government.' Obama said he'll make a decision after he receives the State Department's recommendation. The president said his most pressing concern was whether he could effect the United States' relationship with the communist country in a way that 'benefits the Cuban people over the long term.' 'There are areas where there are serious differences' between the two countries, he said. 'But I do see the possibility -- a great hunger within Cuba -- to begin a change, a process that ultimately, I think, can lead to more freedom and more opportunity.'","The president took a jab at the Wisconsin governor during an interview with NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep .

"From the best night's kip being enjoyed on a Wednesday to rising the earliest on a Sunday, new data is giving fascinating insights into how the world sleeps. Using statistics from Sleep Cycle app users, researchers have discovered that the earliest wake-up time worldwide is on a Monday in South Africa. While on Tuesdays, Americans rise at 7am and are in the worst mood all week. In terms of national average sleep quality, Slovakia topped the list.  The UK was in 45th place, while the US was in 49th. The best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. More than half (58 per cent) of countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day . Other countries that wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil. The Sleep Cycle app tracks a user's sleep as they go through a cycle of sleep phases. It uses the phone's accelerometer to identify phases by tracking movements in bed and wakes users up during their lightest sleep phase, using a pre-defined 30-minute alarm window. It has more than two million active users and gathered data for the study between 1 June 2014 and 31 March this year from users aged 18 to 55 in 47 countries. Other insights from this data include that the best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. Over the course of the week, people in Finland get the most hours sleep - on a Saturday with eight hours and two minutes, on average. On the same night, people in Japan get an average of just six hours and nine minutes sleep. This graph shows which days of the week countries sleep the most . More than half (58 per cent) of the countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day, with China recording the highest sleep quality in the world that night. On Thursdays, people in the Middle East wake the latest and the happiest, and in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE in particular, users also reported the best mood on Thursdays. Despite waking up grumpy on Tuesdays, by Friday the US sleeps in the most and wakes up happiest. The data revealed Americans typically don't rise until 8:24am on Fridays and also report the best wake-up mood. MONDAY: The world wakes up earliest on Mondays with South Africa rising first at 6:09 am . TUESDAY: Americans rise early at 7am and are consequently in the worst mood all week. Other countries that also wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil . WEDNESDAY: 58% of countries surveyed - including the US - experience sleep best on Wednesdays, with China recording the highest sleep quality in the world that night. THURSDAY: Middle East users sleep longer on Thursdays than any other day, and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE also report the best mood on Thursdays. FRIDAY: Americans sleep latest on Fridays, not rising until 8:24am. They also report the best wake-up mood. People in Costa Rica, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden also wake up the happiest on Friday. However, the majority of the world (71 per cent), wake up in the best mood on Saturdays. SATURDAY: Nearly 90% of countries surveyed sleep more and wake up later on Saturday compared to any other day of the week. SUNDAY:The majority of the world (66% of countries) spends the least amount of time in bed on Sundays. Topping the list is South Korea where users only sleep 5 hours and 53 minutes on Sunday nights. Also waking up happier on Fridays are people in Costa Rica, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden. However, the majority of the world (71 per cent) wakes up in the best mood on Saturdays.

"The parents of young cancer sufferers now expect to be offered the same treatment as Ashya King, one of his doctors has said. Clinicians are in an ‘impossible situation’ as a result of the King family’s flight to Spain after disagreeing with doctors who were treating him in the UK. Doctors and nurses who treated Ashya King have criticised his parents while speaking out for the first time in a BBC documentary. Scroll down for video . Clinicians in an ‘impossible situation’ as a result of King family’s flight to Spain after disagreeing with doctors . Ashya was being treated in Southampton when his parents took him from the hospital and fled abroad without telling staff last year. They ignored medical advice and took him to Prague for proton beam therapy, ultimately paid for by the NHS Trust after he left the UK. Paediatric intensive care consultant Dr Peter Wilson told the documentary: ‘It does put clinicians in an impossible position because we now have to try to explain to families why one child... is getting a form of treatment, why they can’t and they’ve got the same tumour. 'That’s deeply unfair when the NHS is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all.’ After fleeing the UK, the Kings were arrested in Spain and spent several nights in custody after an international arrest warrant was issued against them. Ashya was made a ward of court by Portsmouth council before a national outcry led to their release. His parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 46, wanted him to have cutting-edge proton beam therapy instead which is thought to be less harmful. Because it is so highly targeted they claimed it could avoid healthy tissue, particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour. The family then went to Prague for proton beam therapy, and now say there is 'no evidence' of a tumour . A High Court judge approved the move to take Ashya to Prague for proton beam therapy. The NHS later agreed to fund Ashya’s treatment in Prague. In March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Brett King told a national newspaper a recent scan showed ‘no evidence’ of the tumour. But cancer experts have told the BBC although it appears Ashya is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured. Speaking to the documentary, staff at the hospital said they had been viciously attacked in the wake of the story. Dr Wilson said: ‘As soon as the story broke, and it became a story of a hospital who was chasing down a family, we were inundated. Paediatric intensive care consultant Dr Peter Wilson said it was 'deeply unfair when the NHS is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all’ that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children . ‘At one stage, especially on the Monday, our switchboard was basically shut because of the number of phone calls we were receiving; the number of messages that were left ... vitriolic messages for everybody. ‘The overwhelming sentiment was one of just an absolute outpouring of hatred. One of the letters said they wished my children got cancer and died.’ Paediatric oncology consultant Dr Ramya Ramanujachar, also involved in Ashya’s treatment, warned the case could set a worrying precedent. She said: ‘I don’t think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing, managing and dictating their child’s treatment.’","Doctors and nurses have criticised Ashya's parents in BBC documentary .

"CCTV footage of the devastating moment a man put his brother in a coma with a single punch has been released for the first time, with the brother responsible soon to learn if he will serve prison time. Downing Centre Local Court showed the security footage of the violent altercation between Irishman Barry Lyttle and his younger brother, Patrick, during a sentence hearing on Wednesday. Prosecutor Alex Poulos called for Barry, from Belfast in Ireland's north, to face a full-time jail term as it was the 'only appropriate sentence' after the violent incident in Sydney in January. Scroll down for video . After being pushed by Patrick Lyttle, his brother retaliates with a single punch (left) which causes his brother to fall to the ground, his head snapping back and body crumpling (right) Barry Lyttle has been charged with grievous bodily harm and has pleaded guilty to the charge . Magistrate Graeme Curran said a jail sentence was likely, explaining 'the issue is whether or not I suspend a prison term'. Barry could spend up to two years in a Sydney jail, despite his brother's calls for the charges to be dropped. On Thursday, security footage was shown for the first time, revealing the details of the distressing altercation outside Hugo's Lounge in Sydney's Potts Point when Patrick received a single blow to the head during an argument with his brother Barry. In court on Thursday, Patrick comforted his inconsolable brother as they watched the footage. Before the fight the brothers, who had only been reunited for a holiday in Australia for a matter of days, are seen chatting jovially and patting each other on the back affectionately. But after leaving the bar a fight escalated quickly. The court saw footage of the brothers standing nose-to-nose, exchanging some tense words. As Barry starts to walk away from the argument, Patrick pushes his big brother roughly. Patrick was treated by paramedics at the scene where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit on January 3 . Patrick Lyttle (middle) has called on charges against his brother Barry (left) to be dropped . The brothers from Belfast in Ireland (pictured here as children) went on a night out on January 3 in Kings Cross . Mr Lyttle pleaded guilty after the crown declined to downgrade the charge against him . The Irishman could learn his fate as soon as Thursday afternoon when the matter returns to court for a possible sentencing hearing . A split second later, Barry retaliates with a brutal punch to Patrick's head. It is a distressing scene as Patrick's head snaps back from the force of Barry's blow. His body buckles beneath him and he crumples to the ground, his head slamming against the pavement. As Patrick lies unresponsive on the ground, a clearly-distressed Barry immediately rushes to his brother's side, frantically trying to revive him. Patrick nearly lost his life after suffering traumatic head injuries. He was found by emergency services in a pool of blood and vomit, and remained in a coma at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital for six days after the January 3 altercation. Patrick says he has since made a 'fantastic recovery.' Barry pleaded guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, whilst his brother called for the charges to be dismissed. Barry Lyttle (pictured left) has pleaded guilty to causing his brother Patrick (right) grievous bodily harm . The Lyttle family has previously said they believe the charge against Barry (centre) should be dropped . Patrick Lyttle (right) said he had made a 'fantastic recovery' On Thursday, Patrick delivered an impassioned victim's statement, pleading for Barry to be spared a prison sentence and for the family to be allowed to return to Ireland together to 'heal'. 'When my family is healed I will be healed,' Patrick Lyttle told the court. 'It has been an awful ordeal for me but everyone can see it has been for Barry too. 'Victims often want to see deterrence. But everyone can see how much my brother has suffered.' Patrick also pointed out their father Oliver's health has greatly suffered as a result of the trauma. Their father was in Australia with the two men on what had intended as a trip of a lifetime, but has become a nightmare. Barry Lyttle is pictured arriving at court with his brother, Patrick, and his girlfriend, Patricia last week . 'He doesn't want to go home without his two sons,' Patrick said. Patrick asked the court to consider allowing Barry to return to Ireland so the brothers can embark on a career in youth work, telling young people their story to warn of the dangers of violence. Barry's lawyer Chris Watson said his client was remorseful, unlikely to re-offend and of good character. The 33-year-old will be sentenced in Sydney's local court, where the maximum jail term is two years, rather than the district court, where people could face up to 10 years for that offence. Barry Lyttle's barrister Chris Watson said the punch was a 'very emotional, spur of the moment act' that immediately followed being aggressively attacked by his brother, and that Barry Lyttle had immediately shown 'an extreme level of contrition and remorse', according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Any animosity between the two has since gone and they walked from court together on Thursday, as they have done at earlier appearances. Barry will return to court for sentencing on April 24.

"Veteran airman Andrew Danziger claims to have seen a UFO . A veteran pilot, who flew President Obama's campaign plane, has revealed that he has seen a UFO  flying through the sky. Andrew Danziger claimed that virtually all airmen believe in unidentified flying objects and that he had his own close encounter in the cockpit between Kansas and Iowa  in April 1989. The aircraft captain said the UFO initially appeared as a white disc before changing into a 'giant red ball.' The aviator, who has 28 years of cockpit experience, said the alien aircraft glowed bright red for around 30 seconds before disappearing below the clouds, according to the New York Daily News. Mr Danziger recalled that his plane had left Kansas City International Airport and reached the cruising altitude of 15,000 feet when he first saw a 'white disc' clearly visible through the clouds. He explained that the Captain of the aircraft, named only as Bruce, also spotted the foreign object that appeared similar to the moon. Despite, both of the men having a number of years of experience behind them they could not identify the mystery gizmo that was visible for around 40 minutes. As the pair began their decent into Waterloo, Iowa, Mr Danziger said the UFO suddenly changed colour. 'I yelled to Bruce, ""Holy s***,"" he told the newspaper. 'Above the clouds, where the white disc had been, was a now giant red ball.' He said the bright disc appeared to hover above the clouds . Mr Danziger, who flew Barack Obama during his 2008 election campaign, recalled the object flying in the same direction as his aircraft for around 30 seconds before it vanished like the 'setting sun.' The experienced airman said most pilots have reported similar sightings  (file picture) A series of flashing lights were then visible through the clouds, according to the pilot who has flown Boeing aircraft. The men later informed the National UFO Report Centre of the sighting and it was stressed to the pair that  countless pilots have witnessed similar objects in the sky. 'While neither of us had any idea what we had saw one thing we were certain of, it wasn't from here,' the North American Airlines captain told the New York Daily News. 'I'm not going too far out on a ledge to say that virtually all pilots believe in UFOs.'","Andrew Danziger flew President Obama during 2008 election campaign .

"Carefree: Linda MacDonald, 55, was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol Monday night in Dummerston, Vermont . This mugshot certainly won't be winning any points with the judge. Linda MacDonald, 55, was arrested on Monday for drunk driving and decided to stick out her tongue when she was brought to Vermont State Police barracks for booking. Police say the woman from Shelburne, Massachusetts was driving drunk around 10:30pm when she ran off Route 5 in Dummerston, Vermont and crashed her 2011 Toyota Camry into a wooden fence. At the scene, MacDonald told responding officers that she crashed while talking on the phone and trying to take directions down on a legal note pad in her car. But when officers smelled alcohol on MacDonald, they administered a breathalyzer test and she posted a .10 blood-alcohol content - above the state's legal threshold of .08. MacDonald stuck out her tongue for the cheeky picture after she was arrested and brought back to police headquarters on charges of driving while intoxicated. Police say that though MacDonald's car was heavily damaged, neither she or anyone else was injured in the one-vehicle crash. MacDonald was released on a citation and is scheduled back in court on April 28 for an arraignment. Public records do not indicate MacDonald has been arrested for DWI in the past. Sentencing for a first offense in Vermont range from a license suspension of 90 days to up to two years in prison and a maximum fine of $750.","Linda MacDonald was arrested Monday night after veering off the road and crashing her car into a wooden fence in Dummerston, Vermont .

"A new mother and her baby were found dead on a cliff face after she was advised to stop taking an anti-psychotic medication so she could breastfeed. Charlotte Bevan had come off risperidone – a powerful drug used to treat illnesses including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder – before her daughter Zaani was born late last year. Four days after the birth, the 30-year-old walked out of Bristol maternity hospital without shoes or a coat and with her baby girl in her arms. Exit: Four days after giving birth, 30-year-old Charlotte Bevan (left) was able to walk out of Bristol Maternity Hospital without shoes or a coat and with her baby girl in her arms (right) The next day, police found her body two miles away on a cliff face of the gorge near the Clifton suspension bridge. Newborn Zaani Tiana Bevan Malbrouck was later found close by. It emerged yesterday that Miss Bevan – who is believed to have had a history of severe mental health problems – had been advised by medics to stop taking the drug ahead of Zaani’s birth. NHS guidance says mothers should take risperidone during pregnancy only if their doctor says they need to. It adds: ‘If you take this medicine during the late stages of pregnancy or during labour, your baby may have some problems or withdrawal symptoms and may need to have some monitoring after birth.’ At a pre-inquest hearing yesterday, Avon senior coroner Maria Voisin said ‘breastfeeding advice given in relation to (Miss Bevan’s) risperidone’ was an issue she wanted to explore in an effort to prevent future deaths. Discovery: After a huge search, police found Miss Bevan's body two miles away on a cliff face of the gorge near Clifton Suspension Bridge. Newborn Zaani Tiana Bevan Malbrouck was later found close by . She said: ‘She was not taking risperidone – what action was being taken and what impact was that having on her mental health?’ The coroner also said there were further questions for the hospital to answer, adding: ‘The ward she was on - was it appropriate for her to be on and were all the staff trained and able to deal with her needs? ‘Obviously there is the issue of Charlotte managing to leave the ward and the hospital unnoticed and unmanaged.’ University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust launched a review into the care it offered Miss Bevan and her baby following their deaths in December. Immediately after Miss Bevan disappeared, friends and family said she had battled depression since her father’s sudden death from a brain tumour in 2000. And it was suggested she had suffered a decline in mental health due coming off medication. Miss Bevan’s boyfriend Pascal Malbrouck, her mother Rachel Fortune, and her sister were among the family at the short pre-inquest review held at Avon Coroner’s Court in Flax Bourton near Bristol. Plea: Miss Bevan’s boyfriend Pascal Malbrouck (left) and her mother Rachel Fortune (right) at a police press conference in December 2014 appealing for Miss Bevan and her baby to return after they disappeared . Family: Miss Bevan, who was found dead last year, is pictured with Mr Malbrouck (left) and Ms Fortune (right) When asked if she wanted anything raised at the inquest, Ms Fortune said her daughter had asked that Mr Malbrouck was not there during the birth. Investigation: An Avon and Somerset search and rescue team member works with police to search an area near Avon Gorge in Bristol in December 2014 . She said: ‘I think it needs to be said that Charlotte decided Pascal was not present and I think that needs to be said. I think that says something.’ The coroner also expressed her dismay when a Bristol hospitals trust representative said she still had little information on which medical witnesses would be called and what evidence they would offer. Trust representative Caroline Saunders said Avon and Somerset Police were gathering statements from health staff and they had not been passed on to her yet. But coroner Ms Voisin, who said another pre-inquest hearing would now have to be held in around two months, said: ‘I would normally expect the Trust to be much more familiar with at least the chronology and the staff involved – not passing that over to the police.’ She said it was also now unlikely the full inquest in to both deaths will take place until after the summer holidays. And she said to Miss Bevan’s family: ‘There is a lot more work to do and I am sorry if you think it is a slow process but I think in this case we should take things a little more slowly, a little more carefully, to ensure the best for Charlotte and Zaani.’ Among those witnesses expected to provide evidence at the inquest will be Miss Bevan’s care co-ordinators, midwives, a hospital porter, and a consultant psychiatrist.","Charlotte Bevan, 30, walked out of hospital in Bristol with daughter Zaani .

"Former New England Patriots star and newly convicted killer Aaron Hernandez is facing a second murder trial in a 2012 drive-by shooting that left two men dead and a third wounded. Earlier today, the 25-year-old athlete was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2013 shooting death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd. A jury panel in Fall River, Massachusetts, spent 36 hours spread over seven days deliberating Hernandez’s fate before returning a guilty verdict. Scroll down for video . More victims: Aaron Hernandez is accused of killing Daniel Abreu (left), 29, and Safirdo Furtado (right), 28, immigrants from Cape Verde, in July 2012 after a nightclub altercation over a spilled drink . Former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, pictured at his sentencing at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts, Wednesday, is facing a second trial in a 2012 deadly drive-by shooting . Following the sentencing phase, which took place immediately after the conviction, Hernandez was handcuffed and returned to jail. A first-degree murder conviction in Massachusetts automatically triggers an appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court. A date for the Hernandez appeal wasn't immediately set. But the former Patriots tight-end will back in front of a judge later this year, this time in Boston, to face murder charges in the killings of Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safirdo Furtado, 28. The jury that rendered the Lloyd verdict was not told about that case. On July 16, 2012, the two immigrants from Cape Verde were found murdered in their car at a stop light in South Boston following a drive-by shooting. A third man was wounded in the incident but survived. They had reportedly gotten into a fight with Hernandez and his crew over a spilled drink at a night club prior to their murders. In May 2014, Hernandez was indicted for both killings. He pleaded not guilty. According to prosecutors, de Abreu accidentally bumped into him at Cure Lounge, spilling Hernandez's drink. Hernandez told a friend he thought the man was 'trying' him, and surveillance video outside the club showed Hernandez pacing back and forth while his friend tried to calm him down at around 2.30am. Later, Hernandez drove around until he saw the men get in a BMW, followed them and shot at them from a silver SUV at a stop light, prosecutors said. A third man in their car also was shot but survived. About six weeks after that shooting, Hernandez signed a five-year, $40million contract with the Patriots, and he went on to play for another season before Lloyd was killed. He was cut from the team soon after being arrested in Lloyd's killing in June 2013. The Boston case against Hernandez is considered to be stronger than the one that had just wrapped up in Fall River because prosecutors have the suspected murder weapon in the drive-by shooting and eyewitness accounts to rely upon, according to Fox Sports. Justice for Odin: The 25-year-old athlete (left) was found guilty Wednesday of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2013 shooting death semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd (right) Back behind bars: Following the sentencing phase, Hernandez was handcuffed and returned to jail . Under lock and key: The 25-year-old will spend the rest of his days at a maximum-security prison . The trial had been scheduled to get under way May 28, but now it will be pushed back into the fall or early next year to give Hernandez’s defense team ample time to prepare. 'We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track,' Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said in the wake of Wednesday's verdict, reported CNN. In the Boston case, Hernandez faces two counts of first-degree murder; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder; one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. Hernandez also faces civil lawsuits from the families of the men he is accused of killing. And he was sued by Alexander Bradley, a former friend who says Hernandez shot him in the face and left him for dead in an industrial park in Florida after arguing with him in February 2013. Bradley lost his eye in the shooting and subsequently testified against Hernandez at his murder trial but never brought criminal charges of his own against his friend. The high-paid athlete had his $5million in assets frozen pending the outcome of the drive-by shooting trial. In court Wednesday, Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder in Lloyd's killing and several lesser charges - mostly related to the weapon he used in the murder - a .40-caliber Glock pistol which has never been found. Hernandez was found guilty of carrying a firearm without a license, two counts of carrying a large capacity firearm, possession of a firearm without a firearm identification card and possession of ammunition without an identification card. The prosecution said the player and two friends Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz drove Lloyd to an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough mansion and shot him to death, execution-style. Hernandez's attorneys countered that Hernandez was a witness to, not a participant in, the killing. Wallace and Ortiz are to be tried separately on murder charges. The Patriots cut Hernandez hours after his arrest on June 26, 2013, nine days after a teenage jogger found Lloyd's body. Tears of joy, tears of sorrow: Ursula Ward, mother of the victim, and Terri Hernandez, mother of the defendant, burst into tears after hearing the guilty verdict . Lost love: Shaneah Jenkins, girlfriend of Odin Lloyd, broke down when the jury convicted her boyfriend's killer . During four months of testimony, the jury heard from more than 130 witnesses who testified that Hernandez, a native of Bristol, Connecticut, was a regular user of marijuana and sometimes of the stimulant PCP, that he owned guns and at times acted paranoid and that he said he felt his friends did not appreciate the things he did for them. Defense lawyers closed their case by saying Hernandez had been present at the time of Lloyd's slaying, but had been a witness not a participant. 'He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed ... a shocking killing committed by somebody he knew,' said defense attorney James Sultan. 'He really didn't know what to do. So he just put one foot in front of the other. Prosecutors countered that Hernandez had plotted and controlled every detail of the slaying. 'He believed he could kill Odin Lloyd and nobody would ever believe that he was involved,' said Assistant District Attorney William McCauley. Hernandez was led out of his mansion in handcuffs on June 26, 2013 - nine days after Odin Lloyd was found shot execution-style in an industrial park a mile away. Lloyd, 27, was a semi professional football player for the Boston Bandits. He had also been dating Shaneah Jenkins - the sister of Hernandez's fiancée and mother of his child, Shayanna Jenkins. Separate surveillance videos show Hernandez outside Lloyd's home about an hour before the murder, and then walking into his own $1.3million mansion after shots were heard. It also emerged that the NFL star destroyed surveillance video at his home. When he handed over his cell phone, it had been smashed to pieces. Ursula Ward had tears streaming down her face during a press conference following the conviction and sentencing of her son's killer . All eyes on jury: Jurors in the high-profile murder trial addressed the media after convicting Hernandez of first-degree murder . Hernandez glanced to the side and pursed his lips after the 12-person jury pronounced the first-degree murder conviction this afternoon. His mother and fiancee sobbed in the gallery. Dressed in a sharp suit and tie, he sat down as the jury convicted him on two separate gun and ammunition charges. Lloyd's tearful mother, Ursula Ward, told the court that she felt her heart 'stop beating for a moment' when she laid her son to rest, but that she had managed to forgive his murderers. 'I miss my baby boy Odin so much but I know I'm going to see him someday again and that is giving me the strength to go on,' she said, choking back tears. Not surprisingly, prosecutors welcomed the guilty verdict. 'The jury found that he was just a man who committed a brutal murder. The fact that he was a professional athlete meant nothing in the end,' District Attorney Thomas Quinn said. The murder weapon was never discovered, but analysts said the evidence against Hernandez was overwhelming. Hernandez has the right to appeal the conviction.","Former New England Patriots tight-end was convicted Wednesday of killing Odin Lloyd and sentenced to life in prison without parole .

"Police are now urging witnesses of a middle-aged woman's offensive public transport tirade at a Muslim woman to come forward after Daily Mail Australia published video of the incident. Stacey Eden, 23, stood up for the Muslim woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter 'bullying' the Sydney commuter on an Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday afternoon. Ms Eden switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to Muslim couple's defence with a fiery spray notably absent any swearing. A police spokeswoman contacted Daily Mail Australia on Thursday to say they would 'definitely encourage' witnesses of the incident to come forward. In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Scroll down for video . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent. 'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport. Ms Eden told Daily Mail Australia the couple alighted the train at Sydney International Airport . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot. Ms Eden said the woman was saying 'horrible and hurtful things'. 'She told me if I was in their country I would have been stoned to death because I was wearing a dress. 'She was saying a lot of things I just got to the point where I had heard enough.' The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg. Mariam Veiszadeh (pictured), a lawyer and public advocate for the rights of Muslims, says incidents such as these are increasingly common . 'I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness)' Mariam has been the target of racist attacks herself . 'It was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything. People were just listening. I know they were scared,' Hina said. As for Ms Eden, she told Daily Mail Australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online, having posted the video just yesterday. 'Good on you for sticking up for whats right more people should be doing the same,' wrote punter Rachel Lambert. 'Well I don't know you but thank you, thank you for understanding,' said Shahiq Sarkar. Overwhelming response: Ms Eden has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online . 'I hope some day when you need help and are boxed in a corner someone as bright as you is there to support you just like you did for those poor souls. 'We really need to look for the best in people and understand that its a few rotten apples who try to spoil the lot. 'All the best wishes for you.' One comment even asked: 'RU single? Lol'.

"An Iranian cleric is teaching his followers that thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife will make your children gay. Ayatollah Hossein Dehnavi, a celebrity preacher in Iran, made the speech to a packed auditorium of men and women in his home country. It is the latest controversial teaching put forward by Dehnavi, who also warned that if women did not wear the hijab - the veil covering the hair and chest - properly, they could inadvertently cause some men to become homosexual. Islamic cleric Dehnavi is a celebrity in his native Iran, giving speeches on relationships and family values . While thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife is not a sin, the Iranian ayatollah preaches, if she becomes pregnant it will mean the child will be gay. Homosexuality is punishable by death in the state . On past occasions He has preached that women must provide sex to their husbands at all times - and said women who are better educated or are financially independent 'harm men's authority'. 'One of the other duties of women in regard to their men is to take care of their men’s instinctive needs [sexual drive]', the cleric said in a report by The Clarion Project, an organisation against extremism. 'Do not break their pride and [you must] be more sensitive toward them' During another speech, the ayatollah explain that it is not a sin for a man to think about another woman while he is having sex with his partner, but if she becomes pregnant as a result the child will be gay. Incorrectly wearing the hijab, Dehnavi also warns, could lead to some men becoming homosexual. Hundreds of women attend the lectures and speeches of the Muslim cleric, whose is also regularly shown on state TV . The statements, thought to have been made in 2012 and 2013, came to light after being shared by Gay Star News this week. Homosexual acts are punishable by death in Iran, with gay and lesbian people forced to hide their sexuality. A man involved in the 'dominant' role in sodomy faces being flogged up to 100 times if he is unmarried and the sex is consensual, while the man playing the 'passive' can still be put to death regardless of his marriage status, according to a report in The Guardian. Lesbians faced being whipped 100 times, but sex between two women can also lead to the death penalty if the act is committed four times. Following his teachings, Dehavni says, will ultimately lead to 'peace on earth'. In another speech he controversially suggested that women should always be sexually available for their husbands . Men become 'saturated' if they have too much sex, Dehavni warns - suggesting becoming intimate once or twice a week is enough. He also says women can make their husbands aroused by showing off their armpits . Dehavni is a celebrated cleric in Iran, whose speeches on family life and marital affairs are shown on state TV and who people queue up for tickets to see him speak live, according to Iran Wire. The 53-year-old grandfather has himself been married for 30 years . In other speeches he warns Iranian couples not to have too much sex: '.. only once or twice a week, not every day. Otherwise the wan will become saturated.' He also suggests paler women wear black underwear and show off the most attractive parts of their bodies - their armpits and chest - to entice their husbands. By perfecting the art of lovemaking, he suggests, couples will have bigger families with strong Muslim values which will ultimately lead to peace on earth.","Ayatollah Hossein Dehnavi made statement during marriage advice speech .

"While young children must be shown the highway code to cross roads safely, it seems chimpanzees have taught themselves. Researchers studying chimps in Uganda say the apes are having to adapt to cope with increasingly busy roads cutting across their territory. They found at a busy asphalted road through the Sebitoli area of Kibale National Park in Uganda, the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing. Chimpanzees crossing a busy road in Kibale National Park in Uganda (above) have learned to look for traffic . Scientists discovered the chimps will also often run across roads, while dominant males will wait to ensure younger chimps cross safely. It is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to change their behaviour to adapt to busy roads. Chimpanzees appear to flavour their food with herbs, researchers have suggested. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. Marie Cibot, a biologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, who led the work, said the spread of road infrastructure in Africa was posing a growing threat to wildlife in many countries. She said: 'Although the asphalted road represents a substantial threat to crossing animals, chimpanzees took into account this risk. 'More than 90 per cent of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing. 'Chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups. Whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups.' The researchers say the road in Sebitoli sees around 89 motor vehicles an hour racing down it at speeds of between 40mph and 60mph. The researchers said they saw several different primates killed on the roads in the past year. However, chimpanzees living in the surrounding forests appear to have learned about the danger it poses. They watched 122 chimps cross the road over the course of two and half years. They found most of the chimps looked for traffic before crossing and as they crossed. Adult chimps, like this one, tended to wait for younger chimps to cross and checked they got over safely . Females with young and injured adults tended to cross less frequently. Around 20 per cent of the chimps that crossed would turn to check on other members of the group to ensure they were crossing safely. They also tended to form small groups of between two to three chimpanzees that crossed at a time. Chimps have been noticed to cross in similar ways on other non-asphalted roads. However, on quieter roads, adults tend to lead the group in a similar way as they do when checking for predators rather than splitting up into smaller groups. The researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, have appealed for measures to help reduce the impact roads were having on wildlife. Miss Cibot, who worked on the study with Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the Great Ape Conservation Project in Uganda, said bridges or underpasses could be provided to help keep chimps safe. The team are hoping to work with the Ugandan authorities to test new safety measures. Miss Cibot said: 'These observations are relevant for our understanding of adaptive behavior among chimpanzees in human-impacted habitats. 'Further investigations are needed to better evaluate the effects of busy roads on adolescent female dispersal and on their use of territories. 'Mitigation measures, like bridges, underpasses, reduced speed limits, speed-bumps, signposts, or police controls, should be established in this area.'","Chimps were observed crossing busy road in Kibale National Park, Uganda .

"A wedding in Saudi Arabia took a dangerous turn when the brother of the groom began firing celebratory shots with a Kalashnikov, sending a hail of bullets ricocheting off the walls. Horrified guests dived for cover as the groom's brother lost control of the gun at a reception in the capital Riyadh. Firing guns in the air is a traditional way of celebrating special occasions in some parts of Saudi Arabia and despite government efforts to stop it, the dangerous practice lingers on. Shotgun wedding: The groom's brother was caught on camera as he lost control of a Kalashnikov while firing a celebratory round into the air . Banging start: As the man starts shooting, he loses control of the rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street over the wedding guest . The incident was caught on camera, and the short clip shows the wedding party making its way towards the wedding hall when suddenly the brother of the groom starts shooting in the air. As he fires off the celebratory round, he loses control of the Kalashnikov rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street. Once he stops shooting, the video shows the guests attempt to reform a queue and act as if nothing untoward had happened, while  resuming their slow procession to the wedding. The 30-second clip, believed to have been filmed with a mobile phone has been viewed nearly 140,000 times. Several online commentators criticise the gunman, calling him irresponsible and unable to hold his rifle right.

Another, Byzanti, said: 'The police should use the video clip to identify the brother and apply the law. 'As long as there is no punishment, people will continue to act irresponsibly. Those who attempt to show off their firearm skills are usually cowards in real action.' Abu Atab posted: 'The Kalashnikov man should be tied up alongside the family sheep until the wedding is over.' The Saudi government has been calling for an end to the local tradition of firing guns into the air to celebrate weddings and birthdays, which has often resulted in accidental deaths. A government spokesman said: 'Security agencies have been told to monitor wedding halls and places of celebration to prevent this sort of thing happening.

"Pete Evans has been slammed by medical professionals for promoting fluoride-free water . Health Minister Jillian Skinner has slammed celebrity chef Pete Evans for promoting fluoride-free water, saying he is putting people's health at risk with his extreme views on diet and lifestyle. It comes after concerned medical professionals  described Evans' standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice after he revealed his family also steers clear of consuming Australian tap water. Ms Skinner said she was 'highly disappointed' to see the My Kitchen Rules judge use his power as a high profile media personality to influence in areas he had no expertise, in which she has refused to watch his reality cooking show. 'Here we are spending a lot of effort and energy in educating people about the value of fluoridation, about the fact that there are no risks associated with ­vaccination, or very low risks, and that there is no connection between vaccination and autism, and it is countered by a celebrity who knows nothing from a specialist point of view,' she told The Sunday Telegraph. 'I'm highly disappointed that they would use a platform of cooking. That is totally inappropriate and quite disturbing, which is why I won't watch those programs anymore.' Evans' has responded to the Health Minister's concerns, saying he would like to discuss the benefits of water fluoridation. 'I welcome the opportunity to ­discuss the value of fluoridation with Ms Skinner, but ask that she, or any other party, does not misrepresent my views, opinions or beliefs.' The revelation follows after Evans threw his weight behind an anti-fluoride campaign where he proudly wore a 'Fluoride Free WA' t-shirt on Facebook to promote the Perth-based lobby group's cause. Health Minister Jillian Skinner has slammed celebrity chef Pete Evans for promoting fluoride-free water . Evans has also been under fire for endorsing the Paleo diet which cuts out dairy, cereal and processed meats . Some slogans on the Fluoride Free WA Facebook page that Evans is a passionate advocate for . 'Alkalised water (maybe I just should've just said filtered water?) - we have a portable mineral pot ($500) water filter which rids tap water from potential carcinogens (chorine, chemicals, bacteria etc),' he said in a post on his Facebook page. Evans and his family don't drink tap water . 'I realise there's plenty of controversy around alkalised water, but I would rather choose this option over drinking tap water or bottled water, as it works out cheaper in the long run, and is environmentally friendly.' Australian Medical Association Victorian president Tony Bartone hit back at the outspoken chef telling Daily Mail Australia that Evans needed to stick to what he does best. 'All evidence at this stage both reliable studies and research from universities, the World Health Organisation, and by the Australian Dental Association points to the fact that basically fluoridation is an important public health initiative - it does prevent tooth decay,' Dr Bartone said. 'Celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the Stone Age.' 'People like this are using their fame and influence in areas that they have no expertise - obviously a top class chef but when it comes to scientific research and understanding - they are lacking.' Evans has previously been slammed for his endorsement of the controversial Paleo diet, which his family abides by, that includes meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit but excludes dairy or cereal products and processed food. 'I'm occasionally ridiculed or accused of ignorance because I choose to eat and feed my family what I believe to be a nutrient dense diet,' he said on his Facebook page. 'I can't help but find it so bizarre as to why some people find my food choices so offensive?' He says his decisions are an important part of being a parent - adding that 'ignorance is not bliss'. 'I'm a father and I take that privilege very seriously, so for me striving for optimum health and trying new things whenever possible, so that I can be a responsible role model for my daughters and still be able to surf right up until the end, is the ultimate goal,' he posted. Evans (left) says his role as a father is to strive for optimum health for his children . The My Kitchen Rules judge (pictured with fellow judge Manu Fieldel left) thinks it is bizarre that some people find his food choices so offensive . However, Dr Bartone sees Evans' stance as abusing his high profile media personality. 'It is influencing vulnerable others - people who are time-poor - and will unfortunately just look at celebrity endorsement and think it must be good and follow the argument without delving into the facts, he said. 'It affects the health message we are trying to impart on our patients and the community at large - especially in times when know that health and well-being is crucial and key to a number of illnesses and health factors that have a huge cross burden on society.'","Celebrity chef Pete Evans strongly endorses fluoride-free water .

"On Thursday night, the great and good of fashion and showbiz gathered to help one man celebrate the launch of his  new shop. But this was no ordinary shop - this was Burberry Chief Creative and chief executive officer Christopher Bailey's new Beverley Hills flagship. Over 700 guests, including superstars Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse, Mila Kunis, Elton John, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Anna Wintour and the entire Beckham brood, turned out to support their pal Christopher at the London in Los Angeles event at Griffith Observatory. So how does one man have so many A-list friends? And how did he turn Burberry into the world's coolest brand, notching sales for the six months to April up to £1.42bn? An ability to reinvent trends, an eye for the hottest talent and the most charming demeanour; that's how. Scroll down for video . Over 700 guests and models, including Jourdan Dunn, left, James Corden, front, and Naomi Campbell, right, joined Burberry boss Christopher Bailey, back, to celebrate fashion, music, and Britishness at an exclusive event at Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. The event also marks the launch of its new flagship store on Rodeo Drive that opened in November . Christopher Bailey's meteoric rise through the ranks at Burberry  hit new heights after the Yorkshire-born designer was named CEO at just 42-years-old back in October 2013. The designer had been a key part of Burberry's creative team since he joined the label as creative director in 2001, and took the reins as chief creative officer in 2009. In a statement released by the brand, Bailey described himself as 'humbled' after being offered the role, which he took up in mid-2014 when current CEO Angela Ahrendts departed for Apple. During his tenure at the brand, Bailey has made Burberry one of the most influential labels in the world thanks to his uncanny knack for knowing what women want before they know themselves. The great and good of fashion and showbiz (L-R) Cara Delevingne, Mila Kunis and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, gathered to help Bailey celebrate . (L-R) Brooklyn Beckham, Cruz Beckham, Victoria Beckham, Romeo Beckham, Harper Beckham, David Beckham, editor-in-chief of American Vogue Anna Wintour and Julia Corden sat front row at the event . Since becoming creative director in 2001 after a stint at Gucci, the label has gone from strength to strength, but that hasn't stopped Bailey from taking time out to encourage up-and-coming talent from making the most of their skills. Along with mentoring fashion students from the University of Huddersfield and the Royal College of Art, Bailey and Ahrendts together launched the Burberry Foundation - a project that encourages young people around the world to realise their potential through creativity. At every show, he calls on fledgling musicians to perform - and his alumni, including Tom Odell, Paloma Faith and George Barnett, have all gone on to greatness. Christopher Bailey's meteoric rise through the ranks at Burberry hit new heights after the Yorkshire-born designer was named CEO at just 42-years-old back in October 2013. Left: with the Beckhams at the launch of Romeo's Christmas campaign for the brand, and, right, with Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn; two models he has long championed . Prince Charles is presented with a gabardine walking jacket by Burberry's Christopher Bailey as the Prince officially opened the new Burberry global headquarters in London back in 2009 . And then there's the models. Bailey snapped up Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Jourdan Dunn, Lily Donaldson, Cara Delevingne, Douglas Booth and Eddie Redmayne before anyone else had clocked onto them. He counts Sienna Miller, Suki Waterhouse, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss among his most recent clothes horses - and counting. One of his biggest - and most talked-about - coups was snapping up Romeo Beckham to front two of his campaigns. Bailey is good friends with Romeo's mother, fellow designer Victoria, so there's little wonder the pair were introduced. Indeed, Romeo is one sixth of the UK's most famous family, so it's no surprise that Romeo  holds some pretty substantial pulling power. In fact, thanks to his  Burberry advert, sales of the brand's classic £1,500 trench coats shot up a substantial 10 per cent. The fashion label credited the 12-year-old son of David and Victoria for its rise in sales in the US, Europe and the Middle East after he starred in their Christmas advert last year. The advert, which was first released in November, was the first-ever Christmas campaign for Burberry and starred Romeo alongside 50 dancers all clad in the beige trench coats. Such was his popularity in the film called From London With Love that it was watched nine million times after being released. Christopher Bailey has plenty of friends in high places, including Jemma Kidd, Anna Wintour and Evgeny Lebedev and Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Mornington . Bailey, seen with Will.I.Am, described himself as 'humbled' after being offered the role, which he took up in mid-2014 when current CEO Angela Ahrendts, left, departed for Apple . Of course, Bailey has put his golden touch on the clothes, too. This week it was revealed that sales of the brand's poncho carrying a personal monogram and costing more than £1,000 have been central to a sales boom at the very British prestige brand. The ponchos - together with heritage trench coats and scarves - have boosted Burberry sales by 10 per cent over the winter. The wool-and-cashmere designs, which were first modelled on the catwalk by Cara Delevingne, were a huge success among celebrities before Christmas. Famous names including Victoria Beckham, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Sienna Miller and Sarah Jessica Parker were all seen sporting the ponchos, each monogrammed with their initials. The firm said its scarves and trench coats were a hit with customers and ‘investment and innovation in ponchos drove exceptional growth. The British brand has become a global success with sales up 10 per cent for the six months to the end of March compared to the year before, taking from up to £1.42 billion . Chief financial officer, Carol Fairweather, described the impact of the ponchos as ‘phenomenal’ and suggested new variants are in the pipeline adding: ‘There’s lots more to come from the poncho story.’ The British brand has become a global success with sales up 10 per cent for the six months to the end of March compared to the year before, taking from up to £1.42 billion. Sales were particularly strong in the UK and Europe, not least because hordes of tourists from China flocked here to buy designer clothes and bags. Burberry saw ‘double digit’ sales growth in the United States and Europe and trading was particularly buoyant in Britain, France and Italy, from both locals and tourists. One of his biggest - and most talked-about - coups was snapping up Romeo Beckham to front two of his campaigns, which boosted the brand's trench coat sales . Burberry's iconic ponchos  have boosted Burberry sales by 10 per cent over the winter. The wool-and-cashmere designs, which were first modelled on the catwalk by Cara Delevingne, front, were a huge success among celebrities before Christmas . Richard Hunter, of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: ‘Burberry remains in fashion following a trading update which underscores its ability to capitalise on its chosen markets. ‘The overall picture is extremely healthy – the strength of the digital contribution, particular product growth in the likes of the iconic trench coats and scarves and pleasing performances from the Americas and most of Europe. ‘In addition, the company is well positioned for future, selective growth in terms of both stores and lines, such as beauty. ‘It seems that everything about Burberry is premium – its brand, its products and perhaps of late its share price – a 25 per cent increase over the last year compares to a 7.5 per cent rise for the wider FTSE100.’ Burberry was founded in 1856 but has moved with the times under Bailey, who understands how to use technology and social media to the brand's advantage. The brand's flagship Regent Street store in London is case in point. It's not just a place to shop but a hub of new technology with interactive mirrors, concert-quality sound systems and giant screens streaming their catwalk shows - as is the Burberry Beauty Box in Covent Garden. Bailey also allows customers the chance to purchase items straight from the runway at his shows, livestreams the events and this week launched a Snapchat account, featuring surprise visits from members of the Burberry family including Cara Delevingne, Naomi Campbell and Jourdan Dunn. The platform revealed real-time content from the event on Thursday night, including live arrivals on the red carpet and front row reactions. Speaking to MailOnline, Bailey said: 'It's all about involving people around the world and making them feel part of the experience - even if they can't be there in person. He said: 'It's about doing something that makes people smile, that makes people want to engage, whether it's online, whether it's physical, whether it's at the show like this.' Bailey always manages to draw in the starriest of front rows (L to R) Actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, singer Sam Smith, model Cara Delevingne, model Jourdan Dunn, model Kate Moss, fashion photographer Mario Testino and model Naomi Campbell at the Burberry Prorsum AW 2015 show . Christopher Bailey was born in West Yorkshire in 1971 to a carpenter father and a mother who worked as a window dresser in Marks & Spencer. Despite his country roots, fashion always called to Bailey and in 1994, he graduated from the Royal College of Art in London. His career began with a role at Donna Karan in New York but he moved on after just two years, having been offered a senior role at Gucci. After five years in the job, Burberry came calling with Bailey tasked with turning the creative direction of the then ailing fashion house around. Working closely with Angela Ahrendts, Bailey's vision struck a chord with buyers, press and fashion fans alike and the brand has gone from strength to strength during his tenure. Awards for his work have ranged from an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, London's Royal College of Art, to a prestigious CFDA gong in 2011. In his role as Chief Creative and chief executive officer, a new title created especially for him, Bailey is responsible for everything from the design of Burberry collections and products to advertising, corporate art direction and even architectural design. If his success so far is anything to go by, it's going to be a very triumphant future for the A-list-loved brand.

"The killing of toddler Mikaeel Kular could 'not have been predicted' by social and health service workers who visited his family in the months leading up to his death, a review has found. His mother, Rosdeep Adekoya, beat her three-year-old son to death before stuffing his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods in Kircaldy, Fife, in January last year. His death came just six months after he was returned to Adekoya's care following more than a year with foster carers. Social workers also visited the family a number of times over two years. But a review into whether the social care teams involved with the family could or should have foreseen the circumstances of his death has concluded it 'could not have been predicted'. Victim: The killing of toddler Mikaeel Kular (left) by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya (right) could 'not have been predicted' by social and health service workers who visited his family in the months leading up to his death . Adekoya, then 34, beat Mikaeel for being sick and left him to die in agony over three days. She then told police her child had wandered off, sparking a major two-day search operation involving emergency services and hundreds of volunteers. Adekoya eventually led officers to the body, which she hid near her sister's house. She was jailed for 11 years last August after pleading guilty to culpable homicide and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. In the wake of the tragedy, the Fife and Edinburgh Child Protection Committees commissioned an independent significant case review to establish whether the care teams could have predicted the killing is published. A summary of the review, published today, concluded that Adekoya's behaviour towards her son was 'unprecedented and out of character' and that the killing 'could not have been predicted', even though a number of concerns had been raised and the toddler had spent time in care. February 2012 - July 2012 Fife social work and NHS Fife health visiting services carry out a number of joint home visits after concerns are raised over the children's welfare . July 2012 Mikaeel is taken into care after Adekoya left he and her  other children unattended . August 2013 Children's Hearing takes place and Mikaeel is returned to his mother's care . August 2013 January 2014 The family is visited five times by Fife social workers  and twice by an Edinburgh health visitor . January 2014 Adekoya, then 34, beat Mikaeel for being sick and left him to die in agony over three days . August 2014  Adekoya is jailed for 11 years after pleading guilty to culpable homicide and a second charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice . Today Independent significant case review to establish whether the care teams could have predicted the killing is published . Between February 2012 and July 2012, Fife social work and NHS Fife health visiting services carried out a number of joint home visits after concerns were twice raised. Mikaeel, referred to in the report as MK, was taken into care in July 2012 after Adekoya left he and her other children unattended. He remained with foster carers until August 2013, while social workers were waiting for a Children's Hearing before returning the boy to his mother. The report published today noted that while waiting for the hearing, contact arrangements were not increased. The review team felt that this should have been undertaken and used as an opportunity to test out and monitor his mother's ability to manage her parenting responsibilities. After Mikaeel was returned to his mother, the family was visited five times by Fife social workers and twice by the Edinburgh health visitors. The teams found no factors that suggested a level of risk that required intervention. The review concluded that 'the circumstances that led to MK's death could not have been predicted'. The report identified examples of good practice but also identified 13 areas for future learning and action for NHS Fife, Fife social work services and other organisations including the Scottish Government. Steve Grimmond, chair of the joint Chief Officers' Group of Fife and Edinburgh, which agreed the remit of the review, said: 'Social workers and health professionals involved in the case have been greatly affected by this tragedy. Concern: Adekoya told police her child had wandered off, sparking a major two-day search operation involving emergency services and hundreds of volunteers (pictured in January last year) 'They care very deeply about what they do and the people they support. 'The report acknowledges the challenges involved for staff going through periods of organisational change while carrying heavy caseloads. 'All agencies will consider how we can improve support to staff at these times and make sure robust processes are in place to review and assess the impact of change within our organisations. 'The report does make a number of recommendations around the sharing and management of information. We're keen to support this in whatever way we can. Killer: Adekoya, pictured, was jailed for 11 years last August after pleading guilty to culpable homicide and attempting to defeat the ends of justice . 'Finally, we commissioned an independent significant case review to make sure we learn from this case. 'We fully accept the report's findings and we are taking every opportunity to improve and strengthen our practices.' The full report is not being published as it contains detailed, personal and private information, although a summary has been released. Professor Scott McLean, NHS Fife executive lead for children's services, said: 'NHS Fife accepts today's independent report findings in full. 'The report highlights that professionals communicated well with each other and worked collaboratively to care for Mikaeel and his family. 'It clearly states that there is no evidence that health or other professionals could have predicted the tragic death of Mikaeel. 'We are committed to learning from this case and further strengthening areas of practice.' A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'The sudden, un-natural death of any child is a tragedy and the untimely death of Mikaeel Kular continues to reverberate across Scotland and in particular, the communities in Fife and Edinburgh where he lived. 'The Scottish Government therefore welcomes the urgency with which this significant case review was undertaken and its speedy conclusion and focused actions, which we are sure will now be considered and acted upon by all the appropriate agencies timeously. 'We accept the recommendation directed at the Scottish Government and we will consider the implications of the report very carefully. 'We are currently consulting on guidance and secondary legislation accompanying the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act which will help meet the recommendation. 'The Scottish Government takes seriously its responsibilities in relation to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all of Scotland's children, including those who are most vulnerable and at risk of harm. 'We have worked, and will continue to work with, partners and through parliament to strengthen how statutory agencies and children's services work together to identify and respond early to concerns about a child's safety or wellbeing, including most recently through the Children & Young People (Scotland) Act.'","Toddler Mikaeel Kular was killed by mother Rosdeep Adekoya last January .

"Mariel Hemingway was just 16 years old when she starred as Woody Allen's teenage girlfriend in the controversial romantic-comedy 'Manhattan'. As the granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, Mariel was from one of the most famous and recognizable families in America. But despite her grandfather’s success, there was a dark side to her last name, which the now 53-year-old has recounted in two new novels, released Tuesday. On top of the world: Mariel Hemingway, 53, has her life in order and has written two revealing books about growing up in a family riddled with depression, alcoholism and suicides . Independent: Mariel Hemingway, the granddaughter to literary legend Ernest Hemingway, had written a new book where she describes overcoming the legacy of mental illness, addiction, and suicide in her family . Patterns of depression: Her grandfather, Ernest Hemingway killed himself just months before Mariel was born . Out Came The Sun, aimed at adults, and Invisible Girl, written for teens, describes Mariel’s journey of self-discovery and reveals the true stories of the tragedies and troubles of the Hemingway family, which was plagued by mental illness, addiction and suicide. In both books, Hemingway describes her childhood as chaotic. Both of her parents (her father, Jack Hemingway, is the son of Hadley Hemingway – Ernest’s first wife; her mother is Byra Louise Hemingway) were alcoholics, and she recalls their loud fights during which she played the peacemaker and tried to pick up the pieces. She writes about being woken up by yelling, the smashing of plates and wishing it was all a terrible dream. 'I thought all families threw bottles and would yell and scream like that. I didn't know,' Mariel told Metro. She reveals that part of the reason she decided to write two books about her depression was to reach out to a younger audience that isn't normally served. 'My publisher said ""I think we should help young people."" I was so excited because I've always wanted to reach out to that age group, because that was when I was the most scared. That was when life made the least sense to me,' she told Yahoo News. Mariel reveals in candid detail the story of her troubled childhood in a famous family haunted by depression, alcoholism, illness, and suicide. Cursed chain: Mariel with, from left, sisters Muffet and Margaux - once the world's highest paid model - and their father Jack . Difficult childhood: Since her documentary Running From Crazy premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, Hemingway said she has spent much of her time touring the country and telling her story . Nightmare: Mariel, pictured here at about 15, says in her books her parents would drink, fight and then she would be left to clean up the mess each night . Mariel was born in 1961, just a few months after her grandfather, Ernest Hemingway, infamously killed himself with a double-barreled shotgun. The idealized life that the writer was selling to the world, Mariel says, was a coverup for the truth of his self-dramatization and a chronic self-identity crisis, his alcoholism, and his attraction to war. Ernest’s life started to fall apart when he learned his own father had shot himself in the head with a Civil War revolver, according to Mariel. But the family suicides didn't end there. Over the years Mariel's family was said to be cursed. Mariel's elder sister, Margaux,  a beautiful fashion model and actress, also suffered from depression and in 1996 at the age of 42, she died from an overdose of sedatives. Mariel says that both Margaux and another elder sister, Joan were both sexually abused by their father Jack, Ernest's son. However, says she escaped such sexual abuse . The rest of her family, she says, was riddled with alcoholism and arguing. Seminal writer: Mariel's father Jack had a strange relationship with his own father, Ernest Hemingway (pictured), says the actress . Massive blow: Mariel's (pictured in Cannes in 1979) success eclipsed that of Margaux when she followed her sister into an acting career . Sisters:  Mariel Hemingway, 14, with her sister Margaux Hemingway in New York in 1976. She tragically took her own life 20 years later after suffering from depression . Mission: Mariel's mission as a young girl was to escape the desperate cycles of severe mental health issues that had plagued generations of her family. Here she is pictured in 1983 in the film Star 80 . Her younger sister, Muffet, a heavy drug used in her teens, was schizophrenic, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and spent years in mental hospitals. As if that wasn't enough, her mother had cancer (and later died from a drug overdose) and four other members of her family all committed suicide. it became Mariel's mission as a girl to escape the desperate cycles of severe mental health issues that had plagued generations of her family. It meant Mariel, as the youngest member of her family, faced a painful struggle to stay sane. In 2013 Mariel wrote a documentary two years ago called Running From Crazy. It was the first time she had begun to tell her story. She began to speak in front of groups and realized how very similar other people's tales were to her own. 'We just have variations on a theme. We all have something that's affected us in a way that's made us sad or confused us as kids. I'm starting to come to the realization that my purpose is to help other people be OK with the idea that we're not perfect, we're not all balanced, we're not all happy, shiny people all the time,' she told Yahoo News. She found unusual ways to cope with the struggle and became OCD and obsessive about her food, schedule, and organization she reveals in her memoir. 'I have a family of addicts. Everybody was addicted to something. When my mother got sick, I started to think that food had something to do with it. I became so obsessed with ways of eating — whether it was macrobiotic, vegan, fruitarian or drinking coffee all the time — such extremes. I turned it into a positive, but it took me a lot of years. I was obsessed because that was my addiction. That was what I did to deal with whatever I couldn't handle emotionally,' she says.. Partly to cope, Mariel ventured into acting. 'Part of why I liked making movies so much is that I would make families out of the whole set,' she says. 'It was a way to avoid worrying about my own family.' In the memoir she also talks about filming Manhattan with Woody Allen. She says Allen showed romantic interest in her which made her uncomfortable, according to FOX News. May-December: In her new memoir, Mariel Hemingway says Woody Allen asked her to go to Paris with her after filming 'Manhattan' in 1979. She was just 16 years old when the film was shot - to Allen's 43. Above, a still from the film in which Hemingway plays Allen's schoolgirl romance . Adult themes: Woody Allen and Mariel Hemingway on the set of Manhattan. At the time of filming, she had no idea how risque the material was and it wasn't until she saw the finished film she became aware . After wrapping filming on the 1979 movie, Mariel says then 43-year-old Allen flew out to her parent's home in Idaho for a visit, during which he asked her to go to Paris with him. 'Our relationship was platonic, but I started to see that he had a kind of crush on me, though I dismissed it as the kind of thing that seemed to happen any time middle-aged men got around young women,' Mariel wrote. A teenager at the the time, she told her parents that she 'didn't know what the arrangement was going to be' and 'wasn't sure' if she was going to have her own room. 'Woody hadn't said that. He hadn't even hinted it,' Mariel remembers. 'But I wanted them to put their foot down. They didn't. They kept lightly encouraging me.' On the up: Marial Hemingway has been romantically linked with former stuntman Bobby Williams, with whom she has co-authored several self-help books . These days, Mariel practices yoga and is hoping her books on depression will help thousands with the condition . Mariel recalls waking up in the middle of the night 'with the certain knowledge that I was an idiot'. She then went to Allen's guest room, shook him awake and asked: 'I'm not going to get my room am I?' While he fumbled to put on his glasses, Hemingway made up her mind before he could even respond. 'I can't go to Paris with you,' she said. The next morning, Allen ordered a private jet and left the family's ranch. Mariel picked up an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the role. Although the twisted legacy of her family will never quite leave Mariel, in her two memoirs she is able to open up about her claustrophobic first marriage to Steve Crisman, her acting career, and turning to spiritual healers and charlatans for solace. Now desperate to escape the cycles of severe mental health issues that have plagued the Hemingways, Mariel has remained strong and committed to a healthy life, learning how to overcome the family demons. Mariel has two daughters, Dree, a successful model and Langley, an artist, and has found love with her partner, Bobby Williams.","The actress and granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway describes what it was like for her growing up .

"A New York teacher fired after allegedly encouraging pupils to bully a 13-year-old girl by writing down her worst qualities on the blackboard has said she is the victim of a terrible 'injustice' - and wants her job back. Madeline Luciano is said to have looked on as eighth grade pupils at PS 18, in Manhattan, wrote words like 'ugly', 'annoying' and 'phony' on the board to describe their classmate. It only stopped when the girl started crying. Sacked: Madeline Luciano, pictured, was fired after she allegedly allowed pupils to write nasty words about one of their classmates on the board . But Ms Luciano - who was fired following an investigation - claims far from encouraging them to bully the girl, the exercise was supposed to teach them they should be kinder to each other. The 40-year-old has now launched court action against the city's education department as she attempts to get her licence back so she can work in another school. Ms Luciano told the New York Daily News: 'I want justice. I was just trying to stop the bullying. This is insane. I don’t deserve this.' The investigation into the incident, which took place last June, revealed how the girl had been targeted by bullies many times before. On this particular day, they had hidden her book bag. 'Injustice': Ms Luciano claims she was actually trying to teach a lesson about the evils of bullying . Ms Luciano then asked the students to write down any problems they had with the girl - and it ended with pupils shouting insults across the classroom and them being written on the board. But the teacher, who has worked for New York's education department since 2010, says things were never meant to go so far - and she told off the teen writing the nasty comments on the board. 'I had some very challenging eighth-grade students. I tried many different strategies to modify their behavior,' Ms Luciano told the New York Post.","Madeline Luciano was fired after an investigation into the incident last June .

"An 18-year-old man has been charged with conspiring to commit terrorist acts following Saturday morning's counter-terror police raids, in which police seized a number of knives and swords. Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court. He did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody for a filing hearing on April 24. Mr Besim is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony following the raids. Scroll down for video . Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon . Multiple photos of Mr Besim on his social media pages show him posing with one raised index finger, a symbol that other ISIS supporters have also frequently used . Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said the 18-year-old men, from Hallam and Hampton Park, were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider, the 18-year-old who was shot dead after stabbing two officers outside a Melbourne police station on September 23. He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) The second teenager is still being interviewed by police who plan to charge him with a number of offences related to preparing for and planning terrorist acts and possessing prohibited items. A number of 'edged weapons' - including knives and swords - were seized at some of the properties searched. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews dubbed the plans 'simply evil' on Saturday morning, while insisting the individuals 'do not represent any faith, culture or religion'. 'It is alleged both men were undertaking preparations for a terrorist attack at an Anzac Day activity in Melbourne which included targeting police officers,' Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Neil Gaughan said on Saturday morning. Commissioner Patton later added that: 'some evidence that was collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have, leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired.' A total of five teenagers were arrested as part of the Melbourne Joint Counter Terrorism Team operation named Operation Rising, which saw 200 officers' raid seven properties on Saturday morning. Three of the men were released by Victoria Police on Saturday evening. However, according to Australian Federal Police Acting Commissioner Michael Phelan, all five had been on the radar of counter-terrorism investigators. 'Particularly since late last month the investigation ramped up and it became very obvious to us that their plans were specific,' he told reporters in Sydney. 'We received information earlier this week that led us to undertake the resolution today,' Mr Patton said, adding that investigations had begun last month.

Pictured: one of the homes in the suburb where police made one of several arrest during terror raids . One 18-year-old man from Narre Warren was charged with weapon offences, while the two others men from the same suburb, aged 18 and 19, are currently in custody assisting police with enquiries (stock image) It is understood police chose to execute the search warrants immediately as they 'couldn't be sure that they [the arrested men] wouldn't act earlier'. An 18-year-old man from Narre Warren was also arrested and charged with weapon offences, while two other men from the same suburb, aged 18 and 19, are currently in custody assisting police with enquiries. 'I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of these men, this issue is not just for law enforcements agencies, but the broader community,' Mr Patton added.

Searches will continue at several addresses throughout Saturday. Police said the investigations are ongoing. Residents living next door to the homes that were raided in the early hours of the morning have described waking to glass smashing, screams and 'fire-cracker like' noises before seeing lights. 'It woke me up, I heard a whole heap of screaming outside. It kept going for at least 20 minutes. It scared the crap out of me,' one neighbour told the Herald Sun. 'I was woken up through hearing the car doors everywhere and the police telling them to get down,' another said. Most of the residents said they were shocked by the news of the arrests, describing the teenagers as 'lovely guys', 'nice people' and 'the perfect neighbours'.

'It goes to the extremes - no food being eaten, prescription dietary pills, agents telling girls that they’re only allowed to have one cracker and a couple glasses of water leading up to fashion week per day,' Wells told Australian Women's Weekly. The model believed this was not healthy and also took a toll on their mental health as well. 'These girls are going to the extremes to look like that and not being booked for any jobs and they're living with a plus-sized model who's working every single day, and comparing themselves to me who's eating really healthy,' she said. In the interview with the magazine, Wells also revealed she was very resistant to taking up a career as a fashion model.

"Ed Balls (pictured) said he would not allow Nicola Sturgeon's party to insist on a deal that would see Scotland benefit at the expense of England . Ed Balls has ruled out any post-election pact with the SNP that would put Scotland ahead of England - insisting it would be a 'betrayal of the English vote.' The shadow chancellor said he was 'unequivocal' that he would not allow Nicola Sturgeon's party to dictate a deal at England's expense. Ed Miliband has insisted Labour will not form a coalition with the SNP but has so far stopped short of dismissing a looser arrangement that could prop up a Labour administration. Mr Balls told Wolverhampton's Express and Star newspaper: 'On the SNP point, there is absolutely no possibility of any vote being put to parliament or any budget measure in a Labour budget which would in any way disadvantage the West Midlands or any other part of England, because that's what the SNP demand. 'No way. Unequivocal. I'm not going to do it and Labour won't do it. We've been very clear we won't have a coalition with the SNP and the reason is that the SNP - they can't stand up for the interests of people in England because they want to break up the UK.' He went on: 'Now, we will put a vote to parliament to abolish the bedroom tax. I want a Labour majority to get that through. If the SNP decided to vote against it, that's up to them. 'But the idea that we would ever be in a position where the SNP come along and say, ""we want you to advantage Scotland against the West Midlands in return - in order to win our support"", that would be a betrayal of these constituencies here in the Black Country and the West Midlands, it would be a betrayal of the English vote and we will not do it. Unequivocal.' Yesterday, it was revealed that more than half of Scots plan to back the SNP in the general election, shattering Ed Miliband's hopes of securing a Labour majority. Nicola Sturgeon has been buoyed by a series of TV debates opposing austerity cuts, despite threatening another referendum on independence. A  TNS survey shows the SNP has almost doubled its lead over Labour in a month, with 52 per cent now backing Ms Sturgeon with only 24 per cent of Scots planning to vote for Mr Miliband. The Scottish nationalists’ surge in the polls comes amid signs of a split between Labour leadership in London and Jim Murphy, the Labour leader in Scotland. Mr Murphy has suggested that the party would not need to make ‘further cuts to achieve our spending rules’ in the next parliament. But yesterday Chuka Umunna, Labour’s business spokesman, slapped him down; telling the BBC’s Daily Politics programme that cuts would have to be made throughout the life of the new parliament.

Ms Sturgeon has offered to work with Labour to lock the Tories out of power, even if David Cameron wins more seats on May 7. But Labour and the SNP have clashed on Ms Sturgeon's call for full fiscal autonomy for Scotland, and her suggestion that another referendum could be held before 2020. In March, Mr Miliband flatly ruled out going into coalition with the SNP as he attempted to draw a line under weeks of Tory jibes. The Labour leader insisted there would be no power-sharing deal with Nicola Sturgeon's party and he would not lead a government that included SNP ministers. However, he stopped short of dismissing a looser arrangement that could prop up a Labour administration, such as the 'confidence and supply' agreement. This would essentially see Scottish MPs supporting Labour by helping to get legislation through the Commons.","Ed Balls rules out any SNP pact benefiting Scotland at England's expense .

"Outspoken weight loss expert Steve Miller is on a mission to tackle Britain’s obesity crisis and has put forward a strict five-point plan he thinks will work wonders. The former Fat Families star is an advocate of constructive fat shaming and believes we need to get tougher on the overweight population. Some of his somewhat controversial demands include obesity wardens in the street, fat warning signs outside fast food restaurants and Steve moving in with public role models who are overweight. An outspoken weight loss expert, Steve Miller, has devised a five-point plan he is convinced will help tackle Britain's obesity crisis . Steve claims that these interventions could save the country and the NHS millions. He said: 'The financial burden obesity has placed on the UK’s economy is astronomical, it cost the nation nearly £47bn in 2014 alone. 'I am sick and tired of the weak measures in place that are clearly failing to tackle this nationwide health issue. 'It’s obvious that drastic steps need to taken in order to take fat seriously. I don’t care if my views make me unpopular, as long as they make people sit up and listen.' The five simple steps that Steve is pledging are as follows: . 1. Getting fat celebrities to lose weight . Steve believes that overweight celebrities and public figures are promoting an unhealthy body image and are bad role models. He is offering to move in with people he deems overweight to help motivate them to lose weight and get them in the right mindset. Steve claims that these interventions, including obesity wardens in the street, fat warning signs outside fast food restaurants and Steve moving in with public role models who are overweight, could save the country and the NHS millions . 2. Fast food warning signs . Steve claims weight loss is all about control and currently the temptation to pig out is always there with no restrictions. He believes by installing fat warning signs outside fast food joints, there is a concrete health warning for those who are overweight, which should make them think twice before tucking into a burger and fries. Steve claims weight loss is all about control and currently the temptation to pig out is always there with no restrictions . 3. Obesity wardens . Under Steve’s plan, these would be Government-employed individuals who could speak on the street to fat people and openly to encourage them to lose weight. Sometimes it takes someone else to tell you to take action before you see what a huge problem being overweight is and from Steve’s experience, he is convinced constructive fat shaming works. 4. Payments for two seats on a plane and cinemas . According to Steve, double payment for plane seats is another way of constructively fat shaming. He believes airlines, cinemas, and theatres should all have scales and if you are over the maximum weight for your height, you should pay to cover two seats. Staff would reserve the right to weigh the customer upon arrival if they believe the customer is too fat for one seat. 5. Heart attack photos on foods that are obviously very calorific. Steve believes the Department of Health needs to get tough. He claims they have no qualms about using shock tactics with other serious health issues - such as the graphic images on cigarette packaging - and says they need to treat obesity as seriously. Steve’s calling for photos of clogged arteries and other graphic content to be put on foods with high calorie content as a public health warning.","Steve Miller is on a mission to tackle Britain’s obesity crisis .

"Eight San Francisco police officers accused of sending racist and homophobic text messages have been suspended, and the police chief is recommending that the veteran employees be sacked. Chief Greg Suhr announced in a statement Friday that he has asked a police oversight committee to approve firing the officers . He called the texts 'despicable' and says those who sent them 'clearly fall below the minimum standards required to be a police officer.' Authorities say that the offensive texts targeting blacks, Mexicans, Filipinos and gay men, which make repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs, were sent between 2011 and 2012. San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr (pictured) said that eight officers had been suspended and that he had recommended they be fired . Texts between San Francisco Police Department officers included racist, sexist and homophobic messages . Suhr says six others will face disciplinary actions that include reassignment to positions that don't have contact with the public. The messages were discovered by federal authorities investigating former sergeant Ian Furminger, who was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 41 months in prison. 'All n*****s must f*****g hang' and 'N*****s must be spayed' were among the texts uncovered. 'It's not against the law to put an animal down,' an officer said, referring to a black man in Furminger's house. Other texts were offensive to women and repeatedly used the word f**. The eight officers include Captain Jason Fox, 42, a two decade veteran and Sergeant Michael Wibunsin, a 12-year veteran, according to the San Francisco Chronicle's sources. Officers identified as Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year-veteran, Noel Schwab, 49, a 16-year-veteran and Michael Celis, who has been on the force for 16 years, have reportedly already resigned or said they will resign. Sean Doherty, an 11-year veteran and Rain Daugherty, a 15-year-officer, are also facing termination. Robison, Schwab and Celis have reportedly already resigned. Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year veteran of the force, has resigned. He gave an interview to the Advocate in 1999 (pictured) about being a gay officer. He said 'the ""good ol' boys"" system is on its way out' The offensive text messages were uncovered after federal corruption charges were brought against former SFPD sergeant Ian Furminger, who was sentenced to 41 months in prison last month . The eighth officer has not yet been identified, and was not aware about possible dismissal as of Friday. Robison is openly gay and told the LGBT magazine The Advocate in 1998: 'The ""good ol' boys"" system is on its way out, and the newer generation that's replaced them sees things from a more open-minded standpoint' He was accused of using a racial epithet against a suspect in the mid 1990s but the allegation was dismissed. In 2007 an officer named Jason Fox was accused of hitting a gay man's head against the wall and using his hair to clean up urine on the street outside a club. 'Do you think we want your AIDS-infected pee on our streets?’ Fox allegedly said. He  did not face police department discipline in the case because the statute of limitations had passed. Police commissioners at the time reached a $83,000 out of court settlement with the gay man. The SFPD did not respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online about whether the incident involved the same Jason Fox accused in the text message scandal. San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi said that more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified will need to be reviewed . Minutes from a San Francisco Family Violence Council meeting show that Fox was promoted from lieutenant to captain in 2013. Celis was suspended in 2004 after an incident when he tried to use his badge and pay a bribe to get into his wife's hotel room. Wibunsin and several other officers were accused of stealing $10,000 while executing a search warrant in 2011. Public Defender Jeff Adachi said he expects more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified to be reviewed. He has called for the Department of Justice to investigate San Francisco's police as it did with officers in Ferguson, Missouri, according to KQED.","Officers suspended by Chief Greg Suhr with recommendation for firing .

The commission said two employees in FLIR's Dubai office gave luxury watches to five officials with the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Interior in 2009.

Investigation: FLIR Systems Inc. has agreed to pay $9.5 million to settle bribery charges filed by the SEC that involved expensive trips and gifts given to Middle Eastern government officials . 'FLIR's deficient financial controls failed to identify and stop the activities of employees who served as de facto travel agents for influential foreign officials to travel around the world on the company's dime,' said Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act unit. The SEC said in a news release that FLIR reported the misconduct and cooperated with the investigation. Officials with the Wilsonville-based company echoed those remarks. 'The actions of the former employees involved do not reflect the values of FLIR or the high standards to which we hold ourselves accountable,' FLIR CEO Andy Teich said in a statement.

FLIR got a multimillion-dollar contract to provide thermal binoculars to the Saudi government in November 2008.  Timms and Ramahi were responsible for the contract. They also negotiated sales of FLIR's security cameras to the same government officials. The SEC said Timms and Ramahi had Foreign Corrupt Practices Act training and were specifically told that luxury watches and vacations were prohibited gifts. The men falsified records in an attempt to conceal their behavior, the SEC found. Besides paying $9.5 million, FLIR must report to the SEC on its efforts to comply with the corrupt practices law for two years.","FLIR Systems Inc. has agreed to pay $9.5 million to settle bribery charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission .

"A family was awarded the rights to 10 rare gold coins possibly worth $80 million or more on Friday after a US appeals court overturned a jury verdict. US Department of the Treasury officials insist the $20 Double Eagles were stolen from the US Mint in Philadelphia before the 1933 series was melted down when the country went off the gold standard. They argued that Joan Langbord and her sons cannot lawfully own the coins, which she said she found in a family bank deposit box in 2003. Scroll down for video . Ten 1933 Double Eagle coins, which were almost all destroyed when the US went off the gold standard, have been given back to the Langbord family after a length legal dispute with the government . The family found the valuables in a bank deposit box for Joan Langbord's father Israel Switt, a Philadelphia jeweler (left, in 1944). The government believed that Switt stole the coins from a mint in 1933 . Langbord's father, jeweler Israel Switt, had dealings with the Mint in the 1930s and was twice investigated over his coin holdings. A jury in 2012 sided with the government. However, the appeals court returned the coins to the Langbords because US officials had not responded within a 90-day limit to the family's seized-property claim, filed in about 2004. Family lawyer Barry Berke said: 'Congress clearly intended for there to be limits on the government's ability to seek forfeiture of citizens' property, and today's ruling reaffirms that those limits are real and won't be excused when the government violates them.' Langbord, who's in her mid-80s, worked in her father's store on Jeweler's Row for most of her life. Her sons, entertainment lawyer Roy Langbord, of New York City, and David Langbord, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, joined her in the legal fight. Nearly half a million of the coins were minted in 1933, though almost all were melted and a surviving coin sold for $7.6million in 2002 . The coins were never released to the public after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt switched the US off the gold standard . They do not plan to comment on the ruling and have not decided whether the coins will be sold, Berke said. Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens designed the Double Eagle with a flying eagle on one side and a figure representing liberty on the other. One Double Eagle, once owned by King Farouk of Egypt, sold in 2002 for $7.6 million, then a record for a coin. Its later owner, a London coin dealer once jailed by the US over it, split the proceeds with the US in a deal brokered by Berke. The Langbords offered the government a similar split but were rebuffed. The family had taken the coins to the Secret Service in Philadelphia to have them examined, Berke said. A coin that was that was once owned by King Farouk of Egypt (left) fetched millions thirteen years ago. The Langbords brought their coins into the government for authentication, but the valuables were seized . 'They authenticated the coins and said, 'Thank you very much. We will now be keeping them,'' he said. The Mint struck nearly a half-million of the Double Eagles in Philadelphia in 1933 but never released them after President Franklin D. Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard and prohibited using the gold coins as currency. The money makers in Philadelphia sent all of their gold coins to be melted in 1937, according to Bloomberg. The . 1933 'Double Eagle' was dreamed up by President Roosevelt’s distant . cousin,Theodore, who had commissioned the sculptor Augustus . Saint-Gaudens to re-design the $20 gold coin in the early 1900s. Teddy Roosevelt wanted an American coin that matched the beauty of the ancient Greek ones. The last run of nearly 500,000 coins were never released, and it was thought they were all melted down for scrap. In industry speak, an 'eagle' is $10, hence the term 'double eagle' for the $20 1933 examples. While prosecutors argued to jurors in 2011 that Switt must have stolen the coins with help from a Mint insider, Berke said he could have traded his scrap gold for them. Alison Frankel, a journalist who wrote a history of the 1933 Double Eagles, told the New York Times that Berke had an 'amazing accomplishment' by making the government prove that no coins could have possible gotten out of the mint legally. She said that the government attorneys decided not to prosecute Switt when they learned about his possible involvement in the 1940s because the statute of limitations had passed. Robert W Hoge, curator of North American coins and currency at the American Numismatic Society, said that federal authorities had been 'fanatical' about finding the existing coins. The US Department of Justice said it was reviewing its options after Friday's ruling. A Treasury spokeswoman had no comment. Switt, who died in 1990, admitted to the Secret Service in 1944 that he had possessed and sold a set of nine other Double Eagles, which were recovered and destroyed. The surviving Farouk coin is believed to have been a 10th coin from that batch. The Mint sent a pair of 1933 Double Eagles to the Smithsonian Institution for its US coin collection.","Joan Langbord, in her mid-80s, and sons win back ten 1933 Double Eagles .

"Many teenagers are tempted to try e-cigarettes, but few adopt the electronic devices as habit, a new study has found . Many teenagers are tempted to try e-cigarettes, but few become regular users, scientists have discovered. In fact, they found most of those teens who do try e-cigarettes are also smokers. This suggests young people are not using the electronic alternatives to try and quit their habits - nor are they  getting hooked on them after initially trying them. Researchers examined data from two nationally representative surveys of primary and secondary schoolchildren from more than 150 schools across Wales. In all, 1,601 children aged 10 to 11 and 9,055 children aged 11 to 16 were quizzed about their use of e-cigarettes. Experts at Cardiff University found use of e-cigarettes at least once was more common than having smoked a conventional cigarette in all age groups, bar the oldest (15 to 16 year olds). Almost six per cent of 10 to 11 year olds had tried e-cigarettes, far more than had been tempted by tobacco (1.6 per cent). Meanwhile, 12 per cent of 11 to 16 year olds said they had used e-cigarettes, irrespective of gender, ethnic background, or family affluence. This is in contrast with the pattern seen in smokers, where all these factors come into play. The researchers said it suggests e-cigarettes may have a wider appeal across all sectors of the teenage population. The proportion of teens who used e-cigarettes, but who had never smoked, rose from 5 per cent among 10 to 11 year olds, to eight per cent among 15 to 16 year olds. But only 1.5 per cent of those aged 11 to 16 said they regularly used the electronic devices - defined as at least once a month. The researchers note their findings suggest 'e-cigarettes are unlikely to make a major, direct contribution to adolescent nicotine addiction at present'. They note the World Health Organisation recognise there is little evidence as to whether e-cigarettes may or may not act as a gateway to conventional smoking. The odds of regular e-cigarette use were 100 times higher among current weekly smokers than among non-smokers, and 50 times higher among those who had smoked cannabis . The strong link between current smoking and e-cigarette use suggests that teens are not using these products to help them quit smoking, the researchers said. They admit that a lack of consensus about what constitutes ‘use’ of an e-cigarette presents something of a challenge for research in this area, and suggest that further much longer term studies to include the generation of young people who have grown up with e-cigarettes are needed before firmer conclusions can be drawn. The Cardiff University study noted most of those teens who do try e-cigarettes are also smokers, suggesting they are not using the electronic alternatives to try and quit their habits . Professor Peter Hajek, director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit, at Queen Mary University of London, said: 'The results of this large survey tally with all other available data and the picture is consistently reassuring. 'E-cigarettes do not attract non-smokers.' Professor Paul Aveyard, at the University of Oxford, said: 'This study shows that teenagers do what teenagers do: they experiment with smoking and nowadays also with e-cigarettes. 'Consequently some people who have never tried tobacco cigarettes try e-cigarettes but only a few use them at least monthly, suggesting they are unattractive to people who do not smoke. 'About a fifth of regular smokers are using e-cigarettes, which is not a concern because e-cigarettes are less likely to harm users than are tobacco cigarettes. 'It does not show us anything about whether e-cigarettes help teenagers quit. It is hard to measure rare events but this survey was large enough to be sure that fewer than one in 200 never-smokers used an e-cigarette at least once a month.' The study was published in BMJ Open.","Cardiff University scientists found few teenagers become regular users .

"A Roman Catholic school attended by Nick Clegg’s eldest son and two of Tony Blair’s has been cleared of discriminating against the poor. The Office of the Schools Adjudicator criticised the Oratory School in London for engaging in ‘social selection’, saying it had broken the rules in 105 different ways. The state-funded school in Fulham, West London, was ordered to revise its admissions policy last year after the watchdog decided it was biased against working-class and non-Catholic children. The Oratory School in London was cleared of discriminating against the poor and non-Catholic children . The watchdog accused the school of cherry-picking privileged white children using its strict faith-based entry requirements. But yesterday, this was overturned by a High Court judge who said this decision was ‘flawed’ and ‘unreasonable’. Mr Justice Cobb said: ‘The adjudicator’s conclusion that the governing body of the school had operated an admissions system which was socially selective, discriminatory, and unfairly disadvantageous to children from less well-off families was flawed and was reached by a process which was procedurally unfair to the school.’ The original case followed a complaint by the British Humanist Association in the spring of 2013. The school, founded in 1863, has prioritised pupils based on whether they sing in the choir, arrange flowers in church, serve at the altar or assist in pastoral work. In its ruling, the watchdog said the school must not grant places ‘on the basis of any practical or financial support parents may give to the school’ - nor should children be favoured on the basis of their hobbies and activities. It said the ratio of children receiving free school meals - used as an indicator of poverty - was only 6-7 per cent compared with the local average of 25.1 per cent. Mr Clegg’s eldest son Antonio, 12, attends, while Mr Blair sent his two eldest sons, Nicky and Euan, to the school with daughter Kathryn believed to have joined in the sixth form. The boys’ school, which admits girls to the sixth form, also counts deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman among its alumni. A High Court Judge branded the decision by the watchdog 'flawed' It is one of the most popular in the country and is always oversubscribed. In a reserved judgment after a hearing last month Mr Justice Cobb ordered the adjudicator to think again after remitting the case to be heard by a fresh adjudicator. He said: ‘I am satisfied that the adjudicator reaches this conclusion by a mix of flawed reasoning and unfair process. In the circumstances I am satisfied that this finding must be quashed.’ He ordered the adjudicator to pay 80 per cent of the school’s £155,000 costs with £60,000 on account. Ane Vernon, solicitor for the school, said: ‘The allegation that the school was socially selective and discriminating against less well-off families has been hurtful to staff, pupils and parents. ‘This damaging allegation has been found by the judge to be wrong and unfair, and the finding vindicates the robust approach the school has had to take against the Office of the Schools Adjudicator.’ Headmaster David McFadden added: ‘The judge’s decision supports us in continuing to preserve the school’s ethos and serving Catholic families throughout the whole of London. ‘It is profoundly regrettable that the school - and other schools - have to expend precious resources, year after year, in standing up to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator. ‘These are key resources that should go to our children’s education and their future, not overturning ultimately flawed and unmeritorious decisions. Schools within the state sector have serious questions to ask about the adjudication process.’ The judge said he feared his conclusions would not bring an end to investigations into the school which had been going on for ‘far too long.’ London Oratory was rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and has some of the best results in the country. The case comes after a group of secular vicars and laypeople wrote an open letter calling for all Church of England schools to stop admissions based on faith criteria. Church groups have complained that a ‘secular agenda’ is increasingly being imposed on faith schools which aim to uphold their traditional beliefs.","The Oratory School was ordered to revise its admissions policy last year .

"An NFL defensive back with a history of legal problems is being investigated after reports of an early-morning incident involving a physical fight and at least one shot being fired at a Texas club. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother are being investigated for aggravated assault after an altercation at a Dallas-area nightclub on Wednesday morning, according to reports. During a 2011 incident involving two guns when he playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Talib and his mother were accused of shooting a gun at his sister's live-in boyfriend in Garland, Texas. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother Yaqub are being investigated for aggravated assault . Talib was in trouble before and was wanted on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2011 . During the latest incident, a shot was fired outside of Club Luxx in Dallas, Texas, after a physical fight inside . During the incident on Wednesday, Talib and his brother Yaqub had a physical altercation with someone inside Club Luxx and then a shot was fired outside around 2am, WFAA reported. When Dallas officers responded to the active shooter call, the man who called police said three black men had been involved in a disturbance and one of them had tried to punch him. The man also said one of the men pulled out a gun and aimed it at him before firing a round off into the sky outside the bar and causing 'an immediate panic'. The Talibs left the area in a Range Rover and a Jaguar and went to the XTC Cabaret. Police found the brothers at the second club and impounded the vehicles to look for evidence. The brothers were both questioned and an investigation into the incident is ongoing. The general manager of Club Luxx, confirmed the Talibs were at the club but denied that anything with a gun transpired, the Dallas Morning News reported. Hanney Kamal said: 'One-hundred percent that did not happen. 'I was there. Somebody might have called the police because there was a yelling argument. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract last year . 'It's athletes — someone sees them yelling and dials 911. 'Everyone was asked to leave the club, which they did of their own free will, and that was it.' Broncos vice president of public relations Patrick Smyth said: 'We have been in touch with Aqib regarding these reports and will continue to monitor this situation.' Dallas police falsely reported Talib had been arrested for throwing bottles last June during an NFL camp afterparty, the Denver Post reported. The police apologized after it ended up being Yaqub who was arrested. During the 2011 incident in Garland, felony warrants were issued for Talib and his mother Okolo Talib on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police suspected them both of firing shots from a Ruger .380 handgun at Shannon Billings, the boyfriend of Talib's sister, and also believed the NFL back attempted to pistol-whip Billings with a Springfield 9mm semiautomatic handgun during the incident, the Boston Globe reported. They had apparently learned Billings was being physically abusive towards their family member. Talib, who owned both weapons. reportedly yelled during the pistol-whipping: 'You're going to make me throw away my career.' The charges were dropped because prosecutors believed Billings, a registered sex offender with the state of Texas, would not make a credible witness. Garland Police spokesman Joe Harn said: 'It was very fortunate no one was killed and no one was hurt seriously. 'There wasn't a great deal of distance from one person to the other that was shooting.' After the 2011 incident, a felony warrant was issued for  Okolo Talib for an assault with a deadly weapon charge . In addition to playing for the Broncos, Talib has also played for the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Bucs . In addition to the gun incidents, Talib was investigated after an alleged assault on a Florida cab driver. He then resisted arrest on charges of simple battery. The shutdown corner also fought with teammates and was suspended for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract with Denver in March 2014. He also has played for the New England Patriots during his seven-year career. During his time with the reigning Super Bowl champs, Talib said: 'I'm a competitor on the field, man. 'That's kind of what we're talking about right now, just football.' If charges are brought with regard to the incident in Dallas, Talib could face discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy and a suspension seems possible given his history.

"Sweet life: The Duchess of Cornwall . The Duchess of Cornwall has created a buzz with the launch of her own honey, produced in late spring by the bees in her Wiltshire garden. Just 250 jars are being produced, at £20 each, with all proceeds going to charity. But Camilla’s venture reflects a rocketing demand for gourmet honey. Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year. Does luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though? And how does Camilla’s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals — including her husband’s Duchy brand? We tested the best-selling gourmet honeys to find out... Duchess of Cornwall Honey . £20 for 227g, Fortnum & Mason . PROMISE: The Duchess’s late-spring honey is made from ‘delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile’ and billed as ‘the ideal accompaniment to ice cream on hot summer days, or for sweetening tea’. All proceeds go to the Medical Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron. VERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it’s impossible to stop eating. Delicate, delicious and the perfect gift for any honey-lover. A royal winner. 5/5 . Royal winner: Camilla’s honey is made from ‘delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile' Duchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey . £5.10 for 227g, Waitrose . PROMISE: Heathers growing on the Crown Estate in Balmoral produce the nectar for this honey. Beekeepers prize heather honey for its unique taste, and this is a combination of two types of heather, Bell and Ling. VERDICT: Open the jar and just smell the heather aroma before you taste this golden delight. Camilla may have set the bar high but Prince Charles’s answer is also rather beautiful and rare. It has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste. 3/5 . Duchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste . Wedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey . £14.95 for 325g, wedderspoon.co.uk . PROMISE: Wild Rata trees grow on high land in New Zealand. They flower sporadically, so the nectar is extremely rare. The honey is kept at a low temperature — the same as that of a beehive — to preserve natural enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. VERDICT: Did you ever think honey could taste like a Christmas tree? Take one gulp of this delicious amber nectar and, seconds later, a subtle taste of pines will dance on your tongue. This creamy, firm-set honey scooped a place in the top 50 products (out of 10,000) in the ‘food Oscars’, the Great Taste Awards. Now I’ve tried it, that comes as no surprise. 4/5 . Wedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey scooped a place in the top 50 products in the ‘food Oscars’ Tregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka . £29.95 for 113g, tregothnan.co.uk . PROMISE: Although manuka is generally expensive, this is a more normal-tasting version and Britain’s costliest home-grown honey. Most manuka plants grow in New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880. Bees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost £5,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag. VERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans. The jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it. A treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. 4/5 . Tregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every spoonful is pricey . Vasilissa Greek Honey with Edible Gold Leaf . £39.99 for 250g, selfridges.co.uk . PROMISE: Produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of Evia, this honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling. The small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom, infusing it with the flavour of the herb. Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods. VERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don’t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight. The beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume. Inside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5 . Vasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling . Alemany Rosemary Honey . £7.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk . PROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations. The nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation. VERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It’s very mild — there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls. It does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby’s favourite honey — she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5 . Alemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains . Welsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora . £21 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason . PROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales. VERDICT: This looks impressive — a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel. The Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax. The chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out — as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn’t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5 . Heather Honeycomb Starflower Honey . £19.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk . PROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour. VERDICT: You can’t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn’t transparent. I’ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again. It crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5 . Heather Honeycomb Starflower Honey crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside . Chestnut Honey . £6.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk . PROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes. VERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn’t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5 .

"A Lithuanian gangster accused of two murders in his home country has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in a deportation farce after claiming he was too depressed to leave Britain. Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his ‘manifestly ill-founded’ case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the £40,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: ‘This is a shocking example of Labour’s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.’ Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius’s claim that extradition breached his human rights was ‘inadmissible’. They added: ‘The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.’","Gangster Kestutis Martuzevicius accused of two murders in home country .

"Dog walkers have been warned about deliberate attempts to kill their animals after cocktail sausages laced with poison were found at a popular walking spot. A clutch of sausages stuffed with poisons were found on the Cuckoo Trail, a path running from Hampden Park to Heathfield near Hailsham. The grim discovery comes after a spate of dog poisonings in nearby Brighton and Hove, and dog owners are now being warned by Sussex Police to be aware when they are out walking their animals. A man out walking his dog found a clutch of cocktail sausages with poisonous pellets inserted into them . The cocktail sausages were so densely packed with the poison that eating just one could have killed a dog. They were found hidden among grass on the trail. Photos of the Cuckoo Trail sausages were posted on the Doggy Style pet service page. The post said 'Walking along the Cuckoo trail in Hailsham at approximately 6pm this evening, I have found a quantity of cocktail sausages that appear to have a as of yet an unknown substance deliberately inserted into them. 'So this post is hopefully to help make other owners aware of the possible dangers. The sausages were loaded with the poison (left) and found hidden among the grass (right) on the trail . 'Thankfully I have a search dog that is able to indicate if something doesn't smell right, but please watch any dog off the lead as they were not in eye sight but easily consumed and in multiple places along the trail. 'Hopefully this is the action of some bored mis-guided youth, (which I'm sure this isn't the case!) but personally I find this premeditated, calculated with actions of someone who knows what they are doing.' Dogs that have been poisoned may show the following symptoms; . * Vomiting . * Diarrhoea . * Seizures . * Blood in the stool . * Lethargy . * Loss of appetite . * Bruising . * Nosebleeds . * Discoloured gums . If dogs display any of these symptoms they should be taken to a vet straight away. If possible take the packaging or sample of the poison with you. Do not attempt to medicate dogs yourself, or encourage them to vomit using salt water. If the skin or fur is damaged wash them with a mild shampoo and rinse well with water. Keep poisoned dogs away from other animals to avoid cross contamination.","A dog owner found cocktail sausages laced with poison when walking pet .

"Local police chief Terry Rozema spoke out on Wednesday to defend his officer and argue that deadly force was necessary . An Arizona police chief has voiced his support for his officer after dashcam footage emerged of him mounting a sidewalk in his speeding police car and knocking down an armed suspect. Video of the February 19 incident emerged on Tuesday and shows a cop car running into a suspect walking down a street in Marana, northwest of Tucon, with a rifle. Local police chief Terry Rozema spoke out on Wednesday to defend his officer and argue that deadly force was necessary. Speaking to CNN, Rozema was asked if Officer Michael Rapiejko was fortunate not to kill suspect Mario Valencia, 36. 'That very well may be... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,' Rozema said. 'So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,' the chief added. The footage has further stirred debate about the type of force it is appropiate for police to use. This latest incident following cell phone footage earlier this month capturing South Carolina police officer Michael Slager fatally shotting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away. In this latest video, Valencia is captured walking along a street in Marana, carrying what appears to be a rifle. He points the loaded weapon into the air and a shot rings out. WARNING: GRAPHIC FOOTAGE . Scroll down for videos . Deliberate act: Valencia (pictured, left, in his mug shot) remained in hospital for two days before being booked into jail. Police have since spoken out in defense of Rapiejko's actions in the town of Marana, Arizona . Target: The police officer in the other vehicle warns  Rapiejko that the suspect is loaded and tells him to 'stand off'. But in apparent defiance of his advice, Rapiejo drives straight toward unsuspecting Valencia (pictured) Horrific: Seconds later, Rapiejo's vehicle mounts the curb (pictured) and smashes into the suspect's body . Hit: In this screen grab, from the dashcam video, Valenica appears to turn toward the car as it strikes him . A police officer in one of the patrol cars says: 'One round just went out. He's definitely loaded.' He then tells his colleague, Officer Michael Rapiejko, in the other vehicle: 'Stand off, the gun is loaded.' But apparently ignoring his advice, Rapiejko overtakes the officer's car, before speeding straight toward Valencia. Seconds later, his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect's body. Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris. The other officer can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down.' At the end of the footage, obtained by KOLD, Rapiejko is captured emerging from his vehicle and approaching Valencia, while other cops exit their own cars with their guns raised. Valencia was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility on February 19. He was eventually booked into jail two days later. Pozema argued that Rapiejko may actually have saved Valencia's life because we don't know what he would have done next. Smash: Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall (pictured) before coming to a halt amid debris. The other cop can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down' High-speed: Bits of concrete can be seen sailing through the sky as Rapiejko's patrol car continues traveling . 'We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,' Rozema said. 'And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' ' In February, Sergeant Chris Warren also appeared to support the deliberate crash, telling KOLD that Valencia 'was a dangerous felon who'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning'. This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at Columbus Avenue and 29th Street, vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple, a home invasion and theft of a car. Cracked: Valencia, was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in a serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility on February 19. Above, Rapiejko's car window appears to be cracked . It culminated in the alleged theft of a rifle from Walmart at 8280 North Cortaro Road. From there, the suspect fled to 5650 West Coca Cola Place, where he was struck and injured by Rapiejko's vehicle. 'He'd just stolen a weapon, loaded it, was not obeying commands from officers and walking toward occupied businesses. It's a busy time of morning, a lot of employees at work,' said Sgt Warren. 'We had to take immediate action and make sure he didn't get inside those businesses.' Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash, because it was considered use of force. However, the Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing and he is back on the force, Sgt Warren said. Valencia, meanwhile, is facing several felony charges for his 'spree'. Valencia had already been approached by police near a post office following the alleged Walmart theft, it is reported. There, he had apparently threatened suicide, before firing the gun and fleeing.

"'There's no cafetiere and there's no corkscrew!' Listening to my husband Dominic's rant minutes into our family Eurocamp adventure I was reminded that I'm not married to Bear Grylls. But his gripes were soon drowned out by the whoops of delight from our two young boys as they bounced on the beds… 'bunk beds! In a TENT!' - their tiny heads about to explode in excitement. A full-blown corkscrew crisis was quickly averted as we befriended our better-equipped neighbours and, once the wine was flowing, we were able to take in our surroundings. Jake  and Seb ready for their cave adventure . It's not advertised as 'glamping' but with big duvets and brass beds, Eurocamp's Safari tents are more luxurious than an average stay under canvas. Everything is in situ, so no worrying about whether you've forgotten your tent pegs or frying pan… You just bring yourselves, clothes and food (and in our case, a lot of local wine). We visited L'Ardéchoise site in the stunning Ardèche region in south central France at the end of August. About an hour-and-half's drive from the beaches of the south and Montpellier airport, it's known as the gastronomic centre of France. L'Ardéchoise is a quiet, well-established, family friendly site nestled on the banks of the picturesque Ardeche river. For us, entertaining our boys Jake, six, and Seb, four, is the number one priority on holiday - that and escaping the chaos that is our life in London. This site is a five-star park - at the top end of what's on offer in France. With four pools and a camp 'animateur' organising activities for little ones, it didn't disappoint. The big hit for our boys was the pool complex - it included a waterfall and 'rapids' section that kept them amused for hours. The other attraction was other children's toys, and we spent a great deal of our time returning them to our neighbours' tents to preserve community relations and other parents' sanity. The campsite has immaculate facilities. There are plentiful and clean showers, family washing areas, waist-high baby baths and even a dog shower area. Most important of all, the site felt safe and relaxed. Most parents let their children scoot and cycle around on their own and the little ones loved the freedom. The region is famous for having the world's oldest cave paintings at Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc . For me, getting away from work doesn't mean switching off from the news entirely, and with wi-fi availa-ble across the site and daily English papers, I kept up to date from the comfort of my sunlounger. Jane and her boys were excited when they discovered their tent came with bunk beds . The Eurocamp Safari tents are well equipped (although cafetieres are no longer provided), with adequate cooking facilities, gas barbecues and fridge freezers. Fans and heaters are also provided - which proved useful one chilly evening. There were some jokers on site who referred to our area as the UN enclave, due to the beige 'refugee camp' appearance of our tents. The brown canvas combined with overhanging trees means they are a little gloomy inside. We were also closer to our neighbours than we would have liked (less than 6ft to one side), useful for corkscrews… less so for privacy. That said, we didn't spend that much time in the tent as there is so much to do. Kayaking on the Ardèche is the number one tourist attraction (lower age limit seven). The 20-mile gorge that winds through limestone cliffs is a national nature reserve. My husband and I took turns to brave the rapids that lead you under the awe-inspiring Pont'Arc - a natural arch more than 180ft high. This region is also famous for the world's oldest cave paintings at Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc and there are hundreds of underground grottos. Our boys were captivated by the prospect of caving. Reared on a diet of Enid Blyton, they were concerned about 'smugglers'… but once their hard hats were on they were up for it. We visited Aven-Grotte la Forestière, which is one of the smaller caves in the region but no less spectacular than the big attractions. The nearby village of Labeaume was also a big hit. Clinging to the edge of the gorge, troglodyte dwellings are still in use today and narrow staircases spiral through maze-like alleyways. With four pools and a camp 'animateur' organising activities for little ones, the park didn't disappoint . The campsite has immaculate facilities and feels safe and relaxed so it's perfect for families . At the end of a long day's sightseeing a surprisingly good restaurant on site made life easy on the days we didn't fancy cooking. The evening entertainment was also a bonus. We met many families at L'Ardéchoise who had returned from previous years. For us, duvets and brass beds didn't make up for the fact that we were just a layer of canvas away from another frazzled family, but this was a holiday for the kids.

"Tragedy: Carwyn Scott-Howell fell to his death while on  holiday with his mother Ceri Scott-Howell, nine-year-old sister Antonia and brother Gerwyn, 19, in the Alps . The family of a seven-year-old skier killed in the French Alps have paid tribute to their 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and revealed he got lost in woods before sliding towards a 164ft cliff. It is thought Carwyn Scott-Howell may have entered the dense woodland because he thought it was a shortcut to his hotel in the ski resort of Flaine. He was on holiday with his mother Ceri Scott-Howell, nine-year-old sister Antonia and brother Gerwyn, 19. Carwyn's parents, ex-nurse Mrs Scott-Howell and husband Rhys, a former butcher, rent out self-catering cottages and run a farm. They bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'. Carwyn would help feed cows and pigs on the farm which has won prizes for its speciality sausages and has sold scotch eggs to Prime Minister David Cameron. His family last night said his death had left them feeling 'utter devastation' with a 'vast void in our hearts', adding that he was 'a very competent skier' who had started aged three. A statement released through the Foreign Office  said: 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky'. Last night, the family, from Talybont-on-Usk, near Brecon, Wales, remained in the Alpine resort of Flaine – a 38-mile drive from Chamonix – in free accommodation provided by the hotel. They are expected to leave today. Police sources said the boy's body may be expatriated today after final post-mortem examinations yesterday. The family were enjoying the last run of their trip in perfect conditions in the town of Flaine when Antonia fell over and her mother stopped to help her. Within moments Carwyn, who friends say modelled himself on survival specialist and TV presenter Bear Grylls, is believed to have taken the chance to go skiing in nearby woodland. Trbute: Carwyn Scott-Howell's family called the 'caring' boy 'daring and determined' after he was killed after falling from a cliff while on an Easter skiing trip to the French resort of Flaine . He skied 100 yards off-piste, where trees were just a yard apart. Unable to weave through, he took his skis off and is thought to have started sliding on his bottom or running. Last night, there were reports Carwyn could have been trying to get to his hotel, Les Terrasses d'Eos, which can be seen from the ski slope. He continued 400 yards, until he plunged off the side of the mountain and fell 164ft. It is believed he landed on a rocky ledge. In a statement released to the Foreign Office, his family described Carwyn as a 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and a 'very competent skier and snowboarder'. They said they were enjoying their last ski run together when Carwyn's sister 'lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead'. 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky. 'Carwyn was a very competent skier and snowboarder who had started skiing at the age of three and spent several weeks each year skiing. We had spent the most happy ski holiday together in the French ski resort of Flaine.' The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day on Friday afternoon. 'The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead,' it said. 'The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts. The family would like to thank all their friends and family for their support at this time and the vast help from the British Consulate. 'The family now ask for time to grieve in private.' Scene: Carwyn's family are believed to be staying in this hotel, close to the slopes where the seven-year-old died . Family: The youngster lived on a farm near Brecon, which is well known for its produce. Here Prime Minister David Cameron buys scotch eggs from Carwyn's father Rhys at the Royal Welsh Show last year . After a search spanning two hours, a rescue helicopter spotted Carwyn's body. As the vehicle was unable to land, crews were winched down to reach the boy, who was declared dead at the scene after 7pm. Michel Ollagnon, police commander from nearby Bonneville, said Carwyn was found wearing his glasses, dispelling reports he went into the woods because he did not have them on. Despite initial reports that Carwyn's mother had let him try the last run of the day alone, Mr Ollagnon said: 'In fact…he went up with his mother, sister and brother. 'The sister fell, the mother stopped and the little boy went off…Why he went in that direction, we do not know … One thing is sure, the skis were found quite a way from the cliffside.' Pierre-Yves Michau, the judge heading the investigation into Carwyn's death, said the inquiry was still trying to verify all the circumstances surrounding the incident. He said: 'The mother last saw her son at about 4pm. She returned to where they were staying because she thought he had returned on his own to the resort. But he wasn't there so she returned to the mountain. Accident: The Welsh schoolboy is believed to have got lost in the woods pictured here, before falling to his death from the cliffs below . Carwyn, who friends say modelled himself on survival specialist and TV presenter Bear Grylls, is believed to have taken the chance to go skiing in woodland to get back to Flaine, pictured . 'She asked everyone if they had seen him. It was about 6pm when she spoke to the pisteurs because she thought he had returned on his own.' He added: 'He had left the piste and then was in the forest and he took his skis off because perhaps the snow was not very good. 'He descended. He continued on foot. Between the piste and where he fell it would have been about 15 minutes. 'There are footprints in the snow after the point where the skis had been left for several tens of metres.' Family friends in Brecon yesterday paid tribute to the boy. One said: 'Carwyn loved exploring. That's what he spent all his time doing. 'He was a little adventurer. He was quite fearless really. He'd always be out in nature.' Another friend added: 'He idolised Bear Grylls and loved spending his time in the woods … He'd grown up in the mountains and [was] used to those kind of conditions, which makes this awful accident all the more tragic.' Holiday: Carwyn's family has said 'the most happy ski holiday' in Flaine, France, turned to tragedy after Carwyn became detached from the group on the last run of the day . A worker at Flaine hire shop Ski Set, who gave her name as Charlotte, said: 'The slope is about 40 metres [131ft] wide. 'You would have to really try to come off the piste … The trees are about 1.5 to two metres [6ft 6in] high. He must have had to push through … It seems he could see the hotel from where he was standing and tried to get there on foot.' The family were well known at food fairs and farmers markets and Carwyn would often help out on their stall. The Prime Minister briefly met Carwyn's father Rhys at the Royal Welsh Show last year when he bought Scotch eggs. A spokesman Mr Cameron said: 'This was an incredibly tragic accident and the Prime Minister's thoughts are with Carwyn's family.' Local farmer Peter Davies said: 'They were a great family not to mention great farmers who made really good sausages. It's just so sad to think what they must be going through right now. The whole farming fraternity is praying for them.' Children and teachers at the school Carwyn attended faced a difficult first day back after the Easter break. Officials at Ysgol Y Bannau in Brecon said a tribute was paid to Carwyn at a special assembly. Headteacher Emyr Jones said; 'The school mourns the loss of one of its pupils, Carwyn Scott-Howell - a lively and likeable pupil who will be greatly missed. 'We at Ysgol y Bannau, as an extended community, the staff, pupils, parents and governors, extend our deepest sympathy to the family; our thoughts and prayers are with them.' A book of condolence has also been opened at Brecon Cathedral, where a picture of of Carwyn in a karate suit was placed next to candles lit in his memory.","Carwyn Scott-Howell, 7, died on a family holiday in Flaine in French Alps .

"Supermarket giant Coles has been ordered to pay $2.5 million in penalties after lying to shoppers about the freshness of its bread. In June, It's ‘made today, sold today’ slogan, was deemed misleading by the Federal Court. It was slammed with a three-year ban to no longer promote its bread as baked on the day it is sold or made from fresh dough and has now received a hefty fine. 'This penalty sends a strong message to companies that they should not use broad phrases in promotions that are deliberately chosen to sell products to consumers but which are likely to mislead consumers,' Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims said. The Federal Court slammed Coles with a $2.5 million fine and banned them from advertising its par-baked bread from being baked fresh on the day it is sold for three years . The falsified fresh bread has generated a revenue of about $300 million for Coles . The falsely labelled bread has generated an income of around $300 million over three years before former premier Jeff Kennett found that the some of the bread that was advertised as fresh was actually made in Ireland the Sydney Morning Herald reported. In many instances, the breads were partially baked in factories overseas, frozen, and shipped to Australia months later to be sold as freshly baked loaves to consumers. After an investigation by the ACCC Coles was also ordered to display a Federal Court corrective notice in its stores and on its website informing shoppers that it had broken Australian consumer law by falsely advertising bread products as 'Baked Today, Sold Today' and 'Freshly Baked In-Store'. In court, Chief Justice Allsop said that it was clear Coles had the intention of improving its marketing through 'conduct that breached the Australian Consumer Law.' 'It is important that sellers in the market recognise that consumers are entitled to reliable, truthful and accurate information,' he said.

"Tragedy: Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam died when he fell from a van while chasing a gang of thieves . A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a ‘nasty crunch’ as the 34-year-old’s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was ‘a few cheap packets of cigarettes’. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: ‘Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. ‘With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. ‘Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.’ A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna’s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O’Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr Prasanna . ‘He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,’ he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: ‘Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. ‘I can’t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? “ . ‘You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.’ McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O’Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll and Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary’s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son.","Prasanna Arulchelvam leapt into van as it sped away but was pushed out .

"Depraved militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have brutally beheaded four men  accused of theft, before displaying their bodies on railings in a town square. Taken in ISIS' northern stronghold of Mosul, the photographs show four men being interviewed by the terrorists before they are dragged before bloodthirsty crowds eager to see their executions. The savage punishment is a significantly more extreme than ISIS' usual punishment for theft - which typically sees the accused having their right hand hacked-off by machete-wielding jihadis who pump the men full of drugs to numb the limb before severing it from the victim's body. Sentenced to beheading: One of the four men is seen blindfolded and forced to his knees in central Mosul while a masked Islamic State militant reads out the charges against him . Interview: All of the men wear their beards without moustaches in a style commonly associated with Islamist beliefs and their military-style clothing suggests the victims may well have been fighters themselves . The first photograph shows the four men sitting on a sofa in what appears to an interview-type situation with their jihadi captors. All of the men wear their beards without moustaches in a style commonly associated with Islamist beliefs and their military-style clothing suggests the victims may well have been fighters themselves. If the men were ISIS members, that could be one explanation for why they were given considerably harsher punishments than those usually received by ordinary citizens accused of similar crimes. A second photograph shows one of the men blindfolded and forced to his knees in a town square while a masked militant reads out the charges against him. Huge crowds are seen in the streets, with bloodthirsty young fathers and their children jostling for position in order to get a better view of the savage scene. A final photograph shows all four men on their knees as the knife-wielding militants swarm upon them, before carrying out the brutal beheadings. Locals on the ground suggested the men's decapitated bodies were later put on public display in central Mosul. Public execution: Huge crowds are seen in the streets, with bloodthirsty young fathers and their children jostling for position in order to get a better view of the savage scene . Sickening: All four men are seen on their knees in central Mosul as the knife-wielding Islamic State militants swarm upon them to carry out the brutal beheadings . Yesterday U.S.-led forces targeted ISIS with eight airstrikes in Iraq and conducted five airstrikes in Syria, the U.S. military said. The air strikes, conducted since Sunday morning, hit near Bayji, Mosul and Ramadi, in Iraq, destroying fighting positions, mortar positions and a sniper position, the Combined Joint Task Force said in a statement. In Syria, the air strikes destroyed eight fighting positions, an ISIS tunnel system and a vehicle near Hasaka, a vehicle near the terrorists' de facto capital Raqqa, and two buildings in Kobane, it said. The news comes as Iraq's prime minister vowed to protect the people living in territories controlled by ISIS from any retribution or rights violations when their lands are retaken by government forces. Speaking in Irbil, capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, Haider al-Abadi pledged that the 'properties and rights' of local residents would be respected once ISIS militants are driven out. 'We assure the people of Anbar and Ninevah provinces and other territories under IS control that we do respect the people and will not tolerate any violations against their properties, rights and souls,' al-Abadi said, using an alternative acronym for the terror group. Liberated: Iraqi security forces secure a street in Tikrit City after Islamic State militants were forced to flee . Tearing down the flag: Volunteer Shiite militiamen have fought alongside Iraqi army troops and are credited with playing a crucial role in pushing ISIS out of Tikrit and other cities . Convoy: With Tikrit taken, many Iraqis now expect the government offensive to target either Anbar province or Ninevah province - home to Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, where the savage beheading took place . Iraqi forensic teams have described how they wept as they began to excavate 12 graves, believed to be the final resting place of as many as 1,700 soldiers killed in cold blood by ISIS last summer. The teams began the gruesome task of uncovering the bodies of the young army recruits of Camp Speicher, slaughtered by the Sunni ISIS militants as they surged across northern Iraq for the 'crime' of being Shi'ite. The deaths showed Iraqis that ISIS, who have also attacked ethnic and religious minorities as well as fellow Sunni Muslims opposing them, were a threatening new kind of foe. Yesterday, the first of the 12 mass graves on the banks of the Tigris River began to give up their terrible secrets, days after Islamic State's fighters were driven from the city by Iraqi forces and Shi'ite paramilitaries. Volunteer Shiite militiamen, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, have fought alongside Iraqi army troops and are credited with playing a crucial role in pushing ISIS out of Tikrit and other cities. However the Iranian-backed Shiite militias have also been accused of looting and vandalizing the Sunni towns they have retaken. Al-Abadi admits that dozens of houses and shops were burned in Tikrit, and that several people were arrested and now await trial over violations committed there. With Tikrit taken, many residents expect the government offensive to now target either Anbar province or Ninevah province - home to Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul - for the next phase of the effort to push ISIS back. But some Sunni residents remain fearful that a government victory would simply trade the harsh rule of the Islamic militants for vengeance from undisciplined Shiite militiamen. ISIS controls about a third of northern and western Iraq. In Monday's violence, police and hospital officials said three people were killed and 17 others were wounded in two separate bombings targeting public spaces in the capital, Baghdad. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.","Young victims were  interviewed on a sofa before being savagely murdered .

"This fascinating interactive map shows where more than 231 million immigrants live around the world, and reveals that more than 7.8 million reside in the UK. The new data, released by the United Nations, shows how the number of international migrants has increased by nearly 80 million over the last 25 years. In 1995, there were more than 154 million migrants who left their home country and moved to another for various reasons. In comparison, that number had risen to 231 million globally by 2013, according to the international migrant stock trends data. The graphic, featured in The Telegraph, comes at a time when immigration is being heavily discussed by political parties, who each have varying policies on the issue in their manifestos, in the lead-up to May's election. It reveals that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are among the nations which have a high number of immigrants, with more than 7.8 million recorded. Other European countries also have similar numbers, with Germany having nine million, France recording 7.5million and Spain reporting more than six million. Meanwhile, the U.S. has more than 45 million immigrants - the most of all nations - and Russia has more than 11 million. Saudi Arabia has nine million. Countries which had the fewest number of immigrants include Morocco with 50,000, Mongolia with just 17,000 and Greenland with only 5,000. Others with low figures include Tunisia, Papua New Guinea, Cuba and Guyana. The top worldwide destinations for international migrants were the U.S., Russia, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, UK and France, according to the data. It also revealed the areas in the UK where immigrants live, with London, Leicester, the Birmingham area and Bradford among those with the highest percentage. The figures come after it emerged Prime Minister David Cameron had failed in his pledge to slash net migration to the tens of thousands before the general election. Official figures, released in February by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show there was a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the year to September last year, equal to the population of a city roughly the size of Nottingham and up from 210,000 in the previous 12 months. The increase in net migration was driven by a 'statistically significant' rise in immigrants arriving in the UK - up to 624,000 in the year to September 2014 from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. Around 327,000 people emigrated from the UK in the same period. Mr Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May had promised to slash net migration to below 100,000 by the end of the current parliamentary term. The figures also revealed there were significant increases in immigration of non-EU citizens - up 49,000 to 292,000 - and European Union citizens - up 43,000 to 251,000. Experts flagged another statistically significant increase in Romanian and Bulgarian citizens arriving in the UK - up to 37,000 from 24,000 in the previous 12 months. Of these, 27,000 were coming for work, a rise of 10,000 on the year ending September 2013, the ONS added. Around 271,000 people came to the UK for work, up 54,000 on a year earlier, while immigration for study rose from 175,000 to 192,000. Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said at the time: 'UK job growth is likely to be a key factor behind the recent increases. 'If the UK's economic performance compared to the rest of the EU had been poor, then we might well have seen net migration fall, but that has not happened. 'Rising work-related migration from outside the EU has also contributed.' Downing Street said the rise in immigration was driven in part by Britain's economic success relative to its neighbours in the eurozone.","Interactive graphic shows more than 231 million migrants around the world, with 7.8 million immigrants in UK alone .

"A two-mile Victorian railway line which was shut down 50 years ago under a programme of sweeping closures could reopen as Britain's longest cycle tunnel. The disused Rhondda Tunnel, which runs 1,000 feet beneath the Welsh hills, was closed as part of the Beeching cutbacks, a project which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network in Britain. But engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route. Scroll down for video . A two-mile Victorian railway tunnel which was closed as part of the Beeching cutbacks could reopen as Britain's longest cycle tunnel . The disused Rhondda Tunnel, which runs 1,000 feet beneath the Welsh hills, was closed 50 years ago . It was shut down as part of the sweeping Beeching Report, which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network . Under the proposals, it would be one of the longest cycle tunnels in the world, second only to the 4,000m Snoqualmie Tunnel near Seattle in the U.S. It would also mean cyclists could retrace the route where steam locomotives carried coal from the Rhondda Valley to the port city of Swansea - something which supporters  believe could be a huge boom to the tourist industry. Leanne Wood, leader of Plaid Cymru, said: 'There is a real buzz about this project which could transform these valleys if the tunnel is opened up.' The railway tunnel, the seventh biggest in Britain, runs beneath the mountains under the Dunraven Forest in the South Wales Valleys. But engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route . The railway tunnel, which runs beneath the mountains under the Dunraven Forest in the South Wales Valleys, was opened in 1890 in the coal boom. It was then closed in 1968 . It was opened in 1890 during the coal boom, after a five-year building project, which was overseen by the tunnel's chief engineer Sydney William Yockney, a pupil of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. But both ends of the tunnel - at Blaencwm in the Rhondda and Blaengwynfi in the Afan Valley - were filled in during the 1970s. It came following a report by Dr Richard Beeching, a civil servant from the Isle of Sheppy, who wrote a report called Reshaping of British Railways, which led to far-reaching changes in the transport network. The engineer had been employed to make the entire network more profitable, prompting him to recommend the closure of stations and railway lines which did not make money. The tunnel runs from Blaencwm in the Rhondda Valley to Blaengwynfi in the Afan Valley (shown in map) How the tunnel's length will compare to those around the world, according to the Rhonda Tunnel Society . Under the proposals, it would be one of the longest cycle tunnels in the world, second only to the 4,000m Snoqualmie Tunnel near Seattle in the U.S . Although some 3,000 miles of railway lines were closed before the report, he became infamous for causing the closures of several rural stations. The report became commonly known as the Beeching Axe. After falling victim to the report, the abandoned Rhondda Tunnel lay dormant for nearly 50 years. But the Rhondda Tunnel Society formed a few years ago in a bid to secure funding for the tunnel's excavation. The Highways Agency Historic Railways Estate has now contracted a construction and engineering company to undertake the three-day inspection of the tunnel, alongside the Mines Rescue Service. Rhondda Tunnel Society chairman Stephen Mackey said it would be a 'heart-stopping' three days. The chief engineer of the tunnel (left) was Sydney William Yockney, a pupil of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who oversaw the five-year building project which it began in 1885. Pictured right: Workers at the Rhonnda  Tunnel . The Highways Agency Historic Railways Estate has contracted a construction and engineering company to undertake the three-day inspection of the tunnel, alongside the Mines Rescue Service . The Rhondda Tunnel Society formed with the sole purpose of reopening the Victorian locomotive route . He said: 'The engineers will be walking the length of the tunnel across three days looking at the safety of the structure to see what it's like after 47 years and to see if it is possible to re-open the tunnel. 'As well as the structural integrity they will be checking for such things as sulphuric acid which can occur in stagnant water and to check carbon dioxide levels to make sure it's breathable down there.' He added: 'With the interest of the world looking in on the project, the inspections next week are going to be crucial with engineers being in the dark depths of the tunnel evaluating its integrity. 'These are exciting times for us but also a heart-stopping three days. Then we will have the wait for the report and the subsequent findings.' The tunnel was built by the demands of the coal industry to run from pit villages Blaencwm in the Rhondda Valley under the mountains to Blaengwynfi in the Afan Valley . The plaque at the Blaencwm entrance of the tunnel. It is being inspected next week for the first time since it closed . Engineer Dr Richard Beeching, whose report led to the reduction of the British railway network . In 1963, Dr Richard Beeching, a civil servant from the Isle of Sheppey, was recruited by the government to write a report about how to make the railway network more profitable. After being recruited from the job from ICI, he produced a report called Reshaping of British Railways - a document which changed the face of British railways forever. At the time, railway lines were extensive across Britain and even very remote areas had stations. But, with the industry hemorrhaging money, Dr Beeching's solution was to close down the parts - including stations and lines - which did not make money. He recommended axing about one third of the network, which equated to around 5,000 miles of track. This included hundreds of branch lines, 2,363 stations and tens of thousands of jobs lost on the grounds of cost or efficienvy. His recommendations left Britain with 13,721 miles of railway lines in 1966, while a further 2,000 miles were lost by the end of the 1960s. Dr Beeching argued it was more important to invest in fast journeys between the cities and to replace some branch lines with improved bus services. But the report became infamous and Dr Beeching was criticised for ignoring the social benefits of having a rail line. His programme also never made the savings he promised. However, many critics failed to recognise that the government had already cut 3,000 miles of track before Dr Beeching's input, something which was continued by successive governments.","Disused Rhondda Tunnel  closed 50 years ago as part of sweeping closures .

"A devastating fire has caused serious damage to a world-famous hotel used as a setting for television’s Inspector Morse. The Randolph, in Oxford city centre, went up in flames this afternoon, with smoke billowing from the roof as dozens of firefighters battled to bring the inferno under control. The extent of the damage to the Grade II listed Victorian building remains unclear but aerial pictures of the scene showed gaps in the roof and exposed beams. The Randolph Hotel, in Oxford, used as a setting for television’s Inspector Morse, caught fire today . A devastating fire has caused serious damage to The Randolph Hotel, in Beaumont Street, today . Plumes of black smoke was seen coming from the hotel by those on the Ashmolean Museum's roof terrace . The fire's  cause is not known and the extent of the damage to the Grade II listed building remains unclear . The five-star hotel, run by the Macdonald chain, includes the Morse Bar, named after being used as a frequent setting for many scenes where Morse and Lewis deliberated on complex cases. Cast and crew also stayed there while filming the detective drama. The Morse Bar has featured in episodes of the follow-on TV series, Lewis, too. Roads were closed around the hotel as fire crews fought to stop the flames spreading, while its staff and guests were evacuated. Firefighters will remain overnight at the scene of the fire, which is not believed to be suspicious and is thought to have started in the ground floor kitchen. An aerial view over the historic hotel shows massive plumes of smoke billowing over Oxford city centre . The fire is not believed to be suspicious and is believed to have started in the ground floor kitchen . The extent of the damage is unclear, but pictures of the scene showed gaps in the roof and exposed beams . No-one was believed to be injured and guests and staff evacuated to the nearby Oxford Playhouse theatre . Eyewitness Anabel Bacon, who was on the roof terrace of the Ashmolean Museum opposite the imposing, gothic hotel, said there was an initial plume of smoke, which stopped very quickly - but “all of a sudden it resumed again with just as much force”. She said: ‘The fire service was there very quickly after the second plume erupted, within five minutes. Everyone was surprised… no one knew what was going on.’ No-one was believed to have been injured in the fire, with guests and staff quickly evacuated to the nearby Oxford Playhouse theatre. It was not yet known how many people were inside the hotel at the time. An Oxfordshire fire service spokesman said: ‘The call was received by fire and rescue at 4.39pm and a total of 14 fire engines have been sent to the hotel - including two high-reach appliances. ‘Firefighters have not had to rescue anybody from the blaze and the building has been evacuated. 'Roads nearby have been closed as firefighters deal with the incident.' The Randolph was built in 1864 by William Wilkinson, an architect who also designed many other buildings in North Oxford, and first opened in 1866. There have been many attempts to preserve the grandeur of the building with major refurbishments taking place in 1952, 1978, 1988 and most recently in 2001, at a cost of £4 million, which saw the redecoration of 119 bedrooms and the creation of three new meeting rooms.

"An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life .

"As Australian Fashion Week comes to a close, a new damning report has named and shamed some of the worst clothing brands sold in Australia and their companies, for the ongoing exploitation of their overseas workers. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.' However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers, and H&M, Zara, Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker's pay.","Australian Fashion Report revealed the Australian-sold brands and companies that ignore the exploitation of their overseas workers .

"This is the dramatic moment two Typhoons came into land above an astonished father and son. The video captured by William Bird while out with his seven-year-old stepson Alex shows the £126million jets approaching RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland. The first of the aircraft - which can reach 1,370mph - blasted them with the thrust from its engines, while as the second jet disappeared from view the video camera was knocked sideways. Scroll down for video . Incoming: The video shows two of the £126million jets approaching RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland . Overhead: As the second jet disappeared from view in the clip, the video camera was knocked sideways . The video was taken on the same day that Typhoons were deployed by the Royal Air Force as two Russian long-range Bear bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, hugged British airspace. Mr Bird, who runs an aerial photography business in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, captured the video on Tuesday with a Go Pro 4 while on holiday with his family. The 41-year-old said that he was ‘as close to the action as you could get’, having gone to the area after hearing on the news that Nato exercises were taking place in the area. He said: ‘I went to see what I could capture. I wasn't really sure what I would get but it was fantastic watching the video back. ‘They came in very low and were preparing to land, but they were still under quite a lot of throttle. To see that much thrust is quite astonishing. My stepson is still making jet noises.’ He added: ‘It's the first time I've seen a Typhoon in flight and the noise was just incredible. Caught on camera: Mr Bird took the video on Tuesday with a Go Pro 4 while on holiday with his family . 'You can hear it approach from far away, but when it's above you have to fight every instinct not to duck or put your hands over your ears. ‘Shortly after taking this video we were actually told we should probably move a bit away since the planes were coming in to land.’ As well as the bombers on Tuesday, a Russian warship strayed close to UK territory in another apparent attempt to test Britain’s defences. A destroyer with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the English Channel with two other Russian ships. It forced the UK to send a heavily-armed frigate to monitor the vessels. Just a few hours later the Bear bombers hugged UK airspace. Sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to ‘snoop’ on the Nato war games exercise taking place in Scotland. Even though Russian military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength, the timing raised suspicions that Vladimir Putin was using access to the site to test UK reaction times. It later emerged that the Russians had actually been at the Typhoons’ base at RAF Lossiemouth when the warplanes were scrambled.","William Bird, 41, captured footage as jets approached RAF Lossiemouth .

"Newly-discovered medical records have finally revealed the fate of pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti's muse Fanny Cornforth and how she died a tragic, death penniless death. The details of where and how the West-Sussex born model and mistress of Rossetti died remained a mystery for years until her biographer recently tracked her down through hospital records. They revealed the orange-haired beauty - whose face graced many of her lover's paintings - died in the Sussex county asylum in poverty and suffering from clear symptoms of dementia. Rossetti's famous painting Aurelia 'Fazio's Mistress' (pictured) was a portrait of his muse Fanny Cornforth . Fair Rosamund, painted in 1861 (left), and 1886's Lady Lilith (right) also used Cornforth as the model . The records revealed she died at the Graylingwell Hospital on February 24, 1909, at the age of 74. At the time of her death, she was suffering from 'senile mania, confusion, weak-mindedness and an inability to sustain a rational conversation, a poor memory and sleeplessness', The Guardian reported. Born Sarah Cox in 1835, she met Rossetti in 1958 and was considered one of his 'stunners' - a reference to the women he kept in his company as lovers and models. She went on to pose for at least 60 of his artworks. Art historian Kirsty Stonell Walker used the records from Graylingwell Hospital in Chichester, now stored at the West Sussex records office, to track down her  resting site and lay flowers at her unmarked grave. Ms Stonell Walker told The Guardian: 'It is a very sad story, but the hospital was not a terrible place, it actually had a very progressive approach towards mental illness. 'She was buried with a few other people, but not exactly in a pauper's grave.' Rossetti was the son of Italian scholar Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti and his wife Frances Polidori. He was born in London in 1828 and is known for his painting, illustrating, translating and poetry. He founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 with contemporaries William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. His most famous paintings include Beata Beatrix, The Girlhood of Mary Virgin, How They Met Themselves. Dante Gabriel Rossetti was one of the most well-known founding members of the Pre-Raphelites group . The Pre-Raphelites were a group of English artists who formed a 'brotherhood' in 1848, dedicated to creating work that rejected the mannered approach adopted by Raphael and other Renaissance painters. Believing Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo had proven a corrupting influence on art, they wanted to return to the intense colour and detailed compositions that characterised 15th century Italian art. Founded by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the trio later welcomed Rossetti's brother, William, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to their circle.","Details of the death of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's muse finally unmasked .

So he rounded up all his airline miles, and the points he had acquired on his 25 credit cards. In the end, he was able to book a vacation with stops in Mexico, Nicaragua, Trinidad, St. Lucia, Grenada, Germany, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Lithuania, and Finland without having to pay more than a few dollars on any of the flights. He will also be in the United States a few times, but just to catch connection flights. In the end he spent somewhere between 10 and 15 hours putting the entire trip together, which also includes free hotels, at a cost of 136,500 frequent flyer miles. 'It’s tough when you have a job and you have to ask your boss for time off,' Keyes told Business Insider. 'You only have a limited time off and then you spend a lot of that traveling. I figured while I’m in a position where I don’t have a 9-to-5, I might as well take advantage.' In fact, Keyes is such a pro at travelling on the extremely cheap that he even wrote two eBooks detailing his strategies: How to Fly for Free and How to Find Free Flights. And the easiest way is a bit more obvious than many might think. 'If your ultimate goal is to be able to find as cheap a flight as possible and go somewhere cool for not much money then starting with an open, blank slate and going wherever there’s a cheap flight right now is going to be your best bet,' said Keyes.

"Forget chicken fingers and fries — Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka's twins prefer much more foodie-approved fare than the average four-year-old. In a recent interview, David, 39, explained how being a personal chef and graduate of the famed Le Cordon Bleu cooking school has helped him to influence his children's culinary tastes. 'I cook for them a ton!' he told The New Potato. 'My kids are crazy eaters. They have incredible palates.' Scroll down for video . Say cheese: Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka's adorable twins love food and have unusually refined palates for four-year-olds, including a love for seafood and spices . Shared duties: Chef David does most of the cooking in the Harris-Burtka house, but Neil serves as bartender for company and helps David create the perfect presentation . While David said he most often serves grilled fish, ceviche, and quesadillas, he noted that his children each have their own personal favorites as well. Son Gideon eats everything that is put in front of him, said David, but favors clams, sushi, octopus, grilled pork, steak, Parmesan cheese, coconut, and spices like ginger, mint, and cinnamon. Daughter Harper, meanwhile, prefers 'very strong and briny flavors' including oysters, sardines, prosciutto, capers, duck liver, miso, and — not so unusually — chocolate. Foodie feast: Neil commented on this Instagram picture that his kids were 'devouring oysters at Eataly' in New York City; the seafood pick is one of daughter Harper's favorite foods . Impressive tastes: Though the twins eat regular 'kid food' like popcorn, shown here, they also love a lot of dishes that most children their age wouldn't touch, like ceviche and sardines . Though David said that he and husband Neil, 41, don't usually cook as a couple, with David himself taking the reins in the kitchen, Neil does serve as 'more of the bartender' when they have company at their New York home. The How I Met Your Mother star serves cocktails and pairs wine with David's food, but is also 'a great sous chef' who David can rely on to plate food and ice cupcakes. It's natural that David emerged as the parent who prepares most of the meals in the family; besides being an established actor, he also trained under star chef Mario Batali and runs a catering company called Gourmet M.D., which boasts a long list of celebrity clients including Christina Hendricks, John Hamm, Zackary Quinto, and Jesse Tyler Ferguson. Couture kids: Harper and Gideon know how to dress up — and strike a pose to show off their fabulous outfits . Designer darlings: In the caption for this Instagram photo, Neil says his kids are 'giving model poses' Perfect pose: Gideon smiles big while papa Neil says Harper is 'a girl, girl, girl' who likes to be announced like a debutante when she comes down the stairs . Cuisine isn't the only thing for which Gideon and Harper have discerning tastes, either — though the pair only turned four in October, they've already developed and eye for fashion. Dubbing them 'fashionis-tots,' Neil explained on Inside the Actors Studio that Harper in particular has a flair for dressing up: 'Harper is a girl, girl, girl. She wears mermaid outfits and has falls in her hair and you have to announce her when she comes down the staircase.' Both of the twins seem happy to get decked out for their dads, as Neil regularly posts photos of the adorable duo in impeccably-styled outfits on his Instagram account.","David says daughter Harper and son Gideon have incredibly sophisticated tastes .

"A young Syrian boy has revealed how he saw depraved Islamic State militants playing football with a severed head inside the besieged Yarmouk refugee camp. Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he stumbled on the barbaric scene shortly after the terrorists beat him unconscious when they burst into his family home at the camp in the Syrian capital Damascus. The schoolboy said the ISIS fighters were looking for his brother, who is a member of the Palestinian rebel group who ran and defended the camp for several years before ISIS carried out a bloody assault that has left more than 200 people dead in just seven days. His story was revealed as refugees in Yarmouk spoke of the daily atrocities they have witnessed since ISIS seized control of 90 per cent of the camp, including innocent children being slaughtered in front of their anguished parents. Scroll down for video . Scene of death: A destroyed graveyard is photographed in Yarmouk camp following the intense fighting . Innocent: Palestinians, who fled the Yarmouk refugee camp, sit on mattresses inside a school in Damascus . After enduring two years of famine and fighting, Ibrahim Abdel Fatah said he saw heads cut off by ISIS in the Palestinian camp of Yarmouk. That was it. He fled and hasn't looked back. Unshaven, pale and gaunt, he has found refuge with his wife and seven children at the Zeinab al-Haliyeh school in Tadamun, a southeastern district of the Syrian capital held by the army. 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised,' he said. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved,' the 55-year-old said. The school is currently home to 98 displaced people, among them 40 children, who have been put up in three classrooms. The usual occupants, schoolchildren, have been evacuated temporarily from rooms where mattresses and bedding now blanket the floor. 'I left my house which was the only thing I had. My family lived on rations supplied by UNRWA,' the United Nations agency that looks after Palestinian refugees, the former caretaker said. Destroyed: In late December 2012, Yarmouk - just four miles from central Damascus - became a battlefield between pro- and anti-government forces before a merciless siege began . A man stands on a staircase inside a demolished building inside the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp . Anwar Abdel Hadi, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official in Damascus, said 500 families, or about 2,500 people, fled Yarmouk before IS fighters attacked the camp last Wednesday. Before the assault, there were around 18,000 people in Yarmouk in a southern neighbourhood of the Syrian capital. Yarmouk was once a thriving district housing 160,000 Palestinian refugees and Syrians. But that was before it too was caught up in the widespread civil unrest which erupted in 2011. In late December 2012, Yarmouk - just four miles from central Damascus - became a battlefield between pro- and anti-government forces before a merciless siege began. The camp has been encircled for more than a year, but is now reported to be almost completely under the control of ISIS and Al Qaeda's local affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra. Residents who fled the advancing jihadists last week have been put up in regime-held areas nearby. According to Britain-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, nearly 200 people had died in Yarmouk from malnutrition and lack of medicines before last Wednesday's assault. Carnage: Before the Islamic State assault, there were around 18,000 people in Yarmouk in a southern neighbourhood of the Syrian capital Damascus . Keeping the faith: A Palestinian man who fled the Yarmouk  refugee camp prays inside a school in Damascus . Speaking of the moment he stumbled on the ISIS militants, 16-year-old Amjad said: 'In Palestine Street, I saw two members of Daesh playing with a severed head as if it was a football. Wearing a baseball cap sideways, rapper-style, the youth has a swollen eye and chin. 'Daesh came to my home looking for my brother who's in the Palestinian Popular Committees. They beat me until I passed out and left me for dead,' he added, referring to the group by an Arabic acronym . At the entrance to the school, Umm Usama chatted with fellow refugees who had got out. 'I left the camp despite myself,' said the 40-year-old woman who had lived in Yarmouk for 17 years. 'I'd stayed on despite the bombings and famine. It was terrible, we ate grass, but at least I was at home. 'Daesh's arrival meant destruction and massacre. Their behaviour's not human and their religion is not ours,' added the thin woman with sunken eyes.

Before that we didn't fear death, because if there was fighting, the rebels made sure the civilians got to shelters,' said Abir, a 47-year-old woman who was born and raised in Yarmouk. There are no suitcases to be seen in the classrooms -- the families had to leave so quickly there was no time to pack anything. 'I left without bringing any belongings. My husband wasn't able to join me. I walked out hugging the walls so snipers couldn't see me,' said 19-year-old Nadia, nursing her two-month-old baby. Yesterday ISIS launched English-language radio news bulletins on its al-Bayan radio network. The militant group's English bulletin,  promoted via Twitter, accompanies Arabic and Russian bulletins already airing on the network. The first bulletin, which provided an overview of their activities in Iraq, Syria and Libya, discussed a range of topics including the alleged death of an ISIS commander in Yarmouk, a suicide bombing in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk and mortar attacks on militias in Sirte, Libya. ISIS holds territory in a third of Iraq and Syria and is becoming increasingly active in Libya. The group already publishes a monthly online English-language magazine, Dabiq, with religious lessons, plus news about its activities.","Amjad Yaaqub, 16, saw ISIS militants kicking a severed head in the camp .

"A British solicitor and former Mayor of Glastonbury has been revealed as a key prosecutor of the evil camp guards of Bergen-Belsen after its liberation in 1945 . Cecil Hamilton-Miller, from Kensington, London, was responsible for the convictions of 31 concentration camp guards in 1945, including several key Belsen figures, such as camp commander Josef Kramer and Dr Fritz Klein. Mr Hamilton-Miller, who died in 2001, aged 91, struggled to talk to about the horrors he witnessed during the holocaust or the role he played after the liberation of Belsen, his family has said today. Hero: Cecil Hamilton-Miller, pictured as Mayor of Glastonbury, was part of the team that prosecuted dozens of the men and women responsible for running the notorious Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp . Cecil Hamilton-Miller can be seen on the right, watching on as Bergen-Belsen camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial in 1945 . Despite his honourable actions in the wake of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp, which took place 70 years ago this month, many family and friends had no idea of his involvement. A historic photograph found by Mr Hamilton-Miller's family shows him watching on as camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial. His cousin William Miller, 63, who has written a biography about the late solicitor, said: 'Cecil couldn't talk about his Belsen experience in later life without tears streaming down his face because of the traumatic memories. 'He never publicised his extraordinary war record but I am very proud of it - it must rate as the most important legal work of his career.' Prosecutor: Mr Hamilton-Miller served in India for much of World War II and arrived in Bergen-Belsen shortly after its liberation in May 1945 . Bergen-Belsen was a Nazi concentration camp in Lower Saxony, Germany. It was initially intended to hold prisoners of war, but in 1943, parts of the camp became a 'transit camp' for, mainly Jewish, civilian prisoners, . The camp became the final resting place of some 20,000 prisoners of war and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and disabled, and was is burned to the ground after its liberation by British and Canadian troops in April 1945. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1935, Cambridge educated Mr Hamilton-Miller was enlisted into the Territorial Army in 1936 and then, in 1939, was granted an emergency commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Border Regiment. For much of the war he served in India, until in 1944 he returned to Britain on leave and was posted to Carlisle. This ended abruptly on April 15, 1945 when the 11th Armoured Division of the British Army liberated Bergen-Belsen. Recognising that the liberated camps on the continent would require military lawyers, Mr Hamilton-Miller was among those immediately posted immediately to the British Liberation Army, 49 Reinforcement Holding Unit, where he was appointed Staff Captain to 21 Army Group HQ, War Crimes Investigation Team, arriving at Belsen sometime after May 5 to a horrific, challenging and distressing scene. Mr Hamilton-Miller's role appears to have been to assist Major Savile Geoffrey Champion, head of No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Unit, Belsen, to prepare the legal cases against the SS camp personnel. Mr Miller added: 'Cecil's team opened a war crimes investigation office inside the camp and files were opened on each guard. 'Gradually written witness statements and other evidence built up in each file enabling decisions to be made as to whether and when the case against each guard was sufficiently clear and strong to progress to trial.' The first Belsen trial began on September 17, 1945, at Luneburg Town Hall and took the form of a Military Tribunal. Up in smoke: Bergen-Belsen, which became the final resting place of 20,000 POWs and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and people with disabilities is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . The trial of the prison guard, called Rothe, who killed a young girl by beating her was sentenced to ten years in prison. Mr Hamilton-Miller was also responsible for the camp commandant Kramer, the doctor, Dr Klein, and nine guards, being sentenced to death by hanging. Nineteen guards were sentenced to prison terms of between life and one year, with most of them having to serve between ten and 15 years. Mr Miller added: 'Many inmates at Belsen had been moved hurriedly from Auschwitz, and Cecil's unit took evidence from witnesses against Nazi criminals such as Dr Mengele, guards responsible for selecting people to go to the gas chambers, as well as conducting horrific medical experiments on them. 'Cecil appears to have remained in the Belsen posting until December 1945 after which he was sent home and demobbed.' Upon his return to the UK, Mr Hamilton-Miller re-qualified as a solicitor and married Sylvia Hurle. The pair lived in Glastonbury, Somerset, where Cecil lived for the majority of his life, becoming Mayor of the city in 1969. After his wife's death Cecil moved to family in Norwich before his death in 2001 aged 91.","Cecil Hamilton-Miller prosecuted dozens of Belsen guards in 1945 .

"Two fugitives from the London area who featured on the UK’s most wanted list on suspicion of drug trafficking have been captured in Europe with 24 hours of each other. Jayson McDonald was found hiding under a bed in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, while Paul Monk was captured at his luxury villa in the holiday hotspot of Alicante on the Spanish coast. They were arrested as part of Operation Captura, a drive launched in 2006 by the National Crime Agency, Crimestoppers and Spanish authorities to catch suspects who had fled from the UK. Jayson McDonald (right) is wanted on suspicion of conspiracies to import and supply heroin and cocaine, and is believed to be a member of a Europe-wide organised crime network. Paul Monk (left) was wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to supply cannabis . Monk, 54, from Romford in Essex was overseeing workmen laying a marble patio around his swimming pool when armed police swooped at the address where an imitation firearm with silencer and 125,000 euro were recovered. On Wednesday morning McDonald, aged 37, from Acton, west London, was apprehended as part of a separate joint investigation with the Dutch National Police. McDonald had been hiding in Spain but it is believed he based himself in the Netherlands after officers raided a property where he was living in the Coin area of Malaga last month. He is wanted on suspicion of conspiracies to import and supply heroin and cocaine, and is believed to be a member of a Europe-wide organised crime network responsible for the importation of Class A drugs into the UK. Monk is wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to supply cannabis. He was allegedly involved in the handover of a kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, north London, in May 2013. He is also linked to the seizure of 23 kilos of herbal cannabis and one kilo of cannabis resin in October 2013 in Colchester, Essex. Monk, 54, from Romford in Essex was overseeing workmen laying a marble patio around his swimming pool in Alicante (pictured) when armed police swooped at the address . Both men are wanted by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of drugs offences and are currently in custody awaiting extradition proceedings. Dave Allen, head of the UK International Crime Bureau at the NCA, said: “Our ability to capture two of our most wanted fugitives in different countries within 24 hours demonstrates the NCA’s international reach. “Nowhere is a safe haven for British fugitives and we will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners across the world to track them down and return them to the UK to face justice.” Monk was allegedly involved in the handover of a kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, north London, in May 2013 . The arrests come less than a month after an appeal for information about the men’s whereabouts. A total of 68 out of 86 fugitives on the Operation Captura list have now been caught. Lord Ashcroft KCMG PC, the founder and chair of Crimestoppers, praised the results, adding: “This should be a warning to the remaining individuals on the Captura list that they cannot hide forever. If the public continue to contact Crimestoppers and give information anonymously, I am confident we will see more arrests in the future.”","Pair, both from London, captured in Europe within 24 hours of each other .

"With just 26 days until the election, the Prime Minister is already showing the strain of a punishing campaign trail. At a visit to the Age UK in Plymouth yesterday, David Cameron appeared weary with bags under his eyes and disheveled hair. In one day this week the Tory leader travelled to all all four home nations in his bid to secure votes ahead of the May 7 election. Scroll down for video . Showing the strain: At a visit to the Age UK in Plymouth yesterday, David Cameron appeared weary with bags under his eyes and disheveled hair . He has also had to wade into a number of arguments, defending outspoken ministers, and even got into a muddle over cream teas. On Thursday Mr Cameron was been forced to defend Michael Fallon after the defence secretary claimed Ed Miliband would stab Britain’s national interest in the back in the same way he did his brother to gain the Labour leadership. The Prime Minister was also dealt a blow as Ed Miliband overtook him as the most popular political leader for the first time. In a shock result that sent shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. Not impressed: Six-year-old Lucy Howarth looked positively uninterested as the Prime Minister read a story at Sacred Heart Primary School near Bolton earlier this week . The Labour Party also took a commanding four point lead over the Tories, according to the pollsters Survation. On Wednesday, Mr Cameron failed to get the desired response from a six-year-old schoolgirl who looked positively uninterested as he read a story to her classmates at Sacred Heart Primary School near Bolton. Yesterday, another campaign gaffe saw Mr Cameron wade into the Cornwall Devon debate about how to eat a scone - getting the two counties contrasting traditions mixed up. The Tory leader has spent the day campaigning in Devon, where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority. But his hopes of courting support in the county were given a knock with his food faux pas as he chatted with staff and customers of Tea by the Taw on The Strand in Barnstaple, the North Devon Gazette reported. David Cameron, on a visit to Devon this morning, made the blunder of confusing the two methods for eating a cream tea . All good politicians know how to make small talk with voters, but the jam and cream debate is no trifling matter. In an attempt to woo the locals, Mr Cameron ventured: 'When you are in Devon you do the jam and the cream in a different order to Cornwall, is that right?' Sensing a gaffe was imminent, he went on: 'I'm going to get this wrong, aren't I?' His prediction was correct, as he added: 'In Devon it's... jam first and cream on top?' His comments were greeted with silence and stony faces, as the staff realised someone was going to have to put the Prime Minister right.","PM appeared weary with bags under eyes at event in Plymouth yesterday .

"After drawing praise for India’s operation to rescue around 2,000 nationals by air and sea from war-hit Yemen, Minister of State for External Affairs V.K Singh, who is spearheading the rescue exercise, found himself in the thick of a controversy over an unsavoury remark made against the media. The former army chief is currently staying in Djibouti for over a week spearheading Operation Rahat. “Friends what do you expect from presstitutes….” Gen. Singh tweeted last night in response to a channel quoting him saying that he found the evacuation assignment less exciting than his recent visit to the Pakistan High Commission on the occasion of Pakistan's national day. The comment evoked sharp reactions, with the Opposition demanding an apology from the Union minister. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has distanced itself from the former army chief’s views. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said: “Twitter is a personal platform. The meaning of a tweet can be best explained by the person who has tweeted.” But the comment has not gone down well with journalists, and the Broadcast Editors’ Association found the tweet to be offensive. The association’s general secretary, N.K. Singh, said that such comments damage the image of the government. Congress irked . The Congress also grabbed the opportunity to corner the NDA government and demanded that the minister be sacked. “It is very unfortunate that a minister is using abusive language against the media. He is holding a very important position. It is for the prime minister to take a call on this,” said Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed. “Singh’s statement shows utter intolerance and incapacity to hear any kind of criticism or dissent,” the Indian National Congress said on its Twitter handle, quoting its spokesman Abhishek Singhvi. Another party spokesman Sanjay Jha tweeted: “General V.K. Singh’s choice of dreadful terms to attack Indian media is not just politically inappropriate but seriously lamentable.” This is not the first time when General Singh’s tweets have stirred a storm. The Union minister had tweeted “duty” and “disgust” soon after attending a reception hosted by Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit in New Delhi, where Kashmiri separatists were also invited. The Yemen rescue: Indian nationals in Dijibouti before taking off for Mumbai . Singh had represented the government at the Pakistan Day reception and his tweets were read as his displeasure. But the Union minister later clarified that his comment was directed at the media’s twists to the whole episode and that he was misinterpreted. The former army chief has vented his anger at the media several times in the past as well. He has used the word “pressitute” earlier, too, when reports pointing fingers at him for attempting a coup had appeared in the media. The latest episode has hit the government at a time when the flawless execution of Operation Rahat was being hailed by all. The mammoth effort saw 4,000 Indians being brought home safely from the war zone in Yemen besides many citizens of other countries. The former army chief is not known to mince his words. He is not the only one in the government who had uncomfortable relations with a section of media. With PTI inputs . 'Rahat' brings Indians home from Yemen . By Mail Today Bureau in New Delhi . India has pulled off an impressive mission by evacuating nearly 2,000 (by air and sea) nationals during a gruelling operation in the war-hit Yemen. Operation Rahat, as the elaborate humanitarian assistance exercise was christened, has entered its last phase as not many are left to be pulled out from Yemen where Houthi fighters are resisting a Saudi Arabia- led offensive in a war that has left hundreds dead. The Houthis are a Zaidi group that takes its name from Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who launched an insurgency in 2004 before being reportedly killed by the Yemeni army. Led by Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the group carried out a coup in 2014–15 and as of now controls capital Sana’a and the parliament. Three warships, two IAF super heavy transporters, two merchant vessels and two Air India jets helped ferry Indians and some foreigners to safety. Officials said that air operations are being called off, but the naval warships will remain till the last person is evacuated. Minister of State for External Affairs V.K. Singh, who was in the centre of a storm for a remark against the media, led the evacuation operation from Djibouti located on the Horn of Africa across the Gulf of Aden. Singh had created a controversy on Tuesday when he said: “Actually speaking, the operation (evacuation) in Yemen is less exciting than going to the Pakistani embassy.” On Wednesday, he sparked fresh storm by referring to a section of the media as ‘presstitutes’. The Indians were taken out on warships and Air India planes from Yemen and brought to Djibouti before being sent home. It was a Herculean effort considering the numbers involved and the situation on the ground, which was deteriorating with every passing day. As the air operations were being called off on April 8, naval warship INS Tarkash reached Djibouti from Al Hodeidah port with 74 people on board and INS Sumitra entered the Al Hodeidah harbour of Yemen on the Red Sea. Along with destroyer INS Mumbai, the three naval warships made several sorties from Djibouti to the three port cities in Yemen - Al Hodeidah, Aden and Al Mukalla - to bring back the stranded Indians who were told to assemble at these points from the hinterland. The ministry of external affairs coordinated smoothly with various agencies to ensure that the passage back home was safe and secured.","V.K.

"Meter Maids have a long history synonymous with the sandy beaches of Queensland's most sought-after holiday destination, but time may have run out for the Surfers Paradise bikini-clad icons. The 50-year tradition has split the Gold Coast community, with business leaders calling for the end of an era, The Sunday Mail reported. Started in 1965, Meter Maids were the brainchild of Gold Coast developer Bernie Elsey who introduced the initiative to stave off the bad publicity associated with newly installed parking meters. Scroll down for video . Local business owners have labelled Surfers Paradise Meter Maids as outdated and were no longer providing a service . The controversial move involved young women dressed in gold bikinis walking the main tourist strip and placing money into expired meters, according to the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids website. But local business owners say the group is no longer performing a public service as advancements in parking meter technology mean expiry times are not always displayed. They believe Meter Maids are violating the council's anti-touting laws by spruiking branded merchandise, which Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce president Peter Yared says makes the group a business now. 'I think it’s time they moved on,' he told News Corp. Started in 1965, Meter Maids were the brainchild of Gold Coast developer Bernie Elsey who introduced the initiative to stave off the bad publicity associated with the newly installed parking meters . Business leaders say it was time for them to move as they had became irrelevant now because parking meters were electronic . Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce's Peter Yared said the group were now a business . 'They no longer perform any service for the community... They don't do anything in the area except fleece tourists.' Mr Yared said Meter Maids were no longer relevant as parking meters were now electronic and they had not kept up with the changing times.

'The tourists love and embrace the Meter Maids because they are quintessentially part of their Gold Coast and Surfers Paradise experience,' Mr Yarwood said.

He said they brought good memories for many people who had an idyllic beachside holiday at the destination . 'Until such time we are proud of this jewel in our tourism crown, we will continue to struggle to re-establish ourselves as the premier holiday destination in Australia.' Mr Yarwood said Meter Maids were the 'under-utilised resource' to help revamp the region. 'Meter Maids invoke in most people that wonderful memory of that beachside holiday in Surfers Paradise,' he said. 'We're calling for our future actually lies in past. 'I'm Gold Coast born and bred... and I am ashamed to take clients in to Surfers Paradise because it is unsafe and unclean. 'We [The Meter Maids] are the only bit of sunshine.

"A husband accused of trying to murder his cheating wife wrote her an extraordinary letter while remanded in prison asking her to send him a suit for his trial, a court heard yesterday. Joseph O'Riordan, 73, stabbed his 47-year-old wife Amanda eight times after he discovered she had been having an affair with a postman. She was left with life-threatening injuries to her torso, chest, arms and back. Joseph O'Riordan stabbed his wife of ten years Amanda (left) with a seven inch kitchen knife eight times . O'Riordan, who was a councillor at the time, rang an ambulance after the attack in October last year and admitted what he had done during the 999 call. Yesterday it emerged that four months later, while on remand, O'Riordan wrote to his wife from jail asking her to 'get my things together' before for his trial. Meanwhile Mrs O'Riordan, during questioning by her husband's defence team in court yesterday, sobbed: 'I did not want to hurt Joe. I never wanted to hurt him… even now. All of this is my fault because I had an affair.' In the letter, which was posted from prison on February 4 this year, O'Riordan asked his wife to gather some of his belongings and give them to his son, including a 'decent jumper' and his 'beige casual jacket'. He also asked for his 'blue suit' and 'three ties that will go with the suit', which he said he needed for the trial. His letter went on: 'You will be fully aware that I cannot make any mention of the case. 'I hope and pray that your recovery continues to progress and you will always remain in my heart – God bless, Joe.' O'Riordan sobbed as the letter was read out at Brighton Crown Court yesterday. His wife also broke down in the witness box as she gave evidence from behind a screen. The case was adjourned for 90 minutes to give Mrs O'Riordan time to regain her composure. Prosecutor Dale Sullivan asked if she had been expecting the letter and she replied: 'No – I wasn't expecting anything from him.' Earlier, video footage of a pre-recorded police interview with Mrs O'Riordan was played to the court, in which she described her husband as 'passionate and vocally volatile' but said he had never 'laid a finger on her before.' She said she thought he might have suffered from 'mild depression' because he could be 'up one minute and down the next'. During later questioning by O'Riordan's defence counsel Peter Doyle QC, she said she and her husband were 'soulmates'. The couple, from Polegate, East Sussex, met in 1991 and had been married for ten years at the time of the attack, the court heard. Brighton Magistrates' Court heard that four months after attack, while on remand, O'Riordan wrote to his wife from jail asking her to 'get my things together' before for his trial . But Mrs O'Riordan said that last year she felt 'smothered' by her husband and wanted 'more me time.' This was the 'trigger' for her brief affair with postman Nicholas Gunn, who has since moved away from the area. 'It was not something I had ever done before,' she told the court. O'Riordan found out about the affair after hiring a private detective to follow her. He had also asked his friends to watch her. The jury heard that a row had developed between the pair on October 22 while they were visiting Mrs O'Riordan's mother after O'Riordan received a phone call, believed to be from Mr Gunn. Mrs O'Riordan said they then went to a KFC restaurant and in the car on the way home her husband became angry and she tried to get out, but was 'dragged' back and held down. Once the couple were home, she said her husband came into their bedroom brandishing a kitchen knife as he cried: 'You have made me do this. This is all your fault.' Mrs O'Riordan also said that just days before the assault her husband had talked of 'finishing her off and then himself'. She added: 'I just thought that was talk as it was not said in anger. I never read anything into it. It was not said with malice but it was said maybe a week before he attacked me.' O'Riordan was sitting on Polegate Town Council, East Sussex, at the time. He was also president of his local Royal British Legion and was invited to the Queen's garden party in 2013 for helping to arrange parts of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations. O'Riordan has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder. The trial continues.

"In her working life, she has covered terrorist attacks, murders and explosions. But nothing, it seems, has been a greater challenge for Samantha Simmonds than a car journey with her three children. The Sky newsreader has revealed how an Easter holiday outing with her family saw ‘blood and saliva flying’ between her boisterous sons in the backseat – and ended with her six-year-old having a tooth knocked out. Butter wouldn’t melt! Samantha Simmonds and husband Phillip Davies with their children, two, four and six . In a searingly honest account that plenty of exhausted parents will relate to, Miss Simmonds, 42, described how she took some time off work to spend with her children – but said the break turned into a string of tantrums and bickering. Miss Simmonds is married to Phillip Davies, the owner of online auction business Flogit4u, and the couple have a daughter aged two and sons aged four and six. Describing a trip back from Manchester to London, the newsreader wrote on her blog that four hours into a fraught journey, her six-year-old son started screaming. She said: ‘I turned round to see blood and saliva flying towards me and all over [the six-year-old’s] face. I started yelling in shock and shouted to the four-year-old, “What have you done?” ‘What he had done was knock one of his brother’s teeth out! How is that even possible?’ After ‘one packet of wet wipes, a lot of blood and tears’, she wrote, the situation was calmer, and it wasn’t long before her enterprising son was negotiating more money from the tooth fairy ‘due to blood loss and trauma’. Honest: In her blog post, the Sky newsreader and mother-of-three also describes ‘working mum guilt’ The newsreader – who has worked for Channel 5 and BBC News as well as Sky – said she struggled to cope when the boys turned on each other in the car. ‘On their own they are all gorgeous – a delight – a pleasure! Together they are a ticking time bomb,’ she wrote. ‘Just how long before the first verbal or physical punch is thrown is anyone’s guess. It is this – the dynamics of the three of them all together that I find the single hardest thing about being a parent … I feel unprepared and frustratingly un-forewarned of the trials and tribulations of dealing with my children en masse.’ In the post, which does not give her children’s names, she also describes the ‘working mum guilt’ shared by many, and how she tries to squeeze in as many activities as possible during precious time off. ‘Many would argue I do too much …. that may well be so, but I genuinely love our outings and seeing the joy and wonder on their faces,’ she wrote. But the dream can quickly turn into a nightmare when ‘their testosterone-fuelled little bodies means they cannot keep their hands off each other for more than a few minutes at a time’. She added: ‘Either kicking one another while sitting on the sofa, or wrestling around the house and taking it in turn to jump on each other’s heads – our two-year-old daughter included. ‘Pre parenthood, like many childless adults I would stare agog in the streets and in restaurants – at the out of control parent screaming at their equally out of control children … Oh how easy it is to judge! I am now that parent!’","Samantha Simmonds posted honest blog about Easter family break .

"A five-month-old baby whose parents created a 30-item 'bucket list' for their  terminally ill son has tragically died - with sadly only one item ticked off. Elijah McCrae's heartbroken parents, Jessica and Andrew, remembered the 'happiest baby ever', after he died in his mother's arms on Monday evening. 'We thought we had at least another week,' Ms McCrae said. 'It is with a heavy heart, that our baby Elijah has passed away. He passed peacefully in my arms. They tried to revive him but we knew he was telling us it's his time.' 'We thought we had at least another week,' Ms McCrae said. 'It is with a heavy heart, that our baby Elijah has passed away. He passed peacefully in my arms' In a series of heartbreaking posts, Ms McCrae documented the gut-wrenching final stages of their beloved son's fight for life. 'I'd rather death happen suddenly than have to grieve the impending death of my child then grieve again when he dies,' she posted on April 17. 'I became so overwhelmed at knowing that one day I will be in the house without him in this world.' On the morning of April 19, the parents were overwhelmed by love and hope, and shared a picture of Elijah in his hospital bed. 'He is full of smiles - love this kid,' it read. 'Tomorrow we discuss Elijah's end of life care in a multidisciplinary meeting. And hopefully we can then go home within a few days.' That hope was replaced by fear later in the day, when Elijah took a turn for the worse. 'About an hour and a half ago I saw Elijah stop breathing,' she posted about 8pm on April 19. Little Elijah suffered with the fatal genetic disease Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). He was born strong, before becoming 'very floppy' ‘His sweet face will always know how to bring a smile to my face, even long after he has left us,' his mum Jessica McCrae said . 'He was white and he closed his eyes. This was the first time I saw him like that. 'He is incredibly weak and we are now wondering what it all means. This means that we will most likely never be going home. I fainted when I saw his chest stop rising and falling. Amid the unimaginable dread, his parents were given a moment of immense happiness, when their baby Elijah began 'smiling like nothing happened' after the scare. Hours later, Elijah died in his mother's loving arms. The first item ticked off Ellijah's list was a trip to  the Sydney Royal Easter Show so he could meet all of the animals . Andrew, Jessica and Elijah had a day out  at the Easter Show earlier this month . Elijah is pictured with some of his furry friends. His parents had hoped to take him to Sydney Wildlife World and Featherdale Wildlife Park as well . His parents created the to-do list after he was diagnosed with a genetic illness that meant he would likely not live to see his second birthday. Elijah suffered from Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), which saw him get weaker as he got older. The family, from Penrith in Sydney's west, were able to visit the Sydney Royal Easter Show - ticking off one of the items on the bucket list. The list included plans to take a road trip to Queensland to watching the sunrise, and visits to Sydney's aquarium and Opera House, Ms McCrae told Daily Mail Australia. 'Just because he can't move his body doesn't mean he can't enjoy life any other way, like the rest of us can,' she said. Andrew McCrae cradles his little boy . Born strong, he became 'very floppy'. His parents were devastated when he was diagnosed. They created the list in an effort to avoid wallowing in the sadness of the shocking situation. 'You can sit there and be depressed about it, or say, ""he's here for two years, we've got to make the most of it,' Jessica said. They created the list out of their love for their son, and heartbreak at seeing other happy families having fun with their grown children. 'I thought, ""let's make a bucket list. 'I've got my own - like travelling the world - but (Elijah) won't ever be able to do things like that. 'So why don't we do things we would do with a child when we're older? 'The hardest thing is seeing other families, especially when you go out and see these families having fun,' Jessica said. 'We have to enjoy it now. We don't get to see him enjoy these things when he's like 10, we have to do it now.' The family had made a fundraising page in the hope they could use the money to complete the list together. But the item they want the most is to celebrate Elijah's first birthday with a big party, and had hoped he would make it to that milestone. 'We have to enjoy it now. We don't get to see him enjoy these things when he's like 10, we have to do it now' 'The hardest thing is seeing other families, especially when you go out and see these families having fun,' Jessica said . Elijah was born very strong but has lost a lot of muscle because of his condition. ''It breaks you, to see your baby get so weak,' his mum said . 1. Trip to New Zealand . 2. The Gold Coast . 3.

"While airlines are planning to cram even more passengers on Boeing’s next generation of planes, the manufacturer says it has come up with a way to get all of their luggage on board. The world’s largest aerospace company is showing off its roomier overhead luggage bins, which will be available on its 737 family of planes. Designed for future aircraft which will be used by the likes of Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines, the ‘Space Bins’ can hold 50 per cent more carry-on luggage than existing compartments on the current fleet of 737s. Scroll down for video . Boeing's roomier 'Space Bins' (left) can hold two more bags than existing compartments (left) on 737 planes . Finding a spot for a carry-on bag, especially during a budget flight that charges for checked bags, can be one of the most stressful experiences for passengers. Boeing said the redesigned bins can hold six standard-sized bags – two more than the current set-up. That means 737-900ER or 737 MAX 9 planes will be able to hold 194 bags in the cabin, compared to 132 in the current configuration. Its 737-800 or 737 MAX 8 planes will hold 174 (compared to 118) and the 737-700 or 737 MAX 7 planes will hold 130 (compared to 90). The bins have been tested by a group of ‘frequent fliers’ who were hand-picked by Boeing . Boeing is promising faster boarding and turnaround times at the gate with the larger overhead bins . The Chicago-based manufacturer said the ‘Space Bins’ have a lower lip height, making it easier to load bags and see inside. The bins have been tested by a group of ‘frequent fliers’ who were hand-picked by Boeing. Passenger Daniel Jones said in a statement: ‘They're enormous compared to the other bins. I won't have to gate check my bags anymore. So far two airlines – Delta and Alaska – have ordered the new bins, which can be installed on existing 737s . ‘Boarding will be a lot quicker plus I won't have to help my girlfriend load her bags because she can reach these bins a lot easier.’ With larger overhead bins Boeing is promising faster boarding and turnaround times at the gate. So far two airlines – Delta and Alaska – have ordered the new bins, which are also available for retrofit on next-generation 737s currently in use. The bins will likely arrive in Europe within the next few years. Monarch Airlines and Thomson Airways have committed to order dozens of 737 MAX aircraft. Ryanair currently uses nothing but the 737-800 on its routes, but has reached a deal for up to 200 737 MAX 200s.","The 'Space Bins' have been designed for the next generation of 737s .

"A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: ‘I stopped because I couldn’t see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.’ Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff . The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to ‘use an ATM’ before making a run for it. ‘The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi – I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,’ Mr Robinson told the inquest. ‘Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.’ Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker. Paramedics arrived at the scene after his body was discovered in the morning by a dog walker . A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out.  Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were . Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Barkley said: ‘It is likely that he became disorientated and there is no evidence that he knew where he was at the time. ‘There is no way he could have known the danger that lay in front of him. The following day with the benefit of light it was clear the danger he faced by the sheer drop off the cliff just yards beyond the fence.’ Mr Phillips worked for Pretty Green, the clothing label run by Oasis star Liam Gallagher. He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend’s house but he and his friends didn’t have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by ‘dodging’ the fare. Mr Phillips ran off into the ‘pitch black’ and fell down a cliff at the end of the disused Northern Promenade – also called The Dardanelles. Police search the scene at the bottom of the cliff where his body was discovered .","Jacob Phillips plunged down cliff after leaping over a fence in the dark .
