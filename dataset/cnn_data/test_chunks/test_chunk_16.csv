"The records are tumbling and Leicester’s belief is growing. Their 2-0 victory over Swansea made it three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000, lifting Nigel Pearson’s side to 17th and ending their five-month spell at the bottom. All this after just two wins in their previous 24 games. Most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time. Instead, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland are now shorter odds to go down with bookmakers. In truth, there have been no significant changes to affect results. Pearson has applied the same principles throughout the season, except now Leicester are taking more chances. Here Sportsmail assesses the key themes of Leicester’s revival. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring against Swansea during his side's 2-0 win . Scoring surge . Andy King’s late tap-in meant Leicester have scored two or more goals in a fourth consecutive top-flight match for the first time since May 2000. Previously, Leicester were creating plenty but fluffing their lines. Against Crystal Palace in February, for example, they had five shots on target, eight shots off target, six shots blocked – and failed to find the net, losing 1-0. They had six shots on target against Swansea, with a much better success rate. Andy King scores Leicester's second goal to seal three points against Swansea at the King Power Stadium . Cambiasso class . Ulloa scored his first Premier League goal in 647 minutes; last scoring on Boxing Day 2014. Esteban Cambiasso will surely be named Leicester’s player of the season come what may. The Argentine has sprinkled high quality to their midfield, winning possession and conducting play like a grand master plots chess moves. At 34, his experience is now shining through – a calm head even as circumstances appeared brittle. His goal to set up the win over West Ham was special too. His pass completion was not outstanding against Swansea – just 68.3 per cent – but that is largely because he tried difficult balls to get his team on the front foot. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso puts in another classy performance against Swansea on Saturday . Schmeichel sensational . With the score at 1-0, Swansea unlocked the Leicester defence to send Nelson Oliveira through on goal. Kasper Schmeichel was out in a flash, spreading himself large and deflecting the finish wide. It was a hugely important moment. The Danish goalkeeper was on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal for more than three months of this season, but has returned at peak form for this crucial period. Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel gets down quickly and makes himself big to save from Nelson Oliveria . Adept at adapting . Aside from Schmeichel’s injury, Pearson has been able to call a mainly full-strength squad most weeks. He has changed personnel – only Wes Morgan has more than 30 starts under his belt – and players appear fresh when other squads may be tiring. He is flexible with his tactics, changing during games to suit the situation. He is getting it right recently. Against West Bromwich Albion he began with 4-3-1-2 but switched to 3-5-2 when trailing at half-time. Against Swansea, he started with an attacking 3-4-1-2 but implemented a back four when ahead. King slides in with a strong challenge on Swansea's Oliveria during the Premier League match on Saturday . Pearson’s strength . The Leicester manager has been on the touchline rather than high in the stands recently, and uses his position to effect rather than for show. He kept players motivated at the Hawthorns and used a break in play against Swansea to give an impromptu team talk. He has been in remarkable survivals before, at Carlisle, Southampton, and West Brom, and knows what is required. He has managed to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality even after the phantom sacking. The players have always supported him. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gives instructions to his players ahead of the 2-0 win over Swansea . Belief building . The great escape theme was hummed loudly by Leicester fans at fullt-time, and atmospheres at the King Power Stadium have been very noisy for the wins over West Ham and Swansea. That will continue for four of the final six games, with home comfort looking vital. Burnley at Turf Moor awaits first, and Leonardo Ulloa, who scored the opening goal, insists Leicester must not let their intensity dip. He also thinks Leicester’s sustained spell in the relegation zone has equipped them with the psychological tools to claw their way up. ‘If you know this situation at the bottom you play different, the mentality is a little different,’ he said. ‘Now with a good result and we have to push on.’ A Leicester fan holds up a sign backing the team to win their battle against relegation this season .","Leicester have recorded three consecutive Premier League wins .

"Dele Alli is excited by the prospect of playing under Mauricio Pochettino next season and believes Tottenham are the 'perfect' club for him. This has been a whirlwind season for the 19-year-old, with his exceptional performances for MK Dons earning a £5million move to White Hart Lane in February. Alli has yet to feature for Spurs having been immediately loaned back to his boyhood club, where he has continued to impress - so much so that on Sunday he was crowned the Football League Young Player of the Year. MK Dons teenager Dele Alli picked up the Young Player of the Year award on Sunday night . The midfielder was quick to credit MK Dons upon picking up the award and is determined to repay their faith by helping them secure promotion to the Championship. 'MK has got a special place in my heart but obviously I have signed to Tottenham,' Alli said. 'Whilst I am at MK, I am just going to be focused on them, right until the end of the season. 'To get promotion would be the perfect ending to a fairytale, really. 'Obviously, being from MK and playing for MK my whole life, to get us promoted would be a dream come true.' The talented midfielder's performances led to Tottenham signing him for £5million in January transfer window . The Dons sit third in League One and have three matches to make up the one-point gap Preston hold in the final automatic promotion spot. Alli has been key to Karl Robinson's side, scoring 16 goals in 41 appearances, but admits it has not always been easy to concentrate as the speculation mounted. 'I am not going to lie and say it hasn't been hard because it has,' he said. 'For a few years now there have been rumours of me going places. I've been speaking to my agent to see what it is all about. 'Obviously the last year really it has picked up a bit and there has been a lot more speculation about me going other places. Alli paid tribute to Tottenham boss Pochettino for trusting young players . 'In this transfer window, towards the end, it was a bit of a rollercoaster, to be fair. 'When it came that I could come to Tottenham, obviously I had a look and I spoke to my agent. We had to think about the manager and all the pros and cons about it. 'We couldn't think of anything wrong, really, about it - it is the perfect club for me, hopefully. I am just going to do the best I can.' The chance to work with Pochettino is clearly one of the positives for Alli, given the former Argentina international's willingness to give young players a chance. 'That's the big thing for youngsters,' he said. 'When you go, you don't want a manager that's not going to have any trust in young players. 'I think with him you can see already that he has a lot of faith in youngsters and I think as a young player you need that, just for confidence in yourself. 'You need a manager that believes in you and shows that he believes in you by playing you.'","Dele Alli signed for Tottenham in the January transfer window for £5million .

"Swansea boss Garry Monk has responded to speculation linking him to the West Ham job by insisting the perfect man to manage the club is already in place at Upton Park. Sam Allardyce's current contract expires at the end of the season, and it has been suggested West Ham's owners might go in a different direction ahead of the club's move to the Olympic Stadium at the start of the 2016-17 campaign. Monk has been touted as a potential candidate after leading Swansea to a record-equalling 47 Barclays Premier League points with six games left, but the 36-year-old expressed his bemusement should the London club look elsewhere this summer. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is out of contract at the end of the season and could leave the club . Garry Monk has been touted as a potential replacement but insists Allardyce is a perfect fit for West Ham . Allardyce has overseen a solid season in the league so far this term and the Hammers are ninth in the table . 'West Ham have a fantastic manager in place,' Monk said ahead of Swansea's trip to bottom-placed Leicester on Saturday. 'For them to be looking elsewhere - if they are - I think they've already got the manager there who's had a fantastic season. 'West Ham have done exceptionally well this season, progressed again, and that's what you want from a club.' Eighth-placed Swansea are four points better off than the Hammers, who have slipped to ninth after a wretched run of only two wins in their last 14 league games. Monk, the youngest manager in the Premier League, has also earned plaudits for the way Swansea have played this season and kept his side on track following the January sale of top scorer Wilfried Bony to Manchester City. 'I look at that type of speculation as a compliment to the way myself and the team have worked this season,' Monk said. Swansea have had to cope with the January sale of star player Wilfried Bony to Manchester City for £28m . 'It shows we're progressing and going in the right direction. 'But West Ham is nothing to do with me. My focus is purely on Swansea and wishing to finish the season strong - and that will remain my focus. 'The points record was a target we talked about, we committed to the work we wanted to put in place and to achieve it. 'The players deserve massive credit but the whole thing is to get past it and we have six games to hopefully do that. 'We've just focussed on the next game, rather than positions, and that is the same this weekend . 'I'm surprised where Leicester are because of the quality they have, but they've put themselves in a good position to try to get out of it, so we've got to make sure our attitude and mentality is right.' Swansea's French forward Bafetimbi Gomis (left) has been sidelined for a month with a hamstring injury . Swansea must do without striker Bafetimbi Gomis for the next month as the France international will be sidelined by a hamstring injury picked up against Everton last weekend. Gomis had scored four goals in his last seven games and Monk admits the striker's loss has come at the wrong time. 'It's a blow because he's been very confident and showing why I brought him to the club,' Monk said. 'He's been a big player for us and it's disappointing because he was hitting a great bit of form, scoring goals and contributing to the team. 'I'm sure Bafe will come back fresh and he has the ability to really make a mark here, but it's a chance for someone else to step up and score some goals.'

"Rangers' teenage striker Ryan Hardie marked his first ever Light Blues start with a brace as Stuart McCall's side clinched a 3-1 win over Dumbarton. The 18-year-old had made just four substitute appearances before facing the Sons at the Dumbarton Stadium, but his double put Rangers in command after they fell behind to Mark Wilson's second-minute opener. The former Celtic full-back's last goal was also against Rangers - he netted the Hoops' winner in a controversial Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead in March 2011. Rangers' teenage striker Ryan Hardie scored a brace on his full debut against Dumbarton on Saturday . Hardie's brace comes as Rangers boss Stuart McCall fulfills his promise of fielding more academy players . A touchline bust-up between then Celtic boss Neil Lennon and Gers assistant Ally McCoist sparked a summit on sectarianism but there was no further drama this time as Haris Vuckic fired home a spectacular third and Rangers eased to victory. McCall promised his students from the Murray Park youth ranks they would be given their chance to impress when he took over last month. And he stayed good to his word as Hardie - who has notched more than 30 times for the club's under-20s side - and winger Tom Walsh came in to replace Kenny Miller and Dean Shiels following Wednesday's 1-1 slip-up at Livingston. But Nicky Clark's horror miss after less than a minute was not the start the Ibrox boss was looking for, especially when Wilson showed the Gers striker how it should have been done 60 seconds later. Darren McGregor should have cleared Mark Gilhaney's cross but got caught underneath the ball and could only head it straight to the ex-Hoops defender. The 30-year-old averages just a goal a season but showed no hesitancy as he flashed a left-footed strike past Cammy Bell to give the Sons a shock lead. Lee McCulloch thought he had the visitors level, only for home keeper Danny Rogers to produce a stunning reaction stop to keep out the skipper's volley. But Hardie did find the net after 10 minutes as he capped his full debut with a dream goal. Sons defender Andy Graham could not live with the teenager's pace as he latched on to Vuckic's through ball and raced in on goal. Rogers got a hand to the youngster's low shot but Hardie stayed alert and followed in to force the ball over the line before Stuart Findlay could block. Rogers did better with McGregor's powerful strike, but Rangers suffered another scare when Dylan Easton danced past McCulloch before lashing just wide of Bell's goal. Tom Walsh and Nicky Law fired over as McCall's team looked for the lead, but there was no breakthrough by the interval. But they only had to wait three minutes into the second period for Hardie to strike again. Rangers playmarker Haris Vuckic (right) has become a fan-favourite during his loan spell from Newcastle . McGregor took a high ball and hooked it wide to Wallace, whose cross flew towards the youngster at an awkward height. But, with his back to goal, he sent the ball over his own shoulder with a flick of his toe and watched it bounce past Rogers' dive into the bottom corner. Now in front, Rangers went for Dumbarton's throat and got their reward as Vuckic collected Law's short pass before whipping an unstoppable 25-yard shot into the top-left corner. The Sons, though, came up with a couple of reminders that they should not be discounted yet as Scott Taggert fired just over before on-loan Celtic defender Findlay leapt unmarked to head straight at Bell. Hardie, though, was looking to make his impressive start even more special and nearly grabbed himself a hat-trick as his attempted lob sailed just over Rogers' crossbar. But he was denied his treble when McCall afforded the frontman a standing ovation as he was replaced by Calum Gallacher with five minutes left. Rangers were not satisfied yet, though, and nearly had a fourth when Law shook the bar from the edge of the box, while Clark was not far away with an ambitious 40-yard volley.

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall insists it will not be a major disaster if his side are forced to play two extra games to reclaim their Premiership return. The Gers currently lead the way in the race for second spot in the Championship, with a one-point advantage over Hibernian and a six-point cushion separating them from Queen of the South. Finishing immediately behind newly-crowned champions Hearts would spare the Ibrox men the bother of two extra hazardous games in the play-offs, with the teams finishing third and fourth facing off over two legs before taking on the second tier's runners-up. The winner of that tie then meets the Premiership's second-bottom side in a crucial winner-takes-all battle. Stuart McCall is relaxed about the prospect of Rangers finishing third in the Scottish Championship . But having stumbled to a 3-0 defeat against Queens and a 1-1 draw with basement side Livingston either side of Sunday's four-goal romp over Raith, there is no guarantee the Light Blues will see off Saturday's trip to Dumbarton without another slip-up. McCall, though, is ready to take whatever outcome is thrown his way. He said: 'At this moment second place is in our own hands. If you'd given me that a few weeks ago when I first came in, I'd have snapped your hands off for it. 'There were one or two people who thought we wouldn't even reach the play-offs. McCall faces the media on Friday ahead of Saturday's trip to Dumbarton as Rangers look to hold on to second . 'We've done that first part. Obviously we want to get second but Hibs and Queens want the same. 'You don't want to have to play the extra games but if you have to, you will. If you have to get through to the top league by playing six games then so be it. 'Of course it's important to us to finish second. But if we finish third or fourth that does not mean we won't get promotion. It's not the end of the world.' McCall was also happy to see a peaceful resolution reached after the row raised by the Scottish Professional Football League's messy meddling with the Championship fixture list. Rangers' final-day tie with Hearts at Tynecastle was pushed back 24 hours to Sunday, May 3, to accommodate Sky Sports. McCall joins in training on Friday as the Rangers boss prepares his side for Saturday's clash . But that left Hibs raging as having played their last game at Falkirk on the Saturday, they claimed McCall's team would be advantaged by the fact they would know the result required in Gorgie to claim second. Compromise was reached when Sky gave the league permission to switch the Hearts-Rangers tie back to its original May 2 slot. 'Everyone playing at the same time is fine and the right thing to do,' said McCall. But there could yet be more tinkering with the schedule to come. Hibs and Falkirk - who have yet to be counted out of the play-off chase - will battle for a place in the William Hill Scottish Cup final on Saturday, leaving the possibility that the second leg of the play-off final may have to be pushed back into June. Rangers dropped two points at Championship bottom side Livingston in their bid for promotion . The SPFL is expected to announce early next week if a change of date is required but Rangers are bracing themselves for an administrative nightmare, with 12 first-team members due to become free agents on June 1. McCall confirmed the club's five loanees from Newcastle are registered until June 9, and will be free to play whatever happens. But he admitted the club may have to hand short-term deals to their players to see them through to the re-arranged date. 'We won't think about it until it becomes a problem,' he said. 'But it will certainly need to be something that is looked at if that does become the case, as we have almost a dozen players whose contract will be up at the end of May.'","Rangers are currently second in the Championship with three games to go .

"He came for revenge and left having inflicted a humiliating defeat which leaves sorry Sunderland perhaps regretting they ever crossed Alan Pardew. The Crystal Palace boss would not admit as much, but the grin he wore in the wake of Yannick Bolasie's hat-trick goal told of his satisfaction. Four times on the spin he suffered defeat as Newcastle manager in Tyne-Wear derbies. It was a ruinous run which fractured his relationship with the club's fans and contributed towards his decision to quit Tyneside for south London in January. Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie was the hero at the Stadium of Light having scored a hat-trick for the Eagles against Sunderland .

This was his first trip back to the North East and boy did he enjoy it. Palace now have 25 points from a possible 36 under his care and the table for 2015 alone has the Eagles soaring in fifth, two points behind champions elect Chelsea. His team were devastating on Saturday, a ruthless and unforgiving frontline of Bolasie, Glenn Murray, Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Zaha proving too powerful and too fast for a Black Cats defence which is fast running out of lives. Dick Advocaat was perhaps wishing he had remained in Holland as he watched them surrender to four goals inside 17 minutes at the start of the second half.

James McArthur challenges Black Cats striker Connor Wickham at the Stadium of Light as Crystal Palace stormed to victory . Last weekend he was celebrating a Tyne-Wear derby victory and there was talk of him extending his stay beyond the end of this season. Sunderland, though, are heading for the Championship and Advocaat's reputation is on the line. Pardew's standing, however, has never been higher. He resisted temptation to crow over the identity of the victims and instead hailed the players who have now won four on the bounce. 'We were excellent. We were almost unplayable,' said Pardew. 'We're a team that is bang in form and as a manager you can only be so proud. The scoreline flattered Sunderland a little bit. That front quartet were irresistible at times. We are an honest group with that pace and power and that makes us a very dangerous team.' Bolasie's treble bettered his total from the entirety of this campaign. And Pardew added: 'I'm surprised he hasn't scored more goals. He's the first Palace player to get a Premier League hat-trick as well, so that is a surprise. 'He's at an age where he is improving. The final moment still needs to improve but he was excellent in that respect here.'

Zaha joins an ecstatic Bolasie (left) after the Congolese forward produced a stunning hat-trick in the second-half against Sunderland . Advocaat had watched from home in Holland four weeks ago as Aston Villa won 4-0 at the Stadium of Light. This latest collapse leaves them just two places and three points above the drop zone. And the new boss said: 'I was shocked. You can see what can change in just six days. We were not in the game. Even in the first half Palace were better. 'We gave it all away inside just seven minutes. The work-rate from their strikers and the pace they have made it very difficult. We did not create any chances. That is a big concern. 'But I knew when I started this job that it would be difficult. We still have six games. We can still stay up. We need to get our confidence back.' Bolasie made a point to go and celebrate with Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew after his quick-fire hat-trick during the 4-1 victory . Sunderland strikers Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe can't hide their disappointment having been comprehensively beaten on Saturday . The first half had been a depressing demonstration of two sides fouling one another, an occasional half-chance punctuating the boredom. Jack Rodwell lunged recklessly into the leg of James McArthur with the ball long gone and was lucky to see just yellow. We did see red moments later, albeit the blood streaming from Costel Pantilimon's mouth after Scott Dann planted his boot in the goalkeeper's face when competing for a loose ball. Dann, in fairness, was unfortunate to be booked. And the game soon had its third caution when Lee Cattermole, having been robbed by Bolasie on halfway, desperately hauled the forward back by the trim of his shirt. Palace, though, broke the tedium with their early blitz after the break. Bolasie was the provider for the opener when his cross was deflected onto the brow of Murray, who planted home from four yards for his sixth goal in as many matches.

The visitors were three in front come the 54th minute, and again a long ball proved Sunderland's undoing as Bolasie pounced to rob the dithering John O'Shea before lifting over Pantilimon. He did not have to wait long for his hat-trick. Palace broke through Murray down the right and he squared for Bolasie who, after out-scrapping Pantilimon and Santiago Vergini, poked home for his first senior treble. Sunderland did steal a barely deserved consolation when Connor Wickham turned in Patrick Van Aanholt's cross, but it mattered not and news of Leicester and Aston Villa's victories has them looking down once more. For Pardew, things are very much looking up.","Alan Pardew's side scored second-half treble within five minutes to secure the three points .

"Stewart Regan insists Dave King faces a challenge to convince the SFA he is a 'fit and proper' person to be chairman of Rangers. The South Africa-based businessman ousted the previous directors last month and plans a return to the Ibrox boardroom if he can overcome SFA obstacles. King has delayed the process of nominating himself as chairman until he can persuade the governing body's Professional Game Board that 41 convictions under South African tax law are not a breach of SFA regulations. Dave King (centre) will have to convince the SFA that he is suitable to become the next Rangers chairman . He also faces questions about his role as a club director when the oldco Ibrox outfit plunged into liquidation in the summer of 2012. Rangers want SFA clearance for King before commencing with a cash-raising rights issue for existing shareholders. Refusing to put a timescale on when a decision will come, Regan said: 'We are in discussions with Rangers and their advisors and we are gathering information on Mr King. When we have all of that information in, the board will consider it and decide whether or not we are prepared to accept Dave King as a fit and proper person to be chairman of Rangers. We are not in a position to put a timescale on that. 'We need any evidence from Mr King that would support why he believes that he is fit and proper in consideration to the list of criteria in our Article 10 which cover all of the areas regarding track record, background, insolvency and any convictions. 'His tax convictions are a challenge for him and the club to try and present a case whereby the board can view it positively.' King's ally Paul Murray, serving as interim chairman, faces his own fit and proper scrutiny under Article 10. SFA chief Stewart Regan says that King must give evidence to support his case to be chairman at Ibrox . 'Paul Murray, equally, is being considered given that he was a director of a football club that has been in an insolvency event in the last five years,' added Regan. King received clearance from the Court of Session to return to the boardroom after serving as a director in the Ibrox oldco and hopes that will help the SFA to reach a decision in his favour. Rangers, meanwhile, have accepted fines totalling £5,500 for breaking SFA disciplinary rules in relation to Newcastle owner Mike Ashley's involvement with the club.

"Attention is already turning to next season at Liverpool after their FA Cup semi-final exit at the hands of Aston Villa. Unless one of the top four falter dramatically in the final six Premier League games of the season, Liverpool will also miss out on Champions League qualification after only a season back in Europe's elite club competition. Brendan Rodgers undoubtedly needs to reinforce his squad, and Sportsmail assesses Liverpool's chances of landing five of their main targets. DANNY INGS, BURNLEY . Danny Ings has impressed at Burnley this season and is set to leave Turf Moor when his contract expires . Mario Balotelli (left) and Rickie Lambert appear set to depart Liverpool at the end of the season .

PSG have also made enquiries, as have United, who hope Louis Van Gaal's presence can sway the deal their way.

"Sam Allardyce has fired a warning to full back Aaron Cresswell - whose been linked with a move to Manchester City - that the grass isn't always greener and he should look at Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair as examples. The West Ham star has had a fine debut season in the Premier League, with a number of big clubs circling him for a possible summer move. But Allardyce believes that City's previous British purchases speak volumes and that the 25-year-old should remain where he is. Aaron Cresswell (left) has been linked with a move to Manchester City but Sam Allardyce has warned him . He wrote in his Evening Standard column: 'What makes players like him attractive to big clubs is that he is home-grown and squads must have eight of those in the Premier League. 'Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair, for example, both spent time at City but did not play a great deal. 'They're featuring more regularly now, for Sunderland and on loan at Aston Villa respectively, but the decision for a player like Sinclair is would he be willing to join another club on a permanent deal if it meant less money?' The left back scored a stunning free-kick last weekend against Stoke, as he showed his attacking prowess, as well as his defensive solidity. It remains to be seen if Cresswell will be at the club next season but with an England call-up being touted, West Ham may face a tough task of keeping their prized asset.

"A rare insight into Manchester United's unpopular owners has lifted the lid on how they run the club. The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening £800m takeover in 2005. Scroll down for video . Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005 . The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004 . In it, he claims: . • Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons . • The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea . • Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them . • The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors . • Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room . • The Glazers are 'not ogres' Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side. Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. 'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit. But they were back to speak to staff the following day. Sir Alex Ferguson shares a joke with Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer (L-R) in June, 2005 . A young United fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal . 'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds. Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room. 'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.' Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres – on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family. He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.' In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned. 'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors. 'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad. 'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over? Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval . Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani . 'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.' Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college. Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff. Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic. 'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals. Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel. 'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes. 'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.' Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer (L-R) watch United take on Burnley at Old Trafford earlier this season . The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani . Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs. 'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.' He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?' Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season. The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport. 'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes. 'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.' Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal. United fans burn a Malcolm Glazer dummy during a protest outside Old Trafford in May, 2005 . He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results. He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming. Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'. 'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered. Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'.

"Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny had more than one reason to celebrate on Saturday. Just hours after he had played the full 120 minutes it took for the Gunners to grind out a 2-1 win in extra-time over Reading in a tense FA Cup semi-final, Szczesny was treated to a lovely birthday surprise courtesy of his singer-songwriter girlfriend Mariana Luczenko. The Poland international, now 25, was joined at his home by family and friends as well as one of his favourite rock bands, 'Lemon', who delivered a private performance.

There are also pictures from Szczesny's childhood and family holidays as the goalkeeper turns 25 . Szczesny was clearly touched by the efforts of his girlfriend and took to Instagram on Monday to thank her. 'Best birthday ever!' he wrote. Arsenal's triumph over Reading sees them reach the FA Cup final for the second consecutive season, having also won the competition last year against Hull City. This year, it will be Tim Sherwood's Aston Villa who stand between the Gunners and more glory, after they defeated Liverpool in the other semi-final on Sunday. Szczesny joined Arsenal's academy in 2006 from hometown club Legia Warsaw and graduated to the first-team in three years later. Although he has racked up nearly 200 appearances for the north London outfit since then, this season has raised question marks over Szczesny's long-term future. He was caught smoking in the wake of Arsenal's 2-0 Premier League loss at Southampton on New Year's Day and has only made Cup appearances since then. Factor in the form of fellow goalkeeper David Ospina, who inherited Szczesny's role in the league and there is a cloud of uncertainty around the Polish stopper.

"The Fulham fans in the Jimmy Steed Stand applauded their team at the final whistle. It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point . The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley . He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos. Not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages, feeding striker Smith well. Ross McCormack headed over a stranded Stephen Henderson with just eight minutes played in London . McCormack celebrates his goal in front of the traveling Fulham fans with just eight minutes played . Charlton Athletic: Henderson, Gomez, Ben Haim, Johnson, Fox, Johann Gudmundsson, Cousins, Diarra, Bulot (Eagles 70) Vetokele (Church 79) Watt . Subs: Bikey Amougou, Wiggins, Lennon, Dmitrovic, Lepoint . Fulham: Bettinelli, Hoogland, Burn, Turner, Husband, Parker, Tunnicliffe, Guthrie,(Kacaniklic 68), Kavanagh (Ruiz 68), Smith, McCormack . Subs: Kiraly, Stafylidis, Woodrow, Rodallega, Donnelly . But Charlton hit back with a 16th minute equaliser. Morgan Fox’s cross bounced across the front of goal and Frederic Bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect. It was left for a waiting Johann Gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner. Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who seemed rooted to the spot, wisely dragged a furious James Husband, who seemed to believe the goal offside, from a confrontation with the linesman. Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute. Matt Smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint James Husband cross but Henderson did well to thwart the effort. Charlton soon asserted control with Tony Watt going close three times before Parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge. The Charlton players were outraged when referee Andy Madley awarded Fulham a free kick 25 yards out deep into stoppage time but McCormack blasted the ball over the bar. Joseph Gomez  and Dan Burn fight for the ball during match between Charlton Athletic and Fulham . Fulham now sit 20th in the table eight points clear of fellow London rivals Millwall, but Symons is refusing to relax just yet. He said: ‘We’re definitely not safe until it’s mathematically sure because this league is topsy turvy at both ends and it is going to go to the wire.

"Premier League clubs looking for players at Barcelona and Real Madrid this summer will find a team’s worth. Bara want limited departures from the first team this summer because they can’t sign players until January but they also want to blood young players from their B-team out on loan at higher leagues because their second string is likely to be playing third division football. At Real Madrid the need for a clear-out could make the exodus bigger than in most other seasons and boy wonder Martin Odegaard will need a loan club. Sportsmail look at 10 potential Clasico exports. Martin Odegaard (right) is expected to go out on loan from Real Madrid to gain experience next season . PEDRO . He will probably stay for another year but there will be no shortage of suitors for the 27-year-old if he does decide he’s had enough. Much may depend on the part he plays in the end of the season at the Camp Nou as Luis Suarez's arrival has seen his opportunities restricted this year. Pedro could be on his way out of Barcelona after falling down the pecking order since Luis Suarez's arrival . If Real Madrid step up their interest in David de Gea, it could mark the end of Iker Casillas's time at the club . IKER CASILLAS . Iker Casillas doesn’t want to leave but if Real Madrid sign David de Gea he may be more tempted. Arsenal have been interested in the past and London would suit the Spain international. MARTIN MONTOYA . Martin Montoya played in midweek against PSG because Dani Alves was suspended but there is little faith in his ability to be the Brazilian’s long-term successor. Liverpool have looked at the defender before. Not for nothing was he called up to the Spain squad aged 19. At the right club the 24-year-old would thrive. Martin Montoya is not considered to be the long-term replacement for Dani Alves at Barcelona . FABIO COENTRAO . Fabio Coentrao remains one of the biggest mysteries of Real Madrid’s transfer policy in recent years. Jose Mourinho requested the player in his second season at the club and he was brought in for £22million. He has played less than 40 percent of possible minutes and will be sold in the summer. Inexplicably, he always looks a good player for Portugal and his ability to play left back or left midfield is an added plus. Fabio Coentrao (right) has struggled to impress at Madrid and could be offloaded in the summer . Munir El Haddadi (left) could be loaned out next season with attacking opportunities limited at the Nou Camp . MUNIR EL HADDADI . Another already called up by Spain because Vicente del Bosque did not want to lose him to Morocco. The 19-year-old was brilliant for Barcelona earlier in the season, often starting ahead of Pedro as everyone waited for Suarez’s return. He was impressive but now Barça are at full strength and he could be loaned out. ASIER ILLARRAMENDI . Asier Illaramendi, 25, is beyond the point of being able to grow as a player with the occasional first team start. He is another in the same ‘strange signing’ bracket as Coentrao. The midfielder cost £27million from Real Sociedad two years ago and has never looked good enough to play for Madrid. Liverpool have looked at him but Real Sociedad are keen to take him back. Asier Illarramendi has had his progress hindered by a lack of starting opportunities at Real Madrid . Somewhere between the two he will find his level. JESE . Jese can play anywhere across the front and looked like being the late entry in Vicente del Bosque’s Spain squad last season until he tore his cruciate ligament. It’s been a long way back and as ever at Madrid holding down a first team place in the forward line is next to impossible. Jese will only be sent on loan to gain experience as Madrid see him as a first team regular one day . Jese (left) has endured a long recovery from injury after tearing his cruciate ligament last year . Real will only loan him, because they do see the 22-year-old graduating to the first team one day. A season’s experience in England would work wonders. SERGI SAMPER . Spurs were keen on 20-year-old Sergi Samper when Andre Villas-Boas was at the club. Barça believe he will be the long-term successor to Sergio Busquets. The problem for Samper is that Busquets has years ahead of him. Midfielder Sergi Samper (left) has been earmarked as Barcelona's next Sergio Busquets . A loan will be sought if Barça B are relegated but Luis Enrique might also consider making Samper a first-team player next season. SAMI KHEDIRA . Are you still here? The 28-year-old German hardly played last season because of injury and this season has been no different thanks to a lack of form and many at Madrid would say, application. Germany midfielder Sami Khedira (left) is expected to depart Madrid after a minor role at the club this year . Khedira (right) pictured in action against Schalke, the club that could be his next destination . Schalke are the favourites to sign him. Arsenal have looked before but huge wages are a major hurdle. MARTIN ODEGAARD . He has brought nothing but bad luck to Real Madrid’s B-team ‘Castilla’ and it’s no surprise team-mates would prefer he didn’t play, such is the team’s improved form when he is off the pitch. The 16-year-old Odegaard has struggled to fit in the Real Madrid B-team and may depart on loan next season . That’s more a reflection of how he hasn’t fitted in than any problems with his ability. The 16-year-old prodigy will go out on loan next season but English suitors will find it tough to persuade Madrid that the loan club should not be a La Liga side.","Real Madrid  expected to have a summer clear-out when the season ends .

"The eighth wonder of the world is nearing completion in the seventh tier of English football. In a park in the middle of a working-class suburb east of the city centre, builders are putting the finishing touches to FC United of Manchester's Broadhurst Park . There are no pyramids, hanging gardens or light houses but there is a sweeping terrace, a series of football pitches and floodlight pylons. FC United of Manchester's new 5,000-capacity stadium Broadhurst Park is nearing completion . General manager Andy Walsh outside the new ground, which cost the democratic club a whopping £6.5m . This a symbol that there is another way. Another way a million miles away from billion-pound TV deals, fat-cat owners, sanitised stadia and all that many will tell you is wrong with modern football. Set to host Benfica for the official opening on May 29, the 5,000-capacity stadium will finally end a nomadic decade on the road for the breakaway outfit set up in May 2005 by Manchester United fans sick of being exploited by the club they loved, for whom the arrival of the Glazer family was a step too far. Broadhurst (some mischievous souls voted for FCUM Hall in the naming poll), dismissed by many as an impossible dream, cost around £6.5m. Of that colossal sum around half came from the pockets of the democratic club's 4,000 members. The rest came from grants with around £500,000 loaned by the council. It is a ground for the fans, paid for by the fans. The function room at the new ground is part of a stadium that will also serve the local community . Broadhurst Park is a far cry from the glamour and glitz of Old Trafford, seven miles away across the city . But is it two fingers up at the debt-burdening Americans still in charge seven miles across the city? 'That's a daft question,' says general manager Andy Walsh. 'Establishing this football ground is a statement of what football supporters can achieve if they are given the opportunity,' he adds. They are strong words from a man who believes in standing up for what he believes in. Far from marching proudly into a new stadium, 25 years ago Andy, now 52, was nervously stepping into a prison cell for non-payment of poll tax. It was those principles that saw him leave behind a steady job as a driving instructor (with a wife and two kids to support) to take his current role leading the rebels with a cause in 2006 and, with a heavy heart, vow never to set foot inside his beloved Old Trafford again until the Glazers were gone. Broadhurst, with its view of the bright lights of Oldham across the valley, is a far cry from today's Old Trafford. It is also not your identikit, breeze-blocked modern stadium. Behind one goal is a 2,500-capacity terrace, salvaged from Northwich Victoria. The changing rooms at the new ground are simple, but Walsh says the club are ambitious for progress . On matchdays one of the stands will house a food market, with local businesses from Indian takeaways to vegan cafes offering fans their fayre. In the clubhouse supporters will not drink Budweiser, or Aperol Spritz but cask ale from Manchester brewers Joseph Holt. The local brew of the day's opposition will also be imported for each match while the club is planning to install a microbrewery. Dozens of volunteers have helped to build it. One fan donated a lift. Fruit trees will make it the first pollinator-friendly football ground in the country. Discussions, however, are ongoing over the pies. 'We have to get that one right,' says Andy, but the provider will be a local firm in line with the club's policy. The physio room will turn into a medical suite for the community on non-match days and there is a classroom for the club's academy and for the use of those from the surrounding area. On the back of the main stand there is wooden cladding – a nod to the wooden sleepers of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company which spawned the first incarnation of Manchester United just down the road in Newton Heath 136 years ago. Walsh explains the plans for the stadium to Sportsmail's Mike Keegan (right) at the new ground . 'We're a mile away from Northampton Road (Newton Heath's first ground),' says Andy. 'We wanted to be within the M60 ring road. That we are so close to where it began is a happy coincidence.' Andy, born and raised a stone's throw from the Stretford End, is expecting a 20 per cent rise on the club's already impressive average attendances of 2,000 as they seek to end four years of play-off heartbreak and gain promotion to the Conference North. It sounds conservative, but he does admit to having one eye on the future and what feels like an inevitable progression to the Football League. 'We've got an opportunity to use the revenue we generate to invest in our club,' he says. 'This is not just a ground that has been built for the level we are at. We want promotion this year and we will continue to press our way up the leagues as resources allow.' So will Andy, whose side need a maximum of five points from their remaining three matches to secure the title, be sat in the director's box when the dream is finally realised and the teams run out? 'No,' he says. 'I will be stood on the 18-yard line of the end we are attacking. That's my preferred spot.' The club's badge features a ship, to showcase the city's canal-building past, explains Walsh . The club was formed when Manchester United were bought by the American Malcolm Glazer in 2005 . He, like the club, does things differently. FC fans call it Punk Football. For Andy, however, it is an extension of a longstanding Mancunian tradition. 'There's a spirit in Manchester of radicalism and creative thinking,' he says. 'Of challenging the norm and looking at different ways of doing things. Everything from electoral reform – the establishment of the suffragette movement to innovation in industry. 'The first ever computer, the first ever public library and the first ever public park. Our crest itself speaks of that. The ship is because we built the canal. We brought the sea into the centre of Manchester. That's symbolic. It's on our city crest, it's on our club crest.' Unfortunately, Andy has to leave to try and push the project over the line. The FC United of Manchester team in 2005, when they played as a nomadic club without a ground . The club's fans turned their back on the commercialism of Old Trafford and started a democratic club . Time for one last question. Sir Alex Ferguson famously had little time for FC United and having the audacity to mention them at a press conference destroyed the relationship one local reporter enjoyed with the Scot. The latest incumbent, however, is a son of Amsterdam, where they know all about challenging authority and doing things a little differently. So will Louis van Gaal find a ticket to a match at Broadhurst Park on his doormat? 'That's a good question,' Andy says. 'We have no plans to invite anybody form Manchester United to a game.' After a long pause he adds: 'We would, however, have no objections if they wanted to attend.' If they do they will have to join the queue.","Broadhurst Park will host Benfica for opening on May 29 .

"John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United with thousands of supporters planning to boycott Sunday's home match against Spurs. The 50-year-old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver’s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United . United’s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire Ashley, especially as the Magpies have returned record profits of £18.7million and this week revealed they also have £34m sat in a bank account. Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer – or deflect – questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James’ Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: ‘I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,’ he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . ‘For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. ‘The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. ‘Sometimes you’re dealt the hand and you’ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I’ve been dealt. ‘When I took it on, if I hadn’t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. ‘And I’ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I’ve got the right tools I can do the job. ‘But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.’ Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team.

I respect those issues. ‘I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. ‘So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.’ Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .","John Carver has become the target of fans angry with how the club is run .

"Mauricio Pochettino believes Harry Kane and Ryan Mason have not been able to show the same level of consistency since they returned from England duty and hopes to see a big improvement when Spurs face Newcastle. Kane has been one of the stars of the Premier League, scoring 29 goals in all competitions for Tottenham, and is just one away from becoming their first player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to hit 30 goals in a season. The England forward has been nominated for both PFA Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year. England call-up hurt the form of Harry Kane, according to his Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino . Pochettino believes that midfielder Ryan Mason has also been affected by the call-up . Mason has been one of the best young midfielders in England this season and has burst on to the international scene in his first full season in the top flight. But since being called into Roy Hodgson’s squad for the first time for the games against Lithuania and Italy, the duo have been well below their best as Spurs slumped to a goalless draw against Burnley and a shock 1-0 home defeat against Aston Villa last weekend. Pochettino said: ‘When players get their first call-up, they try to show they are good enough and try to impress the national manager, and because they are over-motivated they expend a lot of energy. ‘When you come back to the team, the consequence is that for two or three weeks you are a little bit down. It is normal and this happened at Southampton too. ‘I remember that we were third in the table and we went to play against Arsenal in November. If we won, with three points we’d have been first in the table. The performance wasn’t good. Why? Because we’d spent a lot of energy and it was difficult to keep our focus on the normal life. Pochettino hopes the pair can improve their standard of recent performances against Newcastle . Kane scored on his England debut after coming on as a substitute against Lithuania at Wembley last month . ‘I remember my first call-up for Argentina against Holland. I was up on a cloud for a month after it because it was unbelievable to play for the national team. When I got back to Espanyol it was difficult. I’d been away for 15 days with my national team and I came back and I said, “Oh, but now I play with Redondo, Batistuta...” You feel like a superstar and then you have to go back to Espanyol.’ Meanwhile, Pochettino has told supporters to judge him on where Tottenham finish next season. He added: ‘This season was one of transition. We brought a lot of young players, we got to a cup final at Wembley. Next season we need to build a team to fight for the top four.’","Mauricio Pochettino says Harry Kane has struggled since England debut .

"When Pele and Bobby Moore embraced, yielding perhaps the most famous of all images of sportsmanship on a football pitch, the final whistle had already blown. That was in 1970, at the end of a wonderfully hard-fought World Cup group match between England and Brazil, which the South Americans won 1-0. So loudly did the football world applaud such an exhibition of mutual respect between two giants of the game that all these decades later, the applause still resounds. That image of them is frequently flourished as a perfect example of what the game was, and is used to compare, unfavourably, with what it has become. Newcastle keeper Tim Krul  congratulated Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe on his goal at half-time . Bobby Moore's famous hug with Pele in 1970 is often held up as the peak of sportsmanship . And so the Stadium of Light on Sunday afternoon. Tim Krul and Jermain Defoe are lesser stars than Moore and Pele, of course, and the Newcastle United goalkeeper’s instinctively friendly gesture towards the man who had just scored a brilliant goal past him took place with 45 minutes yet to play. But was it really so different to that celebrated business in Guadalajara, Mexico, for which we don’t only continue to congratulate the England colossus and the Brazilian legend for their integrity and values, but also ourselves, somehow, for knowing and loving the game when it still had a place for common decency? Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, among many others, has lambasted Krul for an inappropriate show of brotherhood towards a fellow professional. On Match of the Day 2, Danny Murphy agreed. The Dutchman, they say, was out of order. The implication is that, as he walked off the pitch at half-time, he should have been so lost in his own despair, or anger, or disappointment, or fierce resolve to get back on terms, that if he’d noticed Defoe at all, the only acceptable form of communication should have been a muttered oath, or at best a hard stare. Krul smiles at Defoe shortly after the striker's goal gave the Black Cats the lead in the Wear-Tyne derby . Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher criticised Krul for his half-time actions while speaking on Sky Sports . Any form of friendliness could at the very least have waited until after the game was over, they reckon. Meanwhile, for some of Krul’s critics on social media, the fact that it was an intense local derby puts his behaviour almost beyond the pale. How unutterably depressing. Has football really become so leeched of humanity that one decent pro can’t turn to another and say ‘well played’? Nobody thinks that Krul would have complimented his opponent had it been a scuffed shot through his legs from two yards. But it was a wondrous strike, and, derby or not, half-time or not, a game that has no room either for an acknowledgment of a great piece of technique, or for a simple, impulsive act of sportsmanship, is a game that has become entirely detached from its roots. Defoe (left) hit a stunning volley on the cusp of half-time to give Sunderland the lead against Newcastle . Defoe celebrates his strike which helped the Black Cats to victory in the Wear-Tyne derby . Others insist otherwise, saying only someone with ‘no passion’ for football could commend Krul for doing what he did. That’s rubbish. I am a passionate Evertonian and naturally I have asked myself how I’d feel if, let’s say, Tim Howard congratulated Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard in the tunnel after just being beaten by him, stupendously, from 30 yards. Would I consider it disrespectful to shell-shocked fans? Or assume that by so publicly fraternising with the ‘enemy’, Howard wasn’t quite up for what remained of the fight? Of course not. On the contrary, I’d be pleased to have a grown-up on my team. Moreover, there is another dimension to all this. The sub-text in at least some of the excoriation of Krul’s back-slapping is that he is one of the Premier League’s foreign imports, and either doesn’t fully understand the ferocious tribalism that flavours the Tyne-Wear derby, or being a highly-paid mercenary, chooses not to inhale it. Newcastle came up short against their rivals yet again, but Krul's gesture was not the problem . Defoe's strike was a goal worthy of winning any game, and congratulating him was the decent thing to do . But that’s rubbish, too. Some of us might have wistfully fond memories of an age when English football was overwhelmingly populated by players from the British Isles, but we kid ourselves if we think that the modern domestic game is divided by passports into those who give their all and those who don’t. And yet, let’s be brutally honest, would the condemnation have been quite so swift and quite so loud if the boot had been on the other foot on Sunday, if it had been Defoe walking down the tunnel at half-time slapping Krul on the back for denying him seconds earlier with a truly breathtaking, world-class save? In fact, would there have been any condemnation at all? Or would it have been held up as a heart-warming example, even in the intense heat of competition, of a typically honest English footballer doing the decent thing?","Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was seen laughing at half time .

"Steve Clarke admits his Reading side require the ‘perfect’ performance to stand any chance of beating Arsenal — but concedes he has yet to see that from one of his teams during his managerial career.

Steve Clarke insists his Reading side must be 'perfect' to have any chance of beating Arsenal at Wembley . ‘We must make sure that the preparation and mentality are right and we give everything we’ve got. ‘We’ve mentioned about having no regrets coming off the pitch and I promise you the players will give everything they’ve got to try to get a result. ‘We have to play almost the perfect game — to be solid, resolute and mentally strong. It’s a game where we can’t make too many mistakes. If you make mistakes against the top teams they will punish you. If we can do that we’ve got a chance.’ Clarke, 51, is still feeling his way as a manager, having taken charge of West Bromwich Albion for a season in 2012 before taking the Reading job last summer.

Asked how many times he had seen a perfect display from one of his sides, he replied: ‘Probably none, so it’s a big ask.

I know they are a good team with good players but if we play the perfect game we have a chance.’ Clarke has challenged his players to make history by getting to the FA Cup final for the first time. Eighty-eight years ago they made it to this stage but Clarke is not content with matching that. ‘It’s not unique history, it’s shared history,’ he said. ‘If they get to the final, no other Reading team has done that.

"Wojciech Szczesny will start in the FA Cup semi-final but the future looks bleak for the Poland goalkeeper who has been deposed as Arsenal’s No 1. Arsene Wenger confirmed Szczesny will play ahead of David Ospina against Reading at Wembley on Saturday but offered no further guarantees. ‘At the moment, I hope yes,’ said Wenger, after a long, uncharacteristic hesitation, when asked if Szczesny had a long-term future at the club. ‘It is very difficult to answer that question, you know. What is important is Saturday. Wojciech Szczesny will start in goal for Arsenal for the their FA Cup clash with Reading at Wembley . ‘His attitude is very good. He has trained very well, very focused. Your job is to fight for your place, no matter how difficult it is. When you choose this kind of job you know it is down to competition.’ Szczesny is understood to be content with his situation and confident of winning back his place. His Arsenal contract runs until 2018, but he has made just three appearances — all in the FA Cup — since an error-strewn display at Southampton on New Year’s Day. Arsenal have greatly improved since the defeat at St Mary’s when Szczesny mix-ups led to two goals. He then infuriated Wenger after the game by puffing on a cigarette in the showers. The Polish international has lost his place to David Ospina after a number of errors this season . Former Arsenal midfielder John Jensen went on Danish television before the smoking revelations and claimed Szczesny had been fined and would not play for Wenger again. The spin machine at the Emirates set about rubbishing this theory and Jensen’s sources, but so far Jensen has been vindicated. Ospina came in for the next game against Hull in the FA Cup third round and stayed in goal when Arsenal played Stoke in the Premier League a week later. The Colombian then kept his place. ‘They know the rules,’ said Wenger. ‘They are set at the start of the season. I replaced Wojciech because he had a bad game. I still think he’s a great goalkeeper and want him to have the opportunity to show that. The Colombian has taken his chance with both hands, winning 11 out the 12 games he's started in goal . ‘It is important two goalkeepers get competition and he will get that in the FA Cup now as long as Ospina plays in the Premier League. Barcelona play their No 2 goalkeeper in the Champions League. Why? Because you need to give them competition.’ Ospina has won 11 of 12 Premier League games since the Szczesny chop, but he could not prevent a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the Champions League tie against Monaco.His unfussy style has solidified a notoriously brittle team. With frailties due to their commitment to attractive football, Arsenal crave reliability from their goalkeeper. Szczesny, for all his bravado and talent, was anything but reliable, with a short attention span and a tendency to become bored and seek involvement even when (especially when) his team were in control. Arsene Wenger admits that Szczesny lost his place to his errors but insists he's working hard in training . Ospina is a soothing influence and Wenger’s belated decision to grasp the nettle has strengthened the team, together with the unexpected advances of Francis Coquelin and Hector Bellerin. Coquelin has added ball-winning bite to midfield and Bellerin, with his exceptional pace, is not in such a hurry as others to abandon his post at right back and rampage forward. Add to this a philosophical tweak — a will to defend harder and adjust to different opponents, such as the attempt to combat Burnley’s high-intensity pressing game by encouraging Ospina to kick almost every ball, and Arsenal are sturdier. Monaco was an aberration caused by complacency or, more likely, an indicator that there is more to do. Wenger will be aware of this and was reluctant to smother Ospina with the credit for a run of 16 wins in 18 games since Southampton. ‘It’s a mixture of things,’ said Wenger. ‘We had many players back. Laurent Koscielny, Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud came back but they came back into form as well in January. And Coquelin is doing well.’ Francis Coquelin (centre) has been one of the success stories of the season and is a key player for Arsenal . It was not overwhelming backing for his No 1 and supports the idea that Wenger will prioritise signing another keeper in the summer when Chelsea’s Petr Cech will be on the market. Like Ospina, Cech is a calming presence and a mature personality. Cech also has experience of winning major trophies. In short, he is precisely the sort of individual Arsenal have lacked in recent years. To invest in Cech would be to lose Ospina. The Colombian was happy to sign as No 2 and challenge Szczesny but that is a different psychological proposition to losing your No 1 status to a big-money signing, despite having performed so well. It is a delicate issue for Wenger, a manager often accused of being too loyal. For Szczesny, there appears no way back. Like Lukasz Fabianski last year, it promises to be the FA Cup and out and proof that Jensen was right all along. A move for Petr Cech has been spoken about but it remains to be seen of Wenger will bring in another keeper .","Wojciech Szczesny to play in goal during Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final .

"Manchester City may be still licking their wounds from their derby day mauling at bitter rivals Manchester United on Sunday, but the reigning Premier League champions looked in determined mood as they trained on Wednesday. Preparing for their weekend clash at home to West Ham United, Manuel Pellegrini's  stars were all in action at their Etihad Campus base.

And the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during Wednesday's session as they appeared  as Nasri underwent some stretching exercises. In the aftermath of Sunday's defeat to United at Old Trafford, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Graeme Souness were highly critical of Toure. Of the 31-year-old, the latter said that he had become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Toure was criticised by Sky Sports' Gary Neville and Graeme Souness after City's loss at Manchester United . 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why . Both the Ivory Coast international and Nasri have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch, but Pellegrini will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season. The 61-year-old's side currently sit fourth in the Premier League with seven games remaining - four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool and with a far greater goal difference too.

"Adrian Heath is holding court at his weekly pre-match press conference, and one of the local reporters wants to talk crossbars. Might it be a good idea to raise it a bit so more goals could be scored for the benefit of goal-hungry American fans? The well-travelled former Everton and Manchester City midfielder – now manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City – responds with good humour. 'Well, soccer's being doing quite well for about 150 years now and if you look at the amount of people who play and watch it's still doing quite well, so I don't really see a need,' he replies with a patient smile. Scroll down for video . Adrian Heath is manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City . Such inquiries are actually becoming fewer and further between, as the world game and the huge US market get better acquainted with each other. Heath has been here for eight years now and witnessed the process at first hand, going from the backwoods of the USL to the major leagues that Orlando have been elevated to this season. The years have not dimmed Heath's impish enthusiasm and, now 53, he speaks of the game's expansion with an almost missionary zeal. Perched in the morning sunshine on a bench at City's pristine training facility he talks about the upside of salary caps, what Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard can expect, the humility of his star signing Kaka and his hopes of an eventual rivalry with David Beckham's troubled Miami project. Steven Gerrard will join LA Galaxy in the summer after spending 17 seasons at Liverpool . Midfielder Frank Lampard has signed a two-year contract with New York City . The aforementioned names' imminent arrival is just one reason why the MLS is achieving a greater resonance on the other side of the Atlantic. ' I think English people are fascinated with America,' says Heath. ' You see the baseball, American football and basketball and wonder whether football can take off here. I'm glad to say I think the only question is how big it becomes. 'Perhaps we have slowly had to educate some of the media. One of the things that has kept football down a bit is that some of the high profile media haven't known the sport, and maybe some people are scared of it. They guard their own sports quite carefully.' Heath's Stateside adventure began in the unlikely setting of a pub in his native Newcastle Under Lyme, where he bumped into Stoke City director Phil Rawlins. Kaka is playing out the final days of a distinguished career on the doorstep of Disney World . 'He was looking to invest in soccer over here and I had just lost my job at Coventry. I'd been with Coventry to Portland that year for a pre-season friendly and there were 15,000 people there. I thought the game was taking off and so I thought I'd try and get in early. 'I started off at the bottom in the USL in Austin, Texas. Sometimes there were less than 1,000 people in the ground, not great facilities, lot of college kids, but you could see the game growing. 'Now you look at Seattle Sounders and they would be not that far from Man United and Arsenal in average gates, getting 45,000 per game.' His belief that in ten years the MLS will be world's 'third or fourth biggest league' is fuelled by his daily influx of emails: ' I only have to open my inbox every day to see how many people want to come out here. All the time agents are offering me players who are going to be out of contract in two years' time, big international players who will may be be 29 then.' Orlando midfielder Kaka has the highest salary in MLS history . While Beckham is still looking for a ground in Miami – last month he made an unusually low profile visit in further efforts to resolve the issue – Orlando sold out their opening game last month at the temporary home of the Citrus Bowl. 'We got 62,000 our first game. That will not be sustained but we are building a 21,000 seater stadium with the capability of going up to 28,000 and we will fill that.' It helps having Kaka as the club's marquee signing, a superstar in name but evidently not in behaviour, as Heath quickly discovered: 'We went on pre-season to Charleston and we hired a few vans to transport everyone around. He volunteered to drive one of them and then would wait around for the kids who are straggling and the last to leave, to make sure they're not left behind. He's a remarkable person.' He knows what an impact the involvement of Beckham could also have if he can sort problems out 250 miles south, and admits a vested interest:' I think he has faced an uphill battle on the back of what happened with the baseball there. The city invested millions into the Marlins and they weren't happy with how it worked out with the owner. Midfielder Heath scored 71 goals in 226 games for Everton . 'There's nobody at this club that doesn't want to see David get it off the ground in Miami. Rivalry makes sports, and we could get that going with Miami and maybe Atlanta, which is also a few hours up the road. ' I think David will do it there, it's very difficult for a city to turn down a major league sport over here with all that it brings. One of things that has helped in Orlando is that it's a young city and they want to show it has a lot more to offer than Disney. The city has united behind this.' Gerrard and Lampard will be coming sooner and, he says, there will be a few culture shocks. ' They will have to get used to the travel for an away game. Six hour flights leaving on Thursday and not arriving back until Sunday night. The time difference, sleep patterns. 'I think they'll be impressed with the athleticism in the league. Six years ago coming here in your mid thirties you could get away with coasting but those days are gone. Frank will be fine and so will Steven because they've got great football brains.' Heath helped Everton lift eight trophies during his six years at Goodison Park . And they will find a much more level playing field.'The great thing about the MLS is because of the salary cap there is parity and you don't know who is going to win the league. The Premier League is exciting in many ways but you know only three or four teams can win it. ' Nobody is more patriotic than me and I'm very proud to have played for the likes of Everton and Man City. But the thought that Everton might never win another trophy doesn't sit well with me. They were level five years ago with Man City. It's unthinkable that Everton might not win anything again.' Heath is that rare bird in English football, the traveller, having also spent a season at Espanyol as a player. It has made him a better coach, although he admits his Spanish excursion was not about self-improvement. 'I earned more money going to Spain, one of the reasons we don't export any more from England is that we are the gravy train. If you want to earn a lot of money you stay in England. If you go back to the likes of me, Mark Hateley, Glenn Hoddle, Michael Robinson, the truth is we all went for more money. But it does help you learn.' Now he is doing something very unusual, having to effectively build a team from scratch after Orlando's 'promotion', working all the time within the salary cap. They currently lie third in the Eastern Conference after six games. 'The bottom line is we have got just under 4 million pounds to work with for 28 players (one of them is his son Harrison). You get three of them outside the wage cap but they count as 400 each against it so there is a lot of juggling.' Heath never gets homesick, and there is a constant flow of football people passing through from England, usually taking their children to Disneyland. 'The funny thing is that is brought my kids over quite a few times when I was a player and they were younger, but now I'm working here I've never set foot in the place.'","Former Everton and Manchester City midfielder Adrian Heath is now manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City .

"UFC women's champion Ronda Rousey reinforced her support for Manny Pacquiao in his May 2 megafight with Floyd Mayweather as she paid a visit to the Filipino's Los Angeles training camp. Rousey, the undefeated UFC bantamweight title holder, has made it clear she is in underdog Pacquiao's  camp in the the lead up to the fight. 'Truly honored to meet such a humble and genuine person. Thank you @MannyPacquiao for welcoming us into your home,' Rousey posted on Twitter. Ronda Rousey said she was 'truly honoured to meet such a humble and genuine person' in Manny Pacquiao . Pacquiao posted this image with Rousey on his Twitter page after a visit in Los Angeles . And it's appreciated by the Pacman, who posted an image of the pair expressing his gratitude to the Fast and Furious 7 star on his Twitter page. 'Thank you for visiting me @RondaRousey and for your support. God Bless!' he wrote. Back in February Rousey, 28, who has signed a multi-fight deal with the UFC but is also keen to get in the boxing ring, told TMZ Sports why she was in camp Pacquiao for the richest fight in history. Pacquiao is preparing for his May 2 megafight against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas . Rousey, the UFC women's bantamweight champion, recently starred in the film Fast and Furious 7 . 'Pacquiao's been very, very nice me, so I'm going to root for him,' Rousey said. She follows a host of other celebrities to back Pacquiao, including The Fighter star Mark Wahlberg, NFL quarterback Tim Teebow, basketball legend Robert Jaworski and actor Robert Duvall who have met with the boxer at his camp. But none of them have the distinction, as Rousey does, of being the only person promised a free ticket to Pacquiao-Mayweather at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

Arum said he was a huge fan of Rousey's and said he wanted to show his support by offering her a prized seat. Rousey is by far the biggest draw in women's UFC and her star has risen further of late with a spectacular fight scene with Michelle Rodriguez in the latest Fast and Furious film and a cameo as herself in the Entourage movie. It's no distraction from her day job though as Rousey continues to dominate her division. Her 11th win came as the headline act in UFC184 on February 28 with a record-breaking 14 second arm-bar finish on Cat Zingano, who was previously unbeaten to that point.

"As Patrick Bamford fired home his 19th Middlesbrough goal of the season on Tuesday night, there was one question on everybody’s lips: can he make the grade at Chelsea next season? The 21-year-old striker has been prolific in his loan spells at Boro, Derby and MK Dons, so much so that Sportsmail understands his parent club are opening talks with him over a new deal. Needless to say it would see his wages rise from his current £7,500-a-week deal. He will also be given the chance to impress Jose Mourinho on Chelsea’s summer tour although at the end of it he is expected to go out on loan again. This time, though, Bamford will be sent to a Premier League club, preferably Aitor Karanka’s Middlesbrough should they join the Blues in the top flight. Scroll down for video . Patrcik Bamford (centre) scored in Middlesbrough's  their 2-1 Championship win over Wolves on Tuesday . Bamford reels away in celebration after netting his 19th goal of the season in all competitions for Boro . The 21-year-old's (centre) sparkling form has led his parent club Chelsea to open talks over a new deal . The worry is that it is the same tactic the club employed with Romelu Lukaku, who was eventually sold to Everton. But Bamford is a confident young man and will believe he can emulate Tottenham’s Harry Kane and force Chelsea’s hand. Bamford is currently one of 26 players out on loan from Stamford Bridge - five of which are rival frontmen - while academy forwards Dominic Solanke and Isaiah Brown have already won elevation to the senior set-up. Then there are Diego Costa, Loic Remy and Didier Drogba already competing for that sole striking role. The chances of Bamford making his mark next season, you feel, are slim. But then weren’t the chances of Kane scoring 29 goals for Spurs in his breakthrough season and then netting on his full England debut also outlandish? Bamford has already impressed Mourinho with his attitude. The striker was sat with his dad and Chelsea’s technical director two years ago when the manager walked in and boldly demanded of the youngster, ‘What do you want?’ He was encouraged by the reply. ‘To play for Chelsea,’ returned the well-mannered but equally brazen rookie. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) has been impressed with Bamford's attitude as well as his development . Romelu Lukaku (pictured in 2011) was sold to Everton in the summer after failing to make the grade . Chelsea youth product Dominic Solanke (centre) has won elevation to the first-team squad this season . Tottenham striker Harry Kane (left) has scored 29 goals in his breakthrough season for the club . Bamford has always achieved his goals in life - be it straight A grades at Nottingham High School, teaching himself Spanish and to play guitar or, indeed, scoring goals as a footballer. He left Mourinho in no doubt as to his ultimate ambition. Last summer, when Mourinho convinced Bamford that Middlesbrough was the best place for him, the manager dispensed with his cool exterior and hugged his player. ‘He was very emotional,’ recalls the 21-year-old. And there is the ace which Bamford holds - Mourinho likes him. In June he will line up alongside Spurs’ Kane for England at the Under 21 European Championships. Kane is just six weeks older and has plotted a similar path through the Football League. On Tuesday night he became Boro’s first player since 1990 to score 17 league goals in one season. The play-offs are Boro’s most likely destination. But for Bamford - favourite to land the Football League’s Young Player of the Year prize - the chance of a showcase match at Wembley is no bad thing. Asked to detail the aspects of his game which have improved this season, Bamford said: ‘I now know how to use my strength in that position (lone striker), and I can run a lot more.’ If Mourinho was listening it would have been music to his ears. For Bamford’s ability - the raw talent which persuaded Chelsea to prise him from Nottingham Forest as an 18-year-old after only 12 minutes of first-team football - has never been in question. That much was in evidence during the midweek win over Wolves. His goal was a ruthless combination of technique and instinct. At times he reminds you of a young Teddy Sheringham, but with more pace. But more eye-catching was the selfless pursuit of a hopeful punt forward when, after out-muscling and out-pacing his minders, he squared for a team-mate to score. There is, then, graft as well as craft. Silk allied to steel. But it is Bamford’s personality which is most endearing. Bamford scored in Middlesbrough's surprise FA Cup fourth round win at Manchester City on January 24 . The striker's style of play has been compared to ex-England and Tottenham forward Teddy Sheringham (left) After training every day he goes home and practises guitar for ‘one hour only’ because he doesn’t want to ‘p*** off the neighbours’. He already plays piano, violin and saxophone and is conversational in German as well as French. There was an offer from Harvard University to study economics, and he could even have followed his two sisters down a medicine and science route. He shunned all of that, however, for a career in football. Bamford knows what he wants, and so does Mourinho. He feels he is ready to make the grade at Chelsea. To do that, like Kane, he first needs the chance. Bamford enjoyed two loan spells at MK Dons before spending the second half of last season at Derby .","Middlesbrough beat Wolves 2-1 in the Championship on Tuesday night .

"One season soon, there will be more people watching each Premier League match live in the USA than in Britain. That is the confident expectation of broadcasting titan NBC, who hold the live rights to show matches Stateside and have more than doubled US interest in England’s elite division in the past two years. In 2012-13, some 13 million different Americans watched at least one top-flight English game live. Last season that was 32 million — or more than one in 10 people in the US. This weekend, for the first time, reflecting their boom product, NBC have transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England. NBC host Rebecca Lowe has helped to improve coverage of the Premier League in America . Star anchor Lowe was at Turf Moor to present Burnley's Premier League match against Arsenal . Lowe was joined by former Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle and retired MLS star Kyle Martino . Lifelong Crystal Palace fan Lowe is married to former Cheltenham manager Paul Buckle . Star anchor Rebecca Lowe was at Turf Moor for Burnley against Arsenal, joined by former USA midfielder Kyle Martino — a pin-up at LA Galaxy just before David Beckham — and fellow pundit Robbie Earle, now based in Los Angeles. The trio, plus pitchside analysts Lee Dixon and Robbie Mustoe, will also be at the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday and at Anfield for Liverpool-Newcastle on Monday. ‘The Premier League sells itself with its drama,’ says Lowe, 34, a former BBC and ESPN journalist snapped up to be the face of the PL in the USA by NBC two years ago. ‘But you can always enhance your coverage and that’s why we’re here this weekend.’ Lowe herself is a lifelong Crystal Palace fan, and had one eye on their stunning 4-1 win at Sunderland. As she told the LA Times recently, tongue in cheek, her support of Palace is not a sign that she can’t recognise good football. ‘I hope that people look at me and say she actually knows football because to be a Crystal Palace fan, you have to really want to be in football,’ she said. ‘It’s not easy being a Crystal Palace fan. I could pick United or City or Chelsea or Arsenal and I probably would have had a much happier childhood.’ Lowe now finds herself helping to influence the footballing choices of young Americans. ‘When I first moved to the States two years ago I hardly saw a [replica] Premier League shirt,’ she says. ‘Now they’re all over the place, and not just the big teams.’ Lowe was at Turf Moor to see Arsenal claim all three points thanks to a goal by Aaron Ramsey . Lee Dixon provided pitchside analysis for NBC as his former side defeated relegation candidates Burnley . NBC transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England for this weekend's round of matches . Every match is shown live in the USA. At 7am eastern time on Saturday, midday in Britain, NBC’s weekend PL broadcasting opened with a long shot of Turf Moor set against the Lancashire hills and Lowe describing how football has been played at this ground since 1883. ‘This country is so rich in history, it’s part of the appeal,’ says Lowe, a Londoner who is married to football manager Paul Buckle, who recently parted company with Cheltenham. ‘It’s important that we do tell our audience about [smaller clubs like] Burnley because otherwise it could all be Arsenal, United, City, Chelsea, Liverpool,’ Lowe says. ‘We’re passionate about educating and informing our audience.’ Martino says that when NBC won the rights to show games — for the three-year period, 2013-16, for $250 million (£167m) — some critics feared that showing every match ‘was going to be overkill … [but] what we’ve found is there is a demand for that level of consumption of this product’. The USA is the third most lucrative market now for the League in rights terms, among 84 separate overseas contracts covering 212 territories. Only Thailand, where broadcasters are paying $320m for the current three years and the Middle East (both £213m), offer richer pickings, so far. With the Premier League having recently sealed their record £5bn domestic TV deal for 2016-19 with Sky and BT, attention will now turn to all the overseas deals, to be brokered over the next year. India will be a key market, with a surging middle-class interest, while Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil are seen as having room for growth, among others. All the overseas rights combined fetched £2.23bn for the League for the 2013-16 period (or £743m a year) with increases expected. The USA is high on the list of places the League want to continue building interest, not just to earn more TV cash but to provide the clubs with potentially lucrative markets. Burnley’s chief executive Lee Hoos, an American, told the Mail on Sunday on Saturday that his club’s merchandise sales in the USA have jumped 212 per cent this season simply by being in the League. Leaps of 150 per cent have been recorded in places as far flung as Korea and mainland Europe. Lowe would have been delighted with Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 league win over Sunderland . Burnley have benefitted from the American audience taking an interest in the Premier League, says Lee Hoos . Burnley chief Hoos, pictured withSportsmail's Nick Harris, insists his club's profile is high across the globe . Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has been impressed with NBC's coverage of the Premier League . ‘There are still people here in the UK who will say to me, “Where exactly is Burnley?”,’ he says. ‘Yet our profile has never been higher internationally.’ Arsenal’s chief executive Ivan Gazidis, who spent 16 years in MLS, said NBC’s coverage has been ‘transformative’ for the Premier League. He said in the recent past football was seen as ‘niche’ and ‘nerdy’ and ‘it was always cool to knock soccer … but when you get NBC coming into play you’re moving into the mainstream. It’s a sea change’. Three of the four most-watched Premier League games ever in the USA, including the No 1 match, Manchester United versus Arsenal in November, have been during NBC’s current deal. The biggest audience averaged 1.41m people — and that was before breakfast in many cities. The average audience in Britain for a Premier League match across Sky Sport and BT is little more than a million (and almost 500,000 in the US) and the biggest ever audience on Sky averaged below 3 million. United's win over Liverpool attracted 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined . Manchester United's 2-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in November was the most-watched PL game in the US . Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. The growth of the interest in America means numbers will swell there, with Martino believing phenomenal increases are likely. ‘NBC cover the Olympics, the NFL, they have been covering the big event for a very long time,’ he says. ‘It’s natural for them. It’s the same template [being used to market the Premier League]. ‘In the United States we talk about the NFL getting 19 million on a Monday night. That’s the bar set. And it’s not hyperbole to be ambitious — that’s what’s going to happen one day with the Premier League.’Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. Jon Miller, NBC Sports’ president of programming, said: ‘The Premier League has a very passionate fan base here in the US. It’s also a youthful and affluent fan base as well, relative to other sports on television. ‘We have created a new “day part” in weekend morning television, where fans now come to our networks beginning at 7 in the morning and stay for 5-6 hours. It’s been a terrific partnership. ‘We believe that this is best soccer being played anywhere in the world and Americans gravitate towards the best when available.’","Rebecca Lowe has helped to enhance Premier League coverage in the US .

"Floyd Mayweather's spending habits are well known but his car dealer has revealed that the boxer bizarrely rang him at 3am to order a Bugatti - insisting the car was to be in his driveway in just 12 hours. The £1.5million valued super-car was delivered just 11 hours later, and was added to his collection of impressive motors. Obi Okeke, who owns Fusion Luxury Motors, was interviewed on the video on Mayweather's Facebook page and spoke about the very late phone call he received. Floyd Mayweather rang his car dealer at 3am to order a £1.5million Bugatti to be delivered in 12 hours . Obi Okele, the owner of Fusion Luxury Motors, was given the task of getting Mayweather the Bugatti . He said: 'The most challenging thing I've ever done for Floyd is when he called me at three o'clock in the morning and said, Obi, I want a Bugatti and I want one in my driveway in 12 hours. 'I then showered, went into my office, did some work and hopped on a plane and got the car, in his driveway, in 11 hours and that makes me a better person, it makes me work harder, it makes me not limit myself, so those are the things that rub off on me from him.' It's not the only request that Okele has had to deal with from Mayweather's extravagant demands, as the fighter once turned up at the dealership at 2am - walking out with a Ferrari Enzo. 'I got a call from overseas in the Middle East that there was a US-spec Enzo for sale, so I hopped on a plane and flew to Abu Dhabi. I then transacted the car and put it in a Boeing 777 passenger plane and flew it out of Abu Dhabi. 'So Floyd came to the dealership and he kept coming and looking at the car. Then he came in one night around two in the morning and said, ""Obi, I wanna buy two Ferrari 458s,"" and that's what he said. 'Then I said OK, then he pauses for a minute and goes, ""Obi, I'm not going to buy them 458s, I want to buy that Enzo and I want to buy it now. Lets go.""' Mayweather's mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao is just three weeks away and the undefeated champion continues to work in the gym and keep his impressive record intact. This Bugatti is similar to the one Mayweather purchased at 3am and is worth an estimated £1.5million .

"A bizarre performance from Stan Wawrinka saw Grigor Dimitrov breeze through 6-1, 6-2 to his first masters quarter-final of the season. Wawrinka is the defending champion in Monte Carlo and seldom has a title been relinquished so easily. The Swiss No 2 played like he was in a hurry - and not in a good way. Rushing between points, Wawrinka won the first of the match and then made four unforced errors in a row to surrender his serve. Grigor Dimitrov powers a forehand from the back court in his comfortable win over Stan Wawrinka . Wawrinka, the Monte Carlo Masters defending champion, appeared out of sorts in the 6-1 6-2 defeat . The world No 9 looked listless and disinterested, rolling in 95mph first serves and ballooning groundstrokes long.

In the second, Wawrinka played a little better - he could scarcely have played worse - but still gave Dimitrov a generous helping of mistakes. The world No 11 broke early and Wawrinka served to stay in the match at 5-2 down. Four tame unforced errors later and Dimitrov was through to the last eight. The crowd on court central would have expected a thrilling encounter between two of the most expressive players on tour. Instead, they were treated to an abject and mystifying performance from Wawrinka. The 30-year-old finally got on the board in the fifth game of the match, although this was down more to errors from Dimitrov - who wasn't even playing especially well himself - than any improvement from the Swiss. But the Bulgarian broke for a third time and closed out the first set 6-1.

"Rafael Nadal squeezed through to the quarter-finals of the Monte Carlo Masters after a narrow win over America's John Isner, but Roger Federer's tournament is over after he lost to Gael Monfils. Federer was playing his first tournament since losing to Novak Djokovic in the Indian Wells final last month and the second seed's rustiness showed as he was beaten 6-4 7-6 (7/5). The world number two struck an early break in the first set but Monfils twice hit back to go one up before edging a close second-set tie-break to seal victory. Rafael Nadal sneaked past John Isner in the Monte Carlo Masters as he struggled to against his big serve .

The world number five is eager to establish some momentum on clay, his favourite surface, after a disappointing start to the season but was close to losing the first set before Isner squandered two set points. The American was unlucky to not come away with the victory but Nadal's class shone through in the end . The American responded strongly in the second set to level but Nadal broke early in the decider before closing out the match.

"One very good player moves out and another very good player moves in. Atletico Madrid supporters have stopped fretting about departures because they have good reason to be confident in the people that run the club and their ability to find adequate replacements. In goal Sergio Asenjo became David De Gea, became Thibaut Courtois, who looks to have become Jan Oblak. Playmaker Diego Ribas became Arda Turan. While centre-forward Diego Forlan became Sergio Aguero, became Radamel Falcao, became Diego Costa who has now become that bloodied battering-ram Mario Mandzukic. Atletico Madrid know how to replace stars, from David De Gea (left to right), to Thibaut Courtois, to Jan Oblak . Sergio Aguero (left) was a star at Atletico before being replaced by Radamel Falcao at the Spanish club . Diego Costa (left, squaring up to John Terry) was sold to Chelsea but replaced by Mario Mandzukic (right) Atletico manager Diego Simeone has been pulling the strings at the La Liga club in terms of transfers . The secret of their success is often exactly that – a secret. No club has used the third-party ownership lenience in Spain more to its advantage than Atletico Madrid. Transfers like Radamel Falcao were always shrouded in mystery. How were they able to sell Aguero to Manchester City and hand over a large portion of the fee to the tax man to service their monumental overdraft with the state, and yet still go into the transfer market and get Falcao for an even higher price than Aguero? Jorge Mendes has worked closely with the club and with its managing director Miguel angel Gil Marin across the last five years and there is no question the club have benefited from a healthy relationship with the world’s most prolific agent. It was bordering on comical in 2010 when the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai picked Gil as its sports director of the year. Mendes played a large part in the setting up of the annual awards – he himself has won agent of the year every year since its inauguration. Atletico playmaker Diego Ribas became Arda Turan at the Vicente Calderon under Simeone . Falcao (right), formerly of Atletico, sits with super-agent Jorge Mendes (left) during a match in France . Atletico's CEO Miguel Angel Gil Marin (far right) give a press conference in Madrid in 2009 . His domination of the best agent award was easier to justify than Gil’s prize that year, coming as it did when Atletico were still hugely indebted to Spain’s Inland Revenue and forced to fire sell every summer. But Gil has led Atletico out of trouble. He has picked his agent friends well, worked the loophole in the system – one Fifa want to close allowing third party ownership in Spain when it is banned in other leagues - and that has played a part in the club's rise. Mendes it was who discovered Costa and brought him to Atletico Madrid via Portugal. The super-agent can also claim to have been the man who saw the huge potential in the unrefined Brazilian front man, overruling scouts that he usually trusted without question and signing the youngster from Lagarto thus beginning the process of making him one of Europe’s top striker. He was loaned him out to four La Liga clubs but was always brought back to Atletico who would eventually win the Spanish Cup, the European Super Cup and the League with him as their centre-forward. Koke is Atletico's brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on Tuesday night . Mario Suarez and Gabi try to stop Cristiano Ronaldo during the Madrid derby in the Champions League . As well as using the right agents to get the right players Atletico have – like so many teams in Spain benefitted from an extensive and well-run youth system. Koke is their brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on Tuesday against Real Madrid with Mario Suarez and Gabi who also both came through the ranks at Atletico albeit only arriving at the first team after long spells away from the club. Next season Oliver Torres should return from a hugely successful spell at Porto and line up alongside another off the conveyor build: the hugely impressive Saul Niguez. It also shouldn’t be forgotten that with a very similar squad back in 2012 Atletico Madrid were closer to the relegation places than the European places and even their most blinkered fan would have dismissed out of hand the idea that they would ever be winning the league and playing the Champions League final in the same season any time soon. The reason for the change is perhaps their greatest signing of all – Diego Simeone. He arrived at the start of 2012 just after they had been knocked out of Copa del Rey by a third division side. The likes of former Osasuna winger Juanfran were in the team back then too – he looked a symbol of the oh-so average signings being made by the club at the time. Simeone has been up there with their greatest signings when they made him manager previously . Juanfran was converted by Simeone to full-back and is now in the form of his life at Atletico . Juanfran was converted by Simeone to full-back and is now first choice on the right hand side of Spain’s defence. His transformation is still a symbol, only now it is one of just how much the club and team have progressed. Chinese company Wanda now owns 20 per cent of Atletico Madrid, their tax debt is under control and they are in a position to sign players without having to sell. Having bought so well when they were in a worse financial situation, supporters are optimistic – just as long as they don’t lose Simeone: the real alchemist at Atletico Madrid.","Atletico Madrid 0-0 Real Madrid: Click here for Martin Samuel's report .

"Reading manager Steve Clarke insists the FA Cup needs protecting after some dubious scheduling decisions. Earlier in the competition the Third Round ties were split over five days due to New Years Day Premier League matches and to accommodate televised games. Reading had to play their FA Cup replay against Bradford in the last round on a Monday when they had played a Championship match two days previously. Steve Clarke wants scheduling of matches in England to improve so the FA Cup can be preserved . Should they progress to the final, that will be contested on May 30 leaving Clarke’s side almost a month without games when the Championship season ends on May 2. The massive Premier League match between Chelsea and Manchester United is also scheduled to be televised at the same time as their semi-final against Arsenal at Wembley on Saturday. Clarke claimed he ‘couldn’t care less’ about the conflicting match, but added: ‘I thought it was a shame in the last round when we had to play on a Monday night after playing on a Saturday. Reading beat Bradford in the last round but face a much tougher task when they face Arsenal at Wembley . 'There are things that we should do to protect this great competition. It should be special. ‘When we beat Arsenal, we have to wait four weeks after our last league game to play the cup final, this is also not correct. 'I probably need to go on holiday for two of them and then bring the team back in. It's a long break. ‘If we get to the final, what are we going to do from May 2 to May 30? What do we do? Everyone else has played, so we won't be playing games. 'It'd be a great puzzle to have though. Let’s talk about it on Saturday night.’ Reading defender Alex Pearce revealed the players are waiting until after the match on Saturday before booking any time off in May in case they beat Arsenal. ‘Holidays are off until now, you can’t book anything, you’ve got to just see where you are and it would be great,’ he said. ‘We’re all committed and dedicated to getting to this final.’ Arsene Wenger's side are in formidable form and beating them will be a tough ask for the Royals .","Steve Clarke thinks that scheduling needs to better for the FA Cup .

"Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda has lambasted Serbian referee Milorad Mazic following his side's Champions League encounter against Real Madrid. The Brazil international criticised Mazic's display after the goalless draw at the Vicente Calderon and questioned why officials from 'minor leagues' were able to referee such a high-profile clash. Miranda and his Atletico Madrid team-mates were left riled when Mazic, who refereed at the 2014 World Cup, failed to punish Sergio Ramos for what appeared to be an elbow on Mario Mandzukic.

Mario Mandzukic makes a point to referee Mazic after being cut by an elbow from Sergio Ramos .

Miranda is not the only Atletico Madrid star to hit out at Mazic as team-mate Mario Suarez has also taken a swipe at the Serbian official. Suarez expressed his frustration after the game, saying on Spanish TV: 'The referee is very bad. They can't use a Serbian referee for these type of games, with all my respect.

"Philipp Lahm has given former Bayern Munich team-mate Owen Hargreaves an insight into the meticulous approach of  manager Pep Guardiola ahead of the club's Champions League quarter-final tie against Porto. The World Cup winner was speaking to the BT Sport pundit as part of a special documentary 'Inside Bayern Munich with Owen Hargreaves' which airs Saturday at 10pm on BT Sport 1. 'His tactical understanding is incredible,' Lahm explained. 'He always gives our team solutions to playing the opposition. VIDEO - Scroll down to see a preview from 'Inside Bayern Munich with Owen Hargreaves' Bayern Munich man Philipp Lahm (left) talks to former team-mate Owen Hargreaves about his career so far . Lahm (right) and Hargreaves played together at Bayern when Hargreaves was at the club from 2000-2007 . The former Bayern midfielder speaks with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the Bayern chairman . Lahm lifts the World Cup with Germany (left) and praised his Bayern manager Pep Guardiola (right) 'He prepares for every opposition completely differently. How flexible our team has become, with a back 3, back 4 or back 5.' Lahm  dissected the differences in approach between Guardiola and his predecessor, Jupp Heynckes, who masterminded a Bayern treble in 2013 before retiring from coaching. 'With Heynckes in 2013, in the big games we played quite defensive on the counter attack. Everybody worked together as a group, we invested a lot of energy in the games,' Lahm said. 'Now under Pep it's more tactical and we have more possession but not like previously when we had a lot of possession but we didn't have any clear scoring opportunities. 'The goal is to go forward and create scoring opportunities. To press very high. To win the ball back very quickly. But to do that you need a clear plan and the daily work on the pitch.' At the age of 31, Lahm is one of the most decorated and accomplished players in modern football. He already has six Bundesliga winners medals, with a seventh seeming certain to follow with Munich ten points ahead of Wolfsburg with six games remaining. Aside from a two-year loan spell at Stuttgart, Lahm has spent his entire career at Bayern but confessed to Hargreaves that he did not ever anticipate the success he has had. Jupp Heynckes led Bayern to a treble in 2013 before retiring from coaching, and was succeeded by Guardiola . Lahm celebrates winning the Bundesliga (left) and the Champions League in 2013 . 'I came at 12 in 1995 and everything's a dream,' Lahm said. 'It's a dream to become German champion, to become a German national player but that it all happened, German champion, Champions League winner, captain of the club, to play for the national team, it's not something that you can plan. 'Maybe eventually it becomes a goal but at the beginning, that's what it is, just a dream. 'For me this is my home. I'm born in Munich, I grew up here, I've been at Bayern Munich since I was 12 years old besides the two years in Stuttgart. 'I might have won the Champions' League earlier with another club but the value of winning the Champions League with my club is much more valuable.' Lahm has demonstrated a versatility both for Germany and Bayern that points to a heightened understanding of the game. He has played at right-back, left-back and as a defensive midfielder with club and country, leading to many earmarking him as a future Bayern manager. The idea is not one Lahm, who is contracted at the club until 2018, rejects but he is still focused on attaining more titles with as a player, starting Wednesday at Porto. Lahm (left) has played at Munich his whole career but had a two-year loan spell at Stuttgart . Lahm (right) is currently gearing up to take on Porto in the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday . Lahm (right) also spoke to Hargreaves about his career where he has won many trophies and become captain . 'It's nice that people talk about me in other positions at the club,' Lahm admitted. 'I've got another three years at the club, let's wait and see what happens then. 'Of course I can imagine myself staying here after I've finished playing, that goes without question.'

"Cristiano Ronaldo left the pitch with a supporter trying to hug him, Gareth Bale left it knowing that once again the fingers of blame will be pointing at him after his first half miss after Diego Godin’s slip. On a night when Atletico Madrid’s defence once again showed why it is one of the toughest to break down in Europe all three Real Madrid forwards were unable to get the better of their rivals. Bale was often the brightest of Real’s front three but his miss was still the clearest. Bale will not find too much consolation in the fact that he linked well with Ronaldo in the first half. With Atletico Madrid’s left-back position still bearing a Filipe Luis-shaped hole, Bale attacked at will and he looked for Ronaldo with his crosses as the Portuguese found himself in centre-forward territory regularly throughout the first 45 minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo is confronted by a supporter at the end of the 0-0 draw on Tuesday night . Ronaldo gives the fan a hug after a frustrating night at the Vicente Calderon for Real Madrid . There seems little doubt the man who is fast approaching Real’s all-time goals record will finish his playing days as a central striker and he came into this game with a scoring rate of a goal every 74 minutes and seven goals in his last three matches. Bale had scored five in his last four games. Ronaldo had hit 15 in his 20 Madrid derbies; Bale had only netted one goal against Atletico, but what a goal it was – the strike that won the Champions League final. But neither man could find the finish to give Real a vital away goal. Both Bale and Ronaldo scored in extra-time in Lisbon and only an incredible performance from Jan Oblak prevented them from doing so in the first half. Bale had embraced his pal Luka Modric just before kick-off and the Croatian midfielder did his best to feed him at every opportunity. Gareth Bale misses the best chance of the match early in the first half as Jan Oblak saves . Ronaldo is squeezed out by Atletico midfielders Mario Suarez (left) and Gabi . When free-kicks came Real’s way they were almost all taken by Ronaldo, although Bale was allowed to run over one – and in fairness to Ronaldo all the set-pieces were awarded on Ronaldo’s favoured left-side of the penalty area. In the second half as Real’s momentum faded so did their deadly duo’s influence on the game. Bale apologised to Ronaldo after one misplaced pass. He probably shouldn’t have because he would have received the ball sooner if Ronaldo had not intercepted it before he reached him. Their understanding on the pitch still looks like it needs some working on but they will remain the biggest threat to Atletico in a week’s time.

"Paul Scholes has criticised Mario Mandzukic for over reacting after the Atletico Madrid striker appeared to be punched and bitten by Real Madrid's Daniel Carvajal. Mandzukic was the centre of attention in on-pitch scraps with Sergio Ramos, Raphael Varane and Carvajal during the Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Vicente Calderon. The Croatian striker was on the receiving end of a number of hits from Real defenders, even having his face cut following a Ramos elbow, but Scholes claimed the Atletico star was over-reacting to the challenges made on him. Mario Mandzukic complains he was elbowed after a clash with Sergio Ramos left him with a bloodied face . Daniel Carvajal appeared to move his mouth towards Mandzukic's arm in an off-the-ball scrap . The referee was not looking at the incident as Carvajal then struck out towards Mandzukic . The Atletico Madrid striker fell to ground after tussling with the Real Madrid defender . 'Mario was trying to cause a bit of trouble,' the former Manchester United midfielder told ITV. 'The amount of times he was down, he made a meal of a few things. He makes out to be a tough centre forward but he was anything but.' Ironically Mandzukic was booked for a foul on Varane when it looked like he had been elbowed again, shortly after he needed treatment to stem the blood flow from above his eye after a clash with Ramos. Carvajal, meanwhile, denied that he had bitten Mandzukic. He said: 'I've seen that after the game I have been accused of biting another player, I want to say clearly that I haven't bitten anybody, nor attempted to do so.' The Madrid derby saw Real control the first half before the scrappy second period was dominated by Mandzukic's battles off the ball.

Scholes states that the goalless draw means Atletico have the upper hand going into the second leg at the Bernabeu, after the Champions League holders failed to convert their first half chances, with Gareth Bale arguably wasting the best opportunity after being denied in a one-on-one with Jan Oblak. 'It could be a dangerous result for Real,' Scholes added. 'If Atletico get a goal at the Bernabeu, Real need two. Real should have won in the first half. Atletico have to thank their keeper for keeping them in it. 'The second half was poor and not a lot of chances were created. Real will be disappointed because how well they played in the first half, they missed a couple of chances and they could regret it.' Mandzukic's cut came after he was caught by an elbow from Sergio Ramos early in the second half .

"The Manchester derby will be more like El Clasico, with 14 native Spanish-speaking players due to be involved. Eight of United’s first-team squad and six from City are from Spain or Spanish-speaking countries. They are David de Gea, Victor Valdes, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera (all Spain), Marcos Rojo, Angel di Maria (both Argentina), Antonio Valencia (Ecuador) and Falcao (Colombia) at United, and Willy Caballero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Sergio Aguero (all Argentina), Jesus Navas and David Silva (both Spain) at City. Sergio Aguero will be one of 14 native Spanish-speaking players to feature in the Manchester derby on Sunday . United captain Wayne Rooney (centre) is likely to be just one of nine English-speakers to feature on Sunday . Nine English-speakers are expected to be in the two sides’ respective 18-man squads including England internationals Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Ashley Young, Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart, James Milner as well as Frank Lampard. Both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products. However, when Sir Alex arrived at Old Trafford he was disgusted to learn that City scooped the cream of Manchester's talent and quickly (and successfully) set about putting that right. A generation such as the Class of '92 is unlikely to be seen again, but the derby could see no Mancunians in either squad for the second time in a row. Sir Alex Ferguson was disgusted that City's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at United . Along with Ferguson, Eric Harrison (left) brought through the Class of 92, to include Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke . For three years, after the departure of Wes Brown to Sunderland, Danny Welbeck flew the Manchester flag. But following the Longsight lad's move to Arsenal, November's first instalment at the Etihad Stadium saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory. Rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned. Unless Tyler Blackett can stun the football world and force his way into Louis van Gaal's United line-up, it will be a Manc-free derby. Unless Tyler Blackett (centre) makes a comeback for United there won't be any local lads in the two XIs .","Manchester United face rivals Manchester City in the league on Sunday .

"Every weekend, Sportsmail tallies up the match ratings handed out by our team of reporters to bring you the Barclays Premier League team of the day. It was the Saturday that saw Leicester City keep their survival chances alive by coming from behind to beat West Brom and Tim Sherwood claim a priceless victory for Aston Villa at his former club Tottenham. Yannick Bolasie scored three as Crystal Palace shoved Sunderland closer to the drop zone, while Hull City remain in danger following a 2-0 loss at Southampton. Arsenal kept up their impressive recent form with a 1-0 win over Burnley, while the matches between West Ham-Stoke City and Swansea City-Everton ended in 1-1 draws. GOALKEEPER . Brad Guzan 7.5 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) This could prove the key moment if Aston Villa are to preserve their Premier League status, as Tim Sherwood returned to White Hart Lane and beat the club who ditched him last summer. He'll be grateful to goalkeeper Brad Guzan, who made a number of important saves to keep the Spurs challenge at bay. Goalkeeper Brad Guzan celebrates after Aston Villa's vital 1-0 win at Tottenham on Saturday . DEFENCE . Leandro Bacuna 7.5 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) It was an afternoon for stout hearts in the Villa defence as they clung on to Christian Benteke's 35th-minute goal but nobody was found wanting. Bacuna was effective in dealing with the Tottenham threat down his side of the pitch and also set up the winning goal. Villa's Leandro Bacuna tacks a run by Tottenham's Danny Rose during their 1-0 win at White Hart Lane . Scott Dann 7 (Sunderland vs CRYSTAL PALACE) Few preidcted that Palace would be sitting comfortably in 11th place at this point of the season, but that's the situation after their impressive 4-1 win at beleaguered Sunderland. Yannick Bolasie may have stolen the headlines but it was a win build also on solid defence and Dann was their stand-out performer at the back. Scott Dann tries to block an effort from Sunderland's Steven Fletcher during Saturday's contest . Ron Vlaar 8 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) After Benteke's opening goal on 35 minutes, Villa had to soak up a lot of Tottenham pressure and their central defensive pairing of Vlaar and Nathan Baker was excellent. The Dutchman needed to draw on a good deal of his experience and he commanded the back line with aplomb. Ron Vlaar keeps a check on in-form Tottenham striker Harry Kane at White Hart Lane . Nacho Monreal 7 (Burnley vs ARSENAL) Arsenal have found a new resoluteness on their travels and this was much in evidence at Turf Moor as they came away with a narrow but well-deserved win over Burnley. Monreal was a big part of this, performing his duties well both at the back and going forward. Nacho Monreal controls the ball during Arsenal's 1-0 win at Burnley on Saturday . MIDFIELD . Fabian Delph 8 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) Delph has been a bright point in an otherwise disheartening season for Villa and he was one of their strongest performers again at Tottenham as he took control of the midfield battle. Indeed, the England international could have scored a second goal towards the end but one was enough for Sherwood's team. Fabian Delph turns away with the ball from Tottenham winger Andros Townsend . Aaron Ramsey 8.5 (Burnley vs ARSENAL) While the Gunners' resugrence may have come to late to stop Chelsea claiming the title, their form since the turn of the year has offered great encouragement. Ramsey is often at the core of this and his energetic performance at Burnley was rewarded with a 12th-minute winner that took Arsenal's record to 15 wins in 17 games. Aaron Ramsey celebrates with Hector Bellerin after scoring what proved to be Arsenal's winner at Burnley . Wilfried Zaha 7.5 (Sunderland vs CRYSTAL PALACE) 'Ruthless, unforgiving... Too fast, too powerful' - that was the verdict of Sportsmail's Craig Hope on Zaha as Palace ran riot at Sunderland. The winger was a constant menace for the home defence and helped improve Palace's record to 25 points from a possible 36 since Alan Pardew took charge. Wilfried Zaha gets past Sunderland's Steven Fletcher to set off on one of his marauding runs . FORWARDS . Yannick Bolasie 9 (Sunderland vs CRYSTAL PALACE) A moment of history for Bolasie as he became the first Palace player to score a hat-trick in the Premier League. His treble at the Stadium of Light came in an electric 11 minutes after the break and turned a slender away victory into a rout. His second was the best, a chip over Costel Pantilimon after he pounced to rob a dithering John O'Shea of the ball. Yannick Bolasie wheels away in celebration after completing his hat-trick for Palace against Sunderland . Christian Benteke 8.5 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) Benteke's 11 goals this season have been vital in keeping their head above water in the Premier League relegation battle and he again popped up with the winner at Spurs. Benteke outjumped Fazio to reach a Bacuna cross and direct a header beyond Michel Vorm to settle the contest. Christian Benteke celebrates his winner for Aston Villa against Tottenham at White Hart Lane . Jamie Vardy 7.5 (West Brom vs LEICESTER) His stoppage time goal at The Hawthorns offered fresh hope that Leicester may pull off the Great Escape and came about through sheer force of will. Vardy robbed Gareth McAuley of possession on the halfway line and advanced beyond Joleon Lescott to score and complete Leicester's late comeback. Jamie Vardy celebrates his stoppage time winner for Leicester City at West Brom .","Bolasie scored three goals as Palace beat Sunderland 4-1 .

"Wilfried Zaha has admitted he felt ‘worthless’ during his two-year spell as a Manchester United player after his dream move to Old Trafford turned sour. The 22-year-old winger was signed by then Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013 from Crystal Palace for £10million. But the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at Old Trafford until the summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. Wilfried Zaha has rediscovered his form at Crystal Palace this season . During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff. ‘There is nothing worse than not being involved,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘You are sitting there thinking ‘what exactly am I? A footballer who is not playing football?’ You feel a bit worthless sitting in the stands, watching all the time. You have nothing to speak about with the players. Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . ‘If you have played the game then it’s “well done” or “you should have passed here or there”. But when you haven’t played… I think people lose a bit of respect for you. I think they are thinking ‘well, he’s not played’. They don’t have anything to speak to you about. It’s a big thing.’ ‘There were so many rumours about me that were not true. And they hurt me because all I was doing was keeping my head down to do my best every time and then after training I’d go home and there would be something in the paper or wherever about me not having a good attitude and that’s why I wasn’t playing, rumours about my private life and that’s why I wasn’t playing, me turning up late for this, turning up late for that.’ Zaha revealed the last straw came when he was left on the bench against League One outfit MK Dons as United crashed out of the Capital One Cup 4-0 last August. Eventually he spoke to new United boss Louis Van Gaal, who confirmed that he wasn't part of his first-team plans and so he headed back on a season-long loan deal to Palace, where he flourished under Alan Pardew, and the deal was made permanent in February this year. Louis Van Gaal told Zaha he wasn't part of his plans after Capital One Cup snub .","Wilfried Zaha joined Manchester United for £10m in January 2013 .

"Lionel Messi is not the best player in the world, neither is Cristiano Ronaldo - that title belongs to Paris Saint-Germain forward Javier Pastore, according to Eric Cantona. Making a rare foray into discussing football matters, Manchester United legend Cantona delivered his surprising verdict that the Argentine was the ‘most creative’ player in the world. ‘The best player in the world, the most exciting player in the world, is [Javier] Pastore from Paris Saint-Germain,’ said Cantona, ‘Why? Because I watched two games just to see Pastore playing, giving passes. He has got something special. Because football is interactive, it's why football is so popular, I think.’ Javier Pastore (right) celebrates after winning the French League Cup with PSG last Saturday . The Argentina international is the best player in the world, according to former striker Eric Cantona . The former Manchester United forward was speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Pastore, who cost the French league leaders £29million, has three goals and five assists this season compared with Messi’s 45 goals for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo’s 51 for Spanish rivals Real Madrid. But statistics did not colour Cantona’s assessment. ‘Pastore can do things that the other ones don't know, he does things that surprise you every time. Not only in scoring goals, spectacular goals - everything. Just passing. He's a very creative player. He's the most creative player, I think, in the world today. It's why I think he's the best player in the world, because I love this kind of player.’ Cantona was third in the Ballon d’Or in 1993 behind Roberto Baggio and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Premier League four times with United before retiring from playing aged 30. No stranger to prompting debate, Cantona invited more controversy by suggesting Spain had only won the World Cup because of the influence of Barcelona on the national team. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the best player in the world for 2014 at the award ceremony in January . The Real Madrid forward has scored 51 goals in all competitions this season . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has also been overlooked by Cantona despite netting 45 times this season . ‘Catalonia won the World Cup,’ said Cantona, speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai. ‘Spain won it with 10 Barcelona players in the team. Spain did not win the World Cup, Catalonia did. Barcelona won it. ‘My grandparents are from Catalunya, from Barcelona. They arrived in France in '39. There was a civil war. So, I am very proud of Barcelona and all that they have done. ‘I’m sure that as soon as the youth set-up from Barcelona and other Spanish teams draw new, good players, Spain will emerge again.’","Eric Cantona says PSG midfielder Javier Pastore is world's best player .

"The Champions League returned this week with eight teams vying for a place in the semi-finals. Three of them are from Spain and with Madrid rivals Real and Atletico, squaring up on Tuesday, the papers had plenty to go on. They focused on the derby clash, which ended 0-0 thanks to an inspiring display from Atletico keeper Jan Oblak. Marca's front page on Wednesday leads on Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak's impressive display . Real Madrid drew 0-0 with city rivals Atletico, while Barcelona prepare for their European tie with PSG . Marca led with: 'The Oblak Wall', while AS claim that Real could have settled the tie in the first half, '...but Oblak said no.' The Spanish papers were also quick to praise 'dazzling displays' from Raphael Varane and Arda Turan, for Real and Atletico respectively, while noting that Carlo Ancelotti's side failed to score on a fourth straight visit to the Vicente Calderon. AS described the tie as still having everything to play for as the two sides head to the Bernabeu on April 22, but suspended Marcelo and Merio Suarez will both miss the game. Wednesday night sees the final Spanish team take to the field, as Barcelona face Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital. AS claim that Real Madrid could have settled the tie in the first half... 'but Oblak said no' The Slovenian goalkeeper, who is not even his country's No 1, prepares to save a shot from Gareth Bale . Marca note that Barca face the only team to have beaten them in the Champions League this season; a Group F match in which PSG ran out 3-2 winners in September. Neymar will start for Barcelona, according to AS, despite his reaction to being substituted against Sevilla. The Brazilian superstar was seen gesturing behind manager Luis Enrique's back and appeared unhappy to have been taken off. Enrique, though, says: 'I've not seen the pictures from the Pizjuan (Sevilla's stadium)'. Mundo Deportivo claim that Barca need to leave the 'silly things' to one side in a decisive game. PSG do not have Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Motta or Marco Verratti to call upon, but they do have 'David Luiz and a dangerous attack.' The Italian papers focus on Juventus' important victory over Monaco in their Champions League quarter-final . Arturo Vidal took most of the plaudits from the press after scoring the only goal  from the penalty spot . Over in Italy, Wednesday's newspapers are screaming the name of Arturo Vidal, who scored the only goal of the game to give Juventus the advantage over opponents Monaco. Although the Chilean took most of the plaudits, La Gazzetta dello Sport pay tribute to goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, labelling him 'the best on the pitch'. The Italian paper are honest in their assessment of the result, admitting that Vidal's goal came from a 'disputed penalty', and they call the win a 'precious result'. Elsewhere, Corriere dello Sport write of a 'stretched and difficult match' while Allegri, after the game, commented: 'See? They are strong...' Tuttosport lead with the headline 'Ole Vidal', with a picture of the Chilean's screaming celebration in front of the home fans. The next leg will take place next Wednesday in Monaco.","Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid drew 0-0 in their Champions League tie .

"From top to third to second to top to second again. What a perfect game to represent such an absurd season. Bournemouth were out of it. Then they were in it. Then it all went bonkers and Eddie Howe was caught between feelings of regret and unhappiness with Paul Tierney, the referee. The stripped-down fact is that it finished 2-2. The glorious detail is that Bournemouth trailed to a Kieran Lee sucker punch, levelled through Yann Kermorgant and then had a man sent off. A problem? Not really. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . BOURNEMOUTH: Boruc, Francis, Elphick, Cook, (Jones 64), Daniels, Ritchie, Arter, Surman, Pugh (Smith 57), Kermorgant (Ward 81), Wilson . Subs not used: Camp, Gosling, Pitman, Fraser . Booked: Cook . Red card: Francis . SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY: Kirkland, Buxton, Lees, Zayatte (Vermijl 45), Helan Hutchinson (Maghoma 15), Melo Silva, Maguire, Lee, Isgrove (Nuhiu 63), Lavery . Subs not used: Westwood, May, McCabe, Bus . Booked: Buxton, Helan, Isgrove . Referee: Paul Tierney . Attendance:11,280 . Matt Ritchie scored the kind of goal that belongs in the Premier League to put them in front. Job done? Not nearly. Chris Maguire scored a penalty for Wednesday deep into stoppage time and three point became one; a big step towards the top flight became a stumble. Howe was left 'heartbroken', but also frustrated, not least because he felt Callum Wilson deserved a penalty in the second half when he appeared to be fouled by Lewis Buxton. Bournemouth have had 15 penalties this season and Howe suggested that might be counting against them, saying in a radio interview: 'It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said don’t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don’ t want them to have any more.' His broader disappointment was also clear, having blown a major opportunity to keep top spot in a thrilling division. He said: 'It really is tough to take. That is why we love the game – the drama and twists and turns. 'The pain and frustration we need to transfer into motivation. This is our most successful season but we have had low moments. We have only two games and our objective is clear. We have to use this as motivation to move forward now. We have to respond.' Lee had put Wednesday in front with a 36th-minute header before Kermorgant levelled midway through the second half. A draw at that stage might have seemed fair but Simon Francis was sent off for two yellow cards and Bournemouth were back on the ropes. Cue bedlam. Ritchie launched a shot into the top corner after Andrew Surman laid off a free-kick but Maguire added to the madness in stoppage time. Wednesday manager Stuart Grey couldn't help but chuckle. He said: 'It took six and a half hours to get down here but we got on with it. If we left without anything it would have been disappointing.' Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his 36th minute header put the visitors ahead . Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute .

"Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti has heaped praise on Zlatan Ibrahimovic for playing an 'essential' role for the French club. The 33-year-old striker has bagged 17 Ligue 1 goals for Laurent Blanc's side this season, but Verratti believes his input off the pitch is just as important. He told FourFourTwo: 'I'd like to talk to you about what Zlatan is like behind closed doors, because everyone knows what he's like on the pitch.

"Eric Cantona claimed Manchester United are ‘kings of the city’ again after their derby victory on Sunday and the club legend believes they have found the right man in Louis van Gaal to drive them to the Premier League title next year. The former United striker made a rare foray into football matters at the Laureus Sports Awards in Shanghai and spoke about diverse subjects, ranging from soft porn – in defence of his latest film – to his old side’s changing fortunes. Cantona once professed his desire to be the manager at Old Trafford but has changed his mind, predicting United would recapture their old dominance under Van Gaal. He also said the onus they put on developing young players in their academy gives them the edge over City in the long run.

I was proud and very glad. It's good because now they are the kings of the city again,’ said Cantona, ‘City have won the league twice, so they have been successful but they cannot win every year because the Premier League is so strong, it has so many clubs, so many rich clubs. ‘Some of them work on the young players and can buy the best players in the world, like United. I prefer this kind of club, who are rich enough to buy the best players they want, and also works on young players. ‘United is a great club, so sometimes you have a season when you have to lose games and you finish fourth, fifth. But they came back and next year they can win the league. With a manager from Holland, it seems to be important for Manchester United because it's the same kind of philosophy for the game: Holland and Manchester United.’ Cantona famously turned his back on football aged 30 having made 185 appearances in the red shirt of United and has forged a successful acting career. His latest film You And The Night was dubbed ‘soft porn’ because of explicit sex scenes but Cantona defended his role.

But you can see it like this. It's beautiful. You should see it. Unfortunately, porn is not so aesthetic and so beautiful. But love is sex also, you know? This kind of story for the ones who have seen it - I'm sure nobody has seen it - it's too beautiful. This kind of story, when you choose to do it, you have to know the director. If it's somebody special, if it's a real artist, you can do it. You can give, and be confident enough.’ The incident Cantona will be remembered for by many in England happened on January 25, 1995, when he launched a kung-fu kick at Crystal Palace supporter Matthew Simmons in the moments after he had been sent off.

But with a quick adjustment of his baker boy cap and a smile, Cantona said he had no regrets. ‘The kung-fu kick, it was great, too,’ he said, ‘I think the good thing from that is, through me, everybody can realise, in your life, you can do good things and bad things. I've done things I'm proud about and I've done some bad things that I don't regret because it's just my life. And if you're happy, it's good. If you're not happy, I don't care.

"Eddie Howe was at a loss as to why his Bournemouth side were not awarded a 'clear-cut' penalty in their 2-2 draw with Sheffield Wednesday. The Cherries looked on course for a return to the top of the Sky Bet Championship going into stoppage time after Yann Kermorgant and Matt Ritchie scored, only for Chris Maguire to earn the Owls a point from the spot after a foul on Atdhe Nuhiu. But it was the failure of referee Paul Tierney not to give the hosts their 16th spot-kick of the campaign in the 65th minute for a foul on striker Callum Wilson that left Howe frustrated. Eddie Howe was at a loss as to why his Bournemouth side were not awarded a 'clear-cut' penalty . Callum Wilson is brought down by a Sheffield Wednesday defender during the draw at Dean Court . Bournemouth's Wilson reacts after the referee decides not to award a penalty to the striker . The former Coventry man, who has won Bournemouth a string of spot-kicks in recent months with his pace and direct running, looked to have been fouled by Lewis Buxton but the decision was not given, sparking furious reactions from supporters behind the goal. And Howe shared their exasperation. 'I don't even know what to say because I don't want to get myself in trouble,' Howe said. 'Let me say I disagree with the decision. 'That for me is the most clear-cut penalty I've seen this season involving my side. And a red card. 'I can't understand why it wasn't given. You will have to ask the referee whether the amount of penalties he (Wilson) has got has worked against him. Who knows? For me a penalty is a penalty and it has got to be given. 'Callum is quick and an athletic player and because of the way he plays he naturally draws fouls. If there is a limit to the amount of penalties that can be given then the Football League should let us know.' Wilson uses his pace to get round the back of the Sheffield Wednesday defence at Dean Court . Owls manager Stuart Gray, however, revealed Buxton believes he got a touch to the ball when tackling Wilson. 'I respect what the referee decided,' Gray said. 'Lewis Buxton said he got a touch of the ball first and you can understand the crowd's reaction. 'The referee had a decision to make and Bournemouth have had 15 penalties this season so they are obviously doing something right going forward.'

Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray celebrates after his are awarded a late penalty at Dean Court . The manner of the late leveller was a real kick in the teeth for Bournemouth after they had bounced back from Kieran Lee's opener and had then taken the lead despite having 10 men following Simon Francis' second yellow card. But their promotion hopes remain in their own hands and they know victory over Bolton live on TV and at Charlton on the final day will see them reach the top flight for the first time in their history. 'That really is tough to take,' Howe added. 'That is the reason why we love the game, with its drama and twists and turns even in one game. It was a heartbreaking end to the game for us. 'Even though we have had the most successful season in the club's history, we have had many moments when we have felt low and down and we have to respond to adversity. 'We only have two games to go now and again our objective is very clear. If we do that then we will be where we want to be.' Gray was heartened with Wednesday's fighting spirit even though there was nothing on the line with safety secured. Matt Ritchie wheels away in celebration after giving Bournemouth the lead against Sheffield Wednesday . 'We knew it was going to be difficult coming here because their tails are up,' he added. 'When we went 2-1 down I was thinking we didn't deserve that as my players were giving everything. 'We thought maybe it wasn't going to be our day but we kept going until the final whistle and I thought if I left this building without anything I would have been very disappointed.'","Eddie Howe was left to rue the decisions of referee Paul Tierney .

"Napoli all but secured their place in the semi-finals of the Europa League after inflicting a devastating defeat on Wolfsburg at the Volkswagen Arena on Thursday night. Gonzalo Higuain and Marek Hamsik put the visitors firmly in control as Rafa Benitez's side struck twice in the opening 45 minutes before the Slovakian midfielder added a third after the break. Substitute Manolo Gabbiadini made it four just moments after replacing two-goal hero Hamisk from the bench before former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner pulled a goal back for the hosts.

Scorer(s): Higuain 15, Hamsik 23, 64, Gabbiadini 76 . Manager: Rafa Benitez . Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz . Wolfsburg came into the clash having lost just once in their last 26 matches in all competitions, a run that included two victories against Italian opposition Inter Milan in the previous round. And the Germans started the game brightly as they looked to impose their slick passing game on Napoli, but it was the visitors who opened the scoring. Dries Mertens checked back on to his right foot from wide on the left and delivered an inch-perfect ball over the top for Higuain, who was just onside. The Argentine striker brought the ball under control with what looked like a combination of chest and upper arm before firing past Diego Benaglio with the outside of his right foot - his seventh of the competition. The Wolfsburg defenders were rightly aggrieved but their protestations fell on deaf ears as the referee waved away their handball appeals. They could have no complaints seven minutes later, however, as Hamsik broke clear of the Wolves' backline to apply a composed finish to a slick, flowing move that ended with Higuain's defence-splitting pass. Gonzalo Higuain gave Napoli the lead with a smart finish via the outside his foot after 15 minutes . Slovakian Hamsik doubled the Italians lead midway through the first half to put them firmly in control . The Napoli captain celebrates in front of the travelling supporters after finishing off a fine move . Wolfsburg almost halved the deficit on the stroke of half-time. Former Chelsea forward Andre Schurrle cut in from the left and struck a rasping drive that needed every inch of Mariano Andujar's frame to tip the effort onto the crossbar. Some sloppy Wolfsburg play  allowed Hamsik to grab his second on 64 minutes as the tie slipped away from Dieter Hecking's side. Benaglio played the ball out to Josuha Guilavogui, who turned and passed the ball straight to Jose Callejon. The former Real Madrid midfielder skipped into the penalty are before squaring for Hamsik to turn into an empty net as Napoli took a firm grip on this last eight tie.

Wolfsburg had only failed to score in two of their last 26 matches and they had a goal back with 10 minutes left. Ivan Perisic broke to the byline before crossing for Bendtner to tap home. This was already the Germans' heaviest home defeat in European competition but it could have been five moments later as Gabbiandini struck the crossbar with a wicked dipping effort from 25 yards.","Gonzalo Higuain gave visitors the lead after 15 minutes with a smart finish .

"Easing through a relatively straight-forward group to reach the latter stages, there aren't many who would have tipped Porto to go all the way in the Champions League this season. 11 years ago the Portuguese outfit achieved the impossible as Jose Mourinho guided an unfancied squad to  glory but since then they have flattered to deceive, only reaching the quarter-finals on one occasion before this season. Julen Lopetegui has masterminded an unbeaten Champions League campaign for Porto this season . Ricardo Quaresma scored twice as Porto beat Bayern Munich 3-1 in the first leg of their quarter-final . The Portuguese side beat the odds to claim the Champions League trophy after defeating Monaco in 2004 . Jose Mourinho lead Porto to glory that year but later moved to take over at Chelsea in the Premier League . Julen Lopetegui has assembled an exciting team, a squad based around technical ability and a high-pressing game, a side that demolished Basle 5-1 on aggregate in the last round and are unbeaten in the competition. After finishing third behind current leaders Benfica and Sporting Lisbon last season, the 'Dragons' took quite a risk in opting for Lopetegui. The 48-year-old had only managed two seasons at club level with Rayo Vallecano and Real Madrid B before impressing as coach in the Spanish youth ranks. The likes of David de Gea, Koke, Isco and Thiago came through under Lopetegui, while he has brought in Oliver Torres and Cristian Tello to develop a defined style of play. Only Bayern, Barcelona and Juventus can better their average possession of 58 per cent. Yacine Brahimi has been a shining light for Porto in this European campaign, netting a hat-trick against Basle to take his tally to five goals, while he has been credited with three assists. Only Lionel Messi (12) Cristiano Ronaldo (11) and Luiz Adriano (9) have been involved in more Champions League goals this season. But it was not the Algerian who took centre stage last week as Bayern were dismantled. That honour went to Ricardo Quaresma - a maverick figure in the dressing room. Heralded as Portugal's next big thing as a teenager, breaking through at Sporting Lisbon just like Cristiano Ronaldo, Quaresma struggled to live up to his reputation at Barcelona and Inter Milan. Unsuccessful short spells at Chelsea, Besiktas and Al-Ahli followed, and now 31, Quaresma is certainly enjoying his second spell at Porto. Quaresma slots the ball past Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at the Dragao Stadium . The winger struggled during short spells with Chelsea (left) and Inter Milan (right) Quaresma and his Porto team-mates look relaxed during training at the Allianz Arena on Monday . It was last chance saloon for the winger when Porto gave him a chance in December 2013, having been without a club for six months. Not many top-flight clubs, let alone those challenging the European elite would have given him a chance. But his double against Bayern alone would suggest Porto made the right choice. Quaresma has always been a man with immense technical ability and flair, and his early penalty as well as his desire and finish past Manuel Neuer to send the home crowd into raptures further demonstrated his class. Lopetegui has played Quaresma and Tello either side of Jackson Martinez up front, with three midfield players providing the base. His style of play has been embraced in Porto, while his popularity in his home country may have been a factor in Casemiro and Tello opting for loan moves in Portugal. The Real Madrid and Barcelona duo have relished the first-team opportunities that have come their way. The Brazilian stopper's presence in the holding midfield role, allows the smaller, more technical playmakers around him to strut their stuff. Jackson Martinez is a Premier League target and had lead the line superbly for Porto this season . Lopetegui gives instructions to Brazilian right back Danilo at the Dragao Stadium last week . Oliver Torres (left) and Hector Herrera (right) close down Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago . But that is not to say Porto have lost an identity which has seen them balance their books while remaining successful on all fronts. Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Eliaquim Mangala are just three of a whole host of players who were sold for over £30million, after being bought, comparatively, on the cheap. The above transfer technique comes naturally to Porto; there are no real work-permit issues in Portugal unlike England and the rest of mainland Europe, and South American players can begin playing there whenever they like. That package gives the Primeira Liga side a win-win situation. They pay little to attract talented but relatively unknown stars, while the players themselves want to get to Europe as quickly as possible to elevate themselves on the football ladder - the Champions League is the perfect platform to perform - and possibly attract other bidders. It's certainly a profitable cycle. There are now many more talents who could make a transfer window. Maruading right back Danilo has already penned a deal with Real Madrid, Jackson Martinez is seemingly constantly a Premier League target, while Alex Sandro and Hector Herrera are also highly regarded. That is not to mention Brahimi, who Man United and City are said to be chasing. His influence in the Champions League season would not go amiss at the Etihad Stadium as Manuel Pellegrini's side look to make their mark in Europe. Yacine Brahimi has been Porto's star man in the Champions League and has five goals in the competition . Radamel Falcao (left) and James Rodriguez (right) were sold for big money - as is the club's way . Porto are hoping to knock Bayern Munich out of the Champions League and send shockwaves across Europe . Porto were able to rest nine players against Academica, a victory that kept them just three points behind Benfica at the top of the table after a shoddy domestic start. They haven't lost a game in the league since January. That is in stark contrast to Bayern, who could add Franck Ribery's absence to the likes of Arjen Robben, David Alaba and Javi Martinez. Lopetegui though, maintains that Porto need to play a 'great' game to beat what he claims are one of the best sides in history. 'We have to produce a great performance against one of the greatest teams in the history of Bayern,' Lopetegui, who is a former Barcelona and Spain team-mate of Guardiola, said in his pre-game press conference on Monday. 'I am expecting a superb Bayern team, regardless of who they will end up playing and we are prepared for what will happen. 'It will be a very difficult task but we will try to find simple answers, we like the idea of playing Bayern, who are one of the best teams in the world. We cannot think about what could happen, we must focus on the game tomorrow and try to give the answer on the pitch,' Pep Guardiola and Lopetegui embrace before kick-off of the Champions League quarter-final first-leg .

"Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben has said he has 'felt disabled' during his latest spell on the sidelines with a troublesome abdominal injury. The Holland international has missed his side's last three games for Bayern Munich and is expected to miss the upcoming Champions League tie against Porto. Robben, who is close to returning to full fitness, has revealed he will be able to start running again in a few days and plans on returning for Bayern's cup match against Borussia Dortmund. Arjen Robben has said he has felt 'physically disabled' during the last few weeks due to an abdominal injury . Bayern Munich ace Robben has missed his side's last four matches due an abdominal injury . The former Chelsea star, speaking to Bild, said: 'You always want to be on the pitch to help your team, but you can only watch them when you're injured. That is the worst situation for a footballer. 'I've had a lot of injuries in my career, but this is something new - I've never had something like this before. With this kind of an injury, you're physically disabled.

"His voice cracked with emotion at times and in the next breath he laughed at questions and joked with his boss, Borussia Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc. In short, Jurgen Klopp’s farewell press conference was much like his seven years at the club: engaging, compelling and infused with passion. Klopp is leaving Borussia Dortmund after seven seasons in which he has won two Bundesliga titles, the German Cup and reached the Champions League final, in 2013 at Wembley. Wednesday was not quite ‘auf wiedersehen’ as there are eight more matches of the season to play. Manager Jurgen Klopp announced he would be leaving Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season . Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, Klopp and Michael Zorc  of Dortmund were present for the press conference at Signal Iduna Park on Wednesday . Photographers snap away at Klopp as journalists gather during the announcement of his Dortmund exit . Yet an era is coming to an end and not just at Dortmund, but – and this is tribute to the charisma he has evoked during his time there – in European football. Like Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho, Klopp has elevated himself into the realms of the cult manager. He is distinct in that he is much more open than Guardiola and seemingly much less calculating than Mourinho, though that in itself is, of course, a calculation. Though there is much more to Dortmund than just Klopp, at times it seems that it has been his sheer force of personality which has carried the club. Klopp was emotionally charged during the press conference as he couldn't resist showing his sadness . But Klopp also had moments where he laughed along with his boss Zorc during the press conference . Borussia Dortmund celebrate in front of their fans after winning a league match against Hamburg in 2011 . There are many reasons why Dortmund have captured the imagination of fans across the world and especially in England: there is the extraordinary atmosphere of the Westfalenstadion and the 82,000 fans; there are the season tickets available at £160; the membership structure which allows fans a say in the running of the club; the little ritual at the end of the game where the players gather in he centre circle, join hands and thank the fans. They came to represent everything the Premier League isn’t. BORUSSIA DORTMUND: . German league champions: 2010-11, 2011-12 . German cup: 2012 . Champions League runners-up: 2012-13 . INDIVIDUAL: . German manager of the year: 2011, 2012 . FIFA coach of the year runner-up: 2013 . And then there were the players, like Marco Reus, Mario Gotze, Robert Lewandowski and Mats Hummels, electrifying the Champions League with their energy and verve. But it was Klopp who was the public face of a club, the embodiment of all that. He was a journeyman football from Mainz, a second-rate lower league team when he played for them. Only when he managed them did they become a Bundesliga force, qualifying for the UEFA Cup, a track record which eventually earned him the Dortmund job. The club was emerging from bankruptcy when he arrived and he has helped to transformed them into one of Europe’s elite football institutions. And whenever they have lost key players – Nuri Sahin, Shinji Kagawa, Gotze, Lewandowski – it seemed to make no difference. The team just took stock and rolled on. It seemed Klopp alone could keep driving the model ever upwards and onwards. Except this season the momentum ground to a halt. In February they were bottom of the Bundesliga and relegation loomed. They have recovered and are tenth but were dumped out of the Champions League by Juventus. Klopp claimed today that he is not tired and that he doesn’t require a sabbatical. But it was hard to avoid the conclusion that the pressure of trying to keep up with Bayern as they cherry picked his best players had finally proved too much. Klopp (left) stands alongside Hansa Rostock boss Juri Schlunz during his days as Mainz manager, where he built the foundations of his reputation after guiding them into the UEFA Cup . After winning the Bundesliga in 2011, Klopp celebrates with Dortmund fans as he holds the trophy . But Klopp would fall one step short in winning the Champions League as his Dortmund team lost to Bayern Munich in the 2013 final at Wembley. Here he stands with Kevin Grosskreutz following the loss . ‘This wasn’t a calculated decision, it wasn’t planned it’s not tactical,’ said Klopp. ‘It’s just that I simply believe that it’s right and important that we can announce this today so we can be up front and begin to make a logical plan to bring this to an end.’ There is another side to Klopp, of course. He could match Mourinho for haranguing referees and has been known to go into full tantrum mode on the touchline. And his stylised open-ness isn’t for everyone. He met with Manchester City officials when the club were considering replacements for Roberto Mancini; they opted for Manuel Pellegrini. It will be interesting to see whether City will now give Klopp a second chance. Klopp has in the past been linked with taking over from Arsene Wenger (right) at Arsenal as the duo shake hands before a Champions League tie at the Emirates Stadium last November . As he barks instructions from the touchline, Klopp's emotional grasp of the game makes him ideal for the Premier League. The Dortmund boss shows his fury after his side fall behind against Stuttgart in September . Arsene Wenger was less than amused when he compared Arsenal to an orchestra playing a ‘silent song,’ adding: ‘I prefer heavy metal.’ It came at a time when Wenger was under pressure, an older man who seemed to be struggling to keep up with the new wave; Klopp knew how to make the point. In many ways he does seem made for the Premier League. His capacity to embrace a club emotionally makes him the thinking man’s Ian Holloway. The sheer relentlessness of his teams and their work-rate means he would have no problem passing the Premier League’s ‘foreigner test’ otherwise known as wet, windy night at Stoke. ‘What I love is fighting football,’ Klopp once said, explaining that in Germany they even call this ‘English’ football. ‘Rainy day, heavy pitch, everybody is dirty in the face. This is Borussia.’ It is Klopp’s mantra too. He clearly won’t lack for offers. And wherever he goes, you can expect Klopp to be the centre of attention.","Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp will leave post this summer .

"Manchester City have defended price hikes after some fans saw the cost of their season tickets almost double. A number of fans in the East Stand at the Etihad Stadium have been informed that their £885 season cards will rocket to £1,750. But the club say that is because the seats have been upgraded and now come with a different package. Some Etihad season tickets have seen their price double, despite empty seats at times this season . Some fans will now have to pay over £1,700 to watch Manuel Pellegrini's side, up from just £885 . They also point out that they still have 8,000 seats below Manchester United’s cheapest offering. Some of the fans affected claim City, who face a fight to secure Champions League football after winning last season’s Premier League title, are abusing their loyalty. One fan said: ‘After the season we have had you would think that if anything they would be lowering the prices. ‘When I was told about how much they were going up to I thought it was an error. They are taking advantage of us, despite how poor they have been this year.’ The club point out that they have reviewed pricing at the stadium following its extension, which will see the capacity rise from 48,000 to 54,000 next season. City claim the change is due to upgrades which have come in during the stadium's expansion . City have slumped to fourth this season after some poor performances in their title defence . They also cite improvements to seating and add that a number of fans have seen a decrease in the price of their ticket. City add that they have increased the number of £299 season tickets available with only Stoke City offering cheaper. The club confirmed yesterday that playmaker David Silva did not suffer any fractures in Sunday’s Premier League win over West Ham. Silva was taken to hospital for checks on his cheekbone and collarbone after being caught in the face by an elbow from Hammers midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate at the Etihad Stadium.","Manchester City fans see prices of some tickets rise from £885 to £1,750 .

"David Silva declared himself fit on Sunday night despite fears he had fractured his cheekbone after being caught in the face by Cheikhou Kouyate’s elbow. The Manchester City star was carried off in the win over West Ham following eight minutes of treatment on the pitch, where he was given oxygen. He went to hospital as a precaution but later posted on social media to ease fans’ worries, and the club announced on Monday that tests showed no fracture.

Silva turns around in pain before receiving several minutes treatment and being given oxygen . ‘Many thanks to all the messages of support, all the tests have gone well and I’m already home. The three points is what was important!’ he tweeted. Kouyate was only booked by referee Anthony Taylor and City boss Manuel Pellegrini believes the Senegal midfielder did not mean to injure his player. ‘I always think that a player doesn’t want to damage another player,’ he said. ‘The referee was so near and he decided it was unintentional. ‘He decides what happens and gave a yellow card. I hope that it was an accidental collision. ‘At this moment Silva is in hospital and they are checking if he has a broken bone in his cheek. It looked serious but we must wait for what happens at the hospital.’ Asked if Silva has been knocked unconscious, Pellegrini added: ‘I don’t know. The doctor has some doubts about that. After that he recovers well so we are checking.’ West Ham manager Sam Allardyce claimed that the incident was ‘accidental’, saying: ‘It was innocuous. I didn’t think it was a foul. ‘Everybody thinks it is more serious attack from Cheikhou than it was. ‘It wasn’t deliberate at all. He has no idea, it has happened from behind him. I have seen the reaction from the video on the laptop.’ Silva was given put in a neck brace and given oxygen as his concerned team-mates looked on . City bounced back from their defeat in the Manchester derby to win 2-0 through James Collins’s own-goal and Sergio Aguero’s 20th Premier League strike of the season. Pellegrini’s side are now one point behind third-placed Manchester United, who lost at leaders Chelsea on Saturday, in the race for a top-four finish and seven clear of Liverpool in fifth. ‘I think it was very important for our team to win,’ said the City boss. ‘We were coming from two defeats in a row, and always when one is a derby it is worse.’ After seeing the Hammers fail to win for the 10th time in 11 games, Allardyce said: ‘The most disappointing thing was the goals we gifted City. The two mistakes we make for the goals, one was pretty bizarre and the other unexpected from a player as experienced as Stewart Downing.’ The loss of Silva will be a big blow to Manchester City if his facial injury is as serious as first feared . Silva was taken off on a stretcher before being rushed to hospital as Manuel Pellegrini has a nervous wait . Jamie Carragher believes the FA have no option but to look into the incident. 'I think they will look at it. It's one of those where no one knows but him if he meant to do it. It was like when Costa stamped on Skrtel. 'Nobody can say 100 per cent, only he knows but you know as players, there are certain challenges or when you're running past someone you think - I can get away with this. 'I think he's gone past and gone I'll leave one on Silva and I'll put my hands up like I never meant it. You couldn't prove it but it doesn't look good and should have been a red card.'","Manchester City defeated West Ham 2-1 in their Premier League clash .

Play resumed but trouble erupted between the players in the second half and, with further objects coming from the stands, both teams left the field and German referee Deniz Aytekin called the goalless game off after 67 minutes. A statement from European football's governing body read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) met today and announced the following decision in relation to various incidents that occurred during the European Qualifiers Group G match between Montenegro and Russia, which was played in Podgorica on 27 March. 'The CEDB has decided to declare the above-mentioned match as forfeited. As a consequence, the Football Association of Montenegro (FSCG) is deemed to have lost the game 3-0. A flare, hurled from the stands, hit the Russian keeper on the head in the opening seconds of the game . Igor Akinfeev is carried off the pitch on a stretcher, which led to an 30 minute delay before play resumed . The keeper was carried off the field to hospital for tests before eventually making a full recovery . 'In addition, the FSCG has been ordered to play its next two UEFA competition matches as host association behind closed doors. The second match to be played behind closed doors is deferred for a probationary period of two years. Finally, the association has been fined 50,000 euros.' Russia did not escape unpunished for their players' actions and were issued with a 25,000 euro (£18,143) fine. The head of the Football Association of Montenegro (FSCG) had branded fans who forced the abandonment as 'barbarians'. Montenegro fans light flares from the stands during the Euro 2016 qualifier on March 27 . Russian fans voice their displeasure after the game is eventually called off . In a statement published on the FSGC's website the day after the game, the association's secretary general Momir Durdevac said: 'The match from the first minute was on the verge of interruption. 'You saw how many people were involved in the organisation, how many times we asked the crowd to refrain from everything. 'But it seems that we do not deserve, neither the country nor the national team, a place in the big competition. Riot police clash with Montenegrin fans after the game is abandoned following a pitch brawl . 'They are here to disrupt, they are here to be barbarians. When we play against the great teams and great players, they are here to denounce these players, not to enjoy their skills. 'To interrupt the match, to throw something on the pitch, and then chant: 'Montenegro, I love you' - it is such hypocrisy, it's such primitivism that should not be seen anywhere. 'For me, the game should not have continued after the first minute.'","Russia's Euro 2016 qualifier with Montenegro on March 27 was abandoned .

"Manchester City's captain Vincent Kompany, manager Manuel Pellegrini and head of youth development Patrick Vieira were in attendance to watch the club's Under 18s side fall to a 3-1 defeat by Chelsea in the FA Youth Cup final final first-leg. Big-spending City, who have invested millions into ready-made first-team stars over the last few transfer windows, are often criticised for the lack of young players to come through their academy ranks. So, it was reassuring to see Kompany and Pellegrini at the game on Monday night, even if was to witness a loss.

In-form forward Tammy Abraham fired Chelsea ahead in the seventh minute with a stunning volley, but that lead didn't last long with City responding through Isaac Buckley's slick low finish inside the box two minutes later. But Abraham restored the visitors' lead before half-time, hooking the ball into the net with an improvised and acrobatic finish at close-range from a corner - his 36th goal this term. Dominic Solanke then sealed the win for Chelsea two minutes from time, latching onto a Charly Musonda through ball and slotting coolly past the keeper. It remains to be seen how many of either of these sides' young stars will progress on to their respective first-teams.

"Too strong, too hungry and too powerful. All over the field Manchester United were superior. It has been a while since we have said that, in this fixture at least. A season that seemed to be heading nowhere when Arsenal defeated them in the FA Cup last month will perhaps now be remembered for a return to European football and also for this, a victory over their neighbours that was even more complete, more absolute, than the scoreline suggests. United used to do this to City all the time. They used to bully them, pass through them, demoralise them and embarrass them. But not since 2009-10 when United beat City twice in the Barclays Premier League and edged a League Cup semi-final have they brutalised them like this. Old Trafford roars with Marouane Fellaini after the influential Belgian gave the Red Devils an advantage they never looked like relinquishing . Fellaini leaps to meet man-of-the-match Ashley Young's superb cross with a thumping header to send Old Trafford into a state of euphoria . City's defence was caught flatfooted and Joe Hart could only watch as Fellaini's header flew into the net on a great day for the hosts . Juan Mata was released by Wayne Rooney and the Spaniard ran through to shoot between Hart's legs to extend the host's advantage . Mata once again showed his value to the side and pointed the way with a display full of energy, poise and intelligence . Chris Smalling showed his hunger to beat a lethargic City defence to Young's free-kick to add a fourth to give the score more gloss . All of United's outfield players congratulate Smalling after his close-range header ensured the red side of Manchester has bragging rights . Young latches on to a loose ball which bounced off Gael Clichy and fires past the despairing dive of Hart to level matters . Wayne Rooney cannons the ball into the net in celebration to release a shower of water as Juan Mata and Young charge to the sidelines . Sergio Aguero finishes off a surgical move for the opener, tapping David Silva's cross into the empty net to give the visitors hope . The United defence looked at sixes and sevens as David de Gea fumes after conceding an early goal to their City rivals . Aguero made it a double late of, latching on to Pablo Zabaleta's cross, but City leave Old Trafford with very little to cheer about . Time will tell what the ramifications will be. United will surely take third place in the league. That looks a certainty now. For City, everything suddenly seems unclear, including their manager’s position and their own place in the top four. Here at a rapturous Old Trafford, United played like a team that had been waiting for this day. City looked like a team waiting for the season to end. City actually bookended this game with two very good goals, Sergio Aguero scoring in the eighth and 88th minutes. What happened in between, however, served to confirm recent indications that United have finally found their true selves while City have fallen off the edge of the proverbial cliff. The home team had all the game’s best players. Marouane Fellaini, Ashley Young, Daley Blind and Juan Mata were all excellent and key to events. City, on the other hand, hardly had a player who will reflect on this comfortably. For 10 minutes, City were excellent. They have grown used to coming here and starting like this. MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-41): De Gea 6.5, Valencia 6.5, Smalling 6.5, Jones 6 (Rojo 75), Blind 6, Carrick 7, Mata 7 (Di Maria 81), Ander Herrera 6, Fellaini 7.5 (Falcao 83), Young 8, Rooney 6.5. Subs not used: Da Silva, Januzaj, Valdes, McNair. Goals: Young 14, Fellaini 28, Mata 67, Smalling 73 . MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-1-1): Hart 5.5, Zabaleta 6, Kompany 5 (Mangala 46), Demichelis 6, Clichy 5, Jesus Navas 5 (Lampard 73), Toure 6, Fernandinho 5.5, Milner 5.5 (Nasri 63), Silva 6, Aguero 7. Subs not used: Fernando, Dzeko, Kolarov, Caballero. Booked: Milner, Silva, Kompany . Goals: Aguero 8, 89 . Referee: Mark Clattenburg . Attendance: 75,313 . Man of the match: Ashley Young .

Manuel Pellegrini shifts uncomfortably in his seat during a torrid afternoon for his rudderless side, who are now six points behind United . Yaya Toure, who was anonymous all afternoon, trudges towards the centre circle after City concede another goal to the Red Devils .

The Dutchman flew into the air after Kompany's stud high tackle just before the break and many felt he was lucky to just receive a booking . Mark Clattenburg books the City captain, who was substituted immediately after half-time . Last season Edin Dzeko scored early and the game finished 3-0. This time, a move began by Gael Clichy and soon joined by a David Silva dash to the by-line was finished off by Aguero. A goal ahead and with three clear chances already to reflect on, City seemed to have given themselves a platform while United looked hesitant. Silva seemed to be readying himself for a stellar afternoon. United, though, have been running hot on belief recently and that has made an enormous difference to their play. The fact they managed to fashion an equaliser from a position of vulnerability spoke volumes. Goalkeeper David de Gea actually looked to be in trouble as Jesus Navas attempted to run on to a short back-pass in the 14th minute and the ensuing clearance was more of a hack than a measured pass to the left wing. But when Fellaini won a challenge with Pablo Zabaleta opportunity suddenly beckoned. The ball broke to Ander Herrera and when he crossed to the near post Young edged his dual with Clichy to nudge the ball over the line after it broke off both of them. Wayne Rooney leaps onto Fellaini's back after United take the lead through the big Belgian, who has had an excellent renaissance recently . Ander Herrera skips inside fellow countryman David Silva during another decent showing from the Spaniard, who pulled the strings . Mata gives Gael Clichy something to think about as the mercurial Spaniard plots another attack for the hosts . Coming at a time when United had looked weak, the psychological effects of the equaliser were immediate and far reaching. The momentum of the game shifted towards red and City never managed to reverse it. United were not particularly fluent and it was, for a while, a tight game played in an atmosphere that reflected the stakes. However, the home team looked to have more energy, more purpose and more conviction. This is what confidence does to a team and by the 21st minute they were in the lead. This time, City had to ask themselves questions and over the remainder of the game it became a theme. The threat in the air from Fellaini was obvious but somehow he managed to isolate Clichy at the far post as Young crossed above the head of the taller Martin Demichelis, who was essentially marking nobody. It was, as the bare facts suggest, a mismatch and Fellaini powered above his opponent to head the ball through Joe Hart and in to the corner. Less than a quarter of the game had gone but already the road back for City looked long. From that point on until Aguero’s late consolation, City hardly made a chance. Aguero finished off an incisive City move which cut through United's defence in an impressive opening spell . United went back to basics for the leveller, with Young pouncing after Herrera's cross hit Gael Clichy . United exploited City's right wing for their second too, with Young and Daley Blind combining to great effect . Intelligent play from Rooney set up the third, with Mata darting through and coolly slotting home . Smalling rose unmarked to head Young's free-kick beyond Hart to make it 4-1 for rampant United . Aguero gave a semblance of respectability to the scoreline by meeting Pablo Zabaleta's cross late on . As half-time neared, their captain Vincent Kompany could have been sent off for a lunge at Blind. As it was, he strained a muscle making the challenge and didn’t reappear for a second period that began with Hart saving Wayne Rooney’s free-kick and then Michael Carrick’s follow-up. City desperately needed a foothold but couldn’t find one. They enjoyed some possession but conviction was absent and when Demichelis dashed senselessly from his position Blind and Rooney were able to pick up the pieces to play in Mata, who looked offside, for the decisive third goal. From here on in, only the winning margin was in doubt and when Chris Smalling ran off Demichelis’s shoulder to head in the fourth from a Young free-kick anything seemed possible. As it turned out the final act belonged to Aguero — Zabaleta the provider this time — and the winning margin settled at a rather modest two. That doesn’t tell the story, though. United were dominant and, at times, rather rampant. For the first time in a while, they held City in their grip. Afterwards, Louis van Gaal suggested he would spend the evening at his favourite Manchester restaurant, Wings. It was appropriate. His team, finally, are in flight. Sir Alex Ferguson returned to his old stomping ground to see his former charges beat the 'noisy neighbours' Roy Hodgson shares a joke before kick-off and will have been pleased with several performances .

"Patrick Bamford believes his long-term future lies at Chelsea and hopes winning the Championship Player of the Year award for his 19-goal season on loan at Middlesbrough will strengthen his case. The striker beat Ipswich Town’s Daryl Murphy and Watford’s Troy Deeney to win the prize at Sunday night’s Football League Awards in central London. After previous loan spells at MK Dons and Derby County, the 21-year-old has produced his best form yet for Aitor Karanka’s promotion-chasing side. And he hopes his success has been noted at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford hopes his long-term future will be at Stamford Bridge . Bamford takes centre stage after collecting the Championship Player of the Year award on Sunday . ‘There’s no reason why I wouldn’t want to be at Chelsea,’ he said. ‘That's my dream, to pull on that blue shirt, so hopefully it'll come true. ‘In the Premier League, strikers are about 23 or 24 if they're playing week-in, week-out and at a club like Chelsea, you've got the money to go out and buy a world class striker like Diego Costa. ‘And there's also that pressure they need to win trophies, win the league. It's just one of those things, you have to stick with it, be patient and hopefully the rewards will come.’ Bamford believes Middlesbrough has been the perfect fit for him because the styles of Karanka and Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho are so similar. The 21-year-old striker has scored 17 Championship goals for Middlesbrough this season . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) has been impressed with Bamford's attitude as well as his development . He said: ‘At the start of the season, I had a discussion with Chelsea and they decided that out of the clubs that were interested, Middlesbrough would be the best fit. ‘Not only for me as a player but it would make me ready for Chelsea next year or the year after.’ Before he returns to London, Bamford will play an integral role in trying to get Middlesbrough over the line in an insanely tight Championship promotion race. Their 1-0 win at Norwich City on Friday night could prove vital, though Watford and Bournemouth overtook them again on Saturday. The young striker will have to compete with the likes of Diego Costa when he is called back to Chelsea . Bamford is hoping to help Aitor Karanka’s Middlesbrough side get promoted to the Premier League . Bamford, who had to come off before the end at Carrow Road, said: ‘A massive result. I can't put into words how much it meant to us, you saw the reaction of the staff after the game and after I went off and had to sit on the bench, it was the worst 10 or 15 minutes since I've become a footballer. ‘In that game, it was awful, there's nothing you can do on the sidelines and it makes you see what it's like for managers. ‘You can see the work we put in week-in, week-out on the training ground, we do deserve to go up but I think a lot of teams think the same thing. Bamford hopes to be part of Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 squad for the European Championships . ‘It's going to be tight, it's going to be an exciting finish to be sure.’ After that, Bamford hopes to be part of Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 squad for the European Championships in the Czech Republic this summer. He said: ‘That's my aim and with the friendlies with Germany and the Czech Republic, I had to pull out because I've had a problem with my toe for the last few months. ‘I spoke to Gareth about it and he said make sure I'm okay for the summer because that's the aim. First priority is to get promoted with Middlesbrough and then after to try and win the Euros.’","Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford has impressed at Middlesbrough .

"Chelsea do consider their sponsorship interests when the club buys a new player but the Blues would never sign someone who isn't good enough, insists manager Jose Mourinho. The west London club, who agreed a £200million sponsorship deal with Japanese tyre manufacturers Yokohama Rubber in February, are believed to have made an offer for FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto. The 22-year-old international would be the first Japanese player to sign for Chelsea if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer, although Mourinho is adamant that commercial deals would never fully dictate his transfer policy. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March . FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto . Jose Mourinho admits that Chelsea do consider commercial deals when signing new players . Asked about Muto in his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday's game against QPR, Mourinho said: 'I know a little about him. I don't think it is nice for me to talk about a player who plays for FC Tokyo. 'If a FC Tokyo manager talks about my player I wouldn't be happy.It is not nice for me to speak about other players. 'In modern football and football is a business, an industry, you have to think about the financial situation, especially a club like Chelsea that wants to be in the rules like Financial Fair Play. 'But we want to win matches and don't get a player unless he is a good player or a good prospect.' FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid - understood to be around £4m - for Muto, who has 11 caps and one goal for his country. Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club . Muto, pictured in action against Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season . The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year . 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Asked about the influence of the Yokohama Rubber deal on his moves in the transfer market, Mourinho said: 'That's modern football. That's modern management. You cannot close the door completely to commercial interests. 'A football club is always a football club. We would never bring a player if the player has no capacity to be in a Chelsea football club squad.'","FC Tokyo claim that Chelsea have bid for forward Yoshinori Muto .

"Four tries and a total of 30 points from goalkicking winger Josh Mantellato broke brave Bradford's hearts as Hull KR avoided a potential Ladbrokes Challenge Cup banana skin with a 50-30 victory at the Odsal Stadium. Rovers twice came came from behind, trailing 12-0 in the early stages to the Kingstone Press Championship heavyweights, before easing clear with five tries in the final 18 minutes. Amid a pulsating and sometimes controversial cup tie, the hosts ultimately had no answer to Italian international Mantellato, whose last three tries came within the space of seven decisive minutes. It was only the East Yorkshire side's second cup tie success since reaching the quarter-finals in 2011 and their first Challenge Cup victory at Bradford since 1926, albeit only the third time the clubs had met in the competition since then. Winger Josh Mantellato scored four tries and kicked 14 points for Hull KR against Bradford Bulls . Having forced several errors from the Super League side in the opening exchanges, it took a fired-up Bulls less than six minutes to go ahead as Adam O'Brien barged his way through and under the posts. Ryan Shaw converted on his way to a tally of five goals. The Bulls struck again when O'Brien and Etu Uaisele put Dale Ferguson over, although Shaw got a fortuitous bounce off the upright in adding the extras this time. Rovers bounced back, capitalising on an unforced error from Shaw to halve the early deficit when winger Mantellato dived over in the corner then converted his own try. Rovers lost forward Greg Burke to a clash of heads midway through the half but they levelled when an Albert Kelly cross-field kick was tapped back by Mantellato for Kris Welham to touchdown with Mantellato again stroking over the extras. A scintillating weaving solo run by Kelly gave the visitors the led for the first time and Mantellato's conversion sent the Robins in at half time with an 18-12 advantage. A minute before the interval the temperature was cranked up a notch when, out of the blue, Rovers Adam Walker launched a blatant punch at O'Brien and was sin-binned, along with the Bulls Adam Sidlow, who also gained a yellow card after following in with his version of justice. Less than a minute into the second half the Bulls gave notice that they were not finished when Danny Addy completed a stirring break from Alex Mellor to score and Shaw levelled matters. The home joy was short-lived as Kieran Dixon broke clear, only to be stopped by a superb tackle from Uaisele, but Graeme Horne then strode through the regrouping defence to edge Rovers in front again. Mantellato's kick bounced back off of the upright and Bradford nearly responded when Uaisele crossed but the final pass was deemed forward. Sidlow and Addy went close and O'Brien was held up before the home crowd were up in arms again as Kevin Larroyer stole the ball from Addy in what looked to many like a two-man tackle and ran unopposed over 25 metres to score a controversial try. Still the Bulls were not finished as O'Brien put Lee Gaskell in for his 11th try of the season and Shaw closed the gap to just four points again. Three minutes later Lucas Walshaw crashed over after innovative work from Paul Clough, Addy and Gaskell and Shaw edged Bradford back in front. But three tries, all from Mantellato, in seven minutes finally quashed the brave Bulls' hopes of an upset. Controversy reined once more as Mantellato gave Rovers the lead again, amid vociferous calls for a forward pass, but there was no doubt when the Italian international raced away for his hat-trick after Shaw fatally allowed a bomb-kick to bounce. Mantellato struck once more before John Boudebza helped raise the half century for Rovers on the hooter.","Goalkicking winger Josh Mantellato dominated the scoring in Bradford .

"Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim was furious after his side lost 1-0 to what he described as a 'non-existent penalty' in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at Juventus on Tuesday. The controversial decision will add to calls for the use of video replays as it was still not fully clear what happened, even after several repeats of the incident in slow motion. The spot kick was awarded after Juve's Alvaro Morata got clear of Monaco's Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho as the striker chased a long ball forward from Andrea Pirlo. Ricardo's Carvalho's initial contact on Alvaro Morata appeared to come from outside the area . The Juventus striker went down under Carvalho's challenge and the referee pointed to the penalty spot . Monaco defender Carvalho and Spanish forward Morata crash to the ground in the penalty area . Replays showed that Carvalho nudged Morata just outside the area but the Spaniard's fall took him inside the box and it was not clear whether there was further contact. Czech referee Pavel Kralovec hesitated slightly, possibly consulting his goal line assistant, before pointing to the spot, while Carvalho was booked. 'It's a huge injustice, there was no penalty,' Jardim told reporters. 'We put Juventus in difficulties, but the result was based on a non-existent situation in an evenly-balanced match. 'The result was created by an incorrect decision by the team (of officials) that referees,' he added. 'This result is not a fair reflection of what happened on the field.' 'All teams should have the same duties and rights,' said the Portuguese coach, who has been widely praised for taking an apparently limited team so far. Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim claimed the penalty decision against his side was a 'huge injustice' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said Carvalho was 'the last man', but otherwise preferred not to get involved. 'I didn't see it, so I couldn't judge. It seems he was the last man,' said the phlegmatic coach. 'Whether it was inside or outside, I don't know.' There was a further surprise when midfielder Arturo Vidal, rather than forward Carlos Tevez, stepped up to take the kick. Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal steps up to score from the spot against Monaco during Tuesday's clash . Vidal celebrates what turned out to be the winning strike after scoring for Juventus against Monaco in Turin . Vidal has already missed two penalties this season, one in the 3-2 group stage win over Olympiakos Piraeus, and another in the 2-2 draw at Cesena in Serie A, when he could have scored a late winner. Tevez and Vidal had wasted good first-half chances in Tuesday's game but the Chilean said he was still confident. 'We don't have a first-choice penalty-taker, it's a case of whoever has more faith at that moment,' said Vidal. 'I felt I should take it and Carlitos agreed.'","Juventus were awarded penalty fouling foul on striker Alvaro Morata .

"Paris Saint-Germain star Javier Pastore has dismissed Eric Cantona’s suggestion that he is the greatest footballer on the planet. Cantona, the former Manchester United forward, claimed earlier this month that Pastore is ‘the best player in the world’. But speaking ahead of his side’s second-leg tie against Barcelona in the Nou Camp, Pastore believes Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are a class above him. Javier Pastore addresses the world's media ahead of Paris Saint-Germain's European clash in Barcelona . Pastore and his Paris Saint-Germain team-mates are pictured at the Nou Camp on Monday ahead of their tie . ‘Cantona has his opinion and I thank him for his praise. However, I don't share his view,’ said Castore. ‘I don't compare myself with the best. Cantona likes good football and goals, but I think Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are incredible players.’ Pastore scored a brace in PSG’s 3-1 win at Nice on Saturday as the Parisians reclaimed top spot in Ligue 1. Speaking at the Laureus Sports Awards, Cantona had said of the Argetnine: ‘For me, the best player in the world is Javier Pastore.

"In-form winger Aaron Murphy scored twice in a seven-try romp as Huddersfield secured a 38-14 Super League victory against Catalans Dragons to end a three-match losing run. Murphy, player of the month for February and March, went over in the left corner on 15 minutes from Jake Connor's pass. He was then on hand when Ukuma Ta'ai, who also scored twice, caught and off-loaded a kick from Danny Brough on 37 minutes. In-form winger Aaron Murphy scored twice in a seven-try romp as Huddersfield beat Catalans Dragons . Former Wakefield Wildcats star Murphy, 27, has now scored six tries in his last five appearances. Having fallen behind Catalans hit back to lead 8-6 - with scrum-half Scott Dureau bagging all of their points. He scored a try on 21 minutes when Elliot Whitehead passed inside after a solo dash past two players split the Giants defence. Dureau converted and then added a penalty goal on 24 minutes for a poor shoulder charge on him by Joe Wardle. Wardle was restored to the Giants line-up after being suspended for last week's defeat by St Helens for a dangerous throw on Ben Cockayne. Huddersfield responded with three tries in 10 minutes at the end of the first half - and it could have been more. Connor nearly put Murphy in again down the left on 27 minutes while Leroy Cudjoe was held up on the right flank after Brough's break from deep. In between Ta'ai pounced for a try when a Dragons defender fumbled a high kick from Brough on 30 minutes. Scotland star Brough, whose kicking caused problems for the visitors all game, was at it twice more before half-time. His kick led to Murphy's second try and then another Brough bomb was dropped on the hooter by a defender and Cudjoe pounced. Brough, who took his tally to 58 points for the season with three earlier conversions, this time hit the post. Huddersfield led 22-8 at the break, with the sides trading tries after the restart as Catalans narrowed the gap to 26-14. Julian Bousquet scored a converted try on 45 minutes while Jermaine McGillvary went over at the other end eight minutes later. There was controversy on 62 minutes when a simmering feud between Cudjoe and Willie Tong boiled over. The pair seemed to exchange words and former NRL star Tong responded by appearing to headbutt Cudjoe right in front of referee Robert Hicks. Tong was sin-binned and Cudjoe got a verbal warning in the presence of Giants skipper Brough. Huddersfield took full advantage of the extra man by running in two quick tries, first from Ta'ai a minute later and then Scott Grix on 65 minutes. There was no further score, but Louis Anderson lost his temper late on as Huddersfield defensively shut the game down.","Aaron Murphy scored twice as Huddersfield ended three-match losing run .

"Gary Cahill has spoken of the demands of maintaining a  title challenge as he looks to secure his first ever Premier League winners medal with Chelsea this season. Cahill has won four cups with the Stamford Bridge outfit since joining in January 2012, including the Champions League, but the England defender believes league glory would be his most testing achievement yet. 'What I’ve won already at Chelsea has been fantastic but we all know in cups, you play the game and don’t see the next one for a month or so,' Cahill said in an interview with Soccer Saturday. Gary Cahill is yet to win the Premier League with Chelsea since joining the club in January 2012 . Cahill (centre) hoists the Champions League trophy aloft after Chelsea's 2012 victory . Cahill spoke of the difference in challenging for the Premier League compared to cup competitions . 'You prepare differently. With the Premier League you’re coming day-to-day, working hard a whole season, all the way through, keeping fit and doing everything you possibly can do. 'In terms of that, the reward is massive and when it is in touching distance of you, for me personally it would be amazing.' Cahill believes Chelsea were taught some important lessons last season, when they finished third, which has caused them to develop a more clinical touch to their performances. Three defeats from March 15 - April 19 in the league last year derailed any title hopes. Losses to Aston Villa and Crystal Palace on their travels were compounded when Sunderland inflicted Jose Mourinho's first home Premier league defeat upon him in 78 games. Cahill believes that Jose Mourinho's side learnt some difficult lessons during last season in the league . Cahill (right) will be back in action when Chelsea host Manchester United on Saturday in the league . 'We are more ruthless, I think we learnt a lot from last season in terms of games that people expected us to perform better in or win,' Cahill said.

"Jamie Carragher says Mike Ashley has turned Newcastle United into a ‘boring’ club and has accused the billionaire owner of only being interested in making money. His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs – a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of ‘We’re rich but our team is s***’ and ‘Where’s the money gone?’ in protest at Ashley’s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of £18.7million and later revealed they have £34m sat in the bank. Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. ‘I can understand why fans are frustrated,’ said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. ‘It’s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there’s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they’ve been. They think “Where else can I make money? Oh a football club”. ‘I’ve had it at my own club Liverpool with George Gillett and Tom Hicks and it’s the same at Newcastle. Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . ‘People will say as supporters you’ve got to come back, you’ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? ‘Since Mike Ashley’s been here they’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. ‘So he’s balanced the books - he’s made money because he’s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, “Don’t you want to be excited yourself?”. ‘I’m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. ‘Now it’s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there’s nothing happening? There’s no cup run, I just don’t get it. I don’t get why he wants to own a football club.’ Meanwhile, former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn says Ashley must try to reconnect with the club’s fans. Thousands of fans chose to boycott the Tottenham game in protest of Mike Ashley's tenure at the club . Some fans that did go to St. James' Park showed their disgust in the stadium with banners and posters . There was blocks of empty seats where fans chose not to attend the 3-1 loss to the London side . ‘I think you’ve got to get the balance right. It’s not just about making money,’ he said. ‘Early on in his tenure here he was getting criticism and he made his mind up he was doing it his way and he didn’t care what the fans thought. And that is something that just doesn’t work. ‘Sunderland fans will resent me for saying this, but the Geordie fans have been through everything with this football club, and for them to stay away and not watch a game of football at this club - that hurts. It tells of the disconnect and it has to be resolved. ‘To reconnect has to be the best way forward.’ Thousands of posters were created by Ashleyout.com and passed around the city prior to the game .","Jamie Carragher has slammed Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley .

"Paris St Germain coach Laurent Blanc accepts his side face an almost impossible mission trying to turn around their Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona at the Camp Nou on Tuesday. The Ligue 1 champions were swept aside in their own stadium last week by a dominant Barca led by a lethal Luis Suarez who grabbed a brace in the 3-1 defeat. They have Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti back from suspension for the second leg but Thiago Silva joins Thiago Motta among the injured and David Luiz is also a fitness doubt. Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be available again when PSG meet Barcelona on Tuesday, after missing the first leg . The PSG players train on the Nou Camp pitch, ahead of a task their manager called 'practically impossible' 'We have to think that we have to score and I am sure that we will but we have only a small chance to go through,' Blanc told a news conference in Barcelona on Monday. 'We cannot afford to concede goals and this here is practically impossible.' 'All the teams that play here in Europe concede at least one. They (Barca) have attacking players with incredible talent,' Blanc added. Marco Verratti will also be fit having missed the defeat to Barcelona in the first leg in Paris . Blanc was pessimistic about his side's chances, but says they must play as if they have nothing to lose . He said that whatever fate awaits his team he will not make excuses about players missing. 'Those who are not here were not fit for the game and I wish I could have had them but it is not possible and it is no point feeling sorry about it,' said Blanc. 'We have to show that we want to win, show that we are capable of doing it and give a better account of ourselves than in the first match.' Blanc has demanded that his PSG side give a better account of themselves than they showed in the first leg . Two goals from Luis Suarez have put the French champions in a commanding position at the half-way stage . Ibrahimovic, currently serving a ban domestically for abusive comments to a referee, returns to the club where he played during the 2009-10 season and coach Blanc hopes it will give him a lift. 'Ibra likes these these kinds of games when there is nothing to lose,' he said. 'He will help us and I am looking forward to seeing him play. 'He is very important for us and is training hard each day. He is in good form.'","PSG travel to Nou Camp on Tuesday with Barcelona in command of the tie .

"Bangladesh beat fellow World Cup quarter-finalists Pakistan by 79 runs in the first one-day international in Dhaka. Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim scored centuries as Bangladesh made 329 for six and Pakistan could only muster 250 in reply. Pakistan will have the chance to level the three-match series on Sunday when the second ODI takes place in Mirpur. Bangladesh celebrate beating fellow World Cup quarter-finalists Pakistan by 79 runs in Dhaka . Bangladesh elected to bat after winning the toss but struggled to 67 for two in the 20th over after Soumya Sarkar was run out by Wahab Riaz for 20 and Mahmudullah (five) was bowled by Rahat Ali. Tamim and Mushfiqur set about repairing Bangladesh's stuttering innings and did just that by putting on 178 runs in 21.4 overs for the third wicket, during which time Tamim notched his fifth ODI century. He continued to plunder runs with ease but went for one big shot too many against Wahab and was caught at mid-off to leave Bangladesh on 245 for three with nine overs left. His 135-ball knock of 132 included 15 fours and three sixes. Two sixes in the 43rd over took Mushfiqur into the nineties and he joined Iqbal in passing three figures by hitting Saeed Ajmal for successive fours in the 45th. Mushfiqur perished in the 48th over when he edged Wahab behind to depart for a 77-ball innings of 106 which included 13 fours and two sixes. Shakib Al Hasan (31) and Sabbir Rahman (15) scored 30 runs in 2.2 overs before falling to Wahab (four for 59) in the final over as the hosts set Pakistan 330 for victory. Bangladesh cricketer Tamim Iqbal plays a shot during the first One Day International cricket match in Dhaka . Pakistan cricket captain Azhar Ali plays a shot during the first One Day International cricket match in Dhaka . Azhar Ali and Sarfraz Ahmed put on 53 runs for the first wicket before the latter slog-swept Arafat Sunny to deep backward square leg to leave Pakistan one down in the 11th over. Mohammad Hafeez was then run out to leave Pakistan stuttering on 59 for two but there was some respite when Azhar notched his fifth ODI half-century in the 20th over to celebrate his first match as captain in fine style. He and Haris Sohail compiled 89 runs for the third wicket but Azhar departed for 72 when he edged behind and Haris was also walking back to the pavilion shortly after he passed 50. Fawad Alam joined Mohammad Rizwan at the crease but his stay was short - 14 runs from 19 balls - and he and Saad Nasim (nought) fell to Sunny in the 40th over as Pakistan limped to 217 for six with 10 overs to play. Igbal sends an impressive shot flying through the air as Bangladesh turn on the style against Pakistan . Pakistan required an unlikely 113 runs to win at that point and though Rizwan and Wahab put on 27 of those, their dismissals saw the end come quickly. Rizwan reached his half-century off 46 balls and went on to 67 from 58 but fell shortly after Wahab, slog-sweeping Rubel Hossain to Nasir Hossain. Junaid Khan was run out without facing a ball and Ajmal also failed to score as the last four wickets fell in nine balls for six runs. Sunny and Taskin Ahmed finished with three wickets apiece as Bangladesh celebrated.

"Andy Lee is confident he has improved even further since winning his world title last year. The Irishman makes the first defence of his WBO middleweight belt against Peter Quillin in New York on Saturday. And he is confident he is ready for anything the former champion has in his locker. Andy Lee works out with trainer Adam Booth at the Barclays Centre ahead of his fight against Peter Quillin . Lee is making the first defence of the WBO middleweight title he won against Matt Korobov last year . 'We've made unbelievable progress in the last year on my skills and everything has really just clicked for me and my team and now we're seeing the results in the ring,' Lee said. 'I'm very proud to be an Irishman from Limerick defending his world championship in New York, it doesn't get much better than that. 'There's been a huge weight lifted off my shoulders since winning the world title. It's what I always wanted to do and I've been touted as a champion for years and if I never got it I would have been disappointed. Now the monkey is off my back and I can just box and show people who I am. 'We've made physical and tactical improvements in the gym since the last fight and hopefully they'll show up in the ring on Saturday. 'I think this could be a technical fight or it could be a bit of a fire fight. It's going to be a little of both at times. There will be moments where we're looking at each other, figuring each other out, but once we exchange it could be explosive. 'Quillin is sure of himself, but he has to be, I have the same mentality. You have to be to compete in this sport. 'Fighting at home like Quillin is on Saturday, brings a different kind of pressure to the table, it's the pressure of expectations and people you know coming to the fights. That's also pressure and I know all about that. Quillin is a former champion but is yet to taste defeat as a professional and poses a tough challenge for Lee . Quillin says he has faced struggles his whole life and that this fight will just be the latest in a long line . 'I haven't needed to build up my confidence for this fight. It's not time to think. It's time to do what I've been doing every day in the gym.' Quillin, meanwhile, believes the fight will just be another struggle he has to overcome. 'I never trailed in a fight and came back and won like Lee. I've just won all the time right out of the gate. Those other guys aren't 'Kid Chocolate' so I think that's why this fight was made,' he said. 'It's a big fight for him and a big fight for me. He's a smart fighter when he's in trouble so I have to watch out for that. Most importantly I just need to be true to myself. 'A lot of people had Lee as the underdog in his last fight but he came out and did great. That's the thing about boxing; one punch can change the fight. 'I'm getting paid for 12 rounds so I'm preparing for 12 rounds but if I can get him out of there early I will. 'My whole life has been struggles and I've had to overcome every single one of those struggles. This is going to be no different from that. 'Being a father of course made me more inspired and watching my uncle pass has made me more motivated than ever to accomplish everything I want. 'When I gave up the belt I learned that I can be a bigger man and make tough decisions like that all of the time.

"Eddie Hearn has insisted his £1.5million purse offer to Carl Frampton comes with no strings attached, but efforts to make a super-fight with Scott Quigg remain deadlocked. Hearn unveiled a cheque with his offer to Sky TV cameras in a bid to force a deal with the IBF super-bantamweight champion, as the Matchroom promoter upped the ante in a bid to book a July 18 date at Manchester Arena. However, Frampton’s promoters, Cyclone Promotions, headed by former world champ Barry McGuigan, released a press release in response to the offer, claiming they were awaiting formal communication from Hearn’s Matchroom Sports before renewing negotiations over the much-hyped bout. Eddie Hearn presents the cheque for £1.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Matchroom Sport boss Hearn said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight . Quigg stares down the camera to tell Frampton to 'put his money where his mouth is' TV rights were believed to be a major stumbling block in negotiations as Matchroom are tied to Sky Sports, while Frampton’s recent title defence against Chris Avalos attracted millions of viewers between ITV in the UK and UTV Ireland. Now Hearn has seemingly attempted to force the fight with a big-money offer in the hope that the bout can be screened on Sky Box Office. While past negotiations were believed to have collapsed due to a failure to agree a deal on future promotional ‘options’ on fights, the Matchroom promoter also insisted he has not demanded rights to promote Frampton’s future fights. ‘Nothing at all — no options, no rematch clause, absolutely nothing,’ Hearn told Sportsmail when questioned on whether such terms were included in his £1.5m offer. ‘He can have this fight, he can go back to whatever broadcaster he wants [after it]. He can go and move to the moon if he wants, it’s nothing to do with us.’ Quigg is the defending WBA super-bantamweight champion and wants to fight Frampton in Manchester . Quigg celebrates his win over Hidenori Othake at the Liverpool Echo Arena in November last year . McGuigan declined to comment further on the saga when contacted by Sportsmail, refusing to elaborate on Cyclone Promotions’ statement which said they ‘have made several attempts to organise a follow-up meeting with Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport to progress these negotiations’. The Cyclone statement added: ‘If Matchroom Sport are interested in joining Cyclone Promotions in staging this domestic superfight, we recommend Matchroom accept the invitation for a follow-up meeting.’ Hearn countered the Cyclone statement, telling Sportsmail: ‘We just want to get it done, it’s so frustrating… I know their statement said we turned down another meeting but that’s because it was getting nowhere. We’re trying to make things happen. ‘The only thing that Cyclone Promotions want is they want to co-promote the show. We’re bringing all the money, we’re putting all the money up,’ said the Matchroom promoter. ‘If there was another broadcaster that they were willing to work with, who could throw a load of money at this fight, then make us an offer. They can’t. We’re in such a strong position, but we’re still being fair. Scott Quigg is the one taking all the risk here. If it doesn’t do that great at the box office, Scott might get only £400-500,000 and Carl still gets his £1.5m, there is no risk. 'This is the offer that I believe has to make Carl Frampton say yes. I’ve already responded [to Cyclone] to say “if you want to co-promote, co-promote it”,’ added Hearn. Frampton lands a punch on American opponent Chris Avalos during their fight last month .

"A driver who was pulled over for suspected drink driving is seen in a video being clubbed by two policemen as he lays on the ground. Sean Reardon was stopped by police as he drove through Chico in California and claims once he was out of the car he was wrestled to the floor by two police officers who then hit him with a baton or stick. Video footage of the incident, taken by a bystander, has emerged and shows the 30-year-old being repeatedly hit by an officer as he lay on the road. Scroll down for video . A video has emerged which shows a man being beaten as he lays on the floor after being pulled over by police . The clip, posted by Action News Now, shows Reardon appearing to be hit with force multiple times. It is likely to inflame tensions in America about police brutality after a number of high profile incidents of beatings and fatal shootings have been caught on camera. Reardon claims he was subjected to violence 'without provocation' and suffered acute respiratory failure and had to be put on a ventilator in hospital. He was in ICU for 4 days. He says he also suffered multiple broken bones, including ribs, nose and sternum. Reardon told TMZ that after he got out of his Chevy Suburban near 5th and Main Streets in Chico, he was tackled to the floor and 'hog tied'. He said he was then thrown into the back of a van by police before being taken to hospital after the incident on February 18, at about 9.40pm. Officers claim Reardon had failed to appear at court on gun charges and refused to raise his hands after being stopped. They said he then attempted to flee when pulled over. In the footage an officer is shown repeatedly hitting Reardon with an object as he lay on the ground . Butte County Chief deputy District Attorney claimed the officers used force to restrain Reardon. He was said to be almost twice over the legal limit for driving and had traces of methamphetamine and cocaine in his blood. Reardon had allegedly hit two cars while trying to get away from the officers, KRCRtv reported. After he hit a parked car he is said to have got out of the vehicle and approached an officer, before complying with orders to lie on the ground. Reardon has denied charges of evading a peace officer, DUI, DUI with alcohol or drugs within 10 years of a prior, and resisting an executive officer . He has not been granted bail. Reardon is on the floor as one of the officers crouches down beside him and the other gets ready to hit him . The 30-year-old claims he was left with broken bones and ribs after being subjected to the brutal beating . The video footage has emerged as tensions over police brutality have increased in America following a number of shootings and incidences of violence caught on camera in recent weeks. This week helicopter cameras captured police beating Francis Pusok at least 80 times after they had already tasered him. Police had tried to arrest him at his southern California and he fled on a horse - sparking a two hour chase before he fell off and was beaten. Last week footage emerged of unarmed black man Derek Harris, 44, being shot dead by a 74-year-old reserve deputy in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He claimed he had accidentally mistaken his hand gun for his taser and had not intended to kill Mr Harris, who was being chased by police following a sting operation. Walter Scott was shot in the back as he attempted to flee police, after being pulled over for a broken tail light . Officers were seen surrounding Francis Pusok as he lay on the ground after falling off his horse . Police officer Michael Slager was charged with murder earlier this month after video captured on a mobile phone showed him shooting Walter Scott, a coast guard veteran, in the back as he ran away. Mr Scott had been pulled over for driving with a broken tail light . Evidence of police brutality has caused outrage in America and led to high profile protests. Hundreds of protesters wore 'I can't breathe' t-shirts at a basketball match in Brooklyn in tribute to black father-of-six Eric Garner who died after being held in a fatal chokehold. Last year days of protests were held after the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. The 18-year-old was stopped and shot dead by by white officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb on August 9.","Sean Reardon was stopped by police on suspected drunk driving charges .

"The February afternoon we arrived in Adelaide, the mercury was whizzing up to a sizzling 46C and the South Australian city was the hottest place on the planet. The temperature had climbed above 40C for a whole week and even the Aussies were struggling. Appropriately, friends took us out that evening to dine in one of the city's hottest restaurants - Celsius! Luckily, it was air-conditioned and served phenomenal food. We especially appreciated the peanut butter and popcorn ice cream. But Adelaide that week was also hot for other reasons. It was the cycling mecca of the world, with 20 teams of Lycra-clad pros and their supporters tearing up the roads and hanging out in coffee bars. Sian Lloyd enjoys a glass of Clare Valley riesling at Skillogalee Winery north of Adelaide in South Australia . Sian meets Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas (centre) and Sir Chris Hoy (right) at the start of the Tour Down Under . Sian takes a ride ahead of the Tour Down Under in Adelaide (left) and meets a bouncy local kangaroo . The Tour Down Under is a big part of the international cycling season and contributes more to the South Australian economy than the F1 Grand Prix (formerly Adelaide-based, now in Melbourne) ever did. Not only was the launch night atmosphere electric, but it was great to catch up with our pals Sir Chris Hoy and Team Sky's Geraint Thomas. We also rubbed shoulders with the Indian cricket team. Howzat! We were staying at the Adina Apartment Hotel, the former Treasury building, where the old tunnels and cabinet rooms can still be seen. The Beatles hid here to evade fans back in 1964. Breakfast was served in the lovely oasis of the serene central courtyard, a delightful start to the day. The hotel is conveniently just round the corner from the splendid Central Market. A trip here is enough to convince anyone that Adelaide is the true food capital of Australia. And bearing in mind that some of the best wine is made within an hour's drive of the city, from the Barossa Valley to McLaren Vale, you feel very indulged. Adelaide is a much softer city than Sydney. It has charm, colonial history, sophistication and space to breathe. It's not called the City of Roses for nothing - there are lots of perfumed parks as well as wide boulevards.

A trip to Adelaide's Central Market is enough to convince us that Adelaide is the true food capital of Australia . Adelaide is a softer city than Sydney. It has charm, colonial history, sophistication and space to breathe . Most beaches are half an hour away, but being creatures of habit, we always head for the Adelaide Hills and the foodie haven of Hahndorf. Here we lunch on superb venison pasta and salted caramel crepes at a quaint old cottage called The White House. We then do a bit of wine-tasting in the scenic Hills and lovely McLaren Vale, arriving at the classy Currant Shed in time for supper. Set in a lime grove and bordered by vineyards, this is my husband's favourite restaurant in the world. I've had a thing about cycling the Clare Valley Riesling Trail for some time. Indeed, part of the reason for coming to sunny South Australia was to tick it off my bucket list. So early one morning we drove 90 minutes north of Adelaide, picked up our bikes from Riesling Trail Bike Hire and cycled along a 15-mile-long disused railway, snaking past vineyards and cellar doors. The gradients were gentle, the information boards fascinating and the tongue-tingling rieslings superb. We then treated ourselves to lunch at Skillogalee Winery, sat under a beautiful old olive tree and overlooking valleys lined with vines. The historic town of Hahndorf, settled by Germans near Adelaide, is a true blue foodie haven . The bright green of the vineyards of McLaren Vale, a popular wine regions close to Adelaide . North of Clare is where the Outback truly begins. And that's where we were heading - to the rugged Flinders Ranges mountains. It took three hours to drive to the majestic range, the largest in South Australia. The Flinders have a stark beauty - the light on the rocks, the vegetation, the bouncing kangaroos, all make you feel as if you're a million miles from civilisation. We stayed at Arkaba Station, a 60,000-acre sheep ranch, from where we did incredible guided walks, taking in the sights, sounds and smells of this astounding wild terrain. If you want to do the Flinders in understated luxury, this is the way to do it. Think cream and wood with cashmere blankets, scenic vistas, 4x4 wildlife trips, wonderful meals and languid cocktails at sunset.

Luxury accommodation at Arkaba Station, a 60,000-acre sheep ranch and the perfect base to go exploring . Sian found the scale of the machinery mind-blowing in Kalgoorlie's gold mine 'Super Pit' And so to my husband's bucket list. Having travelled on the glorious Ghan from Darwin to Adelaide last year, and enjoyed every magical minute, he was determined to travel on its sister train, the Indian Pacific, from Adelaide to Perth. Frankly, I can't think of any better way of seeing Australia. You are treated like royalty, the food is outstanding and the huge views of this beautiful, baked continent are breathtaking. Two nights of cruising overland in air-conditioned splendour - it worked for me! As did the stop-offs, first at the Outback ghost town of Cook and finally at floodlit Kalgoorlie, the biggest open-cast gold mine in the country. The size and scale of the Super Pit and machinery were mindblowing. The same goes for the Nullarbor Plain which has hardly changed in millions of years. We crossed it on the longest stretch of straight rail track on earth - 297 miles without a hint of a curve. We arrived at the Indian Pacific terminal in Perth as fresh as daisies, and drove the three hours to Margaret River without stopping. But this is where we realised we'd made a big mistake. This was our first visit to Western Australia and to tag it on to the end of our holiday just did not do the region justice. The unique mining town of Kalgoorlie is  home to Australia's biggest over-cast gold mine . Sister train of the north to south Ghan, the Indian Pacific takes passengers from Adelaide to Perth . From the first step we took on the Cape to Cape Explorer walk with our guide we knew we'd found exactly what we wanted. The landscape spelt out AUSTRALIA. The views of turquoise bays and stretches of white sand, dotted with surfers, were postcard-perfect. Behind the beautiful Margaret River coastline, there are mysterious forests and caves. There's even a lighthouse where two mighty oceans meet. And then there are vineyards... In less than 50 years, Margaret River has become one of the world's greatest wine regions, gaining accolades galore for its cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays. Not only are you spoilt for choice for wines, but the food is up there with the best. Stand-out meals were the amazing breakfast at the luxury boutique hotel Cape Lodge, the special lunch hosted by the owners of Leeuwin Estate and the dreamy duck curry in the beautiful setting of Aravina Estate. The stunning coastline of the Margaret River, which is also one of the world's great wine regions . A special lunch was enjoyed with the owners of Leeuwin Estate in the revered Margaret River region . And how about sipping world famous Cullen red wine at the cellar door in the evening sunshine? This is the stuff memories are made of. We fell in love with Margaret River. Our last two nights were spent in a gorgeous villa at Injidup Spa Retreat, a peaceful paradise overlooking the Indian Ocean. It was such a stunning spot, and we were so relaxed after our massages, that we did not want to go out for dinner. Instead, we ordered hampers of local food from Lamonts Deli, along with bars of the local Bahen & Co Almond & Sea Salt chocolate, and ate splendidly at sunset on our terrace. We toasted the sun, sand and surf and vowed to come back.

"YouTube star Cassey Ho has hit back at critics with a powerful and provocative new video, highlighting the cruel comments left by viewers of her fitness-focused clips who accuse the trim and toned online icon of being everything from ‘too fat’ to ‘ugly’ to ‘pudgy’. Cassey's YouTube channel, Blogilates, has over two million subscribers, so fans may have been surprised to learn that the negative comments left under the California resident’s fitness videos still manage to get under her skin – and have a much greater impact on her than any of the positive messages sent to her by her fans. But though mean and critical messages may have put a dent in the 28-year-old’s self-esteem, the workout pro is getting the last word with her latest video, The 'Perfect' Body, which examines just whether conforming to society's standards is the key to happiness, while highlighting some of the cruel comments she has received from viewers of her YouTube videos. Scroll down for video. Fighting back: In her new video, Pilates instructor and YouTube star Cassey Ho combats body-shamers who comment on her videos . She's only human: Seemingly full of confidence, Cassey said even she has felt bad about herself after reading nasty comments calling her 'fat' online . In a post on her Blogilates blog, Cassey said negative comments on her videos are nothing new, but the flood of nastiness has grown especially bad lately. She added that the trash-talking has even brought her to tears on more than one occasion. 'It’s hard to be content with the shape of your body when people are constantly telling you how fat you are, how much weight you need to lose, how much weight you need to gain,' she wrote. 'What do people want?' Cassey goes on to explain that, through her new video, fans can see what it's like to face that kind of negativity, and watch as her own self-esteem gets 'stripped away', leaving her feeling insecure and ashamed about her appearance. Fit or fat: The slim and toned blogger says that the negativity in the comments section of her YouTube channel has become especially nasty lately, and has even made her cry . Peanut gallery problems: In the new video, Cassey picks at her body, honing in on places that commenters say she could improve upon . The video begins with Cassey posting a selfie in gym clothes, taken just after a workout. She immediately starts to read the comments, and though they start off positive, soon people are telling her she shouldn't give fitness advice because she is fat. Cassey goes on to strip down to her underwear, examining, pinching and prodding her body, using the spiteful comments to direct her to different parts of her physique that people insist need changing. And as the video goes on, she grows more unsatisfied with herself as negative comments pop up around her. So the YouTube star gets to work, manipulating her body in a simulation of real-life Photoshop. She thins her thighs, hips, and waist, makes her butt and chest bigger, and even changes the color of her eyes. Finally, she posts another selfie of her 'improved' look - achieved with the help of a body double - but she is clearly still unhappy, and she uses this feeling to try and show viewers that giving in to body-shaming will only leave you worse off. Before and after: The fitness expert's body goes under a major transformation; Cassey used a body double to achieve the final look . Moral message: Even after making her butt and chest bigger and her waist and legs smaller, Cassey still doesn't find happiness at the end of the video . No Photoshop here: The retouching in Cassey's video was meant to prove a point - she doesn't use Photoshop in the photos she posts online . It seems that her 'take that' attitude has left her detractors speechless. Readers of her blog flooded the comments section of the latest post with overwhelmingly positive feedback. 'Thank you for standing up to this struggle for girls and women everywhere,' wrote one fan. Another chimed in: 'I absolutely applaud that you are your natural, beautiful self. I think you’re a wonderful inspiration for young people.' Cassey hopes viewers who relate to the video's message will share it in an effort to battle body shaming and cyber bullying.","Cassey Ho boasts over two million subscribers on her YouTube channel Blogilates .

"A protective dad has devised a creative way to keep the boys away from his young daughter - by printing his muscly torso on a t-shirt and making her wear it. 'Stay Clear Boys,' a message on the shirt warns. 'This is my dad!' And while his daughter doesn't look too happy about the new attire, her father is pictured grinning beside her. The image was first shared on Reddit under the headline 'Dad security' at the weekend. A dad created this t-shirt to keep the boys away from his daughter - and she doesn't look happy about it . Kit Dale, a two-time World Pro Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu champion from Melbourne, Australia, shared the image to his Facebook page on Sunday, writing: 'Hahahha smart dad.' By Wednesday, the image on his page had been liked by 370,000 Facebook users and had been shared more than 45,000 times. While some commenters both applauded the move - and even asked whether the girl was in need of a step-mother - others ridiculed it. 'Dads thought process: How can I tell more people I work out, and not look like a tool?' one wrote. Another added: 'How about a shirt that says ""attention boys...this is my body and I do what I want with it...neither you nor my dad make any of the rules...and ps I may not even be into boys.'","A protective dad made a t-shirt for his daughter showing him with the message: 'Stay Clear Boys, this is my dad!'

"For decades, sheds have a been a place that men build at the bottom of the garden so they have a place to be alone. In the book 'Men and Sheds,' the author Gordon Thorburn called the wooden buildings a ""male necessity"" - somewhere were they could do some woodwork, pot some plants or even just read the newspaper in peace. But now the female sex and demanding a place at the bottom of the garden to call their own - a she shed. Scroll down for video . More and more women are demanding their own 'she sheds', places at the bottom of the garden they can call their own . As everyday life gets every more stressful and homes get smaller, women are also looking to the single-storey structures as a safe haven. But while most men might be content with a leaky old shack made of rotting timber, female customers are looking for a home away from home. They are commissioning sheds in a range of styles from beach huts and gypsy caravans to mock Tudor pavilions with tiled floors. Instead of a few upturned apple boxes and an old wireless, the new she sheds are being decked out with Moroccan rugs, cushions, chandeliers and coffee tables. Some have gone one step further and installed a diner in theirs, complete with working jukebox and fifties-style restaurant booths. Fancy a 'she shed' of your own? Read on for some inspiration...

"Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .","The designer diffusion line went on sale Sunday morning but was almost completely sold out online before noon, with stores selling out minutes after opening .
Re-sellers initially tried to unload merchandise at inflated prices including $799 for a $150 hammock; now thousands of pieces are available on eBay with smaller markups .
Outraged customers have formed a social media campaign to boycott the merchandise from second-hand sellers ."
"Young professional footballers can be an easy target with some of their behaviour but on Thursday afternoon it was refreshing to sit down and talk with Danny Welbeck. He struck me as a thoroughly decent young man who lives his life the right way. He is a credit to his family and his easy-going manner means he must a dream to work with. We discussed life at Arsenal, scoring against Manchester United and his FA Cup dreams. You can watch the full interview on Football Focus on BBC One today at 12.10pm and Reading’s semi-final with Arsenal live on BBC One from 5.05pm. Danny Welbeck talks to Sportsmail's Martin Keown ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading . MARTIN KEOWN: You’ve played at Wembley many times and you’ve played in a semi-final as well but you’re now one step away from an FA Cup final. Does that bring extra nerves? DANNY WELBECK: Not really. I think we’ve basically just got to play the game, not the occasion. The team was in this position last year and coming up against Wigan proved to be one of the toughest games of the season. Against Reading today is going to be another tough game. We’ve just got to approach it the right way and we want to get through to the final. Welbeck expects a tough test as Arsenal face a Championship side at Wembley for the second year in a row . KEOWN: How are you settling in? You seem to have been here all your life almost and you’ve only been here seven or eight months. WELBECK: The staff at the club, at the training ground and everyone has been very welcoming. The fans have been brilliant. My team-mates are class and I’m just really enjoying my time here. I’ve settled in very well. It’s a transitional year for me, getting to know new players, new team-mates, new systems and new ways of going about things at a different club. I think I’ve put in a few good performances. I’ve been unlucky on the club front with goals and that’s something I know will come in abundance when I get to know everything spot on with the club and I’m pretty sure that will happen. The Arsenal striker thinks he has been unlucky in front of goal, but wants to play in a more central role . KEOWN: You talk about goals, you’re playing in a wide position. What’s your favourite position? WELBECK: It’s no secret I prefer to play down the middle. But the formation we play at Arsenal, you’re playing on the left or the right. We’re always interchanging, playing in a three-man attack. It’s much easier doing that than playing left midfield or left wing in a four-man midfield. KEOWN: Wenger has worked with lots of strikers over the years and been able to develop them. What’s the area that he’s working on most with you most of all? WELBECK: We talk about the game, we analyse performances and on the training pitch we’ve also got the other staff here so after training we do a bit of individual work so that happens every day. You are always looking at ways to improve as a player, to develop and I feel like I am developing well as a player. Welbeck, who says he has been made to feel very welcome at Arsenal, holds of Nacho Monreal in training . KEOWN: Is it your movement he works on? Is it holding up the ball? Finishing? Or is it a combination? WELBECK: It’s a combination of everything. You don’t just work on one thing. Every single day all the lads after training go out and do finishing. KEOWN: Does that become competitive? To see who can score the most goals? WELBECK: Yeah it does! It gets competitive but it’s obviously all fun. But at the end of the day nobody wants to come last. We work on a lot of areas of our game. Like his team-mate Theo Walcott, Welbeck is often forced out wide, despite preferring being a central striker . KEOWN: In the last round you put out Manchester United. How did it feel to score at Old Trafford? WELBECK: It was a weird occasion for me going to back to Old Trafford on the away side. The weirdest thing was warming up on the other side of the pitch. It just felt a bit weird. But you have to treat it like it’s any other game and play the game, not the occasion. Obviously I was going back to a club that brought me up and going back to the fans that supported me for years, playing against old team-mates, my old friends, it was a weird occasion. But I scored the goal, a big goal to get us through to the semi-final. So it was a spur of the moment to celebrate. The English international scored the winning goal on his return to Old Trafford in the quarter finals last month . KEOWN: Did it cross your mind not to celebrate? WELBECK: Leading up to the game I had no plans whatsoever. I just wanted to play the game, get it over and done with and get through to Wembley and get to the semi-final. That’s what happened. I scored the goal and whatever I did I would have been criticised – criticised if I celebrated or criticised if I didn’t. It was just spur of the moment. KEOWN: Against Manchester United you seemed extra motivated. Was it anything to do with Louis Van Gaal’s comments before the match? WELBECK: I didn’t see the comments. Going into every game I want to be motivated. Playing against Manchester United – I did it earlier in the season at the Emirates – and then it was a bit different this time going back to Old Trafford. There was motivation there but I’m motivated in every game. I want to do well for my team, try and win the game and in that case get through to the semi-final. Listen, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, some you like, some you don’t like but that’s just football and it’s life. You deal with it. Welbeck celebrates in front of his old fans, a decision he says was entirely spur of the moment . KEOWN: I think you showed a lot of mental strength going into that situation. It’s always difficult going back. WELBECK: You’ve got to be strong mentally living the life and being a professional footballer. There’s a lot of people out to get you and whatever you do, everyone’s watching. You’ve just got to be switched on 100 per cent of the time. That’s just the way I’ve been brought up. My parents are lovely, caring people and they look after me well, they brought me up well and it’s the same with me and my brothers that’s credit to them. The striker has quickly become a favourite at the Emirates, and he thanked the fans for their support . KEOWN: This weekend it’s Reading. Have you looked much at their team? WELBECK: You get to watch a few games throughout the season. I know they’ve got players with Premier League experience. I’ve seen them a couple of games this season being a bit direct. [Pavel] Pogrebnyak’s a player they look for quite often from the back and the wingers will be coming inside to get the ball and flick-ons. Hal Robson-Kanu plays a bit more inside and [Gareth] McCleary is a bit more out and out on the right wing. Welbeck has been working hard in training to try and improve his finishing, along with his team-mates . KEOWN: Good knowledge… . WELBECK: Yeah I know quite a lot about football! KEOWN: As a centre forward or a winger, do you look for the weaknesses in the opposition? WELBECK: You’ve got to analyse the positives and negatives in every single team. You look at that and obviously see where you can nullify their attack and see where their weaknesses are at the back. The Gunners forward picked out Pavel Pogrebnyak as one of Reading's most dangerous players . KEOWN: How much would it mean to you to get to the FA Cup final? WELBECK: It would mean a lot. I’ve been in this position before with Man United when we played Everton in the semi-finals a few years back and we lost on penalties. I remember the situation, I remember how I felt that day and that’s something I don’t want to feel again. I just want to get to the next stage, get to the final. This is a very important game so we’re all looking forward to it, we’re going to approach it like it’s any other and play the game not the occasion.","Danny Welbeck met up with Sportsmail's Martin Keown .

"Radamel Falcao has been having a tough time of it on the pitch in recent months, but the struggling striker will have benefited from some much-needed perspective after spending Thursday evening in the company of Jonas Gutierrez. Newcastle United defender Gutierrez, who successful underwent treatment for testicular cancer earlier this year, was given a standing ovation at Anfield when he was introduced as a second-half substitute during his side's 2-0 defeat by Liverpool on Monday night. Falcao managed to catch up with Gutierrez and posted a picture of the pair on his Instagram account stating: 'It was a pleasure to spend time with @elgalgojonas ,a great example of bravery and a great person'.

United will have to pay £46million to make Falcao's transfer permanent but, having only scored four goals all season in 22 appearances for the club, his future with Louis van Gaal's side is looking increasingly uncertain. The former Atletico Madrid striker is currently commanding £280,000 a week in wages and had to suffer the ignominy of playing for United's Under 21 team in March.

"If Virgil van Dijk is absent from the shortlists for this season’s Player of the Year awards, Celtic will surely fire off a stiff missive seeking clarification on the reasons. The prospect of a Treble evaporated last Sunday, an afternoon Ronny Deila now describes as the worst of his career. ‘I sat and stared at the walls,’ said the Norwegian of the aftermath. Eight points clear of Aberdeen with five games left to play, however, his outlook is suddenly brighter.

Scorers: Mackay-Steven 32, van Dijk 63 . Referee: Calum Murray . Attendance: 8, 908 . A fourth successive title looks to be a question of when and not if. It could even happen at Pittodrie on May 10, where van Dijk scored the most significant of his impressive 10-goal haul back in November. He was at it again last night, thrashing home his second 20-yard free-kick in as many games. Ever the perfectionist, his manager still wants more. ‘Virgil has shown that ability also last season with his free-kicks. We can also see it in training, so he has to use it more. ‘It became a very good night and we have put ourselves in a very good position. Eight points ahead with five games to go — and the goal difference as well. We just have to keep on performing and putting pressure on Aberdeen.’ Last Sunday, van Dijk’s early strike against Inverness was overtaken by events. Here, his thrashing effort past Dundee keeper Scott Bain earned Celtic the two-goal lead which ultimately repelled a late rally from the hosts. Jim McAlister’s goal in the 87th minute was too little, too late. Celtic's Gary Mackay-Steven (top) jumps over the challenge from Dundee's Willie Dyer (bottom) Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths (right) goes close with an effort on goal against Dundee on Wednesday night . Celtic had claimed the lead in 32 minutes and, with painful predictability, it was laced with more refereeing controversy. It was fairly mild stuff in contrast with Sunday — and the irony of Celtic being the beneficiaries here will be lost on no one. This is a week when Scottish referees are destined to be hoist by their own petard. A week when every error, minor or major, will be punished to the maximum. The row over the Josh Meekings’ hand-ball in the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat rumbles on but there will be no Parkhead postage stamps wasted this time. There will be no disputing the free-kick which teed up Gary Mackay-Steven’s superbly struck opener. Paul Hartley may have other ideas. ‘There were some decisions which I thought were quite bizarre,’ said the Dundee manager. ‘Referees are always under pressure but after what’s happened the last few days, the scrutiny is always going to be on them.’ It was Calum Murray’s turn to be placed in football’s equaivalent of a thumbscrew last night. A nondescript 32 minutes had passed without incident or urgency when a promising move by the visitors was interrupted by a barge on Mackay-Steven 30 yards from goal. It was a free-kick. Murray, rightly, played a good advantage before Leigh Griffiths immediately tripped over the ball and lost possession. The loss of the advantage was self-inflicted, yet to howls of derision from the home support, Murray pulled the play back for a Celtic free-kick. What came next was inevitable. Stuart Armstrong thumped a long ball towards the back post, van Dijk headed it firmly across the area and Mackay-Steven gathered on the edge of the box, rasping the ball into the top corner. Dundee’s sense of injustice was merely compounded by a penalty claim before half-time when Jason Denayer bumped into Greg Stewart. It wasn’t a penalty. Yet manager Hartley’s pursuit of the officials reflected a broader frustration with his team. Afterwards he bemoaned the lack of ‘cutting edge’ from his team. He wasn’t wrong. Stuart Armstrong (right) is challenged and sent hurtling to the ground by Dundee's Ferry at Den's Park . Mackay-Steven fires Celtic into the lead with a cool finish following a snaking run through the Dundee box . Against a Parkhead side missing Adam Matthews and Stefan Johansen, the Dark Blues struggled to make inroads until the late McAlister strike. Celtic were little better in the opening stages. The opening goal from Mackay-Steven relaxed them markedly. Griffiths was unable to turn the ball back into the net from an acute angle after Emilio Izaguirre’s cross was nodded across the face of the goal by James Forrest. The disputed free-kick changed things. With the lead they had cherished, Celtic seized the game by the scruff of the neck. They should have made it two in 43 minutes. Nir Bitton’s scuffed, mishit shot from the edge of the area fell kindly at the feet of Forrest in an onside position. The winger had time and opportunity to drive it home, but hit an unconvincing effort at just the right height for Bain to pluck the ball out of the air. Denayer’s clash with Stewart — a nondescript affair unworthy of a spot kick — provoked the ire and frustration of Hartley. Celtic had undeniably enjoyed a break from the referee for their first. There could be no real complaints over the free-kick which reaped their second in 63 minutes. James McPake clattered into Armstrong 20 yards from goal. It was the same proximity as last Sunday’s opener at Hampden — and the same devastating result. Like Ryan Esson for Inverness, the Dundee keeper had little or no chance of stopping the van Dijk free-kick which killed the game. The Dutchman stepped up and thrashed the ball into the top of the net. The game, to all intents and purposes, was done. Late on, Substitute Luka Tankulic miscued from close range after van Dijk made a hash of a downward defensive header, but McAlister finished in composed fashion with three minutes to play after Paul McGinn’s progress down the right flank ended in a low cross. Celtic survived. ‘It always becomes a little bit more nervy at the end,’ said a relieved, buoyant Deila, ‘but there weren’t too many chances. We were maybe a little bit naive, but we won the game and that was the most important thing.’ Griffiths is held off by Dundee's Thomas Konrad (right) during the Scottish Premiership match on Wednesday .

"Incredible footage has  captured the moment a huge stingray nibbles on a freediver’s head, gliding back and forth over the man’s body gently on the ocean floor. The video shows the incredibly peaceful encounter between the ray and Johnny Debnam, a 29-year-old commercial diver and ocean lover. Mr Debnam was free diving in water four metres deep; holding his breath and diving down to the depths of the ocean on Rottnest Island off the coast of Western Australia. Johnny Debnam says he felt completely at ease with the stingray, although he was aware of the risks . The commercial diver was free diving four metres beneath the ocean when he had his snuggle with the ray . ‘I was totally at peace. I loved that thing going over the top of me,’ Johnny Debnam said of the experience . The video shows the swimmer completely motionless in the seagrass, with the enormous 150 kilogram ray rubbing itself back and forward over his body - even nibbling at his head. ‘I blew all my air out and was totally calm and at his level,’ explained Mr Debnam during a mini documentary produced for his production company Terra Australis TV. Mr Debnam was completely enveloped underneath the stingray, but he remained calm and insists he relished every minute of the wonderful experience. The stingray is a potentially dangerous creature. If provoked it may use its spiky tail – known as a barb- to spear the victim and inject them with a deadly poison. Tragically, animal activist and Australian icon Steve Irwin was killed after a deadly encounter with a stingray. In September 2006 the creature stabbed him with its barb 'hundreds of times' as he filmed a documentary near Queensland's Great Barrier Reef. However Mr Debnam's relationship with the stingray was incredibly harmonious. He is experienced with marine life and in the video demonstrates his behaviour to be gentle and threatening, and the stingray appears to reward him with some appreciative cuddles! Johnny Debnam did not have any breathing equipment on when he let all his air out and calmly lay still on the ocean floor . The majestic stingray swum over him three times, enveloping him under his body as he glided on top . ‘Those things are huge. They’re massive and they could really mess you up if they wanted to,’ Debnam said during his Terris Australis TV documentary. ‘But, they won’t if they don’t want to.’ Responding to his calm nature, the curious stingray repeatedly glides over him, as if to try to determine what exactly it had found nestled amongst the reeds. Debnam is ecstatic after his snuggled with the majestic, friendly creature. ‘I was totally at peace. I loved that thing going over the top of me,’ he said. ‘It was awesome! It did it three times and I wanted it to do it again. ‘It was a bit of a rush really!’ Responding to his calm nature, the curious stingray repeatedly glides over him, as if to try to determine what exactly it had found nestled amongst the reeds . The production company he co-created, Terra Australis TV, specialises in creating stunning cinematography of the incredible creatures beneath the ocean’s surface in Western Australia. Debnam and his cameraman Cameron Wallace are passionate about showing the ocean respect whilst exploring and filming the wonders of the sea. ‘That’s what makes you feel alive. Natural, awesome, pure things like (swimming with a stingray),’ said Debnam. ‘You can’t buy it.’ See www.terraaustralis.tv .

"The 'battle of Holland' was nothing short of sensational as Raymond van Barnevald defeated World No 1 Michael van Gerwen - earning the bragging rights and giving himself a fighting chance of qualifying for the showdown at the 02 Arena. Robin van Persie was an interested spectator as he watched the bout on a camel TV and showed his support for his fellow Dutchmen on his Instagram page. The reigning Premier League Darts champion started well and found himself 2-0 up, before Van Gerwen began to score high and leveled the legs up. Raymond van Barneveld was in formidable form as he won 'the battle of Holland' against Michael van Gerwen . But Van Barneveld lived up to his legendary status, with scintillating finishing to ease past his Dutch counterpart, 7-3, and end his previously unbeaten record. Phil Taylor ended his losing run after beating Dave Chisnall and drawing with Stephen Bunting but the 16-time world champion will be disappointed he didn't finish off 'The Bullet' - earning himself maximum points. The 54-year-old rampaged to victory over Chisnall, taking the contest, 7-3, and recovering from back-to-back defeats in his two previous outings. Robin van Persie took to Instagram to show that he was watching his fellow Dutchmen go head-to-head . The Manchester United forward is currently out injured but looks set to leave Louis van Gaal's side . Bunting and Taylor were involved in arguably the match of the night, with both men involved in a quite incredible ending, where they threw a sequence of wayward darts before Bunting hit double one and making sure he took home a point. Adrian Lewis won his third match on the bounce, beating Bunting, 7-2, and condemning his opponent to a heavy defeat. 'Jackpot' boosted his chances of making the knockout stage with a convincing victory as he proved why he's still a player to fear in the Premier League. Phil Taylor will be disappointed he couldn't finsh off Stephen Bunting considering the chances he had . Adrian Lewis showed that he should not yet be written off with an impressive win over Bunting . Gary Anderson produced a sterling fightback to earn himself a draw against James Wade - sending the Scottish crowd wild as he hit double 20 to level it at 6-6. Wade had a number of chances to finish off the tie but was out of sorts in the final four legs, giving the 'Flying Scotsman' a glimmer hope - and he made no mistake. Anderson's point could be crucial - come the end of the competition - when the top four will meet to decide who will the Premier League 2015 champion.

"Eric Abidal believes that his former club Barcelona have the potential to secure a famous treble by winning La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa del Rey this season. Luis Enrique's side coasted past Paris Saint-Germain to take up a semi-final place in the Champions League, while they also sit top of La Liga and will take on Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final. Abidal was an integral part of Pep Guardiola's brilliant Barcelona team that swept the board to win six trophies in 2009 and he believes that the club could be on the road to rescaling those heights. Neymar scored twice as Barcelona beat PSG 2-0 (5-1 on agg) to advance to the Champions League semi-finals . Barcelona won the treble in 2009 and former defender Eric Abidal (right) says the current crop are on their way . Abidal, who retired last year, was speaking at the launch of the Eric Abidal Foundation in Catalonia . 'It is possible to achieve a treble but in football it is very complicated.' Abidal said. 'You can win the cup, the league and the Champions League but it only takes a minute for something to go wrong. I would like see Barca once again reach the level they had when we won 6 titles in 2009 and I think they are on this path. With the mentality that they have, working hard, taking it one day at a time, they can achieve these objectives. 'Barcelona are very much in form. They demonstrated that once again against PSG and I hope they will reach the final. I know the aims of this club and I know the team will be giving everything to be in that final.' Abidal did, however, warn that his former coach Pep Guardiola would be a formidable opponent should the draw pit Barcelona against Bayern Munich in the semi-final. 'The 6-1 win over Porto demonstrates that in football you really never know what will happen. This is the beautiful thing about the game. If Barca were to meet Bayern in the semi-finals, then they would really have to be on their guard and concentrate hard because Bayern are a very strong side. Neymar and Lionel Messi have impressed for Barcelona this season, along with striker Luis Suarez . Messi scored Barcelona's second goal against Manchester United in the Champions League final in 2009 . The former Barcelona defender, who retired last year, was speaking at the launch of the Eric Abidal Foundation in Catalonia. The charity is aiming to raise vital funds for research into cancer while it will also strive to improve the support network for families and children that suffer from the disease. Abidal was diagnosed with a cancerous liver tumour in March 2011 but fought the illness to star in Barcelona's 3-1 victory over Manchester United in the Champions League final at Wembley. However, the cancer resurfaced in 2012 when Abidal required a liver transplant - which was selflessly offered by his cousin Gerard. 'I feel very lucky to be here and to have been able to fight for my family and for all the people that supported me,' Abidal said. 'I am very conscious that I am now an example to others because I have overcome the illness twice and experienced a transplant. 'I am very proud if I am seen as a role model but particularly proud to be able to help people in my own way. Abidal is lifted into the air as his team celebrates their capture of the La Liga title in 2011 . 'The foundation is here to help children and teenagers that suffer from cancer. We have created it because we know the exact need of the patients but not only the patients, also families because from day to day we know how a patient suffers but also how it affects the family.' 'We have it very clear in our minds that any child facing the illness is incredibly brave and fights with the determination of an adult but it is necessary to be by their side to remind them of the good things in life, that they have a strong team around around them.'

"Real Madrid closed the gap on Barcelona to just two points at the top of La Liga, but will be praying injuries to Gareth Bale and Luka Modric don't derail their season. Both Los Blancos stars were substituted as Carlo Ancelotti's side struggled to overcome a spirited Malaga, who had chances to snatch a draw. Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty but provided goals for Sergio Ramos and James Rodriguez, before adding the third himself, as Madrid kept within touching distance of league leaders Barcelona.

Subs not used: Guerra, Ochoa, Torres, Filipenko . Booked: Sanchez, Damian Tissone . Goals: Juanmi 71' After just four minutes, Bale's game was over. The Welshman tenderly touched his calf and made a pulling motion with his hands to the bench as he left the pitch, which might imply internal muscle damage. Given that Karim Benzema was injured after a brutal Champions League encounter with City rivals Atletico Madrid in midweek, Bale's injury took the famous ""BBC"" strikeforce just down to C. That's the grade you'd give it too, in 2015, when compared to the performances of Barcelona's trio. Isco came in for Benzema, with the Frenchman's injury solving a problem that was brewing at Real Madrid, with Carlo Ancelotti having to choose between the former Malaga man, and James Rodriguez. The latter was chosen over the former to face Atletico, leading to stories of angst on Isco's part, but the issue was resolved by Benzema's timely absence. Modric, meanwhile, was taken out by a Recio challenge in the second half. It wasn't too fierce a tackle, but the Croatian took a strong knock to his knee and is now a doubt for Wednesday's second leg against Atletico. Malaga, having beaten Barcelona at Camp Nou earlier this season, and drawn with champions Atletico Madrid last week, are no La Liga whipping boys and they came to the Santiago Bernabeu with the belief they could win. Nordin Amrabat, on loan from Galatasaray, charged forward battling with Pepe, escaped the Real Madrid defender and crossed for Juanmi, but the forward couldn't connect and the chance was gone. The Dutchman stung Iker Casillas' fingertips with a strike from distance, the veteran stopper tipping his effort behind for a corner. Carlos Idriss Kameni was forced into a similar save at the other end, spectacularly flicking a header from Bale's replacement, Javier Hernandez, over the bar.

Ramos tucks the ball in to open the scoring for Real Madrid at the Bernabeu . The defender slides on his knees in front of the Real Madrid fans after netting . Real Madrid broke the deadlock in controversial fashion, when Ronaldo fired in a free kick from the left and Ramos rammed home from close range. The defender seemed fractionally offside, but despite Kameni's cries, the goal was allowed to stand. The Cameroonian goalkeeper was called into action again shortly afterwards, making a fine save down to his right from a James volley. With the most expensive player in the world off the pitch, the second most expensive was having fun. Ronaldo pulled off a quite ridiculous backheel-nutmeg on Marcos Angeleri. In the following minute Ramos had the ball in the net again, nodding home a Toni Kroos free-kick, but this time the officials spotted he was offside and ruled it out. Malaga flew down the other end and created a magnificent opportunity, which Sergi Darder blazed over the bar when he should have found the net. Juanmi's cross was half-cleared by Marcelo and Darder pounced, but lacked balance and spooned his strike off-target from eight yards. Amrabat, flying down the right early in the second half, tried to find Juanmi with a low cross, but it flew past the forward and Casillas gathered it. Ronaldo had the perfect opportunity to put the game beyond Malaga when James was taken down in the box by Samu Castillejo, but lacked his characteristic cool and fired the penalty against the left upright.

But Real Madrid didn't have long to wait for their second, with James scoring in spectacular fashion just a minute later. He played two one-twos on the edge of the box with Isco and Ronaldo, before lashing the ball into Kameni's top right corner. Game over? Not quite. Malaga were straight down the other end and on the scoresheet, with Roberto Rosales whipping the ball in from the right for Juanmi to head home. Amrabat had a chance to run through after a Marcelo mis-step - this was a rare poor performance for the Brazilian - but Kroos resorted to a blatant kick to stop him. The German went into the book, with the foul a symbol of how Madrid were struggling to prevent the Andalusian side from getting forward on the break.

Real Madrid forward Ronaldo looks frustrated after missing a penalty during the second half . But Rodriguez soon doubled Real Madrid's lead just a couple of minutes after Ronaldo had missed the penalty .

Ronaldo's evening was saved on a personal level at the end, with Hernandez selflessly squaring the ball for the forward to tap home at the far post. His celebration was excessive, considering Madrid had essentially won the game and it was a simple finish, but that's what happens when you have to keep up with the Joneses. Or in this case, the Messis. The Argentine had scored for Barcelona earlier, so Ronaldo would have left frustrated had he not been able to replicate Messi's effort, grabbing his 39th goal of the season in La Liga, and his 50th in all competitions. Ronaldo became the first ever player to net 50 goals in five consecutive seasons, an incredible statistic, but Ancelotti's mind will now turn to Wednesday night and another incredible statistic. He has faced Atletico Madrid seven times so far this season and not won a single game. Will he be forced to try it without Modric and Bale in the eighth?","Sergio Ramos opened the scoring for Real Madrid in the first half at the Bernabeu .

"These are toxic times on Tyneside but the thousands of supporters who boycotted were at least spared another dispiriting display which equalled a club-record rot of six straight defeats in the Premier League. Were it not for a freaky five wins on the spin last autumn, the Magpies would be headed for the Championship. In fact, head coach John Carver fears his side – the worst in the division on present form – could yet plummet towards the bottom three. ‘We are in amongst a relegation battle.

It’s another defeat and that’s not good enough. This is the most difficult situation I’ve ever been in but I’m not going to give up on it.’ Although the official attendance was returned as a massively inaccurate 47, 427 – making it the biggest of the weekend in the top-flight – estimates had it nearer 40,000 as fans stayed away in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of £18.7million before revealing they have a further £34m in the bank. The billionaire will need to part with a sizeable chunk of that cash this summer if Newcastle are to avoid a season-long struggle against relegation next time around. One banner – unfurled during a pre-match protest outside of the Gallowgate End – captured the mood of frustration and mistrust among supporters – ‘NUFC – Balance sheet champions, 2008-2014’. Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, meanwhile, launched a scathing attack on Ashley. ‘People will say as supporters you’ve got to come back, you’ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters?’ he said. ‘Since Mike Ashley’s been here they’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated again. ‘So he’s balanced the books and he’s made money because he’s a businessman, but I think of these people and wonder, “Don’t you want to be excited yourself?”. ‘I’m getting bored by Newcastle. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there’s nothing happening? There’s no cup run, I just don’t get it. I don’t get why he wants to own a football club.’ The defeat leaves Newcastle seven points above the drop zone and Carver has previously confessed that he does not know where their next point is coming from. Tottenham striker Harry Kane at full stretch with of Spurs is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . After Kane was chosen as caretaker of the captain's armband, Jan Vertonghen returned to lead Tottenham at St James' Park . Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Newcastle's Vernon Anita . On this evidence, they may well have to rely on their current tally of 35 being enough. They were hardly helped here by Tim Krul. But perhaps the loss of form of the usually-dependable goalkeeper best represents the problems which have plagued the squad in recent weeks. The Dutch stopper could have done more to keep out Chadli’s first-half opener and was again culpable as Eriksen struck to restore the lead after Jack Colback had levelled early in the second half. Chadli appeared to have exhausted his options as he floated in possession 25 yards from goal only to drop his shoulder before slamming into the bottom corner with Krul sluggish in his pursuit of the strike. Carver reacted to an insipid first half by hooking the ineffective Yoan Gouffran and midfielder Mehdi Abeid and within 20 seconds they were level when Colback steamed onto a loose ball inside the area before slotting home. Chadli was given space outside the box and pulled the trigger just as Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback arrived in defence .

But parity was to last just eight minutes and Eriksen’s free-kick – intended as a cross – bounced through the weak grasp of Krul and into the back of the net. Krul, in fairness, made a string of fine stops to keep Newcastle within one but he was powerless to prevent Kane rolling beyond him in stoppage-time after he had skipped onto Erik Lamela’s through-ball. In doing so Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to score 30 goals in one season. And the England striker now has Lineker’s total of 35 in his sights. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise for Newcastle . Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at Newcastle's home St James' Park . Fans applaud while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, No Ashley' sign, while Colback's Newcastle team-mates join in the celebrations . ‘I'm very proud but there are five games left and, hopefully, I'll get a few more goals,’ he said. Manager Mauricio Pochettino added: ‘We were better than Newcastle and deserved the win. ‘For Harry, it is a fantastic achievement. We need to push him now because he has a lot of improvement left in him.’ Newcastle, meanwhile, will also need to improve in the final five matches of their sorry season, or risk starting next in the second tier.

"FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce claimed on Wednesday night that the SFA were ‘entirely wrong’ in their move to ban Josh Meekings from the Scottish Cup Final. The Inverness Caley Thistle centre-half will learn on Thursday whether he has been successful in challenging the one-match suspension offered by compliance officer Tony McGlennan. Meekings was charged over the handball that thwarted a Leigh Griffiths effort in their semi-final victory - an incident which also prompted Celtic to write to the SFA seeking ‘an understanding’ of why no penalty and red card followed. Inverness defender Josh Meekings' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to Celtic on Sunday . Meekings has been retrospectively suspended for one match, the punishment he would have got if sent off . But Northern Irishman Boyce, who is also chairman of FIFA’s referees committee, believes the only potential punishment should be levelled at match referee Steven McLean and his assistants. ‘This sets a very dangerous precedent, I am absolutely, 100 per cent against the compliance officer becoming involved because the referee’s decision is final,’ said Boyce. ‘It is a totally different matter if someone has gone over the top, or committed a serious foul, or head-butted someone and the referee has missed it. ‘Those are disciplinary issues. But what happened here is that the referee has made a mistake regarding a hand-ball and that’s the end of it. There is no way the player should now be disciplined for that. ‘Who is to say it was even intentional? If the Scottish FA or their referees committee decide that they feel a serious mistake was made then they could take action in the future against that referee. ‘The only punishment, if any punishment at all is due, should be made if the Scottish FA feel the officials in charge of this game acted improperly and made the wrong decision.’ FIFA's head of referees Jim Boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong . Inverness is appealing the ruling that, if upheld, will deny Meekings (right) a place in the Scottish Cup final . The SFA’s disciplinary rules provide scope for action against sending-off offences not seen by the referee, including denying the opposition a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity. And former compliance officer Vincent Lunny believes Meekings should brace himself to miss the showpiece against Falkirk on May 30. ‘Look at the different options — any way you look at it, he would have missed the final,’ said Lunny. Meekings (right) celebrates Inverness's 3-2 win over Celtic in their Scottish Cup semi-final . ‘I suppose it’s natural to feel sympathetic for a player who is potentially missing out on a place in the Scottish Cup Final, which might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance. ‘But if Steven McLean had seen it at the time, he’d have been sent off and he’d be missing the final had Inverness gone on to win; and if he (Meekings) hadn’t done it, Celtic would have scored and there’s a good chance they would have gone on to win, so again Josh Meekings would have missed the final. ‘I think it will be an uphill struggle, especially after (Inverness manager) John Hughes’s comments on the radio saying it was a sending-off matter.’","Josh Meekings was given a retrospective one-match ban for a handball .

"Greece's Football Federation (EPO) could be suspended from international competition over government interference should a proposed new  law be voted in, FIFA and UEFA have warned. Following continuous problems with crowd trouble, the Greek government has put together a new set of regulations in an attempt to crack down on violence at sports events. FIFA and UEFA have strict rules aimed at protecting member federations' independence in running their own affairs and sent a joint letter to EPO president Giorgos Girtzikis warning that it 'would have no option but to refer the case to the relevant bodies for immediate sanctions, including the suspension of the Hellenic Football Federation (EPO).' The Greek government wants to stamp out incidents such as this in a March AEK Athens-Olympiakos match . A new set of regulations to try and crack down on violence at sports events is opposed by FIFA and UEFA . The bill, entitled 'Measures for the confrontation of violence in Greek sports and other provisions', will be initially reviewed by the Cultural Affairs Committee from April 27-30 and then discussed in parliament on May 4-5. Stavros Kontonis, Deputy Minister for Education, Culture and Religious Affairs, criticised FIFA and UEFA in a strongly worded media statement, accusing both governing bodies of showing little interest in helping solve the issues of violence which have caused matches in Greece to be suspended three times just this season. 'It appears that they are not interested in solving the evils plaguing Greek football, but are instead seeking ways to offend the Greek constitutional order and the Greek people, especially the country's football fans, which have to put up with the current scene of rot and corruption, something which the government is trying to overturn,' Kontonis said. Football's governing bodies have strict rules aimed at protecting member federations' independence . Kontonis has invited FIFA and UEFA to Athens ahead of the planned three-day discussion of the bill. 'We hope that both federations understand the serious, accumulating problems of Greek football and that they will engage constructively and actively in the process of consolidation, democratisation and transparency,' he added.

"As composed and as comfortable as Manchester City were here at the Etihad, performances like this succeed only in highlighting the full extent of their failure this season. In Sergio Aguero they boast the joint leading scorer in the Barclays Premier League. Here against West Ham he scored his 20th of the campaign. And in David Silva and Jesus Navas, not to mention a seemingly revitalised Yaya Toure, they had players far too accomplished for the quality of this opposition. But such a dominant, determined display must leave the club’s owners wondering why on earth this was only their third win in nine games after a run of six defeats in their previous eight. Why, even when West Ham were as abject as they were until City lost Silva to serious injury, they have been unable to play with such confidence more frequently.

Presumably a victory that strengthens City’s position among the Champions League places, on a weekend when Manchester United lost, eases the pressure on Manuel Pellegrini. But there is sure to remain a fair amount of frustration in Abu Dhabi that the last few months have proved so problematic. By the end of this encounter the greater, more pressing, concern was for the welfare of Silva. Injured from what both managers agreed was an accidental elbow in the face from Cheikhou Kouyate midway through the second half, the Spanish international required oxygen before leaving the pitch on a stretcher after eight minutes of treatment. He was then taken to hospital. But other problems nevertheless remain for City’s manager Pellegrini when he had to wake to headlines being generated by the notoriously vocal agent of Toure, who reportedly accused the Chilean of being ‘a weak manager’ as well as criticising other prominent members of the club hierarchy, too. Pellegrini was asked to respond but declined to comment. With managers such as Jurgen Klopp now available for hire, these stories are poorly timed for Pellegrini. But he can at least take comfort in the way his team responded to that crushing defeat at Old Trafford the previous weekend. ‘After two defeats in a row it was a very important win,’ added Pellegrini.

Aleksandar Kolarov goes down under the challenge of West Ham defender Carl Jenkinson in the penalty area but was only awarded a corner . With another match here at home coming next, against Aston Villa, City’s manager is sure to be encouraged by the form of Aguero. Until Sunday he had failed to score a Premier League goal from open play at the Etihad since November 2. But the goal he scored in this contest was neatly taken; much more like the striker City’s subdued supporters have grown to admire. He thrived on the possession City were enjoying — 75 per cent for the first 15 minutes — and joined Silva and Alek-sandar Kolarov in threatening West Ham’s goal early on. City’s opening goal, scored after 18 minutes, was an absolute horror for West Ham. First came Aaron Cresswell’s failure to win an aerial contest with the diminutive Navas, and then a spectacular own goal from James Collins.

In trying to intercept a cross from Navas, the West Ham centre half succeeded only in scoring with a sliced volley, the ball spinning off his boot and over the head of Adrian before flying home via the underside of the crossbar. If it was a little unfortunate for the visitors it remained a product of the pressure City were exerting. A West Ham side probably unsettled by the uncertainty surrounding their own manager offered little in return. Carlton Cole almost seized on a mistake from Martin Demichelis only for Joe Hart to block his shot, while City’s goalkeeper then marked his 28th birthday by denying Enner Valencia.

The control nevertheless remained with City, a second goal arriving in the 36th minute after Toure had regained possession from Stewart Downing. A rapidly executed counter-attack followed, with Aguero and Navas combining impressively before Aguero slotted home his 101st Manchester City goal. In the dug-out Sam Allardyce appeared thoroughly hacked off, and understandably so given the ineptitude of his defenders and his side’s lack of ambition going forward. He responded at the start of the second half by pushing Valencia into a more attacking role alongside Cole. But it was City who continued to press, with Adrian doing well to deny Aguero a second. The injury to Silva — earning Kouyate a yellow card despite the fact that it really didn’t look intentional — disrupted City’s rhythm and gave West Ham a little encouragement. Downing went close, as did Valencia. But to no avail. For once Pellegrini had reason to feel a touch more secure.

"It is exactly a year since Sportsmail revealed that David Moyes was getting the sack at Manchester United, the club deciding to take action as soon as a defeat at Everton meant Champions League qualification was no longer possible. Into his shoes stepped an entirely different character, the supremely confident Louis van Gaal. One year on, JOE BERNSTEIN looks at which man has coped best in the crucial areas of the job, with the pressure of trying to continue Sir Alex Ferguson's success at Old Trafford weighing heavily. David Moyes waved goodbye to Manchester United exactly a year ago after a dismal run of results . Louis van Gaal has propelled United back into the top four, despite an up-and-down season . RESULTS . For David Moyes to take a team that had won the Premier League title by 11 points into seventh place was an unmitigated disaster, even if he coped well with his first Champions League campaign and reached the quarter-finals. United lost seven of their 19 league games at Old Trafford – unacceptable. Under Louis van Gaal, United have already won more league points than they did last season and there are still five matches left. There has been the occasional blip, like losing twice to Swansea City, but the bigger the match, they better they've done, which is how United are meant to be. Two results stand out in particular. Under Moyes, United lost 3-0 at home to their biggest rivals Liverpool and Manchester City. In the corresponding fixtures this season, they have won 3-0 and 4-2. Moyes 4/10; Van Gaal 7/10 . United reflect on another low point last season after Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich . There is a different vibe around Old Trafford now, as seen in the 4-1 win over Manchester City this month . PERFORMANCES . Neither manager plays the same way as Ferguson, whose response when lesser teams came to Old Trafford was to try and overwhelm them with attacking play, based on the use of wingers. Moyes is a more cautious manager, prioritising his defence and it left United fans chanting: 'Come on David Moyes, play like Fergie's boys'. Van Gaal has also been criticised for building play too slowly, he likes to keep possession as a tool for eventually killing off the opposition, death by a thousand passes. But funnily enough that criticism has subsided as the results have improved. Under Moyes, United looked great in some away games, particularly hitting Newcastle for four at St James' Park. But they fell short in the big matches. United got lucky at Arsenal and Southampton earlier in the season, but the showing in the Manchester derby a fortnight ago was a lot more vibrant. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 6/10 . Juan Mata scored twice as United enjoyed a 4-0 win at Newcastle, a rare good show under Moyes . Robin van Persie's double helped United scrape a lucky win at Southampton in December . DECISIONS . David Moyes got himself into a pickle before he'd even started by appearing ambiguous over whether he was a Robin van Persie man or a Wayne Rooney man. The result was the pair failed to link up in any meaningful way. Having spent £27million on Marouane Fellaini, he deployed him too deep, and failed to get the best out of experienced players Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra and Ryan Giggs. Van Gaal comes across as a man who knows what he wants but a defensive injury crisis early on seemed to make him lurch from one formation to another. Rooney was also shunted around from attack to midfield which didn't get the best out of him. Ironically, it was Van Gaal's decision to push a Moyes signing, Fellaini, forward which proved the key to turning United's season around. Moyes and Van Gaal have both made mistakes but the Dutchman seems to have the strength of personality to correct them in time. He has left big names out like Angel di Maria, Falcao and Robin van Persie. Moyes didn't seem to have the confidence to do that. Making Rooney captain was a Van Gaal plan that has worked. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 6/10 . Ryan Giggs (left) was one of the senior pros whom Moyes failed to get the best out of . Falcao has been a big disappointment under Van Gaal, but the United boss hasn't been afraid to drop him . SIGNINGS . It's a confusing area because we don't really know who has been responsible for all the signings at United since Ferguson left. One can assume Moyes handpicked Fellaini from Everton and he has been a belated success, but the £37.1million acquisition of Mata looked more like opportunism from Ed Woodward who needed at the time to know he could pull off a big deal. Ander Herrera, signed when Van Gaal was in charge, is regarded more as a Moyes buy - he'd done the homework on the Spaniard. Likewise, Van Gaal can take credit for Daley Blind, whose versatility has come in useful this season, and Marcos Rojo. He admits he had little to do with Herrera or Luke Shaw, and the capture of Falcao was probably driven at boardroom level. The biggest signing, £60million for Di Maria, is interesting. Van Gaal definitely liked him as a winger but the Argentine has been a letdown despite 10 Premier League assists. Moyes definitely scores a higher mark now for his transfer business than he would have scored when he left the club, which is why his supporters are aggrieved he wasn't given a second season. Moyes 6/10; Van Gaal 5/10 . Marouane Fellaini was originally branded a poor signing but Moyes's decision has since been vindicated . Angel di Maria was bought for a British record £60m, but has flopped in his first season at United . RELATIONSHIP WITH PLAYERS . Having worked with Wayne Rooney as a teenager at Everton, Moyes was able to get the striker back onside despite his disappointment at the time of not earning a move to Chelsea. But other senior professionals did not react well to the Scot. Robin van Persie felt he was over-trained, though he was careful not to publicly criticise Moyes, but others like Rio Ferdinand were not shy about voicing complaints over issues like when the team was announced. Ryan Giggs made it clear he preferred a more direct, attacking approach with 'pace and width'. Club captain Nemanja Vidic made his decision to leave during Moyes' tenure. It is hard to know exactly what goes on in the inner sanctum but it does appear Van Gaal is highly respected by his United squad. The attention to detail in training has won over key players like Rooney and Michael Carrick, the midfielder even suggesting the team's new style has been taken on board by the players quicker than the fans have done. Even when the team was struggling, you haven't heard mumblings of discontent in the dressing-room compared to a year ago. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 7/10 . Moyes endured a fractious relationship with several stars at United, including Van Persie . Wayne Rooney and Van Gaal have formed a strong bond, and the Dutchman has the respect of his squad . PUBLIC RELATIONS . In a sense, Moyes was handed a thankless task, replacing Ferguson as the 'Chosen One'. It did require a strong personality with a thick skin, and unfortunately the Scot failed on both counts. In retrospect, he was too deferential, when he cited the club's tradition for bringing in young players and attacking until the end, it didn't sound right because his strengths lie elsewhere. His admission that he didn't take Van Persie off because he feared the reaction smelt of weakness. Neither was he helped by criticism from club legends Paul Scholes and Gary Neville on television. Because of his c.v., Van Gaal has been able to lay down his markers rather better. He has dealt with the likes of Patrick Kluivert, Xavi and Andres Iniesta and the fans of Bayern Munich and Barcelona so nothing at United was going to frighten him. He has been confident enough to lay down his philosophy, whether popular or unpopular. His biggest error was getting sucked into an argument over long-ball tactics with Sam Allardyce. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 7/10 . A banner critical of manager Moyes was flown above Old Trafford during a match against Aston Villa . Van Gaal's glittering CV ensured he had the gravitas needed to take on one of the game's biggest jobs . ESCAPING THE SHADOW OF FERGIE . Having personally anointed Moyes, Ferguson maybe felt subconsciously he should have some influence. He went to nearly all the matches despite having said on retirement he'd travel the world and was put out that Moyes let his backroom team of Mike Phelan and Rene Meulensteen leave. Certainly, when Moyes was heading out, Fergie knew about it and didn't fight to keep him. Ferguson knows he won't hold any sway over Van Gaal and doesn't even try, which has helped the Dutchman.

"At the Ballon d’Or ceremony in January Carlo Ancelotti and Diego Simeone were runners-up as Joachim Low won the best coach award for guiding Germany to the World Cup. As the two men small-talked in Zurich, Simeone is understood to have asked Ancelotti how life was in Madrid and his answer demonstrated perfectly the dynamic between the two men. He said he was happy in the city and keen to stay, but that life would be a lot easier if Simeone were not on the other side of town managing Atletico Madrid. Having already lost the Spanish Super Cup to Simeone at the start of the season, and the first league meeting between the two teams, since the FIFA gala Ancelotti has been knocked out of the Copa del Rey by his nemesis and beaten 4-0 in the league. The pressure is on Carlo Ancelotti and Real Madrid when Atletico Madrid visit the Bernabeu on Sunday . Ancelotti reportedly told Diego Simeone that life in Madrid would be a lot easier if Atletico weren't around . Simeone (left) and Ancelotti (right) were runners-up behind Joachim Low at the Ballon d'Or in January . ‘We don’t need to beat them, we just need to go through’ was how he approached the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final. That would have been fine had Real marked-up a high-scoring draw in the Calderon but the 0-0 somehow scraped by Atletico Madrid last Tuesday means that now a draw will not send Real Madrid through. Carlo needs to beat Diego – or else it’s either elimination or penalties. Ancelotti’s overall record against Simeone is poor with just three wins in 12 games. He has been beaten twice by his team in the league this season, losing one and drawing one in the domestic competition last season. He did win both legs of a Copa del Rey tie last season but this season Atletico got their cup revenge with an away draw and a home win to knock Real out. Atletico also won the Spanish Super Cup in August. The overall record is 12 played, three won, four drawn and five lost. The games are tight, usually low scoring and uncomfortably physical for Real who, Sergio Ramos and Pepe aside, are short of players who have quite the same appetite for a battle. Ancelotti may well pick both on Wednesday night, and a third centre back in Rafael Varane as he looks to match the visitors for force. If all three are picked Pepe would step into a midfield enforcer’s role that he has not occupied since the days of Jose Mourinho. Real Madrid have struggled against Atletico in recent years and were beaten 4-0 in La Liga in February . The headlines from Spanish publications AS and Marca on Wednesday focused on the huge derby game . The Champions League quarter-final first leg finished 0-0 after a physical game at the Vicente Calderon . There are seven players who a booking away from missing the first leg of the semi-final and German midfielder Toni Kroos, who is among them, has already lit the blue touch paper suggesting Atletico Madrid’s players are experts in pressuring the referee. The question of what will happen to Ancelotti if he loses has already been extensively debated in Madrid. It wouldn’t necessarily be the end of him but he would certainly have to overhaul Barcelona’s two point advantage in the league – winning nothing would be grounds for automatic dismissal regardless of the Champions League he delivered last season. At times this season his team has looked like surpassing the exploits of last year’s campaign – the run of 22 straight wins that also saw them crowned World Club champions in December in Malaysia was the stuff of future legend but the season collapsed in February and the bouquets for the Italian turned into brickbats overnight. Toni Kroos is a yellow card away from European suspension while Ancelotti has several players missing . The Italian coach watches his players, including Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) train in Madrid on Monday . Injuries played their part in the massive downturn. Sergio Ramos and Pepe were missing from defence and Luka Modric and James Rodriguez from midfield. Supporters bemoaned the fact that Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema should still have been able to carry the team to victories but that view did a huge disservice to the way Modric controls games, Rodriguez loads the bullets for the front three to fire, and Pepe and Ramos' pace enables the team to play ten yards higher up the pitch than when they are not available. Just when it seemed Real would be at full-strength for the run-in Modric has gone down with knee ligament trouble likely to rule him out for six weeks and Benzema, Bale and Marcelo are also all missing on Wednesday night. Ancelotti resisted the opportunity to get his excuses in early on Tuesday when he said he had the ‘best squad in the world’. He will hope that message of confidence inspires his players at the Bernabeu. And of course in among all the bad omens there is one exceptionally positive precedent: in Lisbon last May, Madrid beat Atletico Madrid 4-1 and lifted the European Cup. If Ancelotti and Real were to lose on Wednesday night then only La Liga glory would be enough to save his job . Cristiano Ronaldo struck in the Champions League final in a rare 4-1 victory for Real against their city rivals .","Real Madrid host Atletico in Champions League quarter-final second leg .

"An Australian man died suddenly on Wednesday after suffering a suspected heart attack while holidaying in Bali. The 50-year-old collapsed just after ordering breakfast at the Rooftop Restaurant on the fourth floor of the 101 Legian Hotel in the tourist town of Kuta where he was staying. He was unable to be revived, but a doctor at the scene said that it was likely he died of a heart attack. It's believed that he was from Seymour in Victoria. The 50-year-old man collapsed and died at his hotel in the tourist town of Kuta in bali . An autopsy has still to be carried out to find the exact cause of death, although external examinations suggest that he suffered a heart attack. News.com reports that a waitress Ni Komang Hennytasari was working at the restaurant and told News Corp Australia that the man and his friend, with whom he was holidaying, had been sitting at table 31. She had asked him how he was and he told her: 'I am not feeling well.' Kuta is known internationally for its long sandy beach and is very popular with Australian tourists . She said that a few minutes after this the man’s friend called for help as the man suddenly fell to the floor. Denpasar police were working with the Australian Consulate in Bali to find out if the deceased’s family would allow an autopsy to be conducted. The man reportedly checked in to the 101 Legian Hotel on April 19 and was due to stay until April 29. It's believed that the man is from Seymour in Victoria and was holidaying at the Bali resort .

"If you open your suitcase after leaving the airport with damaged goods inside, this might be the reason why. An airport luggage conveyor belt has a novel way of separating bags into the correct queues - but it's a somewhat cut and thrust job. As the suitcases whizz round on the belt, out of nowhere a mechanical arm slams into the bags and and thrusts them onto a lower track. The red and black luggage moves along the conveyor after being taken from the plane . Suddenly the mechanical arm springs into action giving the luggage some brute force . And with a sharp movement, the red and black case is passed down onto a lower conveyor belt . The mechanism appears to work on a sensor system, ensuring it strikes out at the centre of the luggage so as to not spin it, but what might shock is the force of the action. It is not known where this video was taken, although it is believed to be an international airport. However baggage pushers like this are used at airports all over the world, with Dutch company Vanderlande market leaders in the machinery. Their 'Parallel Pusher,' similar to the one in this video, is a widely used horizontal divert pusher that sorts single bags to one destination only. When the pusher is activated, a pusher plate operates at 90 degrees to the transport direction and pushes the bag into a destination or onto a connection conveyor. This suitcase is set for a ride on a different conveyor in a matter of seconds . The arm extends out to separate the luggage in the hope it arrives with its owner . The video, after being uploaded to YouTube, has been met with mixed responses. User Stephanie O wrote: 'This is the real reason why your baggage is destroyed at the airport', while Sarah Cartwright added: 'Vicious airport baggage packer.' DMTRYP says what most people would think on viewing the video, writing: 'Hope none of the souvenirs were made out of glass or ceramics.'","Machines are used around the world for sorting luggage onto conveyors .

"A self-proclaimed animal lover was ‘shocked’ and ‘disgusted’ to find a ball that she thinks was purpose designed to harm animals or children near her home. Tegan Peters, 22, from Auckland New Zealand said she immediately wanted to warn her Pakuranga community after finding a tennis ball deliberately covered in sharp pins in Ti Rakau Park, south of Auckland. Ms Peters said she noticed the ball as she was driving past and decided to pull over, thinking it could be a good present for her one-year-old Rottweiler-cross, Odin. Self-proclaimed animal lover, Tegan Peters, pictured with her dog Odin, was ‘shocked’ and ‘disgusted’ to find a ball that she thinks was purpose designed to harm animals or children near her home. Troubling tennis ball: ‘I picked it up and saw all the needles sticking out and got a real shock’ ‘I picked it up and saw all the needles sticking out and got a real shock,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. ‘There were upwards of 20 needles in the tennis ball.’ Ms Peters said she initially thought she would be able to take the pins out and possibly still give the ball to the dog but she was surprised to find that there were broken up pieces inside the ball. ‘It was definitely deliberate, I honestly think it was made to harm.’ She took a photo straight away and uploaded it on her Facebook page. She then shared it with animal welfare pages in the area to alert people in case there were more of the 'dangerous' balls out there. ‘It is something I would want to be aware of so I posted it on my page and then shared it to Paw Justice , RSPCA and anything else I could think of’ ‘It is something I would want to be aware of so I posted it on my page and then shared it to Paw Justice, RSPCA and anything else I could think of,’ she said. ‘I knew they all get a lot of attention and the post had over 12 thousand likes in only 12 hours.’ While Ms Peters was initially concerned about the welfare of animals in the area, she said she ‘quickly started to thinking about people’s kids’ as the ball was found in close proximity to ‘two or three’ schools. Ms Peters said she walks her dog Odin in the same park she made the troubling discovery . Ms Peters said that while some people thought the ball was 'harmless', the majority of online responders were appalled someone could be ‘irresponsible’ enough to leave a ‘weapon’ like this around . ‘Even if you don’t have a dog, you might have a child and imagine if they got their hands on it.’ Ms Peters said while some people thought the ball was 'harmless', the majority of online responders were appalled someone could be ‘irresponsible’ enough to leave a ‘weapon’ like this around. ‘Everyone is disgusted, sickened and generally really worried but I guess it is a good thing that people now know to be careful.’ Online responders were quick to condemn the 'disturbing' behaviour . Ms Peters said she has walked her one-year-old puppy in the same park she made the troubling discovery in. ‘He is like many dogs; they see a ball and just go “Yay a toy!”,’ she explained. ‘You train your dog to think like that and it could turn out they pick up something that’s been turned into a weapon. It’s scary.’ The 22-year old warehouse worker said she is extremely passionate about animals and would love to make them her life's work. Ms Peters said she is proud she could make a difference in her community by notifying others of her discovery. ‘I feel like I've made my neighbourhood a little safer.'

"Announcing your big vacation on Facebook or posting a series of beach-selfies while you're away can be the highlight of a holiday for some. But sunseekers are being warned that it could also invalidate their home insurance if they get burgled while they are away. Insurers are increasingly checking people's social media accounts following a break-in to see if they announced they would be away from the property, and are using it as a reason not to pay out. Holidaymakers who announce they are going on a two-week trip or regularly post selfies from the beach on Facebook while they are away could find their insurer refusing to pay out if they are burgled . This is because most insurers have a 'reasonable care' clause, meaning firms don't have to offer up cash if they can prove people weren't careful enough in protecting their possessions. In the past this was used in cases of burglary where doors or windows were left unlocked or open, but increasingly it is being used against holidaymakers who advertise their vacation online. Police forces have repeatedly warned that would-be thieves will check social media to see whether property owners have said they will be away, before striking while nobody is home. According to The Sun, families that post pictures of themselves on sun loungers, or announce they are on the first day of a two-week trip could be deemed to be helping criminals. Most firms include 'reasonable care' clause in contracts, meaning they are not liable if people did not protect their property, and are now using against people who advertise breaks online . Police have repeatedly warned that would-be thieves will often check social networks in order to establish that people are out of their homes before striking . A spokesman for the Financial Ombudsman Service said: 'It's possible that your insurance cover could be affected if you explicitly announce your plans on social media. 'You wouldn't put a poster up on your front lawn saying you're going on holiday.' The Association of British Insurers also warned home owners to 'think carefully about what you put on social media'.","Insurers often check accounts of those burgled while they were away .

"Warren Sapp was charged with soliciting prostitution and two counts of assault in February . Warren Sapp made many highlight-reel plays during the course of his Hall of Fame career, but the former NFL star might be better remembered for his off-field exploits thanks to a new video. Sapp was arrested the night after the Super Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona, on a prostitution charge after an alleged incident involving two women. In a police video released on Monday, Sapp, 42, cries, cackles and confesses about what exactly went down back on February 2 in the Renaissance Hotel. In the video obtained by TMZ, Sapp admits he paid for oral sex and that 'everyone got naked' after he 'put $600 on the table' in his hotel room. The two women who were arrested along with Sapp were Britney Osbourne, 23, and 34-year-old Quying Boyd. Sapp continued: 'We're in the bed and I start taking pictures of the two ladies naked and doing what they're doing. 'So I'm taking pictures because I'm silly like that sometimes.' Scroll down for video  (WARNING: Graphic and sexually-explicit content) In a police video released on Monday, Sapp, cries, cackles and confesses during his prostitution arrest . Britney Osbourne, 23 (left), and Quying Boyd, 34 (right), were both arrested in Phoenix along with Sapp . The incident allegedly took place very early on February 2 at the Renaissance Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona . He told police one of them began performing oral sex on him - they stayed safe and used a condom - but the other annoyed him by chatting. When it became too much, Sapp told her: 'Why don't you use your mouth on me, instead of using it. 'Just go. Just move. Your girl’s doing a good job. I’ll be done with her in a minute.’ After Sapp asked to have sex, the woman who was performing oral sex asked for a tip. That request apparently prompted an argument and the first video of the interview ended. In surveillance video that was taken in the hotel lobby, Sapp (left) can be seen walking and talking with a man . In the second clip, Sapp is informed he will be going to jail and then left alone in the room. He began repeating, 'Oh my God. Oh my God' before asking: 'Are you kidding me?' In between cackles and sobs, Sapp added: 'I'm going to be booked as a John. 'I gotta go to jail?' Police became involved after a female contacted them and said she had been assaulted. Both women had minor injuries that were consistent with a struggle, but Sapp denied he assaulted them. Sapp was fired from his job at the NFL network and could get six months in jail and three years probation if he is convicted. He was charged with soliciting prostitution and two counts of assault. Sapp was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. He is 42 . Osbourne is facing a prostitution charge of her own while Boyd was cited for failure to register with the state as an escort. They have both denied the charges. Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders. He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. In recent years, Sapp, a divorced father of two, has been struggling with financial problems, which culminated in 2012 when he filed for bankruptcy. In November of that year, the Super Bowl champion was forced to sell his  home in Florida for $2.1million. Months earlier, Sapp auctioned off a 240-pair collection of rare Air Jordan sneakers worth $6,500 to pay his creditors. Sapp has yet to comment on the video.","Warren Sapp was arrested night after the Super Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona .

In the video, the man is seen pulling the five puppies from a cardboard box recovered from the back of the van and flinging them over the fence in a manner that makes it unlikely that they landed on their feet. 'Luckily he didn't break their legs, or concussion, break a neck,' Kay Hill, director for The Pet Place, told KSLA. Hill said all five of the puppies are healthy and were not injured.

"Manchester Airport bosses are investigating after passengers on a Ryanair flight were allowed to walk through a deserted passport control unchecked. Holidaymakers onboard the delayed flight from Madrid to Manchester had been due to land at 11.25pm on Friday. But by the time they finally arrived three hours later, they disembarked to find an empty arrivals hall at Terminal 3. Scroll down for video . Passengers from the delayed Ryanair flight from Madrid to Manchester were able to simply walk past empty security cubicles . Passengers claim they were not asked for their passport or any other documents but were able to simply stroll past the empty security cubicles. Schoolteacher Clinton Lakin, 46, told the Daily Mirror: 'Every passenger on that plane walked through without a passport check in Britain. 'The only passport check was done at Madrid Airport. 'My concern is we still have the Ebola crisis in Africa and any one of those people who were coming in via Madrid could have been travelling from places where potentially Ebola could have been passed on,' he added. 'And also there is the fact that anybody is walking into the country. You are told that your taxes go to protecting UK borders.' Border Force  claim that a number of passengers were checked by officers on their arrival into Manchester Airport. The agency said that anyone not assessed at the airport had been subsequently checked on their systems. Far from being a one-off, a former airport worker, who would not be named, claimed arriving passengers are frequently unchecked. He even claimed that on one occasion,the border agent manning the passport kiosk and making decisions on passenger entry was actually an illegal immigrant. Holidaymakers were not asked for documents but were allowed to walk through a deserted passport control unchecked . Schoolteacher Clinton Lakin, 46, called the lack of security ludicrous and said 'Every passenger on that plane walked through without a passport check in Britain.'The only passport check was done at Madrid Airport' Mr Lakin, from Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, called the lack of security  'ludicrous.' 'If your plane is delayed and it is that time of night and the airport is closed, then you can just walk into the country, anybody, 130 people. 'Nobody was there, no checks were made. It just seems ludicrous.' 'I did not see a single member of airport staff once we got into the building until we got through to where Costa Coffee is in the arrivals. 'I wanted to report to somebody in the airport that there had been this breach of security.' Manchester Airport said it was down to the airline or its handling agent to inform UK Border Force of their arrivals. But  Ryanair said the airline had attempted to update security at the airport of the plane's arrival at its usual 30-minute intervals but had been unable to do so due to a malfunction of the airport's operating systems. Deserted: Passengers are left to make their own way out of the empty terminal at Manchester Airport . Mr Lakin claimed he did not see a 'single member of airport staff' until he got through to the arrivals lounge . A spokesman said: 'All regular operating procedures were followed and the flight times were updated approximately every 30 minutes. 'There appears to have been a malfunction in the airport's system, which caused incorrect flight information to be published, and subsequently resulted in this issue at border control. We have asked Manchester Airport to look into this matter and ensure it does not recur.' However, the airport said its system 'operated as normal on the night in question.' The Home Office confirmed the Border Force Agency is investigating the incident but added it was the legal responsibility of the airline or handling company to advise them when inbound flights arrive and to present the passengers to their officers. 'We are currently carrying out an investigation into this incident,' a spokesman added. A Manchester Airport spokesman said: 'It is the responsibility of an airline's handling agent to notify UK Border Force about arrivals from outside of the UK - not the airport. 'By them doing this in advance of a flight's arrival, ensures the relevant UKBF staff is in place to handle the immigration process. 'We are continuing to work with our partners to investigate the situation but can confirm the airport's system operated as normal on the night in question.'

"David Cameron today accused the BBC of peddling ‘b*******’ after claiming his favourite sport was foxhunting. The Tory leader hit back at presenter Andrew Marr, after being left baffled by questions during an interview on Sunday. It came as Mr Cameron turned the clock back to ape John Major’s election soapbox by climbing on to a wooden pallet to address the party faithful, but ended up being heckled by someone claiming ‘the NHS is dying’. David Cameron today turned the clock back to ape John Major’s election soapbox by climbing on to a wooden pallet to address the party faithful . Mr Cameron promised at the weekend that he would ‘take to the streets’ to defend the Tory record and urge voters to reject both Labour and Ukip. He said he had ‘upped the tempo’ to make the case that his economic plan is working. But he took time out from the campaign today to escalate his row with the BBC after appearing on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday morning. Marr claimed the PM recently told the Countryside Alliance magazine that his favourite sport was fox hunting. ‘Is that really true?’ he asked. Mr Cameron replied: ‘No, I am a believer in…’ But Marr interrupted again: ‘You said it’s my favourite sport which I love.’ Again Mr Cameron insisted: ‘No I love walking, I love fishing, I love all sorts of sports.’ On the campaign trail in Yorkshire, Mr Cameron hit back at the BBC for claiming he had said foxhunting is his favourite sport . The Tory leader was heckled as he addressed party activists and workers from Decorative Panels during a campaign visit to Calder Valley . But in an article for the magazine, Mr Cameron actually said: ‘I have always been a strong supporter of country sports. ‘It is my firm belief that people should have the freedom to hunt, so I share the frustration that many people feel about the Hunting Act and the way it was brought in by the last government.’ Marr later admitted on Twitter that he had made an error: ‘Honest mistake – I was wrong – sorry. Cock up not conspiracy, but wrong on my part.’ Today Mr Cameron revealed how he thought it was wrong at the time of the interiview.

"Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk insists their season will still be a success if they clinch the Scottish Premiership title. Manager Ronny Deila had targeted the treble in his first season but that dream ended in controversial fashion with a 3-2 William Hill Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Inverness on Sunday. Deila started with a disastrous Champions League qualifying campaign when Celtic were knocked out by both Legia Warsaw and Maribor, but went on to impress in the Europa League and domestic scene with the League Cup already in the trophy cabinet following an absence of six years. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk celebrates with his team-mates after scoring in the Scottish Cup semi-final . Van Dijk, who scored Celtic's opener against Inverness, wants his side to bounce back and win the SPL title . And Van Dijk is now looking to wrap up the title in style to get over his Hampden disappointment. Celtic can reopen an eight-point lead over Aberdeen by winning at Dundee on Wednesday night ahead of the post-split fixtures. 'If we win the league we still improve from last year,' Van Dijk said. 'We want to win it as soon as possible and that starts on Wednesday. 'The disappointment is very high, everybody is down but we are professionals and we need to focus on Dundee. 'We need to move on. Wednesday night at Dundee is a big game, so we need to be ready for that.' Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths accused the match officials of robbing them a cup final appearance after they failed to spot his goal-bound header being stopped by the hand of Inverness defender Josh Meekings when the Hoops were leading 1-0. But Van Dijk refused to dwell on the blunder by referee Steven McLean and additional assistant Alan Muir, who was five yards away. When asked about the penalty claim, the Dutch defender said: 'It didn't happen so we can't talk about it.

'It should have been a key moment but it didn't happen so there is nothing to talk about. We lost and we are very disappointed.' Van Dijk opened the scoring at Hampden when he curled a free-kick in off the post but he and Jason Denayer were given a tough afternoon by the pacy Marley Watkins and powerful Edward Ofere, who scored Caley Thistle's second goal. 'We gave everything,' he said. 'With 10 men we kept on fighting. We had quality to score a goal but unfortunately it wasn't enough.'

"This is the moment a driver deliberately blocked a sneaky motorist who tried to beat a traffic jam with an undertaking manoeuvre. Traffic had started to build up on the M58 around Switch Island on Merseyside, with one motorist filming the gridlock on a dashcam. But one driver in a silver Mercedes obviously wasn't prepared to wait in the queuing traffic on the outside lane, where vehicles were merging. Traffic began to build up on the M58 around Switch Island in Merseyside when a silver Mercedes attempted to undertake the trafffic . But a Renault driver wasn't happy and pulled into the inside lane to block the Mercedes from moving forwards . He attempted to sail up the inside lane in a sneaky bid to avoid having to wait. But to his shock, a silver Renault then pulls into the inside lane to block the Mercedes from advancing any further. Not content with having to wait, the Mercedes driver the tries to both overtake and undertake the Renault in an attempt to get past the vehicle. The two cars then swerve around the lane as the Renault stays determined in not letting the Mercedes past . The Mercedes, behind, is then forced to wait like the rest of the drivers, for 10 minutes as they approach an roundabout . But each time he tries, the Renault swerves in the lane blocking the Mercedes from passing. The swerving goes back and forwards for over a minute before both drivers wind down their windows to confront each other. The pair can be seen pointing and shouting at each other but despite their argument, neither driver lets up. Eventually the Mercedes driver catches up to the Renault with the man shouting and pointing at the Renault driver . This then forces the Mercedes to wait 10 minutes in the queue like everybody else before moving back into the correct lane as they approach a roundabout. The incident was captured on a dashcam by a passing motorist and posted to Youtube by a user called Lancashire Dashcam.

"Having been on the receiving end of a 6-1 thumping, a defeat like that could be justifiably met with a backlash by angry supporters. Watching a 3-1 first leg aggregate advantage turn into a 7-4 deficit come the end of the reverse encounter too could send many fans apoplectic at the capitulation of their side. However that doesn't appear the case for those devoted to Porto. Porto supporters gave their team a hero's welcome following their 6-1 defeat at Bayern Munich on Tuesday .

On their return from a humiliating Champions League quarter-final loss at the hands of Bayern Munich on Tuesday night, the squad were given a heroes reception as they arrived back in Portugal. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, fans mobbed the squad congratulating them on their run in the tournament. Star striker Jackson Martinez and Ricardo Quaresma were one of many Porto players who looked perplexed as they were hugged by fans before they making their way on to the team bus - set upon a cacophony of fiercely-proud chanting. It was the first time that Porto, who had been unbeaten in this season's tournament up until Tuesday night, had reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League since the 2008-09 season. Goals from Thomas Muller, Thiago Alcantara, Jerome Boateng, Xabi Alonso and a double from Robert Lewandowski saw Bayern win the tie emphatically - despite Martinez's second half header giving the visitors some hope in the second leg. 'We didn't play well in the second half and we conceded an early goal,' Porto coach Julen Lopetegui admitted after the match. 'Bayern is one of the best teams in the world and the favourite to win the title... We knew they would come down the sides and we tried to prevent their attacks but we failed.

"Raheem Sterling is at the centre of a second drugs controversy after the Liverpool forward was videoed passing out after inhaling nitrous oxide. The England international, who was also exposed on Sunday after he was caught puffing on a shisha pipe, will face at club investigation over why he was taking the legal high, which is also known as ‘hippy crack’. In the footage Sterling is seen sucking on an orange balloon then laughing and giggling before he asks one of his friends to give him another hit. Raheem Sterling has been filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - also known as 'hippy crack' The video shows him smiling and breathing in gas from a balloon before apparently passing out . When the camera pans back to the 20-year-old, he is either unconscious or has fallen asleep. It is claimed that the video, obtained by The Sun,  was taken at his home in Southport in the days before a game. Nitrous oxide starves the brain of oxygen and makes users feel light-headed and dizzy. Sterling scored in last night’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle United but he also missed a chance from six yards in the 56th minute and could now face disciplinary action after his second indiscretion in the space of 24 hours. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling can be seen pictured on social media whilst smoking a shisha pipe . Sterling scored the opening goal in Monday night’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle . Nitrous Oxide, has been nicknamed ‘laughing gas’ due to the euphoric and relaxed feeling people who inhale it can sometimes feel. The gas is normally bought in pressured canisters, commonly transferred to a container, e.g. a balloon, from which the gas is inhaled. Nitrous oxide is not illegal to possess, but this doesn’t mean that it is safe to use. The effects of nitrous oxide vary depending on how much has been inhaled but they include: . • Feelings of euphoria, relaxation and calmness. • Dizziness, difficulty in thinking straight and fits of giggles/laughter. • Sound distortions or even hallucinations. • In some people, a headache can be an unwanted immediate effect. Risks include: . • Unconsciousness or death from lack of oxygen. This occurs when the available oxygen for breathing is effectively pushed out by the nitrous oxide. A Liverpool spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the story and intend to speak to the player. Any subsequent action will be taken internally.’ Sportsmail contacted Sterling’s agent, Aidy Ward, last night. He refused to comment on the story but did not deny that it was his client. A small pocket of Liverpool fans on The Kop vented their frustrations at last night’s game, chanting ‘Raheem Sterling, your agent’s a k***’ during the first half. They were widely applauded. Asked if he will be reminding Sterling of his responsibilities, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: ‘I will do. He’s a young kid who has been in the spotlight now so he knows the demands of being a top class professional — it’s not just on the field it’s off the field, but I will speak with him on it and we’ll move on.’ Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool captain Jamie Carragher said: ‘In years to come he’ll look back over this period now as a massive learning curve. When you’re a 20-year-old kid, you make mistakes. I did, I’m sure we all do. It’s just important that he learns from it because Raheem Sterling needs to be on the back pages, not the front pages and that’s a problem for him in these last few months.’ Players' union chief Bobby Barnes called for understanding after Sterling 'made a mistake'. Barnes, deputy chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association and European president of the international players' union FIFPro, said people should not be too hard on Sterling. He said: 'Nobody would condone the use of these types of substances whether legal or otherwise as footballers are seen as role models. It does send a message to young people that if it's good enough for footballers then it's good enough for them and that is not desirable. The 20-year-old recently snubbed a £100,000-a-week contract offer from the Merseyside club . 'But you have to bear in mind that we ask an awful lot of young players growing up in the public eye. Many of us look back at things we have done in our teens and early 20s and wish we hadn't done them. 'He's made a mistake and people are human. I am sure this will be a minor blip on his path to a fantastic career. 'Players have to be aware that there is camera on every corner - they are very much in the spotlight. 'He's a young man, growing up in public eye and he's made a mistake. Let's not be too hard on the boy. He is under a lot of pressure and people think because he has a lot of talent he's also supposed to have diplomacy and wisdom. 'In the main he's doing a very good job, he's at a good club and has a good manager and I'm sure Brendan will put his arm around him and at the same time make him aware of his responsibilities.' Nitrous oxide has been nicknamed ‘laughing gas’ due to the euphoric and relaxed feeling people who inhale it can sometimes feel. Official figures show 460,000 16-24 years olds took it last year. Brendan Rodgers has backed his wayward star but contract stand-off has created tension at Liverpool . It has been the cause of 17 deaths since 2006. It costs around £2 to buy and is not illegal to possess — Sterling is not the first footballer to be caught indulging. Drugs charity Re-Solv has called on the 'role model' player to condemn the use of the drug to deter young supporters from taking risks with their health. The anti-drugs organisation's spokesman, Stephen Ream, told MailOnline: 'It's very disappointing from our point of view. He is a big role model and we hate to see this kind of stuff from someone of his status. 'Players in similar situations in the past have come out and apologised and we hope he does the same. 'Nitrous Oxide is not the most dangerous drug out there but there are deaths attached to it. There are risks and we would urge anyone tempted to take it not to do so.' Tottenham defender Kyle Walker was pictured inhaling a balloon in 2013, while last year Saido Berahino was pictured doing it at the wheel of his Range Rover. In February, Jack Wilshere faced criticism after he was pictured with a shisha pipe on a night out while recovering from ankle surgery. But the Arsenal star, who has previously been pictured smoking cigarettes, was defended by England manager Roy Hodgson who said he'd tried the Middle Eastern pipe himself and did not think it was a problem. The past two months have proved to be a tempestuous period in Sterling’s fledgling career and the revelations of the past two days have ensured extra scrutiny.

Sterling’s contract stand-off with Liverpool has created tension and he was heckled at the launch of the club’s new kit last week. He has turned down a deal worth around £100,000 per week and does not want to resume negotiations until the end of the season. Sterling infuriated Liverpool at the start of the month when he gave an interview to the BBC —without permission — to talk about his contract stand-off and why he did not want to be perceived as a ‘greedy 20-year-old’.","Raheem Sterling at the centre of a second drugs controversy .

"A farmer from eastern China has found himself the talk of the country after one of his goats gave birth to a kid with six legs. The 20-day-old 'spider goat' - as it has been (inaccurately) nicknamed by Chinese web users - was born with four forelegs and two hind legs. Xiao Qibin, owner of the farm, said the baby goat is growing quickly and healthily with 'an extraordinary appetite', the People's Daily Online reports. Rare: This six-legged kid has become a star animal in China since it was born 20 days ago . Mr Xiao started running his goat farm in Chaohu in Anhui Province about a year ago and owns more than 400 goats. 'During the labour, I saw the nanny goat was having difficulty,' said Mr Xiao. 'I saw two legs came out at first, but surprisingly another four followed when the kid was fully born,' he added. Mr Xiao said at first he wasn't sure if the mutant goat - which weighed 5kg at birth - would survive. However, the kid is healthy and growing quickly - and has become one of the most playful goats on the farm. 'He can eat a lot,' added the farmer. Playful:  Miss Ge, an employee at Xiao Qibin's farm, takes care of the playful baby goat every day . The kid's six legs were of similar length initially, but as he grew two of the forelegs became shorter than the rest and can no longer touch the ground. Mr Xiao said the six-legged kid was born to two normal 'lake goats' and he was puzzled as to what caused the mutation. He said he will not take the kid to the vet to remove the two extra legs. 'I want him to grow up naturally and happily,' said Mr Xiao.

"Two teenage boys reportedly stabbed a third to death after arguing about their mobile phones - then killed four girl pals they were with so they couldn't tell police about the murder. Sergey Burkaev, 16, and Konstantin Surkov, 17, are said to have raped their last victim before slitting her throat. The vodka-fuelled duo doused all five bodies in petrol and set them alight at a flat in south-west Russia, according to prosecutors. Scroll down for video . Accused of murder and rape: Sergey Burkaev, 16 (left) and Konstantin Surkov, 17, could be jailed for life . Slain at a party: Russian police released pixellated images of some of the victims, who were aged 16 to 22 . The baby-faced pair apparently fled in a stolen car but were arrested by traffic officers, who saw the vehicle being driven erratically. If convicted, Surkov and Burkaev face life in jail. The police who quizzed them say both teenagers have confessed to the murders and rape. The only reason they have given for the carnage was that they were drunk, the officers added. The horrific crimes reportedly took place at a house party in the small town of Kumertau in Bashkortostan on Friday night. A friend of party-goers - 17-year-old Svetlana Frolova - said: 'I just can't believe this has happened. They were all so friendly with each other and always hanging out together. 'I had been invited (to the party) too, and had really wanted to go, but my mum said I had to stay in to do my homework. I'm so glad I did. I can't understand why they did this.'

Boozed-up Surkov and Burkaev are said to have accused fellow party guest Sidor Fokine, 22, of stealing their mobile phones. When he denied it, they flew into a rage and pulled out their knives. Then they knifed him in front of the other guests - who were all female. But they feared that the young women would identify them as the killers.

'Milner is a phenomenon, a guy with big balls and a heart this big,' said Pellegrini. 'I hope he stays. If he doesn’t, it will be because there’s an important offer [from elsewhere].' Milner though has made just 13 Premier League starts from 31 games - less than Jesus Navas, Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri, Fernandinho and Fernando - and wants more regular football. Brendan Rodgers is keen for Milner, pictured in 2012, to help fill the void left by the outgoing Steven Gerrard . Liverpool began their pursuit of Milner almost 12 months ago and a move to Merseyside would tick many boxes. Milner would not have to uproot his young family from their home in Hale and would be offered the chance to play in his favoured central midfield position. As a free transfer, he will command a deal that matches or exceeds his current £120,000 a week salary at City. Arsenal and Everton have also expressed interest while Inter Milan, Roma and Valencia are also in the race for his signature. Milner will not make a firm choice though until after City’s final game of the campaign against Southampton for what could be the last major contract of his career.","Manchester City midfielder James Milner is out of contract in the summer .

"Serie A champions Juventus want to strengthen their attacking options this summer with a big-money move for PSG striker Edinson Cavani, according to a report in Italy. Corriere dello Sport claim that Juve have a plan in place to sign the in-demand Uruguayan as they look to partner him with fellow South American Carlos Tevez. Cavani, who played for Italian sides Palermo and Napoli before joining PSG in a £50million deal in 2013, has admitted his frustration at being played out of position under Laurent Blanc. PSG striker Edinson Cavani (left) is a target for Juventus according to Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport . Manchester United also hold an interest in Cavani, pictured in action against Marseille last weekend . He told Canal Plus: 'The only concern that I have ever spoken about is that I was recruited to play as a striker with (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic and it has not always been the case. 'There is a long series of games where I have not scored in Ligue 1 but that can happen. In France, people judge me as a lone striker, but I do not play in that position.' Former Manchester United boss David Moyes attempted to sign Cavani before he joined PSG and the Old Trafford club remain interested in acquiring him when the transfer window reopens. Louis van Gaal is hoping to bring two new strikers to Old Trafford this summer with Radamel Falcao unlikely to turn his loan move into a permanent one and Robin van Persie being eyed by both Juve and Inter Milan. United appear to have an advantage over Juventus in their pursuit of Cavani after the player's agent, Claudio Anelucci, admitted that a move to England or Spain was most likely.

He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'Is Cavani on the market? At this point it's a little early to say. 'Edi is under contract at Paris Saint-Germain and there are several factors that come into play with respect to his future.' 'Once the situation is clarified there are several different scenarios given that players like him, at his level of maturity, are coveted by the biggest clubs in Europe. 'The market would seem to suggest Spain or England - we can't say at the present time that an Italian club could participate in the bidding for Cavani.'","Juventus want PSG's Edinson Cavani according to Corriere dello Sport .

"Chelsea have made an offer for FC Tokyo's 22-year-old forward Yoshinori Muto, according to club president Naoki Ogane. The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the £200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February.

He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue.

"Siem de Jong is on track to play a part in Newcastle's Barclays Premier League clash with Swansea after taking another step towards ending his eight-month injury nightmare. The 26-year-old Holland international midfielder played 72 minutes for the club's Under-21s and set up striker Adam Armstrong for the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory at Aston Villa on Monday evening. It was his second appearance for Peter Beardsley's side since recovering from surgery to repair a collapsed lung and while he admits he is still short of match fitness, he is in contention for a seat on the bench at St James' Park on Saturday if head coach John Carver requires him. Siem de Jong, pictured in Newcastle training last week, played 72 minutes for the U21s on Tuesday . De Jong has only made one league start this season but hopes to be involved in first-team again soon . De Jong told nufcTV: 'The plan always was to be part of that game, to be on the bench. I played 72, 73 minutes and hopefully I can be part of the team next week. 'We will see what happens. I don't think I could play 90 minutes yet, especially not on a level higher, so we will have to build it up and see how it goes.' De Jong, a £6million summer signing from Ajax, has made only three senior appearances and just a single league start for the club after first suffering a serious thigh injury and then being laid low by a recurrence of a lung problem. His battle for fitness has proved both gruelling and frustrating, and he is already looking forward to the start of the new campaign and launching his Magpies career in earnest. He said: 'It's getting a little bit better. I still feel that it just improves every day, but I still need to keep on improving. I feel it in the power training, but also on the field and in the game. 'I just need to get a few more games in, and I think that will hopefully be a couple of games his season, otherwise start again good next season from pre-season on.' The Dutchman was a £6m summer signing from Ajax but has struggled with injuries . De Jong was signed to help provide a link between midfield and attack and the kind of invention he provides has been sadly lacking for much of the campaign, particularly in recent weeks as a run of six successive league defeats has left Newcastle too close for comfort to the relegation zone. Victory - something they have not tasted since February 28 - over the Swans on Saturday would go a long way towards erasing any fears of being sucked into trouble, although with many fans in open rebellion over owner Mike Ashley's stewardship, it may do little to ease the tension on Tyneside.","Siem de Jong set up Adam Armstrong for winner in 2-1 Aston Villa win .

"Liverpool must stick with manager Brendan Rodgers as he is the right man to take the club forward, believes former Reds' striker Stan Collymore. Rodgers has come under-fire following a disappointing third season with the Anfield outfit - which has led to some unhappy fans calling for his dismissal. Not since the 1950 has a previous Liverpool manager  gone three campaigns without a trophy, but that is the unwanted fate that will meet the 42-year-old at the end of this term. Liverpool must keep faith with under-fire manager Brendan Rodgers, believes ex-Kop striker Stan Collymore . The Reds' FA Cup semi-final exit against Aston Villa on Sunday followed defeat at the same stage of the Capital One Cup by Chelsea. A season of false hope was compounded further as the club failed to progress past the Champions League group stages and were then dumped out of the Europa League on penalties. To make for a gloomier outlook, the Merseysiders' hopes of a top four spot seem remote - as they trail fourth-placed Manchester City by seven points with six games remaining. Liverpool's fortunes are in stark contrast to last season when they came agonisingly close to being crowned champions of England for the first time since 1990. And speaking on TalkSPORT, Collymore is adamant that Rodgers is still the correct figure to make the Reds a force to be reckoned with once more. 'I believe Liverpool should have patience with Brendan Rodgers,'  the Kick Off host said. Rodgers (right) saw his team dumped out of the FA Cup semi-finals by Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday . 'The reasons are quite simple: He is a very good coach, he has a proven track record - going back to Chelsea under Jose Mourinho - of promoting youth, developing youth and giving them an opportunity. 'What he didn't have, having been at two smaller clubs in Swansea City and Reading, is a track record of spending big money, which he needs to do to take Liverpool onto the next level. 'But, he took Liverpool to two semi-finals this season and they were within a whisker of winning the Premier League title for the first time ever last season.

"Sixth-seeded Tomas Berdych overwhelmed Gael Monfis 6-1, 6-4 Saturday to reach the final of the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time. Berdych immediately took control from the baseline and Monfils struggled to cope with the fast pace imposed by the big-hitting Czech. Monfils won just 11 points in a lopsided first set before the Frenchman changed his strategy, using more sliced shots to break up his opponent's rhythm. Tomas Berdych has reached the Monte Carlo Masters final for the first time in his career . The sixth-seed defeated Frenchman Gael Monfis 6-1, 6-4 on Saturday to secure his place in the final . The move paid off early in the second set when Monfils broke back to level at 1-1 as Berdych made two forehand errors. Monfils failed to build on the momentum, though, dropping his next service game as his hopes of becoming the first French player in 15 years to make the final at the Country Club vanished. 'It's always difficult when I'm up against Tomas, I can't find the proper way to play him,' said the 14th-seeded Monfils after his sixth loss in seven matches against the Czech. 'Hopefully I'll find the solution one day.' Monfils, who was a wild-card entry this week after recovering from a hip injury sooner than expected, added that his poor percentage on his first serve was a decisive factor. 'But even when I served well, he was returning hard and deep,' Monfils said. 'He reads my serve very well.' Chasing a second Masters title 10 years after he made his breakthrough at the Paris Masters, Berdych will face either Rafael Nadal or top-ranked Novak Djokovic in the final.

"Frankie Dettori will be left to focus on the British Flat season this summer after boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani signed up Gregory Benoist to ride the horses which race under his Al Shaqab banner in France. The only exception will be Sheik Joaan’s dual Arc winner Treve, who will continue to be partnered by veteran Thierry Jarnet. Benoist is the only jockey to have ridden Elie Lellouche-trained Ectot, who was unplaced for Al Shaqab in last year’s Arc having gone into the race one of the leading fancies having won the Prix Niel. Frankie Dettori is to concentrate on the British flat season and not being picked to ride in France . The recruitment of Benoist could be seen as a snub for Dettori, who was replaced by Jarnet on Treve in the build-up to her Arc success. But Herbert insisted it was no longer logistically feasible to have one jockey covering both countries because Sheik Joaan’s operation has expanded so much. Herbert said: ‘Last season it was feasible to keep travelling back and forth across the Channel but we have more horses this year – 80 in France and almost 100 in Britain. ‘It makes more sense to have a jockey based over there. Gregory Benoist is the rider signed up to race the Al Shaqab banner in France this summer . ‘Frankie is happy with it and he will still ride British horses which we send to run in France. ‘The contract has literally been signed today. We have a very good relationship with Gregory. Thierry Jarnet will still ride Treve- there is no point breaking up a partnership that works.’ Dettori finished third on Al Shaqab’s Moheet in yesterday’s Novae Bloodstock Craven Stakes at Newmarket. The Richard Hannon-trained colt, which had won its only previous race at Salisbury last year, showed signs of inexperience in a tactical affair won by his Richard Hughes-ridden, front-running stablemate Kool Kompany. Hannon, who runs both Ivawood and Estidhkaar in tomorrow’s Greenham Stakes at Newbury, said both his Craven colts could run in the Guineas but, interestingly, Hughes hinted that either the German or French versions, both run around a bend as opposed to a straight course, might suit length and a quarter winner Kool Kompany best. Sheikh Joaan Al Thani (centre) chose not to go with Dettori and insists that he's happy with his choice . Most significant Guineas action possibly took place before racing started on the Rowley Mile when Charlie Hills-trained Acomb Stakes winner Connection put in a decent gallop under William Buick, who Hills hopes will ride his colt in the Classic back here on May 2. Retiring champion jump jockey AP McCoy was unplaced on his final ride at Cheltenham when Milan Bound finished seventh in the handicap hurdle won by Aqalim. McCoy rides at Ayr for the next two days, including the mount on Paul Nicholls-trained Benvolio in Friday's Scottish National. It is then likely he will not ride again until bowing out from the sport at Sandown’s end-of-season meeting on Saturday.

"This will prove yet another bitter pill for Saracens to swallow. The hurt of losing back-to-back European and domestic finals last year took Mark McCall’s men all of last summer and a good chunk of this season to overcome. This time they must lick their wounds and refocus their efforts on the Aviva Premiership after coming up short against Clermont. Clermont warm up in front of their supporters at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne . Clermont centre Wesley Fofana attempts an offload following a crunching hit from Marcelo Bosch . Saracens flanker Maro Itojie secures a loose ball on the deck during a tight first half of action . There should be no shame in this defeat. Whereas Northampton capitulated embarrassingly against the same opponents a fortnight ago, Saracens stood tall on Saturday. Saracens’ long-suffering chairman Nigel Wray, who has pumped tens of millions of pounds into this club over the past two decades, took the opportunity on Saturday morning to repeat his conviction that English clubs will never be able to compete with French teams if the domestic salary cap is not raised. But it can only be a matter of time before Saracens deliver. With five of their starting pack under the age of 24 — all English qualified — they have forwards who will surely develop into a world-class outfit. Twenty-year-old Maro Itoje was impressive making his first start in Europe, while the Vunipola brothers were magnificent. Ultimately the better side won, and Clermont will head into their second European final confident they can land their first European title. Saracens pressurised Clermont with the same fierce defence that knocked them so spectacularly off their stride in last year’s semi-final at Twickenham. Sarries No 8 Billy Vunipola makes a strong run as Radosavljevic tries to halt his progress . The difference this time was that Clermont knew what was coming and were able to keep their wits about them, buoyed by a partisan crowd. ‘I’ve never experienced an atmosphere like that,’ said McCall. ’The effort and many aspects of our performance were phenomenal. We made Clermont play a a game they didn’t want to play. The game was on a knife edge with 10 minutes to go but games like that are decided by small margins.’ As evidence of their dominance, Clermont will point to Wesley Fofana’s superbly taken second-half try and a 19th-minute incident which saw Naipolini Nalaga denied what should have been a penalty try. Chris Ashton knocked him into touch without attempting to wrap his arms around him. Saracens full back Alex Goode tries to sidestep Clermont scrum half Ludovic Radosavljevic . But, had Jacques Burger been able to cling on to a knock-on from Nalaga with less than 10 minutes on the clock after Richard Wigglesworth’s superb chase and tackle of Alex Goode’s clearance, Saracens could so easily have won this game. It is hard to comprehend how the club will pick themselves up from yet another shattering defeat to deliver domestic silverware. But, after winning at Racing Metro in the quarter final while watching Premiership rivals Northampton capitulate to Clermont two weeks ago, McCall’s men still have every chance of delivering a trophy this season. ‘It won’t deter us from our goal,’ insisted Wigglesworth, who is playing the best rugby of his career. Richard Wigglesworth feeds the ball into a Saracens scrum as referee George Clancy watches on . ‘It’s easy to focus on the negatives when we have just lost a game like that. But we’re unbelievably proud of that performance and we’ve got a week to rest out battered bodies and go again.’ Saracens face Northampton at Stadium MK next Saturday, before having the following weekend off when they will watch on enviously as Clermont contest the Champions Cup final at Twickenham against either Leinster or Toulon, who will go head to head on Sunday. But on reflection, Saracens will be buoyed by this performance. Itoje is a rare prospect capable of explosive bursts of power and hugely athletic around the field while Billy and Mako Vunipola are two of the most destructive carriers in Europe. They have both returned to their best following a slow start to the season, while Saracens scrum is also in fine shape. Saracens fly half Charlie Hodgson clears his lines under pressure from the Clermont defence . Charlie Hodgson missed two critical long-range penalties on Saturday but the veteran fly half has been magnificent this season and the second-half appearance of Owen Farrell from the bench saw the England No 10 make his first appearance since rupturing knee ligaments in January. With Schalk Britz and Brad Barritt both fit again, only the absence of Captain Alistair Hargreaves with concussion-related symptoms weakens McCall’s squad. They will hurt from this no doubt. But in the cold light of day, Saracens will realise many of their boys became men on Saturday. The future remains bright for them on the field.","Saracens lead 6-3 at the break thanks to two Charlie Hodgson penalties .

"Former England captain Mike Gatting believes Kevin Pietersen should not walk straight back into the international set-up, even if he piles on the runs for Surrey this season. Pietersen has returned to the LV= County Championship in a bid to stake a claim for an England recall, although the 34-year-old only managed 19 runs against Glamorgan on Sunday. England were held to a draw in the opening Test of a three-match series against West Indies last week, and calls for a Pietersen comeback continue to linger ahead of the Ashes this summer. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 in his first outing for Surrey this season but scored just 19 against Glamorgan . 'There are a few bridges that still need to be rebuilt,' said Gatting, who had just penned a congratulation message to James Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, as part of Slazenger's celebratory flag tour. 'Even if KP scores runs there might not be spaces available. If Gary Ballance, Ian Bell and Joe Root play well, there might not be a place for him. 'You've got to have somebody who isn't playing well to get Pietersen in. 'He doesn't just come straight back - that would be unfair on the people in there at the moment. 'If he does get runs, fine, but that's not the end of it. 'If people are playing well in the team, why should he just get straight in?' Pietersen is keen to play for England again after being sacked in 2014 . Bell and Ballance both hit centuries in Antigua while Root also showed signs of good form with scores of 83 and 59. The scorecard was less encouraging for England captain Alastair Cook, however, who could only manage 11 and 13, stretching his run without a Test century to 33 innings. Cook's poor performances saw him removed as One-Day captain before the World Cup earlier this year and Gatting admits more questions will be asked of the England skipper if he fails to find runs against West Indies. 'Alastair knows what he's got to do, he's got to get some runs,' Gatting said. 'We can keep speculating but I suspect at the end of the West Indies series, they'll look at it and if he hasn't got any runs there might be some questions asked. Gary Ballance scored a century in the first Test against West Indies . 'He might possibly get the series against New Zealand - the fact is Alastair has got more 100s than anyone else has and people do go through bad patches in their careers. 'Alastair has had a break, when he was left out of the One-Day series, he's had time to get himself sorted. 'Maybe he needs a break from the captaincy, that's for people to sit and decide, I suspect it's about the runs though, not the captaincy. 'He's a well-respected man in the team, the fact is he's a batsman, he's a captain and if he fails to get the runs somebody will have to make a decision.' Cook's future may be affected by who the England and Wales Cricket Board chooses for the new director of cricket role, created to replace sacked managing director Paul Downton. Mike Gatting has signed a giant flag congratulating Jimmy Anderson on becoming the leading England wicket taker in Test matches . Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart have all been mentioned in connection with the post, but Gatting is unsure what the point of the position will be. 'I've tried to think what the role could be,' Gatting said. 'If it's going to be someone more hands on with the team, how is that going to affect the coach? 'Can it be any different to the job Paul Downton did? You do need someone in charge of the overall structure. 'At the end of the day, it's all about the players - it's about how they perform. 'I just hope the ECB don't rush into the decision and they get the right person, because different people will do a different type of job.' Former MCC president Mike Gatting was signing Slazenger's 'Congratulations Jimmy' flag which will be touring the country this week. Slazenger is celebrating Jimmy Anderson becoming England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker by giving 10 per cent off its entire cricket range.

"England are set to face trial by leg-spin after West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin confirmed Devendra Bishoo will play in Tuesday's second Test. Wrist spin has long been a bete noire for England batsmen, a quirk that has been passed down the DNA since Australia's Shane Warne dominated the old enemy for more than a decade. Peter Moores' current side, with the fresh faces of Gary Ballance, Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler throughout the order, have yet to face a frontline leg-spinner in Tests but that will change when Bishoo returns at the National Stadium in Grenada. West Indies cricketer Devendra Bishoo will play against England in the second Test . West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin confirmed that leg-spinner Bishoo will play on Tuesday . His record over 11 caps is modest, with 40 wickets at 39.55, but the 29-year-old comes into the game in place of the dropped Sulieman Benn in superb form. His last five first-class matches for Guyana have yielded a phenomenal 37 wickets with six wicket hauls against Barbados, Trinidad & Tobago and the Windward Islands. 'Bishoo will be in,' said Ramdin, when asked about his bowling line-up. West Indies  captain Ramdin prepares for the second Test in the nets . 'The pitch will turn out to be better - in terms of spin - than the first Test in Antigua. He has bowled really well in first-class cricket in the last month and a half. 'In our squad's practice match he bowled long spells and got results. 'It's going to be a batting track for the first two days and then the fourth and five days, the spinner will come into play. 'With a leg-spinner you get bad balls and you get beauties. Hopefully he'll get a lot of beauties in this game.'","West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin confirmed Devendra Bishoo will play .

"Point guard Stephen Curry nearly single-handedly outscored New Orleans with 11 first-quarter points as the Warriors built a 15-point lead and rolled to victory in Game One of their Western Conference first-round series. Game Two in the best-of-seven series is scheduled for Monday night in Oakland. Golden State, the top seed in the West, picked up right where it left off in the regular season, recording a 19th straight home win and 40th in 42 games this year. Stephen Curry scored a stunning 34 points for the Golden State Warriors in there play-off game . The Warriors did it by taking a 25-point lead into the final minute of the third quarter, then holding on. 'We missed a lot of free throws, which made it a lot closer than it needed to be,' coach Steve Kerr said. 'But in the playoffs you've just got to get it done somehow. We're up 1-0. That's where we want to be.' Curry led the Warriors with 34 points, hitting 13 of 25 shots and four three-pointers. All five Golden State starters scored in double figures. Guard Klay Thompson complemented Curry with 21 points, while power forward Draymond Green (15 points, 12 rebounds) and center Andrew Bogut (12 points, 14 rebounds) recorded double-doubles. The point guard has been in spectacular form as he looks to lead the Warriors to the NBA glory . Curry celebrates after scoring a three-pointer on his way to scoring 11 first quarter points .

"There can be no doubt that the bone-jarring collisions we see on Saturday will be far more substantial than the flick from David Beckham's right boot which led to Diego Simeone collapsing in apparent agony on the same pitch 17 years ago. This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago. Veteran fly half Charlie Hodgson will run the show for Saracens against Clermont on Saturday . England centre Brad Barritt will captain Mark McCall's side against at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard . Owen Farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash .

SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final . Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt — captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19. 'He took them on a journey over four seasons where they won the all-Ireland in year two and have been Ulster champions in three out of the four years he coached them. It seemed like a very similar journey to our own. Our players were captivated.' Jacques Burger (centre) was a standout performer in Saracens' 46-6 victory at Twickenham last season . Saracens are able to call on linchpin No 8 Billy Vunipola, who starts in a back row alongside Burger and Itoje who, standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb, epitomises the modern-day rugby player. Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester's Mathew Tait in last weekend's Premiership encounter. With veteran fly-half Charlie Hodgson in the form of his life and Owen Farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of England's Six Nations campaign, Saracens are close to full strength. Barritt believes experience will be crucial. 'We have a squad who have been there and done it,' he said. 'We have experienced those highs and lows of winning a Premiership, losing in the final of the Premiership and consistently getting to the latter stages of the Europe. Those experiences made us a stronger and better team. McCall (above) invited  ex-Donegal gaelic football manager Jim McGuinness to speak to his side this week . 'We feel like we're in a great position for the final run-in of the season. We've won the last six or seven games. In these big games it's often about adapting to the situation and we know we have got a few strings to our bow.' Against a Clermont side capable of striking from anywhere on the field, Saracens will need all those strings.

But his hopes of remaining England captain in the Ashes this summer hinge on what is going on back home. The opinions of ECB chairman-elect Colin Graves, new chief executive Tom Harrison and the man they eventually make director of cricket matter far more than what anyone in the Caribbean thinks. The three half-centuries Cook made in his last four Test innings of last summer count for little now as his battle to prove he remains the best man for the job nears crunch time. England captain Alastair Cook is not concerned about his failure to hit a Test hundred since May 2013 . Cook remains England's leading century maker despite his recent failure to score a Test century . Cook (right, pictured with Gary Ballance) and his team-mates are preparing for England's second Test . The second Test that starts here is not exactly make or break for Cook but he needs runs and a victory as much as at any time in a career that has seen him score more Test centuries than any other Englishman. The decision of Graves and Harrison to sack Paul Downton as managing director and announce that they are looking for a new ‘supremo’ to replace him has placed Cook and Peter Moores under more pressure than ever. By definition, the new powers at the ECB cannot have been happy about the big decisions Downton made in a traumatic 14 months and few were bigger than the move to bring back Moores as coach and the continued backing of Cook. England could not have done much more to force victory in Antigua on a pitch deader than Monty Python’s parrot but their failure to beat West Indies has made the remaining two Tests vital. Cook was both proactive and imaginative for much of that first Test but he is a captain who leads mainly by example and simply has to break a run that now sees him without a Test century for 33 innings. The statistics certainly make grim reading for Cook. In 21 of those 33 innings he has not passed 25 and his Test average of 45.65 is lower than at any time since the 2010-11 Ashes. Since the last of his 25 Test centuries, against New Zealand at Headingley in May 2013, he is averaging under 29. If England really do want a change at the top then it must come sooner rather than later, particularly if, as expected, they would bypass vice-captain Ian Bell and go straight to the man who now seems the heir apparent, Joe Root. The only way for Cook to stop the questions about his lack of a big innings is to replicate the form he has been showing in practice here with his new slightly open stance and go back to churning out the runs. ‘I have been working with Goochie on a number of things, as you always do,’ said Cook of his decision to work with Graham Gooch, his old mentor and the man he sacked as England batting coach. ‘You’re always trying to tinker with your technique and might fall into certain habits at various times in your career. Joe Root lays on the ground to check out the pitch while Cook (right) and Jos Buttler (centre) look on . Cook (left), Moeen Ali (centre) and Adil Rashid (right) go for a gentle jog at the National Cricket Ground Stadium . ‘But the most important thing is not to concentrate too much on technique when you are out in the middle. You have to concentrate on what is important — the ball coming down to you, the situation you’re in and the conditions. ‘I’m a resilient guy who tries to play each ball on its merits for as long as possible, that’s what my success has been built on, and I remain desperate to set the tone at the top of the order with some runs.’ It was hoped that the pitch at a National Stadium here that was rebuilt after the devastating hurricane of 2004 would have a bit more pace than Antigua but Cook expressed his ‘surprise’ at how wet and soft it was, at least on Sunday. That means England will consider bringing in leg-spinner Adil Rashid for Chris Jordan, while Moeen Ali looks certain to return in place of James Tredwell, who has been ‘struggling’ with a shoulder problem suffered in Antigua. The ‘big two’ of record-breaking Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad will both play despite a demanding first Test while Jonathan Trott, rightly, carries on as opener with Cook despite his two failures on his return to the side in Antigua. There is much promise in this England team, particularly in a middle order that will see one of Moeen, Jos Buttler or Ben Stokes batting as low as eight, but questions remain about the man at the top. It is up to Cook to answer them. Cook warms up during the England nets session at the National Cricket Ground Stadium in St George .

Speaking to The Independent, Ings said: 'One thing I don't want to do is go somewhere and, not rot, but all of a sudden disappear for a while. [Somewhere] you don't really get a look-in. I always back myself and no matter what step I take next I want to do well.

A lot of other things can suck you in when it comes to moves and I am sure that it has happened in the past to people.

"Sam Gallagher put an injury-hit season behind him by inspiring Southampton to Under-21 Premier League Cup glory, netting an exceptional goal which he hopes caught Ronald Koeman's eye. Last season surpassed all expectations for the teenage striker as he became a regular under Mauricio Pochettino, making 20 first-team appearances as back-up to Rickie Lambert. Things have gone awry this season, though, with injury stunting the 19-year-old's progress. Sam Gallagher scored the winner as Southampton U21s beat Blackburn Rovers 2-1 on Monday . Ronald Koeman was in the crowd and Gallagher says he hopes he impressed him . Gallagher has not even been named in the matchday squad since the arrival of Koeman, although he gave the Saints boss a nudge in some style on Tuesday evening.

'It was unbelievable, that's all I can really think to say,' Gallagher said, smiling. 'I was always thinking throughout the game it would be nice to get one and to get in the way I did was quite special to me. 'I've had a long injury which has put me back quite a bit this season. It sort of feels like it has just started, but it's almost coming to an end. 'I have always had my focus on the under-21s when I got back fit and I am just looking forward.

"Four Queens Park Rangers supporters have been jailed for football-related disorder following an incident with Burnley fans last year. The unsavoury scenes occurred on February 1, 2014 following a 3-3 draw during their Championship encounter at Loftus Road. The foursome identified as Harry Childs, Jack Hutchins, Dean Foreman and Bradley Pack were sentenced for affray on Friday, after being charged in July last year, due to their involvement in an act of violent disorder outside a west London pub. QPR fans Harry Childs (left) and Jack Hutchins have been jailed for football-related disorder last year . Dean Foreman (left) and Bradley Pack were also sentenced for affray on Friday for their involvement . The incident occurred after last season's 3-3 draw between QPR and Burnley at Loftus Road . Childs, 18 from Billericay, Essex has been sentenced to eight months imprisonment while Hutchins, 21 of Kings Langley, Hertfordshire was given a one-year sentence alongside 27-year-old Foreman who hails from Northolt, London. Pack, 22 of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire was sentenced to 30 weeks imprisonment. In addition all four men also received six-year Football Banning Orders under section 23 of the Football Spectators Act 1989. Childs, Hutchins and Foreman were found guilty of the offences on March 6 with Pack previously entering a guilty plea. During the two-week trial, the court heard how the quartet gathered outside the the Plough and Harrow pub shortly before 5pm, where they confronted a number of Burnley supporters, who were having a post-match drink, through the windows outside the establishment. The incident  dates back to February 2014 when the quartet confronted Burnley supporters after their match . With the shouting reciprocated from within, the events soon escalated to violence and the pub's window being kicked and shattered by Childs. The ensuing scenes saw numerous people assaulted and punched outside the pub, with the Plough and Harrow manager locking the glass front doors and calling 999 in fear of the violence spreading into the premises. Childs - who was wearing a distinctive red patent jacket - and his three associates moved up along Kings Street where they came across another set of Burnley and QPR supporters where further spontaneous violence took place. Police soon arrived at the scene, however Hutchins and Foreman evaded their attention. Childs and Pack were stopped nearby where they identified themselves to the police, but they were not arrested as there was no evidence to support their involvement in the disorder at the time. The foursome attacked the Plough and Harrow pub as the shouting soon turned into violence in west London . An investigation was immediately launched by detectives from Hammersmith and Fulham with support from specialist officers from the Central Football Policing unit. Hours of CCTV were carefully in a bid to identify those responsible for the disorder with Childs, Hutchins, Foreman and Pack and all arrested on suspicion of violent disorder on June 9, 2014. Chief Inspector Simon Causer said: 'This kind of behaviour is entirely unacceptable to the police, the thousands of law-abiding and genuine football fans, the clubs and the general public. Our hope is that, in light of these convictions and sentences, perpetrators will think very carefully about the consequences of their actions before carrying out football violence. 'Our borough has a proud history in policing successful match day operations and we have extensive experience working together with our residents and businesses to ensure that our communities are safe and able to enjoy this great sport. The quartet later moved up along Kings Street where further acts of violence and disorder took place . Hours of CCTV were carefully in a bid to identify those responsible for the disorder . 'With continued support from our football clubs and local partners we remain resolute in our zero-tolerance policy towards football related violence and we utterly condemn such actions.' PC Paul Todd, from the Met's Central Football Unit, said: 'Football violence has reduced over the years but there are still a minority that insist on putting people at risk by fighting in busy streets near members of public. People arrested for football violence do not only get a criminal record but can also receive an order preventing them from attending football matches in the future.' A spokesperson for QPR, said: 'The vast majority of QPR fans are excellent ambassadors and passionate supporters. However the club takes a zero tolerance position to violence in or around the stadium and will continue to fully cooperate with the police in these rare instances.'","Queens Park Rangers drew 3-3 with Burnley in the Championship last term .

"Jonas Gutierrez was dropped after a fallout with Newcastle head coach John Carver – and is now set to be released at the end of the season. The Argentinian – who has twice beaten testicular cancer - was not even named among the substitutes for Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs. Afterwards, Carver said Gutierrez was left out for ‘selection reasons’ before stating that he did not want to talk about the player. Jonas Gutierrez was dropped from squad for Sunday's defeat by Tottenham following row with John Carver . The 31-year-old had earlier posted a message on Twitter saying that he was not injured. Indeed, sources close to Gutierrez say that he was axed following a heated exchange with Carver. Gutierrez was upset when he was dropped from the starting XI for last week’s 3-0 loss at Liverpool. He had been United’s best player during the Tyne-Wear derby defeat at Sunderland in the previous game and was surprised by his omission, which was explained as a tactical switch to pair Jack Colback and Mehdi Abeid in midfield. What followed was a training-ground disagreement with Carver and Gutierrez tweeted on Thursday, ‘I am tired about some things. I am Geordie. Newcastle deserves more’. Meanwhile, a source added: ‘They are treating him very badly. He does not deserve this. He just wants to play for Newcastle.’ Gutierrez’s contract is up in the summer and he will be let go after seven years at the club. The clause which meant he would be guaranteed an extension after eight starts this season cannot now be activated. However, Sportsmail also understands that Gutierrez trained with the first-team on Monday and will be in the squad for Saturday’s visit of Swansea with both Carver and the player keen to move on from their dispute. The midfielder has long since been critical of his treatment by the Magpies after they told him to find a new club when he returned to Tyneside having beaten the cancer for the first time in November, 2013. Newcastle midfielder was given a heartfelt ovation when he appeared as a substitute at Anfield . Gutierrez was eventually loaned out to Norwich City for the remainder of the season. The cancer, however, returned last summer and he underwent a course of chemotherapy in Argentina. He returned to Newcastle in December and has made five appearances, the last of which came as a second-half substitute at Anfield when he was given a heartfelt ovation by the home fans. And, in an interview last month, Gutierrez spoke of his disappointment at the manner in which Newcastle had handled his illness. 'I won't be able to forgive the way I've been treated, no,’ he said. Gutierrez will not be offered a new deal by Newcastle despite seven years at the club . 'I don't think it was the right time nor the circumstances and I think at times like that, you should look after the individual, the player. 'I returned mid-November (2013) and in December the manager said I should find myself another club, that it was best. I understand a lot of things about football that for the directors it is a business, no? 'It is clear that they look after the club's interests, but I think in a situation like that, you need to consider other things, even more as I had been playing for five years before having this problem. I was always playing. 'And I never asked for anything. I paid for it [medical treatment] because, for me, the most important thing was my health.'","Jonas Gutierrez will not be offered a new deal by Newcastle in the summer .

"Thierry Henry said the Stadium of Light was the noisiest atmosphere he had ever experienced during Sunderland’s derby win over Newcastle. Six days later, silence reigned. A sorrowful silence as thousands streamed for the exits in the wake of Crystal Palace’s fourth goal inside 14 second-half minutes. Sunderland strikers Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe can't hide their disappointment following defeat . A shameful silence as Sunderland’s players afterwards absorbed the shock of another embarrassing home collapse. But perhaps most damning was the sad silence of realisation from Dick Advocaat. When asked how concerned he was that the side he has inherited are in danger of the drop, he grimaced for fully 10 seconds before returning: ‘Worried? Yes, very worried.’ And he has every reason to be. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat looks on as Sunderland are dismantled at home by Crystal Palace . The stands emptied during the second-half at the Stadium of Light as Sunderland conceded four goals . Exactly four weeks earlier Advocaat had watched from the comfort of his home in Holland as Sunderland trailed 4-0 at half-time to Aston Villa, a side who had scored just twice on the road all season. On Saturday, he watched from the discomfort of the touchline as Yannick Bolasie trebled his tally for the campaign with a devastating 11-minute hat-trick.

SUPER STAT: Sunderland have now lost the four matches immediately after their Tyne-Wear derby victories. Sunderland, though, had again given a depressing demonstration of how to surrender a football match. When your skipper, John O’Shea, is out-fought for a ball with the odds stacked in his favour — as he was for Bolasie’s second — then you know your problems have permeated the core of the team. Jermain Defoe, derby match winner the previous weekend, played as if he had been issued with an exclusion order from the penalty box. Advocaat said: ‘I can see for myself that we don’t create enough chances even though we play with three strikers. Even when we play with so many up front we don’t create anything and that means there is something wrong in the squad. ‘We showed we can do something against Newcastle but if we carry on performing like this then we have no chance.’ On this evidence, Advocaat is right. Sunderland will only be spared relegation by the shortcomings of others. They are not capable of saving themselves, as they did in miraculous fashion 12 months ago. Given that the season finishes with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea they are now working on a four-game rescue plan. Wilfired Zaha joins an ecstatic Bolasie (left) after the forward produced a stunning hat-trick in the second-half . For Palace and brilliant Bolasie, meanwhile, they are only looking up after four straight wins. And the 25-year-old credited Pardew following his first senior hat-trick. ‘That (goals) is what the manager has been demanding from me,’ he said. ‘He has been putting me right in the middle of sessions, even doing the lay-ups for me. Crystal Palace forward Zaha evades the attention of Sunderland striker Fletcher during the contest . ‘He has put sessions on that have been especially for the strikers, it’s been excellent.’ Pardew enjoyed seeing his side run riot. Murray headed them in front before Bolasie executed three swift breakaways. A league table from Pardew’s time in charge has Palace fifth. And he added: ‘We are a pretty young team and only need to add two or three to the squad and we could be a real force next season.’ As for next season for Sunderland, they can only hope they’re in the same division as Palace.

"Portugal striker Nelson Oliveira is determined to take his Swansea chance presented to him by the absence of the in-form Bafetimbi Gomis. Oliveira has won 14 caps for his country and was once linked to a £24million move to Manchester United, but his career has stalled at Benfica and Swansea is his third loan spell in as many seasons. The 23-year-old has found it tough to make an impression in south Wales but he is set to make his second Barclays Premier League start at bottom club Leicester on Saturday with Gomis sidelined by hamstring trouble. Nelson Oliveira is on-loan at Swansea from Portuguese giants Benfica but has struggled for first-team action . The striker (right) has recovered from a training-ground ankle injury and is expected to start against Leicester . 'I've had to be patient waiting for my chance,' Oliveira told the official Swansea website. 'But that's understandable. It's normal that when you join a very good team who are doing well and are eighth in the table, then you have to wait for your chance.' Gomis has been ruled out for between three to four weeks after being injured in the early stages of last weekend's 1-1 home draw with Everton. The France international has scored four goals in seven games and Oliveira, who has recovered from a training-ground ankle injury in time to feature at the King Power Stadium, admits that Gomis' form has made life difficult for him. Oliveira is hoping to take his Swansea chance presented to him by the absence of the in-form Bafetimbi Gomis . 'Bafe has been doing very well and scoring goals,' said Oliveira, who has made seven of his eight Swansea appearances from the bench with his only start coming in the 5-0 home defeat to Chelsea in January. 'He's a good player and person and I feel for him because of the injury. 'He's been in a good moment and is important to the team. 'I'm not happy he is injured, but if it gives me a chance then I really want to take it; work hard, play well and help the team. 'It would be nice to score my first goal for the club and I'm always confident in my own ability. Manager Garry Monk is set to hand Oliveira only the second Premier League start of his career at Swansea . 'And I know, the more I play the more confident I will get.' The injury to Gomis on the back of selling Wilfried Bony to Manchester City in January has highlighted the shortage of strikers at Swansea, and manager Garry Monk has made no secret of the fact that it is one department where the club need to strengthen this summer. 'It is an area where we need to help those who are here,' Monk said. 'We still need to look at Nelson and Marvin Emnes is not an out and out striker. 'Hopefully Nelson can have some more game time but we are looking to strengthen that area.'","Nelson Oliveira is on-loan at Swansea from Portuguese giants Benfica .

"Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp says that Tottenham have not made any progress under Mauricio Pochettino this season, insisting he has been rescued by the kids. Spurs are almost certain to miss out on Champions League football again with club currently occupying a place only in the top six, although they did reach their first major final since 2009 this season. Argentine boss Pochettino has put his faith in the likes of Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason, while more experienced, higher-profile players have been pushed out to the fringes. Harry Redknapp says Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has been rescued by the kids this season . Harry Kane has scored 20 Premier League goals this season, while Ryan and Mason has played a key role . Redknapp insists the club have not moved forward under their Argentine manager this season . And former Spurs boss Redknapp, who led the club to two top-four finishes during his tenure, says that a sixth or seventh place finish this season is not progress. 'I like the manager, I think he's excellent,' Redknapp told Sky Sports. 'He is a great guy as well. 'But let's be honest, they haven't pulled up any trees. Finishing sixth or seventh is certainly not going forward. But he needs another year. 'Really, he's been rescued by the kids this season - Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb, Danny Rose, Andros Townsend, Kyle Walker.

'They have been the best players at the club and have probably kept them going. Redknapp has also criticised Tottenham's recruitment policy after the club spent the money received from the sale of Gareth Bale on big-money signings that have failed to deliver. Roberto Soldado (£25.9million), Erik Lamela (£25m) and Paulinho (£17m) have all struggled to justify their hefty price tags. Argentina international Erik Lamela is another that has failed to live up to a hefty price tag . 'They have bought players in and haven't spent wisely. The players that have been brought in aren't down to him. 'The big signings that have come in have been a disaster. That is something Daniel is going to have to look at, the recruitment was poor. 'They have changed that around now and I think they have new people coming in.

"Martin Odegaard's week got worse when Real Madrid's 16-year-old wonderkid who cost £2.3million was refused a rating by Spanish newspaper AS for his performance for the club's B-team Castilla. The Norway international was dropped previously by manager Zinedine Zidane, and was substituted after 65 minutes against Tudelano with the club's second team a goal down. Odegaard missed the two games before Sunday's match, which ended 1-1, and AS note the starlet was whistled by supporters.

Spanish newspaper AS refused to give Odegaard a rating (right) for his performance for B-team Castilla . He chose Madrid over Liverpool and Manchester but it has been suggested other Castilla players resent the starlet training with the first team three times a week and his superior wages.

He may be benefiting from training alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale but it is costing him time with Castilla which could help him gel with Madrid's fellow B-team players. There have been suggestions that Odegaard will be sent on loan away from the Bernabeu next year. Carlo Ancelotti has been patient with Odegaard.

"Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey has slammed the FA’s decision to put Jon Moss in charge of the FA Cup final instead of Mark Clattenburg.

"Aston Villa are chasing Cordoba striker Florin Andone. The 22-year-old Romanian has scored six goals in 16 games for the struggling Spanish side who are rooted to the bottom of La Liga. Although born in Romania, Andone moved to Spain when he was 12. He was only promoted to the senior team in December and has since made an impression being called up to the Romania national side. Florin Andone has scored six goals in 16 games for Cordoba and earned himself a call up for Romania . Tim Sherwood is looking at the attacking duo of Andone and Bakary Sako to bolster his squad next season .

"Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is convinced there is more to come from striker Harry Kane after seeing him plunder his 30th goal of the season. Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker to reach the 30-mark with a late strike in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League victory at Newcastle on Sunday. However, Pochettino is convinced the 21-year-old England hitman can improve further as he continues to make his way in the game. Harry Kane calmly slots Tottenham's third goal in time added on after coming one-on-one with Krul . Kane celebrates putting the result beyond doubt as Spurs claim a 3-1 win over Newcastle . He said: 'He has big potential. He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. We need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve. 'It's a fantastic achievement and I congratulate him. He deserves this moment because he has worked a lot. It's an historic thing. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' If it was Kane who put the icing on the cake at St James' Park, it was Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen who paved the way for his late contribution as the visitors condemned Newcastle to a sixth successive league defeat. Chadli fired them in front on the half-hour and after Jack Colback had levelled 20 seconds after the restart, Eriksen scored with a free-kick which evaded all the yellow shirts in the middle and defeated keeper Tim Krul. Kane killed off any hopes of a second fightback when he rounded off a 91st-minute break to leave Pochettino delighted. Tottenham striker Kane at full stretch as he is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . Kane celebrates his goal against Newcastle as opposition goalkeeper Tim Krul looks on in despair . He said: 'We fully deserved the victory and the three points. I think our performance was better than Newcastle's and I am very pleased for our players. 'I am happy to recover this feeling after the last two games - that wasn't good and it's important to feel victory again.' It proved a difficult day for opposite number John Carver, whose side had to contend not only with Tottenham, but a boycott by some of their own fans. Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Vernon Anita . Carver insisted that had little impact - the official attendance at the 52,000-capacity stadium was 47,427 - but admitted the Magpies, who are currently seven points clear of the drop zone, are engaged in a survival fight. He said: 'Absolutely, we're in amongst it, there's no danger of that, because you have got sides - and I'll use Leicester as an example - who are winning games. We aren't. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise . Newcastle players join Colback as the hard-working midfielder pounces on a loose ball in the area . 'But we have got to find a way of trying to find some points and put some points on the board. We have to come up with a solution, I have to come up with a solution. 'I have to find a method of trying to play now that might not be pretty on the eye, but I need to find a way of getting some results, getting some points. People might not like what they see, but I'm going to have to do it.' Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at home . Fans applaud Newcastle's goals while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, Not Ashley' sign during the game . Geordie Carver was installed as Alan Pardew's replacement until the end of the season in January, and has found himself in the firing line virtually ever since, although he is refusing to throw in the towel. He said: 'It's probably the most difficult situation I have ever been in. But I'm a fighter and I'm not going to shirk anything. I'll take the stick and I'll take the responsibility because that's the type of person I am. 'But I'm not going to give up on it. Yes, I'm angry and I'm annoyed, and I've got my own thoughts in my head that will stay private. But I have just got to get on with it because nobody else is going to do it.'

"Dele Alli has set his sights on the Toulon Tournament with England Under 20s as he aims to cap a season that will live long in his memory. The 19-year-old's impressive performances for Milton Keynes Dons earned him a dream move to the Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur in a £5million deal rubber-stamped in January. Loaned back to the Dons for the remainder of the season, Alli's 14 goals have helped keep them in touch with the automatic promotion places in League One.

Dele ALli has impressed for MK Dons this season leading to Tottenham signing him for £5m in January . Alli laid on two assists for team-mate Carl Baker during the Dons' 3-0 home win over Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday night, a result that leaves them a point behind second-placed Preston North End with two matches to play. The season has seen progress for Alli on the international scene too, with good performances for Sean O'Driscoll's Under 19 team. His absence through an ankle injury was a big blow as the team failed to qualify for the Under 19 European Championships but Alli could compensate for that by winning a place in Aidy Boothroyd's Under 20 squad for Toulon next month. Alli told The FA.com: 'I'm not going to lie and say it isn't [a target]. You want to do as well as you can. The aim is to eventually get into the first team.

'It was a real honour to win it - especially with the players I was up against in Patrick [Bamford of Middlesbrough] and Nathan Redmond [of Norwich]. 'They're great players, and from playing with Patrick last season [during his loan spell at MK Dons], I know just how good he is, so it was a great honour and achievement for me.

Sherwood wrote Charlie a letter congratulating him on his credentials, despite missing out on the job. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood (centre) showed his softer side by replying to 6-year-old Charlie Pye . He wrote: 'From your letter it is clear to see that you would indeed be an ideal candidate for the job due to your knowledge of the game - and your very capable backroom staff, of course! 'Hopefully you're not too disappointed at missing out and I'm informed that I just managed to pip you to the post so you were very close to being offered the job.

"Defender Per Mertesacker believes Arsenal have become a stronger unit from their FA Cup success of last season, but cannot allow themselves any sense of complacency against Reading at Wembley in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final. The Gunners head into the tie on the back of a superb run of form, which has seen them win 16 from 18 matches in all competitions and up into second place in the Barclays Premier League. The atmosphere around the club is certainly a world way from the tense finale to the 2013/14 campaign, when Arsenal were under extreme pressure in the quest to finally end a near decade wait for silverware as well as finish in the top four of the Barclays Premier League once again, not to mention the uncertainty around the future of manager Arsene Wenger.

Alexis Sanchez looked in good spirits as he cheered on his team-mates during their training session . Calum Chambers reacts as Danny Welbeck laughs during training as they prepare to defend their FA Cup win . Those ambitions were within eight minutes of being shattered when trailing 1-0 to Wigan in their semi-final 12 months ago, before Mertesacker made amends for giving away an earlier penalty when heading home a late equaliser to force extra-time and a nerve-shredding penalty shoot-out victory that in turn set up a final against Hull, which itself proved just as dramatic as Arsenal came from 2-0 down to lift the trophy. 'It is a good warning to all of us. You need to be focused 100 per cent Reading, so it is going to be a tough one for us,' said the German, who will again lead the team out at Wembley with captain Mikel Arteta still not fit. We suffered a bit last season on that occasion with that pressure, but it was a great experience and hopefully we can manage that a bit better. 'We are on a good level of confidence, but there will be pressure on us because we are super favourites and can we handle that during the game?' Mertesacker added: 'It is going to be Reading's biggest game of the season, so to mentally prepare for that is going to be difficult, not just to match their physicality and mental strength, but to do more, to be on the ball from the start, to show them respect, but no fear for the pressure.

I want to repeat the success (of 2014), so let's make sure that we are on the same level and do more than our opponent. 'I feel that we are really sharp and eager to repeat it. We have the chance to do it because we did well before and that is something I want to build on.' Mertesacker believes the squad have it within themselves to sustain a challenge for honours in the coming seasons. The German continued: 'To go on or to be consistent - that is a tough target, but we push ourselves. 'We want to be able to defend a title and be able to compete at the top which makes us at the moment a good team. We haven't shown that consistently this season because all of a sudden we lost one game [in the Champions League last 16 first leg to Monaco] and in a cup competition you cannot afford that. 'Even in the Premier League, if you lose four games, you cannot win the title, so that is something we really try to push ourselves to the next level.' Arsenal won the FA Cup last year and will be trying to defend their trophy this season once more . Chambers and Ozil during training in London on Friday morning ahead of Saturday's semi-final . The bedrock of Arsenal's resurgence has been the return to fitness of key men, which has left the likes of Theo Walcott, Danny Welbeck and Kieran Gibbs all looking on from the bench. Jack Wilshere could be another in contention this weekend, having recovered from minor ankle surgery. Mertesacker believes such strength in depth can only be a positive for the squad's development. 'It is weird, but it is really good, the competition we have got at the moment. It is really something that lifts everyone at the club,' he said. 'Obviously there are going to be a few disappointing situations for players, but we have to respect the manager's decision and not to let anyone down, if someone is not in the squad.'","Arsenal face Reading at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday .

"Real Madrid’s £2.3m, 16-year-old wonderkid Martin Odegaard has been dropped from the club's B-team Castilla because results drastically improve when he is not on the pitch. Odegaard picked Real Madrid over Liverpool and Manchester United at the start of the year but the record-breaking teenager is already experiencing how difficult it can be for young players in the Spanish capital. Real Madrid Castilla, managed by first-team coach in waiting Zinedine Zidane, were top of their regional third division when Odegaard arrived at the club in January, but after he made his debut the team’s form dipped dramatically and following a run of four straight defeats, they dropped to seventh place, four points off the lead. Martin Odegaard, pictured in training with the Real Madrid first team, has been dropped by the Castilla side . Odegaard is said to be on a different wavelength to his Castilla team-mates as he rarely trains with them . Zinedine Zidane (with Odegaard behind him, right) dropped the Norwegian as he looks to secure promotion . Martin Odegaard was chased by a host of top European clubs before he left Stromsgodset for Real Madrid. The Norwegian youngster visited Liverpool and Arsenal's training grounds, as well as Bayern Munich. He is thought to be on wages of around 40,000-a-week after Real spent £2.3million to acquire his services. Age: 16 (D.O.B. 17/12/98) Born: Drammen, Norway . Position: Attacking midfielder . Clubs: Stromsgodset (2014-15), Real Madrid (2015- . Castilla appearances: 7 . Castilla goals: 1 . International appearances: 3 . International goals: 0 . There have been suggestions that other B-team players resented the fact that Odegaard was training with the first team three times a week and then starting Castilla games very much on a different wavelength to his team-mates. The Norway international might be benefiting from training with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale but it was not helping him become a cohesive part of the Castilla side. And they had the perfect chance to prove they were better off without him when he was called up by Norway coach, Per-Mathias Hogmo, for the recent European Championship Group H qualifier against Croatia. They won the match played in his absence and despite the fact that he was back in Madrid and available at the weekend Zidane kept him out of the team and they won again. Real Madrid are desperate to see their Castilla side promoted and Zidane must now decide if Odegaard’s presence is doing more harm than good. The teenager was involved with Norway on international duty last week and Castilla prospered without him . If Real Madrid Castilla fail to go up to the second division then Odegaard will be loaned out next season . Odegaard signed for Real in a £2.3m deal in January as Carlo Ancelotti placed his trust in the 16-year-old . The Norwegian’s future is also tied to whether or not promotion is achieved. He was never going to be asked to play another year of Spanish third division football so if Castilla fail to go up to the second division he will be loaned out next season. No one at Real Madrid believes the club has made a huge mistake in signing Odegaard but it was a measure of how they will need to be patient with their precocious young talent when first-team coach Carlo Ancelotti decided against playing him in the Champions League against Schalke despite pressure to pick him. Odegaard would have been the youngest player ever to play in the competition. With his path to first-team involvement currently blocked and the B team choosing to chase promotion without him he might even be questioning his decision to turn down a clutch of Premier League clubs in favour of Real Madrid. Odegaard poses with Sergio Ramos (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) after completing his move in Spain . The youngster takes part in sprint training with Welsh winger Gareth Bale in January .

"Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker has tipped compatriot Jurgen Klopp to make his mark in the Barclays Premier League if he opts to continue his career in England. Klopp, 47, announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close, prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League. Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season . Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League . Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday . He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job. I think you should give him time - and I wish him all the best.' Klopp waves to the fans after Dortmund's Champions League game against Arsenal in November . The German boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at Dortmund and won the Bundesliga title twice . But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp, Mertesacker admits he cannot work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia. He said: 'It is obviously sad news for Borussia Dortmund, [he was] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them. He was the guy who turned it around at Dortmund. 'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation. 'But in the summer, it will be a new situation for him. Maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there. 'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final. It will be interesting to see what happens in the summer.' Klopp has been tipped to replace Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger but it remains unlikely .","Jurgen Klopp will leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season .

"Brazilian star Oscar says he is happy at Chelsea and won't be leaving Stamford Bridge in the summer. There have been suggestions that the 23-year-old could be offloaded by Jose Mourinho having not completed a full 90 minutes since January.

'There are different tactics depending on the opponents we face, and we respect the manager's choices. 'Sometimes I've ended up not playing the entire match, but I'm doing my best to fulfil my role. I'm happy with my performances.' The Brazil international has played some part in 39 Chelsea matches across all competitions this season, scoring seven goals and contributing eight assists.

This match is followed by a trip to Arsenal next Sunday and the Blues currently have a seven-point advantage over the Gunners with a game in hand. Oscar added: 'It seems easy, but it's definitely not. We face United and then Arsenal, and those will be like two finals for us.

"Floyd Mayweather lacks class and does not act in the manner befitting a champion, according to Marvin Hagler. Mayweather is the richest sportsman in the world, nicknamed 'Money' as much for his ostentatious displays of wealth as his actual bank balance. Earlier this year Mayweather posted a picture to various social media sites showing him stood in front of a fleet of super cars and a private jet. Floyd Mayweather performs at a media workout with his uncle Roger on the pads in Las Vegas . Mayweather is not shy when it comes to sharing pictures of his wealth on social media . Mayweather has posted pictures of himself counting money and of his expensive timepiece . Hagler, speaking at the Laureus Sports Awards on the 30th anniversary of his blockbuster fight with Thomas Hearns, said he is in danger of alienating fans. 'It's not class and really no way for a champion to act,' he said. 'If you have the skills you don't need to impress everybody by being a show-off. Then when you get beat, the public stays behind the winner instead of with you when you were the champion.' Hagler's fight with Hearns is widely considered to be one of the finest bouts in history but he warned Mayweather's £$300million showdown with Manny Pacquiao could be a dud. The two best pound-for-pound fighters will finally meet in Las Vegas on May 2. 'Mayweather can put you to sleep,' Hagler added. 'Just by boxing and moving around and no excitement and Manny could be more on the defensive side rather than the offensive side so it might be boring.'

"It was 12 years ago that David Seaman pulled off one of the most iconic saves in FA Cup history against Sheffield United at Old Trafford - and the former Arsenal keeper says it's the best one he ever made. Arsene Wenger's side were hanging by a thread against their lower league opponents, when Paul Peschisolido headed what looked like an equaliser but Seaman somehow managed to hook it away from goal - leaving players and fans speechless. The 51-year-old revealed to the Daily Mirror, that the save was the best of his career and topped his penalty heroics at Euro 96 for England. David Seaman says this save against Sheffield United was the best one he ever made during his career . The former England international went on the win the FA Cup with Arsenal in the same season . He said: 'I was fortunate enough to make one or two important saves from penalties for England, but from open play that one at Old Trafford was probably the best.' Arsenal are in formidable form this season and are currently in the midst of an eight-game winning streak but Seaman warns his former side that they shouldn't underestimate Reading. 'It was special because that was the 1,000th competitive appearance of my career for Arsenal and England, and for the final against Southampton, Arsene Wenger made me captain for the day because Patrick Vieira was injured, which was obviously a massive honour. Seaman believes the save tops his penalty heroics for England - including the Euro 96 shootouts . 'Although I didn't know it at the time, it turned out to be my last game for Arsenal. 'I went to Manchester City in the summer but six months later I had to retire because of a shoulder injury.

"Louis van Gaal wants Danny Ings to form a central part of his Manchester United rebuilding this summer. High-placed sources at Old Trafford have confirmed their interest in a player who is also being strongly pursued by fierce rivals Liverpool. The futures of Robin Van Persie and Radamel Falcao are uncertain and Van Gaal has put the 22-year-old Englishman on his list of targets. Danny Ings (right) is a top target for Manchester United and could be set for a summer move to Old Trafford . United have held talks with Burnley and through a loophole in Premier League regulations are able to agree a fee and pre-contract with the player to ensure a transfer in the summer. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers tried to sign the striker in January, but Burnley were intent on keeping him until the end of the campaign. Ings is out of contract in the summer but, due to his age, Burnley would be owed a fee set by a tribunal of around £5million if he joined an English club. However, under Premier League Rule U8 domestic clubs are able to agree terms with the club and player who would then move when their contract expires. Louis van Gaal is a fan of Ings and was impressed with the forwards performance against his side . Ings has become one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe. If United are successful they would beat former manager David Moyes, who is keen to bring the 22-year-old to Real Sociedad, to the signing. Tottenham and Manchester City are also interested. Ings has scored nine goals so far in his first season in the Premier League and United consider him to be a future England international. Van Gaal was particularly impressed by Ings’ performance against United at Old Trafford in February when he scored in Burnley’s 3-1 defeat. Van Persie, 31, has struggled with injuries this season and the loan of Falcao, 29, from Monaco has produced only four goals. United are also interested in signing PSV forward Memphis Depay, Southampton right back Nathaniel Clyne and Dortmund centre back Mats Hummels.

"World title-winning boxer, politician, actor, singer... and now music video director. Manny Pacquiao revealed yet another of his talents by releasing his own walk-out tune ahead of his $300m mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr. The so-called 'The Nation's Fist' not only wrote the song 'Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino' but also sang and directed the music video before releasing it on his Facebook page on Monday. The tune, which sounds somewhat like an 80s rock ballad actually translates as 'I will fight for the Fillipino' and will be played ahead of the richest fight in history against the undefeated American at the MGM Grand on May 2. Multi-talented Pacquiao not only wrote and sang the tune but also directed the music video . The video also carries a nostalgic feel, featuring a leather-clad Pacquiao crooning into the microphone Band-Aid style while a montage of his various fights and humanitarian efforts fade in and out. Whether Mayweather has called on his close friend and cheerleader Justin Bieber to come up with his own entrance song has not been confirmed.

World No 1 Van Gerwen, 25, beat countryman Van Barneveld, 47, 7-2 last week to remain undefeated and leave the veteran four-time World Championship winner on the brink of elimination.

Van Gerwen was sensational in Dublin last Thursday averaging over 108 and hitting seven 180s, as well as narrowly missing a nine-darter, but with the 10-man field being cut by two after Thursday's matches his compatriot could be leaving the tournament early.

Going into his match against Anderson, Van Barneveld knew he needed a positive result to keep his Premier League hopes alive following Adrian Lewis' 7-4 win over Peter Wright earlier. And the Dutchman duly delivered by taking a 5-3 lead against the Scot, which ensured he earned at least a point, before drawing 6-6. That draw, coupled with Lewis' win, meant that Wright was one of two players to be eliminated from this year's tournament - and cruelly so via leg difference.

"Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game .

Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106 . When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season’s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. ‘I am happy we are through,’ said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. ‘But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him — I have been there, done that.’ Clarke did his best to ease Federici’s pain, too. ‘This is the life of a goalkeeper,’ said the Reading boss. ‘And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There’s every chance he’ll be Reading’s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. ‘We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I’m sure he’ll be as good as he always is.’ Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger’s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal’s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled.

They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored .

Reading’s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs’ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands. Redemption was not far away for him. It will take longer to greet Federici. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has an effort blocked by Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici .

"For two hours at the start of a Test match that England cannot afford to lose it was possible to believe that Colin Graves’ description of West Indies as ‘mediocre’ would have the same motivating effect as Tony Greig saying he would make them grovel. Certainly the comments of the ECB’s outspoken new chairman were not looking very accurate when England’s new top three had all succumbed to a West Indies pace attack seemingly inspired by bowling coach Curtly Ambrose. That England averted disaster was down to their middle order. Ian Bell, with his 22nd Test century, Joe Root and, thrillingly, the rejuvenated Ben Stokes had restored order in this crucial first Test. Tony Cozier, the most respected of Caribbean broadcasters, had said ahead of this series that Graves’ words might well inspire the home side, just as Greig did all those years ago in 1976 when West Indies were approaching their peak. And it looked that way when the West Indies pace trio of Jerome Taylor, Kemar Roach and Jason Holder had all bowled with a discipline and skill in the opening session worthy of their great mentor Ambrose himself. The last time England played a Test at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium, in 2009, it was abandoned after 10 balls because of an unplayable outfield, and for a while it looked like West Indies were going to kick sand in their faces again. What a terrible start this was for England and a captain in Alastair Cook, who desperately needs both runs and victories here if he is to avoid being swept out along with managing director Paul Downton by the mood for seismic change. Cook, still steaming about his sacking as one-day captain ahead of the World Cup, has been working hard on his batting with his old mentor and the man he sacked himself as England batting coach in Graham Gooch. Ian Bell hit his 22nd Test match century to rescue England after a top-order collapse in the first Test . Bell is congratulated by Ben Stokes on reaching his ton and leading England out of trouble . Bell and Joe Root put on 177 for the fourth wicket after England's top order collapsed in Antigua . Alastair Cook - 25 . Kevin Pietersen - 23 . Wally Hammond - 22 . Colin Cowdrey - 22 . Geoff Boycott - 22 . Ian Bell - 22 . Yet a slightly altered technique that worked so well against hapless St Kitts last week did not pass its examination against a much better attack here, notably Roach, who took advantage of Cook’s old failing against the full ball. By that stage the remarkable comeback of Jonathan Trott, making his 50th Test appearance 18 months after his traumatic 49th, had been nipped in the bud in the first over of the day when he fended his third ball to slip. The decision to prefer the proven quality of Trott as Cook’s new opening partner to the county form horse in Adam Lyth had not found universal approval but it would be foolish to judge the move until Trott has adapted to a new role. A minute silence was held before the start of play in honour of Richie Benaud, who died last week .

Jonathan Trott's return to the  team ended with a three-ball duck when he was dismissed in the first over . Jerome Taylor celebrates after having Trott caught in the slips in the first over in Antigua . When Gary Ballance became the third to fall to a bad shot with just 34 on the board England were in trouble and Bob Willis was spluttering on Sky about the top three being ‘constipated’ and in need of a ‘good dose of syrup of figs.’ Yet by the close of the first day of a hectic spell of 17 Tests in the next nine months that will make or break the captaincy of Cook and the coaching of Peter Moores England could breathe a lot more easily after being put in to bat. They had moved on to 341 for five, with Stokes, unbeaten with 71 off 80 balls, adding refreshing attacking impetus with a flurry of boundaries in a stand of 130 with 174 coming in the final session as West Indian wheels began to fall off. England captain Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach having scored just 11 runs . West Indies fast bowler Roach runs off to celebrate after making a mess of Cook's stumps . The England captain makes his way off the field after being dismissed for 11 with his team on 22 for two . Gary Ballance was dismissed by Jason Holder to leave England in a hole at 34 for three . If England are going to emerge from the Caribbean unscathed then Bell, as the senior member of their batting order, must make his quality count, as he did here after going 20 balls without scoring before he got off the mark. Bell survived an early scare when he edged through the vacant third slip on 21 but he was soon unfurling his silky array of shots and West Indies were looking much more like the side who Graves dismissed so disrespectfully. He was joined in a stand of 177 by the man who looks sure to be the figurehead of a new era that has struggled to blossom under the giant shadow that continues to be cast over England by Kevin Pietersen. Bell and Root combined to dig England out of trouble with a fourth-wicket partnership of 177 . Bell was in brilliant form as he scored his 22nd Test match century on Monday in Antigua . Root hit 83 off 133 balls as England began to accelerate in a wicket-less afternoon session . Bell and Root walk off for tea unbeaten on 69 and 61 respectively having led England's revival . Root punches his bat in frustration after being dismissed by Taylor 17 runs short of a century . Root will undoubtedly succeed Cook as England captain one day, especially with Yorkshire being in such vogue, but for now his runs are invaluable to the incumbent and he carried on where he left off last summer. The man who hit who three big Test hundreds and three more half centuries against Sri Lanka and India looked certain to add another century here, especially when Sulieman Benn dropped him on 61, before he got an inside edge to a short ball from Taylor and was bowled for 83. There was to be no denying Bell, however, as he went to a hard earned hundred with a late cut boundary off Marlon Samuels and fell just before the close for 143 to a brute from Roach. Only Cook, with 25, and Pietersen, 23, have scored more Test centuries for England. Bell kisses the England badge on his helmet after reaching his century on the first day in Antigua .

England had chosen the side that looked inevitable after their unsatisfactory warm-up in St Kitts, with Trott being preferred to Lyth and the steady James Tredwell profiting from Adil Rashid’s inconsistency last week. West Indies, meanwhile, were bereft of those players who prefer to put money ahead of Test cricket by playing in the Indian Premier League, notably their star batsman in Chris Gayle. It is a sad but inevitable consequence of the Twenty20 revolution and one that, by the close, with the Test running away from them, saw West Indies look much more like the eighth ranked Test team that they currently are.","England close day one of first Test against West Indies on 341 for five .

"John Carver has called on the advice and support of former Newcastle managers Alan Shearer and Alan Pardew as tensions grow between the club and its fanbase. Supporters are planning to boycott today’s game at home to Spurs in protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from owner Mike Ashley. Carver was in the dugout alongside Pardew at the end of last season when fans again expressed their discontent during a 3-0 victory over Cardiff. Pardew was booed every time he ventured to the touchline amid a toxic atmosphere inside St James’ Park. Newcastle boss John Carver is under pressure and has asked for advice from some of his predecessors . Alan Pardew was in charge of Newcastle from 2010 to January this year, when he left for Crystal Palace . Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, the club's record goal-scorer, also had a brief stint as manager . Newcastle fans are planning to protest against owner Mike Ashley for a perceived lack of ambition . Sunday's protests will take place outside of the stadium, but Carver – who, in fairness, has been left with a depleted and disinterested squad - could nonetheless find himself the target should his side fall to a sixth straight defeat. Carver, though, accepts that he must take criticism and has spoken to the likes of Pardew and close friend Shearer, who was relegated as boss in 2009, for words of encouragement. ‘Some of the advice I’ve had has been excellent. It’s definitely changed me as a person in how I’ve dealt with things because, in the past, I would have reacted to what people have said and some of the things that have been written,’ he said. ‘Both Alans have excellent experience at it and that’s why I’m listening to what they are saying. Without a shadow of a doubt they have helped me through this. ‘We are not through it yet but they have been excellent for me, along with many other people in the game.’ He added: ‘But the club realise the situation I’m in and they realise that it’s a difficult one, and that’s why I’m convinced they are going to have to invest. ‘Whether it’s me or whether it's Sir Alex Ferguson doing this job, they would need investment.’ Carver, meanwhile, does not expect a repeat of the poison of 12 months ago when they take on Spurs. ‘The Cardiff game was one of the strangest atmospheres I’ve ever experienced,’ he said. ‘We got through it in the end. I hope it won’t be as difficult an atmosphere this time. Toon fans are planning to boycott the next home game with Spurs and have designed anti-Ashley leaflets . Newcastle players are put through their paces in training ahead of the home game with Spurs on Sunday . Newcastle winger Remy Cabella strikes a shot at goal during a training session ahead of the Spurs match . ‘I don’t think it will be, I think it will be a different type of protest. The fact that people are staying away, the people who come into the stadium will be behind the team because they understand where we are and everyone will be in it together.’ And Carver believes that the home double-header with Spurs and Swansea will determine how the rest of their season plays out. ‘I think these next two could define the season, because if we don’t pick up results it just adds a bit more pressure,’ he added. ‘Sometimes pressure can take over and we don’t want to leave ourselves in that situation.’","Newcastle boss John Carver is under huge pressure to perform in his role .

"Brendan Rodgers will remind Raheem Sterling of his responsibilities after the Liverpool youngster hit the headlines for the wrong reasons before scoring the opener in a 2-0 win over Newcastle United. Sterling, who is unwilling to sign a new contract at Anfield, has been videoed passing out after allegedly inhaling nitrous oxide, also known as 'hippy crack', and on Sunday was pictured puffing on a shisha pipe. The 20-year-old faces a club investigation and potential disciplinary action over his behaviour, and Liverpool manager Rodgers now says he will take time to talk to his rising star about what being a professional entails. Brendan Rodgers will remind Raheem Sterling of his responsibilities after his recent controversies . Liverpool forward  Sterling can be seen pictured on social media whilst smoking a shisha pipe . Rodgers said that Sterling's behaviour would be dealt with internally and that he would be speaking to him . When asked whether he would speak with Sterling, whose opener was followed up by Joe Allen's goal in the 2-0 win at Anfield, Rodgers said: 'I will do. 'I think it’s one where internally we’re always looking into these types of items. 'He’s a young kid that’s been in the spotlight now so he knows the demands of being a top class player and a top class professional, it’s not just on the field it’s off the field but I will speak with him on it and we’ll move on.' An excellent piece of skill from Sterling inside the Newcastle penalty area opened up the chance for him in the ninth minute on Monday night, and the England international expertly curled past goalkeeper Tim Krul to make it 1-0.

'He’s very valuable, he’s a kid that, he’s non-stop, he wants to learn and improve himself, the Anfield boss said. 'I thought he was outstanding tonight. He’ll be disappointed that he maybe didn’t get three goals this evening, second one he should slot away, but wonderful skill and ability for the first goal and he was tireless all evening pressing the ball and posing a threat.'

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports: 'There’s no doubt over the last six to 12 months, in years to come he’ll look back over this period now as a massive learning curve for him. 'When you’re a 20-year-old kid, you make mistakes at that age, I did, I’m sure we all do. It’s just important that he learns from it because Raheem Sterling, for how good a footballer he is, he needs to be on the back pages, not the front pages and that’s a problem for him in these last few months.'","Raheem Sterling has been videoed allegedly inhaling nitrous oxide .
