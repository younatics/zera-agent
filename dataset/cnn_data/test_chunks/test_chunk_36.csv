"As Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne is used to inventing new ways of hovering up taxpayers’ money to clean up the deficit. Mr Osborne today came face to face with a real Henry the Hoover – and onlookers couldn't fail to notice there was an uncanny resemblance to the Tory campaign chief. The Chancellor met his house-cleaning doppelganger at a campaign stop in Somerset, where he was given a tour of the factory where the machines are built. Uncanny: Chancellor George Osborne met George the Hoover as he campaigned in the West Country . The blue version of the popular vaccum brand, which also shampoos carpets, was unveiled during Mr Osborne's visit to the Numatic factory in Chard, Somerset . Mr Osborne appeared to be amused by a Henry Hoover as he spoke to staff on the production line . Mr Osborne was seen cracking up after posing for photographs with the iconic hoover brands. Onlookers could not help noticing the striking similarities between the grinning, plastic cleaning device – and the Chancellor. Mr Osborne was shown round the factory by worker Inga Ciplyte, 29, from Exeter, as he promoted the Government’s plan to create thousands of new apprenticeships. The Chancellor took to Twitter to hail the Henry the Hoover factory, writing: 'Great British products made here in Chard and exported around the world.' David Cameron had earlier been joined by the TV star Karren Brady to highlight a series of deals with big businesses to create 16,000 new apprenticeships over the next five years. The Conservative peer, who stars as one of Lord Sugar's sidekicks on The Apprentice, joined the Prime Minister at a Costa Coffee - after they announced plans to take on 6,000 youngsters as part of the Tories' pledge to eradicate youth unemployment. Baroness Brady, who is also the government’s small business ambassador, said apprenticeships ‘transformed’ people's lives and were now more respected than in the past. Earlier Mr Osborne tried his hand at being a mechanic as he met  apprentices at Hawkins garage near St Austell . The Tories announced an extra 16,000 apprentices would be created by firms including Morrisons and Costa . Mr Osborne even got the teas in as he campaign for local Tory candidate Steve Doble (left) Mr Cameron has pledged to create three million more apprenticeships over the next five years, if the Tories win the election. Costa Coffee and supermarket chain Morrisons have signed agreements to train thousands of apprentices each. Ministers will today visit firms across the country to welcome fresh commitments from companies including Morrisons, who will train 9,000 apprentices; Crest Nicholson, who will take on 200 and announce a new training academy; and the National Grid, who will take on 500 new apprentices. Ahead of their campaign visit today, Baroness Brady said: ‘David Cameron’s commitment to delivering more apprenticeships is a fantastic boost for the long-term prospects of our young people.' She added: ‘With 2.2million starting since 2010 and another 3million more to start over the next five years, each apprenticeship is a chance for young people to master a trade, learn on the job and take home money in your pocket each week. ‘They’ve become more rigorous and respected too: we’ve got young people building engines for jet planes, working on massive engineering projects, innovating in science labs.’","Mr Osborne was shown around the Henry the Hoover factory in Chard .

"A heartbroken mother has spoken out about her relentless grief after her baby son was brutally murdered in a random attack when a stranger broke into their home. Casey Veal's son Zayden was just 10 months old when he was bludgeoned to death by a drug-crazed burglar who broke into their Bendigo home at random, whilst the baby slept in his cot in June 2012. 'It tortures because it's something that's always like – why me? Why our house? Why our Zayden?' a heartbroken Ms Veal told 60 Minutes. The culprit was 19-year-old Harley Hicks who bashed baby Zayden more than 30 times with a homemade baton during a senseless and unprovoked robbery, fuelled by ice and marijuana. Casey Veal's son Zayden was just 10 months old when he was bludgeoned to death by a drug-crazed burglar who broke into their Bendigo home at random in the middle of the night as the family slept . The culprit was 19-year-old Harley Hicks (pictured) who bashed baby Zayden more than 30 times with a homemade baton during a senseless and unprovoked robbery, fuelled by ice and marijuana . Heartbroken mother Casey Veal (pictured) has spoken out about her relentless grief after her baby son was brutally murdered in a random attack when a stranger broke into their home . 'My son was murdered so he could get a hit of ice. That's it,' Ms Veal told 60 Minutes. Hicks left the home with nothing more than a wallet and a pair of sunglasses. He unplugged the baby monitor before unleashing the vicious attack on the defenceless baby while Ms Veal and Zayden's brother Xavier, then aged three, slept. When Ms Veal woke she realised they'd been robbed. She was then faced with the horror of discovering the brutal attack on her son, leaving him almost beyond recognition. 'When I walked over to the cot, I pulled the blankets back and that's when I saw his face and there was blood everywhere underneath him,' she said tearfully. Zayden had been repeatedly bashed before he was stabbed 32 times with a homemade copper baton. The happy baby with a beautiful smile suffered a crushed skull, broken collar bone and a broken rib. He was rushed to hospital but couldn't be saved.

'He was gone so I asked if I could have him, I just wanted to hold him,' she told 60 Minutes. 'I just sat and I cried. I just said 'I am so sorry.' 'I'm so sorry that I failed. My only job as your mum was to look after you and I didn't.' The new interview coincides with the federal government's announcement of the introduction of a task force to combat the 'national ice epidemic'. Assistant Health Minister Fiona Nash says the best way to reduce demand for ice is to educate the community, not just police its use. 'We can't arrest our way out of this problem,' she told ABC TV. The health and education campaign will warn Australians about the dangers of the drug. Its key message would be that a momentary high would lead to a lifetime of pain and suffering, Mr Abbott said. He declared the drug worse than heroin, LSD, cocaine or ecstasy. Justice Kaye said the murderer Hicks had at no point shown remorse.'Nor was there even the slightest indication by you of any pity or sympathy for the baby... or for his family' The baby was a victim of a random attack yet his mother Casey Veal (pictured) remains wracked with guilt . 'It's much more addictive, much more dangerous, much more damaging,' he told reporters in Sydney. Asked if the campaign would be as confronting as the infamous Grim Reaper AIDs ads of the 1980s, Senator . Nash said: 'We're going to do what's most effective.' The campaign will get underway 'well before' June 30, Mr Abbott later added. Ice is known for its intense comedowns and can make a person feel paranoid, hallucinate, aggressive and extremely violent. As for his motivation, Hicks has offered no explanation for why he committed the horrific act. The murder weapon, a homemade baton, was later discovered at Hick's home with his DNA on one end and Zayden's on the other.

Harley Hicks has been sentenced to life in prison with 32 years non parole for the brutal murder of baby Zayden Veal-Whitting. 'It is almost unthinkable that any human being could have carried out such a sickening crime that you have committed,' Supreme Court Justice Stephen Kaye said in sentencing Hicks. 'What you did was totally and utterly evil.' Justice Kaye said he could not say for sure if Hicks had viciously snuffed out Zayden's cry in a bid to silence the baby during the robbery. 'If that constituted your motive for killing Zayden, then you murdered an innocent child so that you could escape the premises with the valuable items that you had stolen from it,' he said. 'On the other hand, if that was not your motive, then your murder of Zayden was simply an act of unmitigated evil committed by you for the sheer sake of it.'

Justice Kaye said Hicks perpetrated an extraordinarily violent bashing on Zayden involving multiple blows with the baton to the head, face and other parts of his body. 'He was utterly harmless, defenceless and helpless,' he said. 'Any human being with even a shred of decency and humanity could only feel compassion, tenderness and protectiveness towards an infant in those circumstances. 'By contrast, you inflicted a brutal bashing, with a lethal instrument, on that baby. 'You crushed his skull, you savagely beat him with at least 30 blows.

Justice Kaye said Hicks, of North Bendigo, had shown no remorse. 'At no stage of the trial could I detect from you any sign of remorse. Nor was there even the slightest indication by you of any pity or sympathy for the baby, whose life you had taken, or for his family, whose lives you have shattered.

"Ed and Justine Miliband first met at a dinner party, hosted by the woman he was 'secretly' dating . Relish the scene. A dinner party in West London. The hostess: Stephanie Flanders, the glamorous then economics editor of BBC2's Newsnight. The guests: young barristers and would-be politicians. Central to the party that night back in March 2004 was Flanders' boyfriend, Labour rising star Ed Miliband. At the time, he was chief economics adviser to the Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Miliband had been back in Britain for two months after a brief spell as a lecturer at Harvard University in the U.S. Ever the policy nerd, the son of a Marxist professor waxed lyrical about economic theory. As he held court, a young woman called Justine Thornton, who was sitting across the table and whom he had never met before, became transfixed. A clever young environmental lawyer, she had been invited by Stephanie — the brilliant daughter of Michael Flanders, of the Fifties and Sixties musical comedy duo Flanders & Swann. Yesterday, Justine recalled in a red-top newspaper: 'I thought he was good-looking and clever and seemed to be unattached. But we just went down a conversation cul-de-sac. Apparently we had nothing in common. 'He just wanted to talk about economics — one of my least favourite subjects. None of our conversations went anywhere.' Mrs Miliband said that she was 'furious' when — far from being 'unattached' — she found out that he was 'secretly going out with' the woman who had invited her for dinner. Fast-forward more than 11 years and the Milibands have since had two children, married and believe they are less than a month away from moving house with their family to No 10 Downing Street. But the story of the pair's first meeting offers a fascinating insight into the somewhat caddish character of the Labour Leader. Scroll down for video . For, not only did he knife his elder brother in the back by ending his dream of getting the Labour leadership by standing against him (contrary to the wishes of their mother), but he met his future wife Justine (albeit unwittingly) at that dinner party hosted by his then girlfriend. The story emerged yesterday when Mrs Miliband gave an interview to the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror. Clearly she was guided by Labour spin doctors, who wanted to give the impression to voters that her husband was a touchy-feely human being, rather than the soulless nerd that his awkward image conveys on TV. The simpering headline of the article ran: 'Ed bandaged me up after I was bitten by a Doberman . . . and I fell in love.' Justine told how, during the 2005 election campaign, Ed had come to her rescue after she was bitten by the dog. It happened when they were putting leaflets through letter-boxes in houses in Runcorn, Cheshire. 'Ed bandaged me and I fell in love with him,' said Justine. Former partners of Mr Miliband include Juliet Soskice (left) and fellow political aide Liz Lloyd (right) After their first meeting at that 2004 dinner party, it was at least a year before they started dating. Justine's recollection isn't, though, the first public airing of her love story with Ed. In the biography of the Labour leader, titled Ed: The Milibands And The Making Of A Labour Leader, an associate is quoted as saying: 'Although she was struck by his eyes — wide and brown and fixed on their subject — a friend remembers her undoubted excitement after meeting Ed as: 'Gosh, how fascinating, he's really clever', rather than: 'Gosh, how handsome'.' Perhaps glossing over what may be seen as such caddish behaviour, the Daily Mirror omitted to say that the dinner's hostess, Stephanie Flanders (who later left the BBC for a £400,000-a-year job at a bank in the City), was Ed's then girlfriend. It was left to Tony Blair's biographer John Rentoul to let the cat out of the bag after reading the Mirror story, when he tweeted: 'Justine on clandestine Ed. Why has Mirror not named the host of that dinner? It was Stephanie Flanders.' Stephanie Flanders (pictured), a former girlfriend of Mr Miliband, hosted the dinner party where he first met his future wife . Considering that she, at the time, was economics editor of BBC-TV's flagship Newsnight, Rentoul added: 'Could the secrecy have been because he was a Treasury special adviser and Stephanie Flanders was a BBC economics journalist?' What's more, there is another intriguing twist to this story of high politics and high economics. For two years ago, Ed Miliband ungallantly blurted out, during an interview with a celebrity magazine, that not only had he romanced Stephanie but that his close Labour colleague and Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, had had a relationship with her, too. Miliband said: 'We did both date her but there was a long time apart between me and Ed. Stephanie and I don't have any problems running into each other now.' For her part, Stephanie had no forewarning of Miliband's revelation and restricted her response to curtly dismissing her relationship with him as having been 'very brief and a very long time ago'. However, her relationship with Balls, a decade earlier, was more serious. They met in 1989 at Harvard University, where they were both Kennedy scholars after having graduated from Oxford University. It was while they were working at the Financial Times as leader writers that their friendship blossomed into a serious relationship. The way these relationships intertwined also highlights the deeply incestuous and narrow world of the Labour high command. For it wasn't just Miliband and Balls, but others, too, who had close personal relationships. Of course, Balls is now married to fellow Shadow Cabinet Minister Yvette Cooper. All four studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) at Oxford University. Cooper and Flanders were tutorial partners and Kennedy scholars at Harvard. Miliband also studied at Harvard. Cooper once shared a house with Miliband (who apparently had a few other girlfriends). And she met Balls when they both worked at the FT. But back to Ed Miliband's tangled love-life. For several years in the mid-1990s, when he was working as an adviser to the then-Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, he went out with fellow political aide, Liz Lloyd (a Cambridge graduate). She worked for a time for Tony Blair, who described her in his memoirs as 'an English rose, intellectually able and blue stocking or red stocking according to the occasion'. In the summer of 1995, she and Miliband went on holiday to the south of France. They stayed in the family home of one of Miliband's first girlfriends, Juliet Soskice (the daughter of an LSE political economist and who went on to marry the late tycoon Andrew Rosenfeld, who gave £1 million to the Labour Party). At the time, Juliet was dating the Blairite journalist Phil Collins (who went on to write speeches for Blair). It was clearly a busman's holiday, as much of the discussion among the group was about the national minimum wage which was a New Labour policy. After breaking up with Liz Lloyd, Mr Miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist Alice Miles (pictured) 'We discussed it like we were in a Fabian Society seminar,' recalled Collins. 'I remember being in the kitchen and listening to Ed having a conversation about it in real detail.' Miliband's relationship with Lloyd continued when Blair became PM. Her job at No 10 meant she sat next to her lover's elder brother David Miliband, who was a key figure in the Downing Street policy unit. After breaking up with Lloyd, Ed Miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist Alice Miles, who then worked for The Times. Ms Miles, who some years later became a single parent, also had a fling with her then coke-snorting Times colleague Tom Baldwin, who is now Miliband's chief spin doctor. What a deliciously small and privileged world! One that is a million miles from the lives of millions of ordinary voters. And so back to Red Ed and Justine. The next time they met after his questionable behaviour at his then girlfriend Stephanie Flanders' dinner party was in the months leading up to him becoming an MP. Later, she helped campaign for him in Doncaster during the 2005 election by moving chairs around for a public meeting. No more Mr Nerd: Justine's interview in yesterday's Labour-supporting Mirror . Some months after, Justine planned a holiday with a woman barrister friend, Quincy Whitaker, to Libya to see the Roman ruins. However, after it was booked, Justine said she wanted to go, instead, with Ed Miliband. Their relationship had consolidated further by the time Miliband was appointed Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in the Brown government. Not only had their personal lives meshed, but their professional ones, too, as Justine (who was a member of the Labour Party) had written a book on the environment. A few years later they had the first of their two children — and then decided to get married (in May 2011). This week, by happily putting the spotlight on her husband's past love affairs, Justine must be hoping that the result will be to portray him as a dashing romantic figure. However, many voters — particularly women — may see him in a less attractive light.","Justine Miliband reveals how she met future Labour leader at dinner party .

Daniela Pinto, 39, her thin arms jutting from her red dress, has been a crack user for 4 years and has been living in this Crackland for about 4 months. She says she wants freedom, peace and love, but most importantly she wants to be freed from her addiction . A makeshift portrait studio - a scavenged chair set in front of a white backdrop, illuminated by two small lights - draws crack users from their nightmarish surroundings for a photography project. One of those willing to open up and share her story was 17-year-old Ketellin Silva who posed for a portrait in the open-air crack cocaine market. Ketellin, who first became a mother to little girl when she was just 14, clings on tightly to a stuffed animal. The toy dog, she says, belongs to her baby boy who was born premature and still remains in hospital while she returns to the crack market.

Renato Dias, 39, pictured at Crackland in Rio de Janeiro's slums, has been using crack for about 4 years and says he uses his notebook as a form of distraction. He writes about super heroes and dreams of becoming one . Long-term crack addict Sancler Rodrigues, 32, said he has been smoking the drug for 7 or 8 years but was proud to pose for a portrait at Crackland, telling the photographer 'I didn't think my old black shirt would look good in your photo, so I borrowed this from friend' Carla Chris, 35,  who has been using crack for over 6 years, says getting into crack was easy. What is difficult is finding an opportunity on the outside. But she pushes herself everyday, saying: 'Smile because life is beautiful. Jesus loves you and victory is certain. I am capable, prepared and self-sufficient, so I can do for myself' Daniela Pinto, her thin arms jutting from her red dress, has been visiting Crackland for four months. The 39-year-old says she wants freedom, peace and love but, like so many others, she wants to be freed from her addiction most of all. Andrea, better known as Loira, which is the Portuguese word for 'blonde,' is married and has a loving family at home but it doesn't stop her sneaking out to visit the market. Patricia Sebastiao, 22, already has a two-year-old daughter and one-year-old son, and is expecting her third in a few months. But despite being pregnant, she cannot stop herself from returning to Crackland to feed her addiction and leaves her children behind to visit the drugs market. Brazil has become the world's top consumer of crack cocaine, according to some recent studies, as government programs fail to stem the rapid spread of drug use. Valeria de Brito, 36, a user for eight years, said she does not like the Crackland environment and prefers to use drugs elsewhere .

"An elderly woman died after she was unable to call for help because the phone company had disconnected the mobile she kept for emergencies. Sheila Secker, 78, had been given the pay-as-you-go phone by her son, but as she had not used the phone for some time it had been cut off. When the grandmother collapsed in her home in December, she could not contact her family and died in hospital a few days later, the Sunday Times reports. Cancelled: As Sheila Secker had not used her pay-as-you-go phone for any chargeable services, Vodafone retired her number without warning . Mrs Secker's son Steve told the newspaper how his mother had owned the mobile phone for 14 years, and recently topped up the credit, but had not made any calls. Shortly before her fall, Mrs Secker moved into a new home, near York, and had yet to have a landline installed, so relied on her mobile. Mr Secker told the Sunday Times' Money section how the family raised the alarm the next day after not hearing from his mother, and emergency services were called. Mrs Secker died in hospital on New Year's Day. When Mr Secker contacted Vodafone he was told his mother's number had been retired, and that a 'glitch' in the system had allowed the elderly woman to continue to 'top up' her credit. Take heed: Most major mobile phone operators regularly 'recycle' numbers when they have been out of use for a three to six months . 'What I cannot fathom is, if Vodafone has retired a number, how can it permit money to be taken as a top-up,' Mr Secker, 46, told the Sunday Times. 'This is nothing more than a rip-off to add insult to injury'. Most major phone operators regularly 'recycle' phone numbers when they have been out of use for a certain time. A Vodafone pay-as-you-go mobile is put into 'semi-quarantine' if no chargeable calls or texts are made for 90 days. After a further 90 days the number is disconnected, and 270 days later the number is recycled and given to another customer, with any credit on the phone lost. EE retires a pay-as-you-go number after 180 days of inactivity and O2 disconnects a pay-as-you-go phone after six months of no chargeable services. Tesco Mobile allows six months of inactivity before sending the customer a text to remind them to use their phone again, or their number will be lost.","Sheila Secker, 78, died after she was unable to ring son after a fall .

"A couple accused of kidnapping two Amish girls from a produce stand before shackling and sexually abusing them have been offered a plea deal that would spare the girls from testifying. Stephen Howells, 39, and his 25-year-old girlfriend Nicole Vaisey, from Hermon, New York, were charged last summer with sexually exploiting the Amish girls and other children. They each face kidnapping and federal child exploitation charges after police say they abducted the girls, then seven and 12, from their family's farm roadside vegetable stand on August 13. On Tuesday, St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain said that the defendants were advised of the strength of the evidence and offered an agreement to plead guilty in both cases. Accused: Stephen Howells, 39, and his 25-year-old girlfriend Nicole Vaisey have been offered a plea deal after being charged last summer with sexually exploiting two Amish girls and other children . Guilty pleas would mean the victims wouldn't have to testify, including others who are not publicly known, which Rain said is one of her biggest concerns. She declined to disclose the terms offered so it is not clear how much time the duo would serve. Their federal trial has been reset for July 6 on charges they coerced minors to make pornographic videos, and they also face kidnapping charges in state court. The Amish girls were abducted from the stand in rural Oswegatchie, near the Canadian border. The incident touched off a massive search in the community of about 4,000 people, but authorities were hampered by a lack of photos of the girls. The Amish typically avoid modern technology, and the family had to work with an artist to produce a sketch of the older girl. Authorities say the girls were shackled to a bed and sexually abused before they were released 24 hours later and turned up safe at the door of a house in Bigelow, New York, belonging to Jeffrey and Pamela Stinson, who drove them home. Scene: The two girls, then aged seven and 12, were abducted from this farm roadside stand in August . Fears: Authorities can be seen at the family's farm after the abduction in Oswegatchie, near Canada's border . Heroic: A day after the girls were abducted and sexually assaulted, they were left at Jeffrey and Pamela Stinson's home 20 miles from their farm. The couple then returned the girls to their home . Howells, a registered nurse at Claxton-Hepburn Medical Center, and Vaisey, a former dog groomer, were arrested on August 15 after voluntarily going to the sheriff's office for an interview. This week, investigators told WWNY that Howells had planned to kill the girls and then bury their bodies to hide the crime but Vaisey convinced him to let them go. The original federal indictment said another young girl, now about 8 years old, also was sexually abused by the couple during the two-year span. Rain said the defendants have not yet responded to the offer and she declined to say how many victims they've identified. 'We are still gathering evidence,' she said. The latest federal indictment, based on computer videos taken from the couple's rural home in Hermon, where authorities say the Amish girls were held, listed six victims. Sources close to the investigation also told WWNY that sexually disturbing video images involving several handicapped adults were found on the couple's computer hard drive. 'Controlled': Howells dominated Vaisey in a sort of master-slave relationship, her lawyers have said . Locked up: Howells, formerly a registered nurse in Ogdensburg, New York, has three children of his own . Arrest: Vaisey, seen in August, and her boyfriend were arrested after voluntarily going for police interviews . 'Everyone is working toward finding a way of resolving this matter,' said Vaisey's attorney, Bradford Riendeau. 'A trial is one way.' He declined to comment on the report from WWNY television that Howells considered killing the Amish girls and Vaisey convinced him to let them go. Riendeau has maintained that Howells dominated Vaisey in a sort of master-slave relationship. During a hearing in August, Vaisey said that she and Howells had been on a 'shopping trip' for slaves on the day of the kidnapping. Calls to Howells' attorney, federal public defender Randi Bianco, were not immediately returned. The couple's house was later bought by a neighbor. It was burned down as a fire department training exercise and the debris cleared. Howells has three children of his own.","Stephen Howells and Nicole Vaisey, from Albany, New York, were charged last summer with sexually exploiting the Amish girls and other children .

"For U.S. moms, the typical time between pregnancies is about 2½ years but nearly a third of women space their children too close, a government study shows. Experts say mothers should wait at least 18 months to give their body time to recover and increase the chances the next child is full-term and healthy. The study released on Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 30 percent of women who'd had a child became pregnant again within 18 months.

Second baby: For U.S. moms, the typical time between pregnancies is about 2½ years but nearly a third of women space their children too close, a government study shows . 'That is actually pretty high and very problematic,' said Heike Thiel de Bocanegra, a reproductive health researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. She was not involved in the new study. The report is based on 2011 birth certificates from 36 states and the District of Columbia, representing about 83 percent of the nation's births that year. It was the first such report by the CDC so researchers don't know if pregnancy spacing has changed over time. The study found that the median time to next pregnancy was 2 years, 5 months. About half fell in the 18 months to 5 year range. About 20 percent had babies more than 5 years apart. White women had the shortest spacing — about 2 years, 2 months on average. Black and Hispanic women typically waited 2½ years or longer. The older the mom was, the longer the spacing between a birth and her next pregnancy.

Of course, miscarriages, illnesses or other factors can affect a couple's plans. Lhamo Ellin of New York had her daughter about 12 years after her son. 'I tried. It didn't happen,' said Ellin. She works as a nanny in a Brooklyn neighborhood that is a magnet for young families, where she said siblings seemed to be about three to five years apart. New Yorker Reis Goldberg and his wife had twin boys and then a daughter 3½ years later. 'As soon as we got the twins under control, we were ready to have another one,' he said. Goldberg, who is only about a year younger than his brother, agreed with the experts. 'Second kid suffers. A lot runtier. He was like double my size when I was younger,' he said.

"Field Marshall Erwin Rommel sporting his famous goggles which were in fact a five from British Major General Michael Gambier-Parry . He was the one German leader in the Second World War who the British regarded with honour. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel gained respect from his foes for his tactical acumen and sense of fairness during the battle for North Africa. Rommel, nicknamed the Desert Fox, also became an iconic wartime figure – and the stylish goggles he famously wore across his peak cap became part of the myth. Now the story of how the German came to be in possession of the goggles can be told for the first time. They were given to him by a British prisoner as a gift to thank him for retrieving a stolen hat. Major General Michael Gambier-Parry, of the 2nd Armoured Division, was captured with 2,000 of his men by Rommel in Mechili, Libya, in 1941. The German field marshal invited the British officer to dine with him in a gesture of military camaraderie. The pair shared good wine and smoked ‘excellent cigars’, according to Gambier-Parry’s granddaughter, Liza Donoghue, 67. During the meal, Gambier-Parry complained that a German soldier had taken his hat. A furious Rommel then took it upon himself to get the garment back to his prisoner. And when Rommel later found Gambier-Parry’s Army goggles in a staff car, he asked the British officer if he could keep them and Gambier-Parry agreed. Scroll down for video .

"The married manager of a limousine company fired an employee for refusing to have sex with him, and even said as much in a text he sent her. Raymond Towns­end, a manager at US Limousine on Long Island, New York, was found liable for sexual harassment against his dispatcher Geralyn Ganci, now 32, after more than a year of lurid messages. The woman, who sat near his wife in their office, repeatedly refused Townsend's requests for sex, but kept a text from her boss where he said that she lost her job because she 'refused to have sex with the General Manager'. Limousine company manager Raymond Townsend (right) was ordered to pay compensation to his employee Geralyn Ganci, (left) 32, after telling her she was fired because she would not have sex with him . He also sent her texts saying that he 'had to pull over to the side of the road and masturbate thinking about me',  Ganci said in court papers. Other messages allegedly asked her to come over to his house because his wife was visiting her mother for he evening or contained pictures of his 'lap'. Ganci said that she had attended the wedding of Townsend and his wife. The original sexual harassment complaint against Townsend, filed in 2010, said that the manager would call Ganci 'at all hours of the day and night, during the work day and after the work day to convey disgusting, sexually suggestive, erotic and vile messages of a sexual nature'. Messages, which were aimed at making the woman have sex with him, continued for more than a year. She was fired after the boss allegedly forced Ganci into a bathroom and put his hand up her shirt in 2009 on a day when his wife was not at work. Townsend sent texts to Ganci including one where he claimed that he'had to pull over to the side of the road and masturbate thinking about me', the employee said. A judge has settled the final amount owed by US Limousine and Townsend at more than $700,000. Above, the company's various white vehicles . Ganci's complaint said that Townsend then offered to fire someone in the limousine company's 'wedding department' to bring her back in a different position. Townsend and US Limousine are now liable for more than $700,000 in damages and fees after losing a civil rights suit where the message was used as evidence, according to the New York Post. Though a federal jury found Townsend and his company liable in 2010, a federal judge in New York just finished finalizing the legal fees awarded to Ganci at just more than $170,000. She will also be awarded $550,000 in damages and compensation from US Limousine and her former boss. She had originally asked for $5million. Ganci said Townsend's behavior caused her emotional distress that landed her in the hospital, but that he called her while she was in the facility and asked about her breasts. Last year a jury found Townsend liable for creating a sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment, but not intentionally inflicting emotional distress. Townsend does not work at US Limousine any longer and did not return a request for comment to the New York Post.","Gerlayn Ganci, 32, repeatedly asked for sex by boss Raymond Townsend .

"Hillary Clinton looks set to come under renewed pressure to explain herself after a letter revealed she had been asked about her use of private email by a House committee two years ago - but refused to answer. Representative Darrell Issa asked then Secretary of State Clinton whether she, or any of her senior staff, had used a personal email account 'to conduct official business' in December 2012. But Issa, who wrote as chairman of the House committee on oversight and government reform, was ignored until more than a month after Clinton had stepped down in February 2013. And even then, the reply did not answer the question - instead going into detail over the State Department's email policy. Silence: Representative Darrell Issa (left) asked the State Department about the use of personal email for official business in December 2012, but didn't receive any answer until Clinton (right) had left the department . The leaked letter, obtained by the New York Times, casts a further shadow over Clinton just days into her bid to become the Democrat's 2016 presidential candidate. The former First Lady found herself at the centre of a storm in recent months after it was revealed she used her personal address during her time as Secretary of State. Even her Twitter profile picture was dragged into the row: it showed her on her Blackberry apparently sending emails while en route to Libya in September 2011. But there is no record of any emails on her official account that day - and she has since removed the picture from her account. Clinton has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account, calling it a matter of 'convenience', admitting to deleting thousands of emails. Clinton, however, has insisted every relevant email was now in the hands of the State Department. But critics say by using her personal email account, she has avoided scrutiny. The presidential hopeful handed over 55,000 emails sent from her personal email account between 2009 and 2013 - her time as Secretary of State - but it is not yet known what they contained. However, it has already been claimed that the documents have 'huge gaps'. Shadow: Clinton is likely to want to play down this latest revelation as she begins campaigning in Iowa . Campaigning: Clinton is hoping to win over voters with a more personal approach than in 2007 . Clinton is likely to want to play down these latest revelations, as she begins a campaign for nomination which is set to last until the end of June next year. A Clinton aide told the New York Times on Tuesday 'her usage was widely known to the over 100 department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, as her address was visible on every email she sent'. Clinton is currently on a two day tour of Iowa, opening her 2016 campaign with visits to a family-owned produce company and speaking with small-business leaders outside Des Moines. The decision to focus on smaller, more personal interactions during the campaign is in stark contrast to 2007, when she spoke to huge crowds. The grandmother-of-one will spend a second day in Iowa campaigning today.","Letter to State Department in December 2012 asked about personal email .

"Washington believes that the ‘special relationship’ between Britain and the US is over, according to a secret briefing document seen by The Mail on Sunday. The memo for members of Congress states damningly that ‘the UK may not be viewed as centrally relevant to the United States in all of the issues and relations considered a priority on the US agenda’. Dated April 2015 and drawn up to brief the Senate and House of Representatives on the impact of Britain’s General Election, the memo also warns that the UK faces turmoil if there is a hung parliament. Scroll down for video . The 'special relationship' between Britain and the US was strong under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan . The document – prepared by the Congressional Research Service, an in-house intelligence body that gives confidential analysis to legislators – states that while Britain and the US are likely to ‘remain key economic partners’, a ‘reassessment of the special relationship may be in order… because its geopolitical setting has been changing’. The memo, edited by Derek E Mix, the CRS’s chief European affairs analyst, says that the development of organisations such as the G20 group of major economies has led to a decline in the ‘influence and centrality of the relationship’. It also states that the UK’s continued importance to the US will hinge on the future success of the economy – and Chancellor George Osborne’s implementation of spending cuts. It reads: ‘A significant degree of the UK’s international influence flows from the success and dynamism of the British economy, further raising the stakes on whether the UK can sustain stronger economic growth while continuing to pursue ambitious fiscal consolidation.’ Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama serve food  during a Downing Street barbecue in May 2011. When Cameron visited the White House in January, he insisted the President had said the special relationship was ‘stronger than it has ever been’ Winston Churchill first coined the phrase 'special relationship' in a speech in 1944 . The ‘special relationship’ has been deployed by generations of politicians – most notably Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher – to describe the close political, diplomatic, cultural, economic, military and historical relations between the two countries. It was first coined in a 1944 speech by Winston Churchill, when he said it was his ‘deepest conviction that unless Britain and the United States are joined in a special relationship… another destructive war will come to pass’. Increasingly, however, the relationship has come to be seen as one-sided, with British Prime Ministers more keen to flag up the alliance than US Presidents. When David Cameron visited the White House in January, he insisted the President had said the special relationship was ‘stronger than it has ever been’. The memo also expresses concern about a potential UK exit from the EU following an ‘Out’ vote in any referendum, saying: ‘Both the positive and the negative aspects of a prospective life outside the EU are more difficult to foresee.’ Explaining the significance of a hung parliament, the congressional document says it could result in a ‘brief period of ambiguity’ and ‘constitutional uncertainty’.","Memo damningly states UK may no longer be 'centrally relevant' to the US .

"SeaWorld has been accused of drugging killer whales, painting over their injuries and keeping them in pools so shallow they get sunburned. A lawsuit filed by Joyce Kuhl, a grandmother from South Carolina who visited the Orlando park in 2013, claims orcas are being kept in 8ft deep holding pools, leaving the marine animals 'essentially roasting'. In her suit, Ms Kuhl alleges that the resulting burns are so bad staff are forced to paint the orcas with black zinc oxide to disguise the injuries . Scroll down for video . Accusations: A lawsuit claims the orcas at SeaWorld Orlando are being kept in shallow holding pools which give them such bad sunburns staff are forced to paint them to disguise the injuries . Ms Kuhl wants to have her $97 ticket reimbursed, as well as tickets for millions of other visitors who have been to the park in the past four years, accusing SeaWorld of 'false, misleading and deceptive business practices,' the Orlando Sentinel reports. In her suit she also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at SeaWorld, and that the chlorine used in their tanks is 'many times stronger than household bleach'. Kuhl's suit details allegations of forced breeding, incestuous inbreeding and whales kept together in ways that make them hyper-aggressive so that they fight and inflict deep gashes on each other. She claims to have witnessed whales 'banging their heads against their tanks and grinding their teeth on the walls, floors and bars until their teeth break or are worn to the pulp, allegedly because of boredom, frustration and ennui,' The Guardian reports. This is the second lawsuit against SeaWorld in less than one month, with similar filed in California which accuse the company of 'misleading the public' by claiming that their killer whales are happy. The lawsuit also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at SeaWorld . This follows a failed social media campaign last month, during which SeaWorld organised a Q&A on Twitter using the hashtag #AskSeaWorld. Instead of the intended questions about opening hours, animals and attractions, the company was asked if their 'tanks were filled with orca tears'. Many people used the opportunity to express their anger at the company and questioned its ethics for keeping killer whales and other animals in captivity, often in solitary confinement. User @AshleeCheese_ tweeted: 'Why do you keep breeding whales when you barely have enough room for one? #AskSeaWorld.' Another campaigner @Jennyleeisme followed suit and tweeted: 'Do you really believe Shamu Stadium is the most advanced marine mammal habitat? Have you seen the ocean? #AskSeaWorld.' Animal rights group PETA was quick to make its views known, tweeting a series of photographs of the marine creatures, reportedly showing signs of their distress. The backlash comes two years after the release of the documentary BlackFish, which questioned the conditions orcas were kept in following killer whale Tilikum's fatal attack on trainer Dawn Brancheau at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010. The 80-minute film, which premiered at Sundance in 2013, prompted questions about the ethics of keeping the large mammals in tanks. Since its release, attendance has declined at the company's parks in Orlando, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas. SeaWorld's stock value has also plummeted. To counter the backlash, the firm, which has participated in animal rescue programs for more than 50 years, has announced plans to nearly double the size of its orca enclosures in upcoming years. Recent figures show attendance to the company's 11 parks between October and December 2014 fell 2.2 percent to 4.4 million from 4.5 million in the same period a year ago.

"Nicola Sturgeon tonight backed the immediate transfer of all tax powers to Holyrood in a move that threatens a multi-billion pound cut to Scotland's budget. The First Minister was forced to admit her MPs would vote for fiscal autonomy as early as next year, despite the catastrophic collapse in North Sea oil revenues. Such a move would leave a massive £7.6billion black hole in Scotland's finances, triggering either higher taxes, deeper spending cuts or unsustainable borrowing levels. Nicola Sturgeon said she would back calls for all tax powers to be devolved to Scotland 'as soon as possible', but Labour leader Jim Murphy (right) warned this would leave a catastrophic hole in the country's budget . Miss Sturgeon struggled once again in a TV election clash screened by the BBC, just a day after she faced an audience backlash by refusing to rule out a snap second referendum on independence. She walked into a trap set by Labour leader Jim Murphy, who pointed out that one of the SNP's biggest supporters, billionaire Jim McColl, admitted Scotland is not ready for fiscal autonomy. But asked when she wants full tax powers, Miss Sturgeon said 'as soon as possible'. 'As Scotland's voice in the House of Commons, if the SNP is there in numbers we will be arguing for as many powers to come to Scotland as quickly as possible,' she said. 'I would like it as quickly as the other parties agree to give it.' Asked by Murphy 'would your MPs vote for it next year?', the First Minister replied: 'I would vote for it, would you support it?' To applause, the Labour leader swiftly responded: 'No I wouldn't. 'Absolutely not, and let me tell you why. This is the idea that we cut ourselves off from sources of taxation across the UK. Miss Sturgeon (centre) struggled slightly during a debate tonight in Aberdeen (pictured) just a day after she was booed for refusing to rule out another referendum after the election . Gaining full fiscal autonomy from the rest of the UK will likely leave Scotland with a £7.6billion shortfall in cash, according to independent experts, after the value of North Sea Oil plunged earlier this year . 'After the difficult time that Aberdeen and the north east of Scotland been through, the idea that we voluntarily give up the pooling and sharing of resources, the ability to transfer money across these islands - I don't think it makes sense.' The debate was held in Aberdeen University's Elphinstone Hall, and was chaired by the BBC's James Cook – who has been the victim of 'Cybernat' abuse in recent days. Miss Sturgeon, Mr Murphy, Tory leader Ruth Davidson and LibDem leader Willie Rennie – who all took part in an STV debate the previous night – were joined by UKIP's only elected politician in Scotland, MEP David Coburn, and Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie. During the one-hour clash: . Much of the debate focused on the SNP's support for 'full fiscal autonomy', which former First Minister Alex Salmond has described as 'home rule' and critics have branded 'independence by the back door'. It would see the devolution of every tax – including North Sea oil revenues – and leave only defence and foreign affairs reserved to Westminster, ending the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. Scottish Government official annual accounts show how Scots contributed £400 extra in taxes than the UK average last year, but received an additional £1,200 in public spending. Scots Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie (left) warned Miss Sturgeon against another referendum, while Scots Green Party Leader Patrick Harvie (right) called for an end to North Sea drilling . Last month, the highly-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) predicted that a 'fiscally autonomous' Scotland would have a massive £7.6billion black hole in its finances. That is the difference between the estimated budget deficit for the entire UK in 2015-16 of 4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Scotland's budget deficit of 8.6 per cent. According to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), offshore revenues are expected to shrink to only £600million in 2016-17. That is a staggering 13 times smaller than the most optimistic figures Alex Salmond based his independence blueprint on. Speaking after the debate, Tory leader Ruth Davidson said Miss Sturgeon's election campaign is 'beginning to unravel'. One member of the audience warned the First Minister that she 'doesn't speak for everyone' in Scotland. In the earlier STV debate on Tuesday, Miss Sturgeon said next month's General Election is not a 're-run' of the referendum, but pointedly said 'that's another matter' when asked about her Holyrood manifesto for 2016. Her weak response was met with audible groans from the audience. Ruth Davidson (left), leader of the Scots Conservatives, said Miss Sturgeon's election campaign was unravelling. Ukip MEP David Coburn was branded a 'disgrace' by Nicola Sturgeon . During the show, the SNP leader insisted: 'I do accept the result of the referendum. There is a triple lock on this. 'Before it is inserted in the manifesto, public opinion has to change, and then people have to vote for the manifesto if it is in it, then people have to vote for independence.' Pressed on whether the Tories would block another referendum, Miss Davidson said: 'I do not see an area where if the circumstances arose again that we would. 'However, we would feel a betrayal very deeply when we were promised time after time by Nicola, by [Deputy First Minister] John Swinney, by all her MSPs, MPs, MEPs and councillors that this was 'once in a generation' and we were told by the end of the campaign it was 'once in a lifetime'.' Mr Murphy said: 'You don't get a mandate from an opinion poll, you get a mandate from a manifesto and you have gone from being a proud co-leader of the big Yes campaign to being the head of the 'maybes ayes, maybes naws' campaign.' Mr Rennie said: 'Just imagine if we had a different vote last September. 'I think there would be blind panic as a result of what has happened in the North Sea. 'Nicola Sturgeon has got a nerve to continue to argue for a policy that was soundly trounced in the referendum.' UKIP’S Scottish leader David Coburn was last night branded a ‘disgrace’ by Nicola Sturgeon for comparing one of her ministers to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza. The First Minister rounded on the MEP after the Scottish Daily Mail revealed how he made the comparison when referring to Muslim minister Humza Yousaf. Mr Coburn was also roundly booed by the audience in the BBC leaders’ debate as he claimed ‘open door immigration’ has contributed to the rise in food banks, and demanded a cut in foreign aid because most of it ‘goes to dictators’. In a fierce exchange, Labour leader Jim Murphy told him: 'Don’t demonise immigrants. How dare you?' Ruth Davidson . Best bit: A passionate defence of the UK, describing it as a ‘social union as well as a political union’. Key clash: A row with Nicola Sturgeon over a second independence referendum, in which she warned that breaking the SNP’s ‘once-in-a-generation’ promise would be a ‘betrayal’. Worst bit: Forced to concede that Westminster would not stand in the way of another referendum if the SNP wins a majority. Verdict: Not quite as sure-footed as she was in Tuesday’s STV debate, but her honesty with voters and passion for the Union shone through. 7/10 . Nicola Sturgeon . Best bit: Branded David Coburn a ‘disgrace’ to his face for comparing SNP minister Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza. Key clash: A battle with Jim Murphy over ‘full fiscal autonomy’ and what it would mean for Scotland’s budget. Worst bit: Admitted SNP MPs would vote for full tax powers as soon as next year – coinciding with a dramatic slump in North Sea oil revenues. Verdict: Unlike last week’s UK-wide debate, she struggled under scrutiny from her opponents, with full fiscal autonomy now a millstone around the SNP’s neck. 5/10 . Jim Murphy . Best bit: Vowed to fight to keep the Barnett Formula ‘today, tomorrow and forever’. Key clash: Took David Coburn to task for ‘demonising’ immigrants in an explosive confrontation that left the UKIP leader in pieces. Worst bit: Forced to admit that a Labour government would make ‘targeted’ cuts, less than 24 hours after he claimed the party may not make any spending cuts. Verdict: A commanding performance, forcing Nicola Sturgeon to sign up to massive budget cuts for Scotland. 8/10 . Willie Rennie . Best bit: Huge applause when he used self-deprecating humour to warn Nicola Sturgeon against ‘breaking a promise’ that last year’s referendum was a ‘once- in-a-generation’ vote. Key clash: Desperately tried to distance the LibDems from their coalition partners during exchanges with Ruth Davidson. Worst bit: Squirmed over the LibDems’ broken promise not to increase tuition fees south of the Border. Verdict: Came out fighting after failing to make any impact in Tuesday’s debate, and delivered the best joke of the night. 6/10 . Patrick Harvie . Best bit: Won applause for accusing UKIP of trying to ‘cancel our membership of the civilised world’. Key clash: Left looking foolish by presenter James Cook, when asked if opposing ‘capitalism’ would be a ‘red line’ for Green MPs. Worst bit: Telling an audience in Britain’s oil capital the country must ‘minimise extraction’ of North Sea reserves, jeopardising thousands of local jobs. Verdict: David Coburn saved him from making the most ridiculous comments of the night, but his arguments were at the level of a sixth form school debate. 2/10 . David Coburn . Best bit: Claimed Scotland would have called in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by now if there had been a Yes vote in the referendum. Key clash: Clashed with every leader and the audience, and most of civilised society. Worst bit: Nearly every time he spoke. Booed for blaming immigration for the rise food banks and claiming foreign aid mainly goes to ‘dictators’. Verdict: Arguably should have lost his job weeks ago when he compared a Muslim minister to Abu Hamza. Added nothing to the debate. 0/10 .","Miss Sturgeon made the call in debate at King's College, Aberdeen, tonight .

"The sheriff who had former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez in custody for more than 18 months said Tuesday that he's a master manipulator and will probably do fine in prison now that he has been sentenced to life for murder. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said Hernandez knows how to use his charm and manipulate better than anyone he has ever seen, adding that the former football star is generally affable and polite and would try to use those qualities to get what he wanted at the Bristol County House of Corrections. 'He would make every effort to get extra sandwiches,' Hodgson said. 'He would just try to convince the officers to give him more than what they otherwise could get.' Scroll down for video . Former New England Patriots NFL football player Aaron Hernandez during his trial for murder (file photo) Staff members were directed to treat Hernandez like any other inmate, Hodgson said. Hernandez was convicted April 15 of the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. He will ultimately end up at the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski state prison. A lawyer for Hernandez did not immediately return messages seeking comment on the sheriff's remarks. After the verdict was delivered, staff from Bristol County brought Hernandez to a state prison not far from Gillette Stadium, where Hernandez used to play football in front of tens of thousands of cheering fans. There, he told them, 'I'll miss you guys, but they got it wrong,' Hodgson said. 'He didn't really have much of a change in his demeanor. He pretty much still had a swagger in his step.' Hodgson said the 25-year-old Hernandez has an ability to compartmentalize things and lock out the negative. 'He doesn't really look at it as jail,' Hodgson said. 'It's more like training camp.' Hernandez got into trouble from time to time in jail in Bristol County. He was accused of threatening to kill a prison guard and his family, and he got into a fight with another inmate. Asked how he thinks Hernandez will do in prison, Hodgson said he thought he'd be OK. 'He'll probably do fine. He'll be able to talk his way through everything,' Hodgson said, adding that disrespect is a 'hot-button' issue for Hernandez. 'If someone's trying to outwardly and aggressively disrespect him, that could create a problem,' said Hodgson. Hodgson said he had many conversations with Hernandez about his father, who died unexpectedly when Hernandez was 16, with Hernandez telling him how his father commanded respect whenever he walked into a room. 'His father was a huge, huge influence in his life and really his anchor,' Hodgson said. 'If you disrespected him, it's like you disrespected his father.'","Sheriff Thomas Hodgson who had Aaron Hernandez in custody for 18 months is opening up about the football star .

"This is the chilling message a mother wrote on Facebook a day after allegedly abandoning her quadriplegic 21-year-old son in the Pennsylvania woods with just a blanket and a bible. 'I'm so happy,' Nyia Parler, 41, commented under a new picture of her cuddling her boyfriend on Tuesday. Just 24 hours earlier, police say she wheeled her care-dependent son into a park near their home in south west Philadelphia and left him there, before going to stay with her partner in Maryland. Relatives, who had been contacted by the boy's school when he didn't turn up to class on Tuesday, commented on Parler's picture, 'nyia call me asap,' and 'How the hell you happy?!? Call me!' On Sunday police said that Parler will be arrested as soon as she is released from hospital herself. Parler was admitted to a Maryland facility on Sunday for an 'undisclosed condition' and faces charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangering, neglect of a care-dependent person, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, according to police in Pennsylvania. 'When her treatment is completed, we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition,' Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police said in a statement. Chilling: This is the message Nyia Parler wrote on Facebook hours after she allegedly left her quadriplegic son alone in woodland with just a blanket and a bible. Relatives contacted by the boy's school frantically replied . Charged: Parler (right) was detained in Maryland on Saturday night, charged with assault and neglect. Police say she left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left) in Montgomery County, Maryland . Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found here on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . Parler left her son — who also has cerebral palsy — lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair while she left town on a romantic getaway with her new boyfriend, John Ferguson, police said. He was found on Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park. Police believe he had been there for five days and the last time he and his mother were seen together was on Easter Sunday. She then boarded a bus to bisit Ferguson in Maryland, said Lt. John Walker of the Southwest Detectives Division. Walker said the victim was found around the corner from their home, and he described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place: 'She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area, takes him out of wheelchair, lays him on the ground, puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him, and then just walks away.' During the period he was exposed to the elements, the young man was 'completely defenseless' in an area with wild animals, with no water and in cold, damp weather, Walker said. 'It's only by the grace of God that he survived this. Amazing,' he said. Reports claim relatives have been trying to obtain guardianship of the boy from Parler (pictured) for years . Contacted in Maryland after the young man's school became concerned about her absence, the victim's mother told relatives and authorities that he was with her, Walker said. 'Obviously her statements made during the week were not truthful,' he said. Her boyfriend, however, assumed other relatives were caring for the young man and 'was in shock when he learned what happened,' Walker said. A 16-year-old son also residing with the family is now in the care of other family relatives, Walker added. Walker said the son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a deep cut on his back that caused concern about potential infection and possible eye injuries, but he appeared to be improving. 'He seemed to be a little happier yesterday,' Walker said. 'You could tell he knew his family was around and felt more comfortable. The 21-year-old, who is non-verbal and suffers from cerebral palsy, is now in Philadelphia Children's Hospital with his aunts, where he is being treated for dehydration and cuts to his back and eyes. Officials told NBC Philadelphia her son would have died if he hadn't been spotted by people walking along a nearby street. 'This kid is obviously a fighter. It's just unbelievable how we found him last night. It's just heartbreaking to see how another human, especially a mother, could treat him like that,' Lt. Walker of Philadelphia Police told ABC. Abandoned: A passerby noticed the 21-year-old here in a wooded Philadelphia park . The son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a cut to his back and eye injuries. According to Philly.com two of his aunts, who are with him in hospital, have been trying to obtain guardianship for years. A neighbor, who declined to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'She used to push him out to the school bus in his wheelchair, she seemed to care for him. Whenever I saw him, I saw her.' Another, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I would see them outside together in the summer when he got home from school. Nothing looked wrong, I didn't suspect anything.' Walker said the son was exposed to the elements and other dangers. 'A lot of things could have happened out there,' he said. 'Obviously he's in the middle of a wooded area. You have wild animals there ... this kid could not defend himself. He does not function at all.' Walker added : 'What we've learned so far is that the 21-year-old child lives with his mother, completely dependent on mom as a result of his condition. 'She also has a 16-year-old son who is staying with other family members. 'We know she left for Maryland on Monday to go see her boyfriend on a bus.' The man had been reported missing from class at Philadelphia's School Of The Future on Monday. However, when a teacher called Parler she told them they were both in Maryland and he was well. Rescuers used flashlights to find the non-verbal in the East Lansdowne area of Philadelphia on Friday night .

"Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has ordered an official probe into claims that a civil servant leaked an official account of a private meeting between Nicola Sturgeon and the French ambassador. The SNP leader has denied telling French ambassador Sylvie Bermann that she would prefer David Cameron to remain in Number 10 while suggesting that Ed Miliband was not Prime Minister material. Ms Sturgeon told supporters at a rally in Glasgow today that she had written to Sir Jeremy to demand an official investigation. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon, pictured, had asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate the leaked memo . She told supporters in Glasgow today that the Westminster establishment were afraid of the SNP's rise and called on Ed Miliband to commit to 'locking out' David Cameron from Downing Street next month . Ms Sturgeon completely denied claims that she secretly hoped David Cameron would win the election . She claimed that the story was a sign of 'panic' within the Westminster establishment over the surge of support for her party. She then called on Mr Miliband to publicly commit to working with the SNP to 'lock out' Mr Cameron from Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament. Ms Sturgeon described the account of her conversation with the French ambassador as '100 per cent untrue'. The memo was published in the Daily Telegraph was written by a British civil servant following a conversation with consul-general Pierre-Alain Coffinier regarding the meeting between Ms Sturgeon and ambassador Sylvie Bermann, who was on her first visit to Scotland in February. According to the memo: 'Discussion appears to have focused mainly on the political situation, with the FM stating that she wouldn't want a formal coalition with Labour; that the SNP would almost certainly have a large number of seats ... that she'd rather see David Cameron remain as PM.' The note went on to say that Ms Sturgeon had said she did not think Labour leader Ed Miliband was 'prime minister material'. The civil servant added: 'I have to admit that I'm not sure that the FM's tongue would be quite so loose on that kind of thing in a meeting like that, so it might well be a case of something being lost in translation'. Mr Coffinier - who was at the meeting - told Sky News that he had no recollection of Ms Sturgeon's alleged comments. He said: 'I do not know where this comes from, because it is certainly not in my report that anyone gave any preference.' David Cameron, pictured today, said any deal between Labour and the SNP would be a 'chaos alliance' A spokesman for the Ms Bermann said: 'While the Ambassador and First Minister, some time ago, discussed the political situation, Ms Sturgeon did not touch on her personal political preferences with regards to the future prime minister.' Attending an anti-nuclear rally in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: ""This story has already been shown to be 100 per cent untrue - having been comprehensively rejected by both the French Ambassador and Consul General. 'The real issue is how a second-hand and inaccurate account of this meeting - which was not even attended by the UK Government - came to be written by a UK Government civil servant and then leaked to Tory-supporting newspapers at the start of a General Election campaign. 'It suggests a Whitehall system out of control - a place where political dirty tricks are manufactured and leaked. And the Foreign Office now appears to be denying the very existence of such a document. Nicola Sturgeon would rather see David Cameron win the election because she does not see Ed Miliband as ‘prime minister material’, it was reported last night. A memo shows that the Scottish first minister told the French ambassador in February she would prefer to see Mr Cameron remain in Downing Street. The document, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, undermines the SNP leader’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office. The SNP’s opponents say the party would favour another Tory-led Westminster government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-English sentiment and make an ‘out’ vote more likely in another referendum. Written by a senior civil servant, the memo from February 26 states: ‘The first minister confessed that she’d rather see David Cameron remain as PM (and didn’t see Ed Miliband as PM material).’ She has denied the claims while last night Last night the French consul general told the Guardian that no such views were given by Miss Sturgeon, and 'absolutely no preference was expressed' on the outcome of the general election. 'I am therefore writing to the head of the UK civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, requesting an urgent inquiry into the circumstances of such a false account being leaked for transparently political motives.' The SNP leader added: 'Anyone who knows anything about me knows I don't want to see a Conservative government. I'm campaigning to get the Tories out of Downing Street. We've made if very clear that we will lock David Cameron out of Downing Street - the only person who's not made that clear is Ed Miliband. 'We've said that if there are more SNP and Labour MPs than there are Tory MPs, then we will vote to stop a Tory government even getting off the ground. I reissue my challenge to Ed Miliband today to say likewise.' Conservative Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'Who knows what the reality is there? I think the one thing that we do know is that the SNP seem to be doing very well in Scotland at the moment ... and it strongly suggests that the only way Ed Miliband could every come into office is in coalition with the SNP and that would mean chaos for Britain.' And a Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband still won't rule out a deal with the SNP because he knows he can't get into Number 10 without them - he's in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon has him on a leash. 'And we know what's in the ransom note: £148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: 'The First Minister might deny reports of her tete-a-tete with the French but we all know a Conservative-only government is the result of this election that the SNP want to see. A Tory PM governing alone in Downing Street and veering to the right fuels nationalist fires back home. 'Despite her fluffy, positive words about working with the rest of the UK we know what she really thinks. Her sole ambition is to break up the UK.' Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured, has announced a full investigation into the growing scandal . Ed Miliband, pictured, said he will not enter into any coalition with the SNP as he wants a majority . Mr Miliband described the leaked memo as a 'damning revelation' claiming the SNP were saying one thing in private and something completely different in public. He said: 'I'm very clear that there won't be a coalition with the SNP. That's not going to happen, As for how other parties will end up voting on a Labour Queen's Speech, that's a matter for them. I want a majority Labour government.' Mr Miliband refused to rule out any post-election deal where he would rely on SNP support to prop up a minority government. He added: 'What I'm saying very clearly is we are not going to have a coalition with the SNP. As for other post-election possibilities, I'm not getting into that.' Prime Minister David Cameron joined the row while campaigning in Oxfordshire today. He said: 'There is this coalition of chaos alliance we could end up with if we are not careful - an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt Britain - Labour - and the people who want to break up Britain - the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond. 'That's what we have got to avoid, that big danger of a coalition of chaos that would take our country back.' He claimed Ms Sturgeon's disputed opinion of the Labour leader 'told us something that I said about four years ago - that Ed Miliband is not up to the job of being prime minister. I think we knew that already'.","SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon dismissed claims she wants a Tory victory .

"Harvey Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman today gushed online about her 'wonderful husband'  - just days after it emerged he would not face criminal charges for allegedly groping an Italian model. In an apparent effort to push past the scandal, the British-born fashion designer, who turned 39 on Tuesday, shared an Instagram image of a large bouquet of flowers he had bought for her. 'Thank you for my beautiful flowers!!! #wonderfulhusband #birthday,' she wrote alongside the photo. Scroll down for video . Moving on: Georgina Chapman, who is married to Harvey Weinstein, shared this image to her Instagram page on Tuesday, with the caption: 'Thank you for my beautiful flowers!!! #wonderfulhusband #birthday . Scandal: Chapman, pictured with her husband in February, was reportedly 'furious' after he was accused of groping an Italian model in his Manhattan office last month and wants to put it behind her . The birthday gift comes four days after her Hollywood producer husband learned he will not face criminal charges after Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police he had groped her. Battilana had claimed that the 63-year-old father-of-five  touched her breasts and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca Film Center office in Manhattan on March 27. The Manhattan District Attorney's office investigated the model's claims but announced last Friday that it has decided not to prosecute Weinstein. Weinstein, who had always maintained his innocence, could have faced misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations proved true. Battilana reoprtedly refused to cooperate with authorities for four days after the complaint, which led to speculation  she made the allegation in a bid to try and land a part in one of Weinstein's films. Once that 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to cooperate and pursue the criminal case, according to sources. Claims: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police Weinstein groped her during a meeting last month . Denial: Weinstein, pictured last week, had insisted he had never touched the model and on Friday, yhe Manhattan District Attorney's office said it would not be prosecuting him . Weinstein founded Miramax with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. His wife founded the luxury label Marchesa. They have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Last week, a source told the New York Daily News that Chapman had been 'furious' following the reports and had been intent on continuing with her work and avoiding further embarrassment to her young children. On Instagram, she has shared photos of her work in the run up to Bridal Fashion week. 'The countdown begins,' she wrote alongside a snap of some of her designs on Monday. '5 days until the reveal!! Excited!! #marchesa #ss16 #bridal.' 'Any suggestion that these flowers were for anything but Georgina's birthday is a complete fabrication,' said a rep from the Weinstein Company. Focused on her work: Last week, Chapman, who co-founded luxury brand Marchesa, shared this image of her working on designs for Bridal Fashion Week, with the caption 'Doing what I love most!'","The designer shared the snap to Instagram on Tuesday, her 39th birthday .

"Tony Blackburn has called for lessons to be learnt after historic sex abuse allegations . Tony Blackburn claims disgraced entertainer Jimmy Savile 'tarnished' his era after his fellow colleague's names were 'dragged through the mud' during probes into historic sex abuse. The 72-year-old's long-term employer, the BBC, is still reeling from a string of allegations levelled against former staff - most of them Blackburn's vintage. Several media personalities were investigated and arrested following the launch of Operation Yewtree, including broadcasters Dave Lee Travis and Rolf Harris. The probe also exposed abuse by paedophile DJ Savile, who sexually assaulted staff and patients aged between 5 and 75 over several decades. The BBC Radio 2 presenter professed his deep shock at the headlines, explaining that most of his colleagues in the industry were 'just working hard' and 'having a good time'. 'It's upsetting, horrible,' he said. 'I never liked Savile, and I knew there was something about him that was odd but I didn't know what it was. 'I saw him very rarely but the way he was, you could never have a sensible conversation with him. 'But it was shocking when the stories came out. It's tarnished that era, and it wasn't really like that. Most of us were just working hard, having a good time.' His good friend and fellow DJ, Paul Gambaccini, was also caught up in the scandal after spending a a year under a cloud of suspicion when he was arrested over historical sex offences. In his case the 65-year-old was accused of having sex with two underage boys, however, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the charges last year. Blackburn said he is outraged at how Gambaccini was treated and has called for lessons to be learnt. He said: 'If somebody has done something wrong they should be punished but I do think there is something appalling going on when someone, anyone, can accuse you of something. 'In Paul's case, he didn't know the people - and your name is just dragged through the mud. I saw him very recently and the fact is that there has been no apology, and he has lost a lot of money and it is not right. You haven't done anything wrong but it sticks. We need to learn something from this.' Blackburn has remained unequivocally untouched by scandal, and explained: 'That's because I haven't done anything wrong, it's as simple as that,' he says emphatically. But the DJ, who started his career on pirate station Radio Caroline in 1964, has faced his own controversies after proclaiming he had bedded more than 500 women in his Sixties heyday. Blackburn said he never liked paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile (pictured), who sexually assaulted staff and patients aged between 5 and 75 over several decades . Rolf Harris and Dave Lee Travis were among Blackburn's former BBC colleagues caught up in the historic sex abuse scandal at the Corporation . He made the boasts in his 2007 autobiography Poptastic! My Life in Radio in which he said he had slept with 250 women – a number which he then doubled five years later in a magazine interview. The father-of-two, who was born in Surrey and brought up in Bournemouth by his nurse mother and GP father, now admitted: 'It was tacky, it was unnecessary and I wish I hadn't done it.' It only happened, he maintains, as his autobiography's ghost-writer said they needed a bit more sex, given the lack of drugs and 'rock n roll'. Blackburn says lessons need to be learned after his friend and colleague Paul Gambaccini (pictured) had charges against him dropped . 'I was quite open about it - I don't see anything wrong, and I never have, if two consenting adults make love that's their business, providing it is all above board. 'I wasn't that bad, I just had a really good time - but I wish I hadn't written about it quite so honestly as it hurt my mum and dad. It really wasn't clever.' Blackburn married Robin's Nest actress Tessa Wyatt, mother of his advertising executive son Simon, when he was 30 but she left him after four years when she discovered he had had an affair. He remarried in 1992, this time time to Debra, a theatrical agent 17 years his junior, and mother to his 18-year-old daughter Victoria, and the family live together in Hertfordshire. This time he has remained faithful and admits that when he discovered his calls had been intercepted during the phone hacking scandal, he wasn't fazed. 'When all the phone hacking started I was called by the police who told me my phone had been hacked,' he said. 'And I thought ""Well, fine. That must have been boring."" It didn't bother me as there was nothing to hide. So I never pursued it.' Three years ago he had to undergo laser eye surgery after he suffered a detached retina when he was mugged by three thugs who tried to steal his mobile phone as he left the BBC. 'It was like being descended on by a pack of wolves,' he said. 'They knocked me to the ground, but I managed to get at them with my umbrella and I did chase after them even though I had blood pouring down the side of my face. 'I was on the phone to my wife at the time so she heard it all. It was pretty horrible. 'I did report it to the police, but what could they do? It did shake me. My producer said ""they must have really hated your music"".' He has also recently started wearing a hearing aid to correct the creeping hearing loss after spending the last 50 years wearing headphones blasting music into his ears. ‘You can barely see it, it fits snugly in your ear and there’s just this little clear wire. And they don’t whistle. They’re pretty amazing. Wearing one just sharpens everything up a bit. They’re fantastic little things.’","Tony Blackburn claims disgraced entertainers 'tarnished' his era of DJs .

"This is the incredible moment a man narrowly missed being burnt alive by a massive fireball which erupted from the pavement. Father-of-two Shiraz Nawaz said he felt lucky to be alive after the 15-foot flames shot out of the manhole just seconds after he had walked over it in a busy street in the West Midlands. The 36-year-old had been on his way to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him. Flames as high as 15ft tall erupted from a manhole in the West Midlands just moments after a pedestrian had walked over it . Shiraz Nawaz, 36, said he felt lucky to be alive after he narrowly missed being burnt by flames shooting out of the manhole . As he turned around he noticed the charred ground and watched on as thick black smoke began billowing from the manhole. The smoke was followed by a huge blast of flame which shot out 15-foot of the ground on the pedestrian walkway. Further bursts of flame and thick black plumes of smoke were to follow. Despite his shock,  the building contractor was able to grab his phone in time to film the terrifying incident. 'Had it literally been a few seconds earlier I would have been walking right over it,' said a shaken Mr Shiraz. Mr Nawaz said he had been walking to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him and noticed the blackened cover . As he watched on in shock, thick black smoke began to escape from the manhole in the busy street in Shirley, Solihull . 'I'm so lucky I didn't get burned.  I think I used up one of my lives right there. 'I've never seen anything like it, and I have been in the building trade.' Miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident, thanks to Mr Shiraz who had evacuated the nearby takeaway. The former gas engineer told the staff to turn off the gas supply and also rang the fire service after the incident in the busy Stratford Road, Shirley, Solihull. Firefighters extinguished the blaze, which they said was caused by a fire in an underground link box - which distributes electricity - below the manhole. Neighbouring properties had to be evacuated and many others lost power for several hours as crews tackled the electrical fire which was thought to have started accidentally. Shiraz, who now fits kitchens and bathrooms, said: 'To think that I had just walked over that. 'The flames kept shooting up - maybe five or six times. The smoke was followed by a quick blast of flame which shot out of the manhole on the pedestrian walkway . Flames shot up to a startling 15-foot high and could be reaching the top of the nearby shop and take away fronts . 'I'm a building contractor so I knew that when I heard the noises it was something to do with electrics. It was like a buzzing. 'I knew what it was but I didn't expect flames to come shooting out straight away or anything like that. Shiraz was walking from his home to the Dixie Chicken shop around the corner from his home when he saw the flames at around 7pm on Monday. 'I got my phone out because I heard the actual noise and I think I saw a flash,' he said. 'I think I managed to get it on film just as the first real flames came up. 'It looked like it was coming from a manhole cover. It was quite shocking. 'I told the guys in the shop to switch off the gas and get everyone out. I told them to stop any unassuming person from walking down the road while I stayed on the other side. Flames were followed by more plumes of dark smoke continued to billow up out of the charred ground reaching several feet high . Miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident after Shiraz evacuated the nearby takeaway, told them to turn off their gas supply, and called the fire service . 'The guy in the shop grabbed me a couple of burgers after everything, so I guess it had a happy ending.' A spokesman for West Midlands Fire Service said: 'We had a number of calls about about it - probably five or six, maybe a couple more. 'It involved a fire in an underground electrical link box. The electrical supply was isolated by Western Power. 'Power was isolated to surrounding homes and premises for four hours. 'Three people were evacuated from one of the properties. 'We used a CO2 extinguisher and a hose real with foam, because it was an electrical fire. It was accidental.' Western Power Distribution workers were later seen repairing the man hole cover in Shirley, Solihull . The area had been evacuated and blocked off as Western Power Distribution employees worked to fix the underground link box . Incredibly no-one was hurt in the incident and quick-thinking Shiraz managed to grab his phone in time to take a film of the astonishing flames .","Shiraz Nawaz felt lucky to be alive after the flames shot out the manhole .

"A daughter whose mother died from breast cancer says she wishes she would have let her mother die as oppose to making her undergo more painful chemotherapy. Amber Phillips of Los Angeles expressed her support for the right to die law introduced in California on Tuesday that if passed next year will legalize physician assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. 'The pain and suffering took some of her dignity away when she became so ill that she was not able to work,' Phillips told Dailymail.com of her mother who died in the summer of 2012. Regretted her choice: Amber Phillips says she regrets making her mother undergo chemotherapy against her will when her breast cancer progressed to the point that she could not enjoy her life . Deteriorating: Connie Phillips, pictured in her final days, suffered long before her death in July of 2012 . Phillips told Dailymail.com that her mother asked about ending her life via physician assisted suicide on numerous occasions but said that at the time it was not a legal option for her. 'Had she had the choice to end her own life she might have been able to reclaim some of her autonomy and dignity,' Phillips added. Not only did Phillips die a slow and painful death, but she was unable to spend the final moments with her family because her two sons Owen and Ethan Phillips were on other sides of the country at the time. 'Everything happened so fast,' said Phillips. 'My brothers were on the other side of the country and both they and my mother would have wanted them to be there as she died. It might not have happened that way,' she said. Connie Phillips fought her illness for years before expressing her desire to end her suffering. Amber Phillips is not the only family member of a cancer victim who supports the right to die legislation. Back in February Debbie Zieglaer, the mother of terminal brain cancer sufferer Brittany Maynard who ended her own life in November of last year, expressed her support for her child's choice to die. 'My daughter Brittany Maynard wanted to die in her beautiful four-poster bed. As Brittany’s symptoms and pain from the large, infusive glioma brain tumor increased, she began to talk about how she wanted her death to be, who she wanted in the room with her, where she wanted them to be, what she wanted to hear,' Ziegler wrote for Dailymail.com. Family bond: Amber Phillips, pictured with her mother when she was a child, said that her mother would have wanted to end her own life to reclaim her dignity and would have wanted all her family members present . Right to die campaigners will use Brittany Maynard as a poster girl for a worldwide push for right to die laws. A video of the 29-year-old explaining why she was making use of legislation allowing death with dignity in Oregon has been watched by more millions of people on YouTube and has encouraged states like California to adopt the law allowing physician assisted suicide. Her mother has spoken out in support of helping terminal patients chose to die peacefully surrounded by loving family members. Like Maynard, Connie Phillips fought her cancer with fervor before asking that she be killed with the help of a physician. Sadly, Phillips was not granted the same opportunity as Maynard who lived in Oregon where her death was her own choice. 'She was a fighter,' Amber Phillips told KPCC's Public Insight Network of her mother Connie Phillips. She explained that her mother 'did radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy, had her lymph nodes removed, had a breast removed, meditated, and all numbers of treatments.' Despite the treatments, Phillips said that in 2008 her mother's cancer spread from her breasts to her bones and her lungs. Phillips said her mother did not want to receive more treatment but that she did it for her family because they could not bear to be without her. 'We nagged her, encouraged her to continue treatment when she didn't want to, bought her wigs when she started losing her hair, managed her diet with cancer-friendly foods, held her hand, and begged her to continue fighting for us,' Phillips said. Phillips says that in 2011 her mother's condition grew more grave. She had to quit her job as a teacher in Phoenix, Arizona and moved in with Amber Phillips and her husband in Los Angeles. Phillips says the medication prevented her mother from driving or being independent which was especially hard for her. Fighter: Before requesting physician assisted suicide, which was not an option at the time of her death, Connie Phillips tried to fight her breast cancer with a number of different treatments . 'She was on heavy narcotics so she couldn't drive, she was no longer in her own home, she no longer had her job, she was moved away from her friends and she became dependent on us,' Phillips said. 'This was incredibly difficult for her.' Phillips says she loved her mother so that's why she wanted her to live. Looking back she says she wishes she would have tuned in more to her mother's suffering and allowed her to end her treatment sooner. 'We just wanted her to live and we wanted her to continue fighting,' Phillips said wistfully. 'We really just didn't get it. We really bought into the possibility or the fairy tale that things were going to get better, when it was so clear that they were getting worse and worse.' Phillips says she ignored the signs that her mother was going to die, especially after her father died of a heart attack in the Spring of 2012. 'I just doubled down,' she says. 'I just felt like I couldn't lose both of them. I just thought I was going to fall apart. 'It was a lot of 'me' focus – what I could handle.' Phillips says her mother’s health continued to deteriorate and that at one point her mother lost her voice and started having trouble breathing. 'She lost her voice – something happened to her voice box, and she could only speak in this very high tone,' she says. 'She was having trouble breathing. We were just hoping she would get better.' Phillips said her mother became emaciated because she couldn’t hold down any food and all of her internal organs started shutting down. Lady liberty: Amber Phillips said her mother Connie deserved the freedom of choice over her life granted in the right to die law that if passed in California will legalize physician assisted suicide . In June of 2012, Phillips finally came to terms with her mother's wishes to end treatment and then called hospice care to their home. Phillips didn't allow herself to imagine her mother dying at first and still fought in her mind to keep her alive. She says she stayed optimistic because she and her mother took trips to Target together and would chat which made her think she had more time to live. 'we were still going to Target on the weekends, and taking weekend trips together,' said Phillips. Phillips gravely remembers July 2012 when her mother began to hallucinate and so she gave her consent to put her mother on the painkiller morphine which was her mother's wish. 'After the worst day of my life to that point, I gave my consent to put her back on morphine, knowing that she would die and knowing that this is what she wanted,' she writes. Connie Phillips died in her daughter's home on August 1 of 2012 year when she was just 65. Phillips told KPCC that the decision to die was her mother's and not hers to make and said she wishes she would have allowed her mother to end her suffering sooner. Sadness: Amber expressed sadness as losing her mother to cancer but even more pain in watching her mother decay and become a shell of the woman she once was . But Phillips says she doesn't think twice about telling her mother her love for her and her desire to keep her alive. 'I don't regret nagging her or telling her that I wanted her to be around because I loved her and was not ready to be without her,' she writes. 'But I regret standing in the way of a decision that was hers to make because I was selfish.' 'It was her decision, not mine,' Phillips recalled. 'And I regret that I took that decision away from her.' Close ties: Amber said her mother Connie died quickly while her brothers Ethan Phillips (left) and Owen Phillips (not pictured) were on the other side of the country . Phillips says she has been a long time supporter of assisted suicide, even before her mother died. Having to see her mother suffer from her illness has made her even more of a supporter of patient choices. 'If I want my mom to continue treatment because I want her around more, that's a struggle we should have within our family,' Phillips said. 'I don't think I ever would have felt like that's the government's call.' Phillips says she is aware that some  groups fear that this law could cause abuse for people with disabilities but said there are measures in the law to prevent that from happening. 'I do empathize with that concern,' Phillips told KPCC. 'in my experience,' she says, 'I've only seen it play out in such a way that people are not given the choice to end their suffering...There is a way to navigate potential abuses, without robbing people of the choice about their own lives.' Amber told Dailymail.com that the choice to live or die is a heartbreaking one, but one that belongs to every terminally ill individual.

"Doctors who treated brain cancer sufferer Ashya King in Britain yesterday accused the boy’s parents of putting his life at risk when they refused to let him have chemotherapy. Consultant Peter Wilson told a BBC TV documentary Ashya’s chances of long-term survival could have been halved by Brett and Naghmeh King’s decision to flee abroad with him before he had the treatment he was being offered here. Dr Wilson, clinical director for child health at Southampton General Hospital, claimed the chemotherapy was essential to reduce the chances of the five-year-old’s cancer returning. Scroll down for video . Clinicians in an ‘impossible situation’ as a result of King family’s flight to Spain after disagreeing with doctors . And in an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme he complained of the ‘vitriol’ to which he had been subjected as a result of the case, saying: ‘I personally received a letter from a person who said they wished my children got cancer and died.’ Mr and Mrs King had accused the hospital of planning treatment which would have left their son a ‘vegetable’ and took him abroad last year for proton beam therapy, an alternative form of radiotherapy. Mr King, 51, said Ashya did not need subsequent chemotherapy as his cancer was in remission. Last month, four months after the proton treatment ended, the family said scans showed ‘no evidence’ of the tumour. But Dr Wilson, a paediatric intensive care consultant, said Ashya should have undergone chemotherapy within six weeks of his original surgery to remove the tumour in Southampton last July, and said it was too early to say he had been cured. He told the BBC: ‘We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is… every month that goes by that he’s not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens. The family then went to Prague for proton beam therapy, and now say there is 'no evidence' of a tumour . ‘There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival – so survival going from 80 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent, which is quite dramatic.’ Dr Wilson said there was an ‘international consensus’ of medical opinion that Ashya’s form of brain cancer should be treated by surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After he had the surgery in Southampton his parents took him from the hospital without telling doctors. He was eventually given radiotherapy in the form of proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic, but his parents said the chemotherapy was not needed. They initially fled to Spain where they were arrested then released after the High Court approved their plan to take Ashya to Prague. The NHS eventually agreed to pay for the proton therapy there. Dr Wilson said there was a risk that tiny cancerous cells remained around the tumour site after the surgery, and that chemotherapy and radiotherapy were required to treat those cells to offer the best possible chance that the cancer would not return. The Kings were unavailable for comment but have said they wanted Ashya to receive the best possible treatment. Paediatric intensive care consultant Dr Peter Wilson said it was 'deeply unfair when the NHS is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all’ that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children .","Doctors and nurses have criticised Ashya's parents in BBC documentary .

"A mother of two has openly admitted she prefers her younger son boy and says the special bond is caused by his 'special smell' - and sniffs him all the time. Amie Cox, 33, of Victoria made the ready admission of the sensory bond she has for son Alex, 5, over her older boy William, 7, while appearing on an SBS Insight programme about sibling rivalry. Since her revelations surfaced on the Insight website, Ms Cox told Daily Mail Australia she has been attacked and been called 'a freak', but that she is 'a normal loving Mum'. She said that the bond with Alex's scent began from the first moment she held him after giving birth and that for the first six to 12 months of his life she didn't want anyone else to touch him or 'rub their smell on him' because it would interfere with his unique and special smell. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Amie Cox, 33, of Victoria, and her two sons, five-year-old Alex (left) with whom she says she has 'a special smell connection' and sniffs him 'all the time' and William, 7, who she says is more easygoing and has a normal relationship with his younger brother and she loves both boys equally . Since revelations about how she prefers the smell of her younger boy Alex, Amie Cox says she has been attacked on the SBS Insight website, but says he is a 'normal loving Mum' who treats her boys equally and older son William also thinks his brother Alex has 'a special smell' Amie Cox said she bonded to younger son Alex (pictured, right, with his brother William, 7) so strongly after his birth that she 'didn't like people to rub their smell on him by touching him' and that continued for his first six to 12 months, although she is now used to it . Ms Cox's revelations came to light during the taping of the programme when the studio audience was asked whether they had a clear preference for one child over another. Ms Cox didn't hesitate to answer 'Alex'. When the audience and SBS presenters reacted with amusement to her swift reply, Ms Cox said 'People have already ... you can't say that,' she said shrugging. 'If you said choose one to live or die, I wouldn't be able too ... like I love them equally. 'But Alex has a smell that he's had since he was born. I sniff him all the time. There's some sort of smell connection.' The Insight programme is based on research of modern families which shows sibling interactions can have a vital role in teaching children valuable social and life skills, as well as in shaping personality and behaviour. But, the programme researchers said, siblings also routinely get stuck into each other. 'Parents may see this rivalry as part and parcel of the sibling experience, however there is a growing body of research that links early sibling aggression with serious ongoing learning and mental health problems,' Insight says. Amie Cox says five-year-old Alex (left) who has the special smell which she appreciates because of the science of pheromones is 'a terror' while his brother William, 7 (centre) is more easygoing but both boys get the same amount of toys and love and she is a normal mother despite being attacked online as 'a freak' The 33-year-old said attacks on her for admitting she is very attracted to her younger son's scent are 'water off a duck's back' and that 'it doesn't bother me' because she is a good mother who gives her older son William just as many hugs as she does Alex . 'Are such disputes unavoidable, and do tensions always persist into adulthood?' Insight asks 'if competition and conflict between siblings is a good thing, and whether favouritism can affect this.' Ms Cox told Daily Mail Australia that she treats her sons equally and that her older son William also has appreciation for Alex's scent. 'William has the same smell connection with Alex as I do,' she said. 'It's about the science behind pheromones. 'They were on the couch the other day and William said ""Alex, isn't his skin so soft and he smells so nice"" and of course Alex said get off me. 'Alex is the terror. He's feisty and opinionated like me, while William is well behaved very easygoing and has a different personality. 'They still fight, but there's nothing vicious or violent about it. 'They are like puppies or tiger cubs. They're rowdy, but they're not particularly competitive.' The program also explores how this plays out in families from a culture where there is a hierarchical or gender preference. Guests , sisters Jen Paull and Melanie Colwell described how their perceptions of who was the family favourite affected their relationship with their parents. ' I'd describe her as a role model to me. I grew up basically wanting everything that she had,' Ms Paull said of her sister. 'I don’t think my parents knew how good they had it until they had Jenny,' said Ms Colwell. Brothers Nick and Tom Inatey said their relationship growing up was not competitive. 'We're not the two that are going to go out in the backyard and beat one or the other at . spor,' Nick said of Tom, saying his brother was 'hopeless' at sport. Tom readily agreed, 'Absolutely. That's very true.' Celia Harrison, who is the mother of twins said of her children, 'they’ll compete about who’s got the most cereal in a bowl and they’re measuring glasses to make sure someone doesn’t have more milk that the other one' INSIGHT: Siblings Showdown - Tuesday 7 April, 8.30pm, repeat Wednesday 3.30pm on SBS ONE .","A mother of two  admits she has a favourite child because of his smell .

"Kim Jong-Un has appeared in yet another unusual set of pictures, showing him allegedly climbing North Koreas highest mountain in nothing but an overcoat and leather shoes. The jovial dictator allegedly scaled the 9,000ft high Mount Paektu near the Chinese border, before telling troops at its peak that the climb was like 'nuclear weapons'. Pictures released by North Korean state media show the 32-year-old leader smiling on the  top at sunrise before visiting troops at the mountain's base. Scroll down for video .

Man of the people: Kim Jong-Un can be seen at the centre of the picture, dressed in black, as he poses for a photo with the troops on the mountain . Upon arriving at the top, Kim Jong-Un greeted Korean People's Army pilots, telling them that the alleged climb had given him mental energy 'more powerful than nuclear weapons.' This is just the latest of the dictator's publicity stunts published in state media, praising him  for unbelievable feats, following claims last week that Kim Jong-Un could drive by the age of three. 'Climbing Mt. Paektu provides precious mental pabulum more powerful than any kind of nuclear weapon,' the state-owned Rodong newspaper quoted Kim as saying. Mr Paektu, lying on the border with China, is considered a sacred place in Korean folklore and plays a central role in the propaganda glorifying the Kim family. He did it, honest! Despite being dressed for nothing more exhausting than a stroll, North Korean state media claims that the dictator had climbed the mountain before sunrise yesterday .

Pyongyang's state hagiography has it that Kim Jong-Il was born on the mountain -- although many historians say he was born in Russia -- and praises the family for their 'Mt. Paektu bloodline'. State-run news service KCNA reported that the young ruler  scaled Mt. Paektu on Saturday morning along with hundreds of fighter pilots as well as top army and party officials. Kim, like his predecessors, has made frequent 'field guidance trips' to industrial plants, army bases, and sacred sites across the country in what analysts say is an attempt at forging an image as an energetic man of the people. Kim, who took over after the death of his father in 2011, seeks seemingly impossible policy goals of improving the economy and developing the atomic arsenal simultaneously. He presided over the country's third nuclear test in February 2013 - its most powerful to date - amid fears that it was on track to developing technology to mount an atomic warhead on a long-range missile.

"Your private medical information is under threat. That's according to a study that found almost 30 million health records nationwide were involved in criminal theft, malicious hacking or other data breaches over four years. The incidents seem to be increasing. Compromised information included patients' names, home addresses, ages, illnesses, test results or Social Security numbers. Most involved electronic data and theft, including stolen laptops and computer thumb drives. The study didn't examine motives behind criminal breaches, or how stolen data might have been used, but cyber-security experts say thieves may try to use patients' personal information to fraudulently obtain medical services. Breach: A recently-published study that found millions of health records in the US were involved in criminal theft, malicious hacking or other data breaches over four years (file photo) Cases that didn't involve malicious intent included private health information being inadvertently mailed to the wrong patient. Hackings doubled during the study, from almost 5 percent of incidents in 2010 to almost 9 percent in 2013. Hackings are particularly dangerous because they can involve a high number of records, said Dr. Vincent Liu, the lead author and a scientist at Kaiser Permanente's research division in Oakland, California. 'Our study demonstrates that data breaches have been and will continue to be a persistent threat to patients, clinicians, and health care systems,' Liu said. The study appears in Tuesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. A JAMA editorial says there's evidence that the incidents are leading some patients to avoid giving doctors sensitive information about their health, including substance abuse, mental health problems, and HIV status. 'Loss of trust in an electronic health information system could seriously undermine efforts to improve health and health care in the United States,' the editorial said. Author: Dr. Vincent Liu,  a scientist at Kaiser Permanente's research division, was the lead author on the study . Patients should be alert to cyber threats, including 'phishing' emails from hackers posing as doctors, hospitals or health insurance companies, said Lisa Gallagher, a cybersecurity expert at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society. Those messages require clicking on a link to get information, and patients should instead should call the purported sender to verify whether the email is legitimate, she said . Patients should also double check doctor bills and other insurance company information. 'Don't throw away your explanation of benefits. Take a look at them,' Gallagher said. 'If you see care that wasn't provided to you, or dates and names of providers that don't make sense, go to the provider and report that.' For the study, Liu and colleagues analyzed an online database regulated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and containing mandated reports of breaches in health information protected by federal privacy law. Over the four years, 949 data breaches were reported across the country.  The numbers climbed annually, from 214 in 2010 to 265 in 2013.  Nearly 60 percent involved theft. Prominent cyberattacks affecting two health insurance giants happened after the study. Last May, a data breach hit Premera Blue Cross, affecting about 11 million customers and others. And between last December and late January, hackers accessed an Anthem Inc. database with information on nearly 80 million people. Authorities believe hackers in China may be behind both attacks, Gallagher said. She said cybersecurity is among key topics at her nonprofit group's annual meeting this week in Chicago. Members include doctors, hospitals, health plans and sellers of electronic health record products.

He appeared before magistrates in Camberwell today for a brief hearing, and will appear at the Old Bailey later this week . Meanwhile, Scotland Yard said tonight that a second man, aged 61, had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Mr Arwani. Charge: A man has been charged with the murder of Syrian imam Abdul Hadi Arwani . The imam ran a building company as well as preaching at various mosques before he was shot dead and his body abandoned in a Volkswagen Passat last Tuesday night. Cooper, from Brent in north-west London, was remanded in custody by a judge at Camberwell Magistrates' Court and ordered to appear at the Old Bailey within the next 48 hours. He wore a grey tracksuit during the minute-long hearing, and spoke only to confirm his name. Earlier, the CPS said in a statement: 'The Crown Prosecution Service has today authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Leslie Cooper, 36, with the murder of Abdul Hadi Arwani. Mr Arwani was shot dead in the Greenhill area of London on April 7, 2015. Mosque: Mr Arwani was a preacher at the An Noor mosque and cultural centre in west London . Car: He was found dead in his black Volkswagen Passat in Wembley last Tuesday night . 'Mr Cooper now stands charged with a criminal offence and has the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.' The family of Mr Arwani have thanked the community ‘for the outpouring of support during this extremely difficult time’. In a statement, released through Scotland Yard, Mr Arwani's son Murhaf said: ‘We are touched to learn how many people my father helped, advised and inspired in his short life.’ Mr Arwani also urged anyone who may be able to help with the investigation to come forward. He said: ‘If anyone has any additional information that can help with the investigation, we urge you to please come forward and speak to the Metropolitan Police. ‘Your co-operation will help us close this painful page and begin to move on with our lives, in the knowledge that the person who took away our father will be brought to justice and duly punished for this heinous crime.’ A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Leslie Cooper, 36, of Brent, NW10 was charged on Tuesday, April 14 with the murder of Mr Arwani and has been remanded in custody to appear at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court at 14:00hrs this afternoon.' A post-mortem examination found that Mr Arwani, a father of six, died from gunshot wounds and counter-terrorism officers were tasked with investigating his murder. He was an imam at the An Noor mosque in Acton, west London, from 2005 to 2011, but left the institution after being embroiled in a row with other leading figures there. Mr Arwani was a passionate opponent of Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime, and supported the opposition seeking to unseat the dictator. He was apparently forced to flee his home country after he was caught taking photographs in the town of Hama, which was devastated by a government massacre in 1982. After he was found dead, Mr Arwani's family paid tribute to him calling him 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet', and called on members of the public to help find his killer. An Noor has been linked with extremism after a number of radical preachers were invited to speak there, but friends of Mr Arwani have insisted that he held moderate and pro-Western views.

"Watching George Osborne enjoy scampi and chips with a glass of cider and a chat with the locals in a Somerset pub garden, it is hard to believe that only three years ago he was virtually scared to leave the safety of his Treasury office. He felt besieged and intimidated. There was little evidence his hardline ‘austerity Britain’ policies were working. His nervy demeanour and pallid complexion reflected the sickly economy. In the eyes of critics he was a hate figure – and it was getting to him. ‘It’s fair to say that by 2012 it was tough economically, and I got myself into a position where I was hunkered down in the Treasury,’ George Osborne drinks a pint of Somerset cider as he is interviewed by Political Editor Simon Walters at The Cotley Inn, near Chard, Somerset . Osborne reflects as we chat at the Cotley Inn in Chard during a break in an Election campaign tour of the South West. ‘I was saying, look, if people don’t like the plan or whatever, well, you know… so be it.’ The nadir came when the Chancellor was booed at the Paralympic Games. Worse, it happened in front of his children, Luke and Liberty, now aged 13 and 11. Did he feel he couldn’t take any more? ‘I never personally felt, erm, low,’ he says slowly, giving a rare glimpse of his emotions. ‘But I’m not going to pretend it was easy. ‘The most difficult thing was explaining it to my children – it’s not an easy conversation to have.’ Osborne has gone from being booed in front of his two children at the Paralympics to being credited with helping to turn Britain's economy around . Osborne did not consider throwing in the towel, but he knew that he had to break out of his Treasury bunker. ‘I thought, hold on, you cannot do this in this job – you have to go out and explain yourself, meet people, expose yourself to fresh ideas.’ He gestures with outstretched arms, hands clenched, recalling the moment he got a grip. Since then, confidence in the economy has risen on the same slow but steady path as that of the Chancellor himself. And he did more than look at himself in the mirror politically. He went on the 5:2 diet and lost 2st. On the day of our interview, a national newspaper compared the new-look Osborne to dashing Latin heart-throb actor Antonio Banderas – quite a change from the days when he was derided as a Regency fop. ‘It’s definitely moving in the right direction!’ he laughs. More waspish and engaging than David Cameron in private, Osborne has always looked more awkward and unsympathetic in public. It is one of the reasons he stood aside when Cameron ran for the Tory Party leadership. He is not the type to emote in public at the drop of a hat – a basic skill required by modern leaders. His sense of isolation in his early days as Chancellor was compounded by being separated from his family as a result of his and wife Frances’s decision in 2010 to carry on living in their family home in London instead of moving to Downing Street. They thought it would make it easier to preserve a ‘normal’ family life. It did the opposite. ‘I never saw the kids or Frances, because I was up so early and back late,’ Osborne says. His morale improved dramatically when the family did move into Downing Street, one of the few U-turns Osborne has made. ‘I see the children all the time now, in the morning, and I can pop up in the early afternoon if I’m going out in the evening,’ he says cheerily. ‘I feel very lucky.’ Osborne also had some stark warnings for the voting public - saying Britain under Labour will mimic France's course since it voted in socialist Francois Hollande as president . Osborne’s tour of the West Country has been designed to target seats where the Tories are fighting the Lib Dems. At Hawkins Garage in St Austell, Cornwall, to promote the Government’s apprenticeship scheme, the Chancellor was shown by 17-year-old trainee mechanic Dale Wilkes how to drain a car sump. Osborne’s hand ended up drenched in oil. If he had been asked to do it in his ‘hunkered down’ phase he would have found it torture. Here, with his skinny frame in blue garage overalls, it wasn’t easy to tell him apart from the apprentices in the gloom beneath the car ramp as Dale passed him a spanner. From St Austell it was back to Somerset and Yeovil, where Osborne hopes the Tory candidate will unseat Lib Dem David Laws who was, until two weeks ago, a Coalition colleague. Osborne was such a fan of Laws that when the Coalition was formed in 2010, he made Laws his deputy, stating that he was ‘put on earth to be Treasury Chief Secretary’. ‘Well, he didn’t last long in that position!’ hoots Osborne with a fiendish grin. Laws was forced to resign after he was caught up in an MPs’ expenses scandal which led to him being painfully ‘outed’ as gay. Osborne’s ruthless political approach allows no room for sentiment. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem who succeeded Laws as Osborne’s Treasury deputy, claimed that an unnamed ‘very senior Tory’ told him: ‘You take care of the workers, we’ll take care of the bosses.’ Was it Osborne who said it, as many suspected? ‘No,’ the Chancellor snaps. But if he has rescued the economy and Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are so useless, as he always claims, why aren’t the Conservatives ahead in the polls? Is it time to press the panic button? ‘The campaign is going as we wanted it to,’ he insists. Really? ‘Yes. We always thought it would be close.’ Mr Osborne said he never 'personally felt low' about being booed at the Paralympics in 2012, but had to explain it to his children . But Miliband is proving more resilient than the Tories expected. ‘Only because he’s standing behind podiums in front of Labour supporters,’ he mocks. Tory MPs claim that their party’s campaign lacks passion and that Cameron’s Australian election guru, Lynton Crosby, is too aggressive and too powerful. Osborne stands foursquare behind them: ‘David Cameron leads this Election campaign from the front.’ It provokes him into showing some passion of his own. ‘I’m not about to hand over the keys to No 11 to Ed Balls, saying, “Go and wreck all the good work we’ve done and ruin the lives of the people of this country.” Absolutely not!’ The one U-turn Osborne has made during the last five years is moving his wife Frances (pictured) and their children to No 11 Downing Street, so he can be closer to them . He says that if Labour wins, Britain will become an economic basket case like France did after socialist Francois Hollande won power. ‘France is an example of how quickly the mood can turn sour, jobs go, debts pile up. People will say, “My God, Britain is going backward instead of forward.” Osborne is in his stride now, spitting venom. ‘All this sanctimonious rubbish you hear from Labour about standing up for the many not the few… the people who suffer most when Labour governments screw up the economy are the poorest.’ A measure of the transformation in his standing was indicated when last month Cameron named Osborne as one of three potential successors – and no one laughed. So would he like to become PM? ‘I’m not a politician who spends my life thinking, “What if…?” and “What when…?” ’ Rot, he can be every bit as calculating as Labour’s Machiavellian Peter Mandelson, we tease him. ‘I’m not rising to that!’ he laughs. Osborne was back on the campaign trail yesterday in his Tatton constituency, combining politics with a family day out. He was accompanied by Frances, a successful author and daughter of former Tory Minister Lord David Howell, and Luke and Liberty. ‘We’re all really looking forward to the Election. The children are interested in it. My son went through the newspaper the other day and marked up what he thought were good stories for me and bad ones,’ he chuckles. ‘Then The Voice came on TV and we switched over to that.’ With that, Osborne takes another sip of his Somerset cider, aptly called Thatchers Gold. It slakes Osborne’s thirst for now. But he will be left with a permanent bitter taste if the Tories don’t win Election gold on May 7.","Osborne sits down with the Mail on Sunday while on the campaign trail .

"A hospital which ran out of space to store bodies in its mortuary after 'an unprecedented number of deaths' resorted to leaving them in a refrigerated lorry parked next to a load of bins, it has emerged. Bosses at Queen's Hospital, Burton, Staffordshire, admitted they didn't tell relatives about the arrangement and a spokesman has claimed the use of a lorry is normal practice across the country. Bodies were transferred to the mortuary for viewings, then returned to the truck, according to one hospital worker. Temporary mortuary: The refrigerated lorry - where bodies were stored after the hospital ran out of space in its mortuary over the Easter weekend - parked outside Queen's Hospital in Burton, Staffordshire . Queen's Hospital in Staffordshire said it experienced an unprecedented number of deaths over the Easter weekend. Relatives were not told about the arrangement to use a refrigerated lorry as a temporary mortuary . The hospital said there were an unprecedented number of deaths over the Easter bank holiday weekend, with many undertakers closed during the four-day break. A hospital spokesman said families were not informed that their deceased relatives were kept in the refrigerated truck over the bank holiday period as it treated the temporary service as an extension of its fixed mortuary. Chief operating officer for Burton Hospitals Trust, Brendan Brown, defended the use of the lorry . Brendan Brown, chief operating officer for Burton Hospitals Trust, said that the temporary mortuary service adhered to the same robust standards and regulations as the normal mortuary. He said: 'Our priority is always patient care and ensuring that our patients and their relatives are treated with dignity and respect at all times. 'This approach extends to any essential contingency planning we may need to do as a trust, for example, the need to install temporary mortuary services when required, to help us increase capacity when faced with increased demand for those services. 'Putting the needs of patients and their families first was the basis for our decision to employ the use of temporary mortuary facilities.' Mr Brown added that the temporary facility was no longer on site as it was brought in only as and when required. A spokesman said the use of a refrigerated lorry was normal practice at hospitals across the country and, as most undertakers were closed on bank holidays, the hospital mortuary had filled up. A hospital employee said: 'Bodies were being viewed in the mortuary by relatives and then they were being transferred into this trailer and put on beds.'","Bosses admitted they didn't tell relatives about the arrangement .

"A Neighbourhood Watch official has been handed a restraining order following a bitter row with his neighbours over a garden gate. Married couple John and Karen Copleston claim Paul Phillips, 67, 'constantly harassed' them over a petty dispute after they moved a gate at the back of their £210,000 house in Poole, Dorset. Retired Mr Phillips, the treasurer of the local Neighbourhood Watch scheme, accused the Coplestons of putting the garden gate up on communal land and took the matter to council planners. Scroll down for video . Married couple John and Karen Copleston said neighbour Paul Phillips, 67, had constantly harassed them over a petty dispute after they moved a gate at the back of their £210,000 house in Poole, Dorset . When the couple challenged him they say claim embarked on a campaign of misery that forced the Coplestons to install CCTV cameras to catch him in action. The covert footage caught Mr Phillips fiddling with the gate's lock, waving and smiling at the camera and repeatedly setting off a motion sensor. But on Friday the case against Mr Phillips was dismissed, although a three-year restraining order was imposed on him under the Protection from Harassment Act by magistrates in Bournemouth. The long-running dispute between the neighbours began three years ago and a year ago the row became centred on the gate at the end of a shared passage both houses back on to. Karen and John Copleston (pictured) outside their property - Mr Phillips' home is on the far right . The gate in question: Mr Phillips accused the Coplestons of putting the garden gate up on his land . The Coplestons claim the gate has been at the end of the shared path since they bought the property in 1987. After taking advice from police they moved the gate to halfway down the path where it provides access onto their property - but is also directly next to Mr Phillips garden gate. Mr Phillips, a former Poole council employee, argued the gate should not be there at all as it is in the shared easement. He said the previous gate had been a hazard as it was rusty and did not allow enough room for his wife's invalid buggy. Caught: Paul Phillips, 67, was captured on a covert camera as he repeatedly set off a motion sensor at night . Banned: Phillips was also seen smiling and waving at the camera as he embarked on a campaign of terror . Row: The long-running dispute between the neighbours began three years ago and a year ago the row became centred on the gate at the end of a shared passage both houses back on to . The Coplestons said he continued to complain and would stand outside the gate early in the morning and late at night. They said Mr Phillips even installed his own CCTV cameras on his property which he would use to watch them on a monitor in his bedroom. Mrs Copleston, 49, said: 'All I want to know is why? 'Why did he start this? Why did this happen to us? I don't understand why and that's what's very hard for me.' Mr Copleston, 53, added: 'It started off with something petty and it just got bigger and bigger. 'Luckily, our little camera picked up enough that we could take this to court. 'I don't use computers much myself, so it was always Karen by herself when she saw the footage of him at the gate. 'It's been frightening and very stressful for her and it's had a real effect on her health.' Prosecutor Timothy Sullivan said: 'The proceedings arose out of a long-running acrimonious dispute between neighbours. 'The prosecution says relations broke down as a result of the defendant's anti-social behaviour. 'The victim said she felt like a prisoner in her own home.' The Coplestons pictured with their gate - Mr Phillips' gate and garden are on the left . Pathway: Mr Phillips argued the gate (pictured) should not be there at all as it is in the shared easement . Speaking after the case, Mr Phillips said: 'Myself and my wife are now in the process of selling our home because of this dispute. 'It has been horrific for us. I'm delighted at this result - I couldn't stand another day worrying, 'What's going to happen next? 'I have been a law abiding citizen all my life and have no criminal convictions and have not been in any trouble with the police until this stupid charge was brought up. 'My wife Enid and I have already moved out of our home and into sheltered accommodation to escape the aggression we encountered regularly.'

"SpaceX has released dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic. The video, taken from a plane yesterday, shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side. The 14-storey booster manages to hit the barge, but its high speed and tilt causes it to explode on impact. Scroll down for video . SpaceX has released dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a drone barge in the Atlantic Ocean . The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. The video, taken from a plane yesterday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side . The booster manages to hit the barge, but its high speed and tilt creates a huge explosion on impact . United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies should arrive the six space station astronauts on Friday. The rocket was was due to take off yesterday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. On board the Dragon capsule is an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. The booster managed to land on the barge but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment will arrive Friday . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed second landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The ISSpresso machine uses a normal Lavazza coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. While the booster landing didn't go to plane, the launch was successful. It took place at 4.10 ET from Florida under perfect conditions, after a attempt had to be scrubbed on Monday due to lightning .

"The mother of a young woman who suffers from lupus, an inflammatory disease which affects the immune system, has hit back at a stranger who left a cruel note on her daughter’s car claiming she had no right to park in a disabled space – despite the fact that she has a handicap permit. Corinna Skorpenske, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took to Facebook to publicly shame the anonymous note writer, while also defending her daughter Harley Jo, a student at Ohio State University, and her condition. 'My first reaction was anger,' Corinna told Yahoo Health. 'On top of everything she deals with she didn't need this. Harley is very strong, and many times she just lets it go. But because she is human I know she feels something.' Noted: Harley Jo Skorpenske, who suffers from lupus, discovered this note on her car after stopping at a CVS in Cleveland, Ohio . Keeping up appearances: The disability caused by Harley's illness is not visible to others, but presents her with a battle every day . The harsh note, which was left on Harley’s car, despite the fact that that her official handicap tag was clearly visible, read:  'You should be ashamed! When you take a handicap spot, an actual disabled person suffers. You were not raised as you should have been.' The person who wrote it evidently saw Harley walk into the pharmacy unaided, and assumed that she was lying about being disabled. In response to the note, Harley's mother Corinna wrote an open letter on Facebook, hoping it would eventually reach the person whose ignorance had so upset her daughter, and also aiming to raise awareness for non-visible 'ghost diseases' such as Harley's. Including a photo of the note lying on top of Harley's handicap tag, Corinna wrote in her post: 'To the person who left this on my daughter’s car. You'd never know: Harley may struggle every day, but she continues to persevere, unbeknownst to many of those around her . Mom knows best: Corrina Skorpenske (pictured) hopes to find the writer of the note and change that person's - and others' - perceptions about 'ghost diseases' 'Wishing so much for you to have stopped and talked to this amazing person before leaving this. If you had, you would have known that my daughter has a disease.' Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack its own tissue, leading to inflammation that results in visible swelling and joint pain. The disease affects women much more frequently than men and leaves suffers feeling extremely fatigued . The condition is also typified by a 'butterfly rash' which spreads across the face of many with the illness. There is no cure for lupus, but most of those afflicted are able to live a normal lifespan on medication. Corinna went on to explain in detail the laborious battle her daughter has been through since being diagnosed with lupus aged 16. 'It started with her joints swelling and the pain being so bad she could hardly walk,' Corinna said. 'But she continued going to school and keeping up with her community service.' The teenager went on to suffer a facial rash and hair loss - and had to attend her prom in a wig. She would go on to battle debilitating muscle pain, hearing loss, multiple lung collapses and a month-long stay in the hospital that forced her to postpone her studies. But, incredibly, the young lady always made it back - although 'not at 100 per cent' her mother explained. 'She struggles every day with permanent damage she has had to one side of her body and with hearing loss, but baby she keeps going!' gushed Corinna in the letter. 'I think you would love her': Harley's mother leapt to her daughter's (pictured) defense in an open letter, describing her as a fighter and an 'amazing person' 'I may not be a perfect parent, but I know I did good with her!' Corinna's letter is finished with a plea to the writer of the note, saying she hopes to find him or her: 'Not to tell you how wrong you were in leaving that note...but to give you the opportunity to meet My Girl. I think you would love her [sic].' 'People with ghost illnesses are often labeled as lazy or fakes,' Corinna told Yahoo Health. 'We never know what burdens people struggle with. Often we are so quick to judge or make assumptions, but if we just take the time to ask them, they are often very willing to educate them on it. Their pain and discomfort is real.'","Corrina Skorpenske, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took to Facebook to publicly shame the person who left a cruel note on her daughter’s car .

"Catholic bishops in America have denounced Wolf Hall as a ‘prejudice-laden presentation of the past’ as the acclaimed BBC drama was broadcast in the U.S. for the first time. The review attacked the six-part series as ‘a work of fiction that adopts a narrow, revisionist and anti-Catholic point of view toward the religious turmoil of the Tudor period in which it’s set’. The latest remarks echo criticisms voiced by clergy in the UK, who tore into the series for its 'perverse' depictions of the historical characters when it first aired. Scroll down for video . Bishops in the USA have slammed Wolf Hall, starring Damian Lewis, after it was broadcast for the first time . The audience is encouraged to support 'monster' Thomas Cromwell, played by Mark Rylance in the hit series, a damning review by the Catholic News Service in America said after the first episode was aired in the USA . The review also slates the depiction of Catholic martyr Sir Thomas More, played by Anton Lesser in the show as an 'evidence-flouting caricature' that is 'sleazy, mean-spirited and just plain rude' A review for Catholic News Service, an agency of the U.S. Bishops’ Conference said that the show encourages the audience to ‘root for the self-made commoner Thomas Cromwell’ when in fact he was a ‘monster’ who engineered a reign of terror and murdered anyone who stood in his way. In contrast, the drama’s depiction of Sir Thomas More, a Catholic martyr, is ‘not a pretty sight’, said author Joseph McAleer. ‘The future saint is barely recognisable: sleazy, mean-spirited and just plain rude,’ he writes. ‘This evidence-flouting caricature is light-years away from the man of principle.’ A Washington Post reviewer warned the distortion of historical facts in Wolf Hall pointed to 'ideological bias' US media were generally looking forward to the historical drama being shows on Masterpiece PBS as a 'great British import', with Homeland star Damian Lewis as King Henry VIII and Claire Foy playing Anne Boleyn . Gregory Wolfe said that the adaptation of Hilary Mantel's book 'could obscure important lessons' The criticism from the U.S. Catholic Church follows that of Mark Davies and Mark O’Toole, the Catholic Bishops of Shrewsbury and Plymouth, who said Wolf Hall was guilty of ‘anti-Catholic’ depictions of More, played by Anton Lesser, and for its whitewashing of Cromwell, the hero of the drama, played by Mark Rylance. Most U.S. media looked forward, however, to the opening episode of the series, broadcast on Masterpiece PBS last night, as a great British import co-starring Damien Lewis, the anti-hero Brody in the U.S. series Homeland, playing King Henry VIII. One of the few critical reviews of the adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s historical novel appeared in the highly-influential Washington Post, however, which warned viewers that the distortion of the facts pointed to a ‘clear ideological bias’. ‘What makes for great drama may not make for good history,’ said the review by Gregory Wolfe. ‘Mantel’s version could obscure important lessons from that dark period that have continuing relevance for the present moment,’ he added. Wolf Hall was BBC2’s most popular drama since 2002 , gaining an average of 4.4million viewers during its six-week run.","Review by Catholic News Service says hit show is not historically accurate .

'It was like every other morning, I was always vigilant, I was always keeping an eye out,' he said. He parked his vehicle and got out to deliver thousands of dollars to the Highland Park Tavern, according to the Courier Mail. That's when he noticed a man approaching him wearing a motorcycle helmet. 'Straight away I thought this guy, his body language was very aggressive,' Mr Heneker said. 'I've seen him and said: ""get back, get back, stay back"".' However the man pulled out a pistol and pointed it straight at Mr Heneker, who was also armed at the time. 'Take the money, they money is there, just take the money,' Mr Heneker recalled telling the gunman. But instead, the thief decided to reach for Mr Heneker's gun which is when a struggle ensued between the two men. The father-of-two appears to be distraught after shooting Mr Rahman three times . Mr Heneker speaks to police soon after the incident occurred last year . Mr Heneker said he made the decision to shoot at his attacker in a bid to save his own life . During the tackle, Mr Heneker says he was concussed but was able to pull off the gunman's helmet. Yet he was was still unable to see his attacker's face. It was at that very moment the father-of-two made the decision to fire three shots at his attacker in a bid to save his own life. When the gunman rolled over and faced the security guard, Mr Heneker recognised him straight away. 'It was shock horror. There was absolutely not one moment from the beginning to the end that he identified himself,' Mr Heneker said. Mr Rahman was a former workmate who worked alongside Mr Heneker as a security guard for Border Security. Mr Heneker told A Current Affair how he had worked with Mr Rahman for two years, who had also made the same cash drop off at the tavern during that time. He says he is still struggling to cope with the fact that he had killed one of his mates. 'It's horrible enough to shoot someone you don't know. But when you've had a relationship with someone and you thought they were your friend,' Mr Heneker said. 'It's been very, very difficult. Every day has been difficult. 'You realise that you've taken someone's life. A life that cannot be replaced.' It was later discovered that Mr Rahman's gun was fake. Police did not charge Mr Heneker over the incident, according to the Herald Sun.","Wayne Heneker says the incident a year ago still haunts him today .

"The Muslim couple who were abused by a middle-aged woman on a Sydney train are 'hardworking, honest and kind' parents of a little baby boy who moved from Pakistan several years ago seeking a better life in Australia. As NSW police sources told Daily Mail Australia a formal investigation is 'definitely' under way into Wednesday's incident, friends of Hafeez Batthi, 33, and his wife, Khalida, 26 painted a picture of the Islamic couple as 'committed' members of the community in Brisbane. The family regularly attend the Holland Park mosque, community spokesman Ali Kadri said, and they are raising a newborn baby son, Mohammad, in the country which they are grateful to call home. The couple were in Sydney for just a day when they were abused by an unknown woman on an Airport Line train on Wednesday afternoon. Stacey Eden, 23, overheard the ranter insulting the Muslim couple as 'ISIS terrorists' and was recorded on video standing up for the couple. Scroll down for video . Abused on the train: Young parents Hafeez Batthi, 33, and his wife, Khalida, 26, have been described as 'hardworking, honest and kind' by members of the local Islamic community . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted . Now, in an extraordinary act of gratitude, the Brisbane couple's mosque in Holland Park has offered Ms Eden and her partner an all-expenses-paid trip to visit the Gold Coast for a night and to see their mosque. Ms Eden, a blood collector for a pathology company who was born and bred in Sydney's eastern suburbs, said she was planning to consider the 'lovely' offer after the overwhelming wave of international media attention passes. Mr Bhatti told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the ugly incident, which occurred on the Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday. 'She asked my wife why she was wearing a scarf when it was hot outside - when my wife answered her I thought the woman was asking to be friendly,' Mr Bhatti said. 'Then she started saying Muslims like us are trying to conquer Australia and behead everyone here. We were absolutely shocked. 'It was just very disappointing.' Mr Bhatti said another woman nearby supported the racist woman, and the incident caused his family to miss its flight home. 'She said all Muslims should be kicked out of Australia - I tried to calm things down by telling her we love everyone,' Mr Bhatti said. He also said his wife was 'very shaken up' after the incident, to the extent she questioned if it was worth staying in Australia. Hafeez Bhatti, who was racially abused along with his wife on a Sydney train, thanked the woman who stood up for them . Police are urging anyone who witnessed the attack, which was caught on camera, to come forward . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti said on his Facebook account . 'This sort of thing has happened before, but you try to ignore it and the ignorant people behind it; there are lots of very good people in Australian and only a few bad ones,' he said. 'God bless Stacey Eden who supported us.' Mr Bhatti reached out to Ms Eden on his Facebook page after the story emerged. 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted. Ms Eden was scheduled to meet police on Friday afternoon and detectives were attempting to contact Mr and Mrs Bhatti. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Bhatti vented his frustrations with the attack, when he posted: 'once again, victim of racism by an old Christian lady.' He also discussed the events and said it started after the woman touched his wife's head like she was blessing her, before 'she started her ignorant comments'. Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent. 'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport. Ms Eden told Daily Mail Australia the couple alighted the train at Sydney International Airport . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot. Ms Eden said the woman was saying 'horrible and hurtful things'. 'She told me if I was in their country I would have been stoned to death because I was wearing a dress. 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'She was saying a lot of things I just got to the point where I had heard enough.' The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg. Mariam Veiszadeh (pictured), a lawyer and public advocate for the rights of Muslims, says incidents such as these are increasingly common . 'I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness)' Mariam has been the target of racist attacks herself . 'It was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything. People were just listening. I know they were scared,' Hina said. As for Ms Eden, she told Daily Mail Australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online, having posted the video just yesterday. 'Good on you for sticking up for whats right more people should be doing the same,' wrote punter Rachel Lambert. 'Well I don't know you but thank you, thank you for understanding,' said Shahiq Sarkar. Overwhelming response: Ms Eden has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online . 'I hope some day when you need help and are boxed in a corner someone as bright as you is there to support you just like you did for those poor souls. 'We really need to look for the best in people and understand that its a few rotten apples who try to spoil the lot. 'All the best wishes for you.' One comment even asked: 'RU single? Lol'.

"Stevie McCrorie has been crowned the winner of The Voice UK 2015, after beating fellow contestant Lucy O'Byrne in the final. Now mentor Ricky Wilson, his fellow celebrity judges Rita Ora, Tom Jones and Will.i.am, and most of all bosses at the BBC will all have their fingers crossed for his success. Because it's not just a hit single Stevie needs, he also has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts. Scroll down for video . Can this year's The Voice UK champion Stevie McCrorie break the winners' curse? His mentor Ricky Wilson is confident Stevie could be just what the BBC needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule . Leanne Mitchell, the first ever winner of The Voice UK, has been dropped by her record label and now works as a holiday camp performer. The very job she was hoping to leave behind when first auditioning for the show . Series one winner Leanne Mitchell, mentored to success in 2012 by Sir Tom Jones, blew everyone away with her version of Whitney Houston's I Would Run To You in the live final. But despite much excitement surrounding her first single, she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts. Then a year later came her album, a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions, which failed to chart in the top 100. Some, including The Script frontman and former Voice coach Danny O'Donoghue, believe Leanne didn't have the right work ethic. When asked last year about Leanne's flop, he said, 'I was told by Tom Jones, and by the label as well, that Leanne just did not want to work as hard as you have to work to be a pop star.' Leanne won the public vote in the final of The Voice UK's first ever series, but her debut single, a cover of Whitney Houston's I Would Run To You only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . Leanne Mitchell has now returned to her previous employment, singing for holiday campers at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton-On-Sea, Norfolk, after failing to make her mark on the music industry . After being dropped by her label Decca, Leanne is now working in the job she thought she'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton-On-Sea, Norfolk. The singer has defended her efforts, suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she'd finished writing her album. But can the same be said for series two winner, Andrea Begley? Former The Voice UK coach Danny O'Donoghue criticised Leanne Mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the BBC talent show, but has failed to make his own winning act, Andrea Begley, who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013,  into a household name either . Partially sighted Irish singer Andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor Leanne, but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal, she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other TV talent shows like Simon Cowell's The X Factor . The partially sighted singer from Pomeroy, Northern Ireland, now 29, won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow Irishman, Danny. She even commented on the failings of her predecessor Leanne, and said that she was determined to do things differently. 'Everybody is obviously aware that last year things didn't go maybe as well as they could've done, and I think lessons have been learned,' she told the Mirror, shortly after being crowned champ. Andrea's album, The Message, released in October 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts, but compare that to the success of most X Factor winners, and you soon understand the singer's disappointment . But while Andrea is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal, her success hasn't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like The X Factor might bring. Her debut single, a cover of Evanescence's My Immortal, charted at number 30, while her follow up, Dancing In The Dark, originally by Bruce Springsteen, didn't make it any further than 113. Andrea's album, The Message, released in October 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts, but compare that to the success of most X Factor winners, and you soon understand the deflation in the Begley camp. Will.i.am won the third series of The Voice UK with Jermain Jackman, a young singer from Hackney, London . 2014 The Voice winner Jermain saw his debut single And I Am Telling You, a cover of the Broadway number made famous by Jennifer Hudson in musical Dreamgirls, chart at just number 75 . Hot on the heels of Andrea was Jermain Jackman, who won last year's series with coach Will.i.am. If a slow start killed Leanne Mitchell's chances, Jermain and Will had better kick this career into gear. The singer from Hackney in London, still just 20-years-old, saw his debut single And I Am Telling You, a cover of the Broadway number made famous by Jennifer Hudson in musical Dreamgirls, chart at number 75. Despite various public appearances, once with Mitch Winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter Amy Winehouse, Jermain's debut album this month has landed at number 42. Compared with X Factor's 2014 winner Ben Haenow, whose debut single landed the Christmas number one spot, Jermain's success has so far been what you could call limited.

Despite various public appearances, once with Mitch Winehouse (pictured centre) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter Amy Winehouse, Jermain's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . The glitter falls from the ceiling...but the real hard work is just beginning for Stevie McCrorie . So can Stevie McCrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of The Voice UK? His debut single will be Lost Stars, a cover of Adam Levine's hit from the film Begin Again, which was nominated for an Oscar this year. The Scotsman has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival T in The Park already. Stevie's coach Ricky Wilson, frontman of rock band Kaiser Chiefs, has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism. When asked if he's worried about the growing number of The Voice UK flops, he simply replied, 'Stevie hasn't won it before.' So now it's all eyes on you Stevie! No pressure... Though it's not always the winners who reap all the success (Steve Brookstein, case in point), the X Factor has produced far more chart successes than The Voice UK. Here are just a few of the best-selling artists that came from Simon Cowell's ITV show: . One Direction They didn't win, in fact they came third, runners up next to Matt Cardle and Rebecca Ferguson in 2010, but Simon Cowell's boyband has sold over 50 million albums and quite literally, taken over the world with their legion of fans. Leona Lewis Despite having left Simon Cowell's label Sycon last year, Leona remains one of the show's biggest successes, having sold over 4.4 million singles off the back of her 2006 win. JLS The runners-up of the 2009 series, JLS went on to sell over 3.9 million singles and 2.7 million albums, before splitting up in 2013. Olly Murs He came second to Joe McElderry in 2009, then went on to sell almost as many albums as JLS and co-present the X Factor's sister show Xtra Factor in ITV2 with Caroline Flack. Alexandra Burke After winning the 2009 series following her duet with Beyonce, Alexandra went on to rack up more than 1.25 million sales for her debut single Hallelujah. James Arthur Before the singer landed himself in hot water with volatile Twitter rants, he clocked up over 1.2 million sales of his first single Impossible after winning the 2012 series. Little Mix The first ever group to win the show in 2011, Little Mix have now beaten The Spice Girls' chart success in America and raked up an impressive 132million VEVO views. Rebecca Ferguson Though she came second to Matt Cardle in the 2010 series, Rebecca has just released her third album Lady Sings The Blues and has enjoyed steady chart success.","Leanne Mitchell has been dropped by her label and sings at a holiday camp .

"The family of a teenage burglar left seriously injured when he fell through a roof during a school break-in have been left with a £150,000 legal bill after trying to sue the council for not doing more to secure the premises. Thomas Buckett plunged 15ft on to a concrete floor after friends dared him to jump on a glass skylight, and sustained life-changing head injuries as a result. A court heard the group of teenagers had broken into the school’s tuck shop before scaling the roof on a Sunday in May 2010. Defeat: Thomas Buckett, 21, faces a huge legal bill after unsuccessfully suing Staffordshire County Council . Injuries: Mr Buckett had to undergo invasive surgery when he fell through the roof of a school after breaking in to the tuck shop and stealing food and drink . It was originally claimed that Thomas climbed on the roof of Clayton Hall Business and Language College in Newcastle-under-Lyme to fetch a football. But the court heard that a police officer who investigated the break-in wrote an email of support to the council, stating that he had made the family aware ‘this incident was the fault of Thomas and his friends messing around’. PC David Stubbs added: ‘I have made the family aware that if any claims are made against the school my report will show the school is not at fault.’ Judge Peter Main told Telford County Court: ‘There were few measures, reasonably achievable within the likely school budget, [which] it could have taken to prevent all acts of trespass outside school hours.’ He acknowledged that the school should have risk-assessed the likelihood of youths gaining access to the flat roof. However, he ordered the Buckett family to pay the council an interim payment of £150,000 in costs by May 4, a figure which could climb as high as £260,000 after further assessment. School: The bungled break-in took place at Clayton Hall Business and Language College in Stoke-on-Trent . Happier times: Thomas Buckett with mum Mandy. The family faces financial ruin after they were left with a £150,00 legal bill after failing to sue the council . Teenager: Mr Buckett, who was 16 at the time, is pictured left in his school uniform and right while he was recovering in hospital . TaxPayers’ Alliance spokesman Jonathan Isaby welcomed the court’s ruling, saying: ‘It’s good to know that despite our ever-creeping compensation culture it is still possible for vexatious cases like these to be thrown out.’ Thomas spent two weeks in a coma following the fall and suffered ten skull fractures. Doctors removed half his skull and repaired it ‘like a jigsaw’ in a revolutionary procedure involving specialists from Italy. He lives with his mother, 48, who is now his full-time carer, father Andrew, 50, a supervisor for a maintenance firm, and older brother in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Mrs Buckett said her son had suffered life-changing brain injuries, although she declined to elaborate on the extent of his recovery yesterday. However, Thomas, who is now 21, was listed as a ‘protected person’ on court paperwork, a term used to describe somebody who lacks capacity to conduct proceedings for themselves. His mother was listed as his ‘litigation friend’, somebody with the power to make decisions about the case on behalf of the protected person. Mrs Buckett said the family had funded both the legal action and her son’s care. Asked if she may have to sell the family’s bungalow to pay the council’s costs, she said: ‘I don’t know what’s going to happen yet. I need to speak to my solicitor.’ She declined to comment further. Recovery: Mr Buckett had to undergo a pioneering procedure which allowed him to walk and talk again . Fan: Mr Buckett as a teenager posing with former Stoke City manager Tony Pulis . The family sued the council under the Occupiers Liability Act 1984, which covers the duty of care owed by a landowner or occupier of premises to persons on site ‘other than their visitors’, who suffered injury as a result of the ‘state of the premises’. Lawyers argued the council had ignored a long-term problem of trespassing at the site during weekends and holidays. Judge Mann acknowledged that Thomas had been ‘very seriously injured as a consequence’ of his actions, but said he had to be guided by evidence, not sentiment. Staffordshire Police said two other teenagers were cautioned for burglary and criminal damage in connection with the college break-in, but no other charges were brought. The county council defended its decision to pursue the legal challenge to court. Chief executive John Tradewell said that defending the case was ‘about fairness to the taxpayer’. He added: ‘The county council will continue to help Thomas access the care and support he needs to live as fulfilling a life as possible.’ The Bucketts’ lawyers did not return calls for a comment.","Thomas Buckett, 21, broke in to tuck shop at school in Stoke in May 2010 .

"A Florida mother has accused a school of threatening to suspend her five-year-old autistic son because of 'essential oils' he wears to help combat  his illness.

Jessica Kemp from Eustis says teachers at Seminole County Elementary threaten to remove kindergartner Logan from class because the oils smelled and were a distraction to youngsters around him . The 32-year-old puts the oil on his neck as she believes it keeps him calm and focused . She claims her boy has been using them all year, but then a teacher's aide complained. Speaking to Click Orlando, she said: 'Why is it not OK? Nobody is telling me. I'm just being told that he smells. 'I haven't been told that anybody's been switched out of the room .

'I could put chemicals in his body, but I can't put anything natural on him that has some kind of smell?' she added.

"Self-inflicted? The only other prisoner who rode in a police van with Freddie Gray on April 12 told investigators that he believed the 25-year-old was trying to hurt himself, according to a leaked affidavit . A prisoner who shared a ride to jail with Freddie Gray claims the 25-year-old was trying to injure himself inside a police van before he died from unexplained spinal cord injuries, according to a leaked police report. The report was leaked to the Washington Post under the proviso that the prisoner remains anonymous - raising questions about its accuracy and the favorable light which it shines on the Baltimore police force . In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he claims he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The Washington Post obtained the affidavit from a person who asked the prisoner, who remains jailed for violating a restraining order, not be identified for fears over their safety. Officials in Baltimore have warned protesters that the investigation into Freddie Gray's death will not be resolved by tomorrow - despite rumors to the contrary. City chiefs have been attempting to manage growing expectations they will immediately decide whether to prosecute six officers involved in the arrest of Gray who later died of injuries he apparently received while in custody. Authorities confirmed they plan to turn over findings of a police investigation into the death to a state's attorney by Friday. In the past week, Gray has become the new face of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, with many believing his death was caused by police during or after the arrest. His death has not only prompted demonstrations in Baltimore, but in several cities across the nation. However, just how Gray sustained the life-ending injuries has remained unclear with both the Baltimore Police and Department of Justice revealing little of their respective on-going investigations. The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we’ve seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' And local reporters have also found inconsistencies with the leaked affidavit. According to WBAL reporter Jayne Miller, police originally said that the second prisoner in the van told investigators that Gray was 'mostly quiet'. Sources also told the station that by the time the second prisoner was in the van, Gray was unresponsive. Cell phone footage captured the moment Gray was arrested by police near a housing project in west Baltimore on April 12. Police say Gray fled when they tried to talk to him, and that after tackling him to the ground they found him carrying an illegal switchblade knife and took him into custody. Scroll down for video . Clues: The hour-long period between Gray's arrest (captured in bystander video above) and his arrival at the hospital has remained a relative mystery until the Washington Post obtained the sealed affidavit . Gray appeared to still have some mobility when officers were putting him into the police van, but it's unclear how much officers were aiding him into the car . Gray died the morning of April 19 at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center from his spinal injuries . In the bystander video, two officers are seen pinning Gray to the concrete with their knees. When they pick him up to lead him to the van, Gray appears to struggle with walking and can be heard yelling out in pain. The image of Gray being placed in the van is the last time he is seen before arriving at the hospital about an hour later with a partially severed spinal cord. Police have so far denied causing Gray's injuries, but have not explained how he became so severely injured in their custody. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts claims Gray had the capacity to walk since he is seen stepping into the police van in the bystander video. About five minutes into the 30-minute ride, the police officer driving the vehicle pulled over to put Gray in leg irons. That officer described Gray as 'irate' and 'continued to be combative in the police wagon', Batts said. Angered: Gray's death has sparked protests not only in Baltimore, but across the nation. Above, thousands took part in a student-led protest in Baltimore on Wednesday . After another five minutes, the officer made yet another stop, asking another cop to check on Gray. That officer found Gray on the floor because he had not been properly restrained with a seat belt  -a violation of department policy. During this stop, Gray asked for medical help due to his asthma and Batts said officers ignored Gray's worries and continued on to pick up the other prisoner - the 38-year-old man quoted in the recently-released affidavit. When the van arrived at the jail for booking 30 minutes after Gray's arrest, he was found on the floor of the vehicle unconscious. He was taken straight to the hospital, and died a week later due to a severed spinal cord. The Baltimore Police Department is still conducting their investigation into Gray's arrest. It was originally thought that the report would be released on Friday, when the department hands over their findings to the state attorney's office. However, a police spokesman clarified that statement on Wednesday, saying they would be not be releasing anything to the public  and the decision to do so would be up to prosecutors. Six police officers involved in Gray's arrest and transportation are currently suspended pending the investigation. The report was released on the same day that a family member of one of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest spoke out to defend their loved one on CNN. Defending the cops: A relative of one of the six police officers currently suspended over Gray's arrest spoke with CNN on Wednesday . The family member, who chose to remain anonymous but appears to be female, said she was speaking out because she didn't think it was right that no one was standing up for the officers. She says her law enforcement relative, who she says is African American, believes Gray was injured before he was taken away in the police van on April 12. The relative also shot down allegations that the police officer behind the wheel of the van may have driven eratically on purpose to get back at an 'irate' Gray. She says that since paddy wagon drivers are called to the scene of arrests, the driver wouldn't have been emotionally involved with what happened when Gray was apprehended. While she believes that her relative is free from any blame, she added that she suspects the police department is hiding something and that there may be a few 'bad apples' amongst their ranks. 'Why can't they figure out whether this gentleman was injured when he was being chased? Or where he was injured? There are a million cameras everywhere.' The relative says her biggest fear is that all six officers will be punished for Gray's death, which she thinks only a few may have been directly responsible for. When asked how her relatives is doing, the woman responds: 'How would anybody be doing in a situation like this? In a situation where you got out there, you risk your life, you make a little bit of money and then something bad happens and nobody is standing behind you, such as the city that you served. 'How would anybody be doing when someone is dead? Just because they wear that uniform doesn't mean that they don't hurt or that they're not upset or that they don't blame themselves. 'They're human beings not machines.'","The prisoner who rode in a police van with Freddie Gray on April 12 in Baltimore says Gray was trying to hurt himself .

"The New Horizons spacecraft has taken its first colour image of Pluto and its largest moon Charon ahead of its arrival in three months. Taken from a distance of 71 million miles (115 million km), the blurry image doesn’t reveal a huge amount of detail - but it is a sign of things to come. As the spacecraft gets closer and closer, the images will continue to improve until it flies by on 14 July - humanity’s first ever visit to Pluto. Nearly there: After more than nine years, the New Horizons spacecraft is now just three months away from its historic encounter with Pluto. And now the spacecraft has taken its first colour image, shown, revealing the dwarf planet (the bigger blob) and its moon Charon . After a journey of more than nine years, Nasa’s New Horizons spacecraft is now reaching the climax of its thrilling mission. It has traveled longer than any space mission in history to reach its primary target - with its pedometer measuring more than three billion miles (4.8 billion km). Its arrival at Pluto will be the last world in the ‘classical solar system’ to be explored. In July this year New Horizons will become the first spacecraft ever to visit Pluto. It was launched on 19 January 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph (58,536 km/h) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth orbit, 100 times faster than a jetliner . After passing the orbits of all the major planets from Earth to Neptune, New Horizons is now beginning its final leg of its 3 billion-mile (4.8 billion km) journey. On 14 July 2015 the flyby of Pluto will begin. Using a suite of instruments, the spacecraft will map the surface of Pluto and its moon Charon to a resolution of 25 miles (40km) - far better than anything possible before. This will reveal the surface features of Pluto - which may include ice. As it flies past, it will also look back at the two bodies against the sun, to look for telltale signs of an atmosphere. Despite the long journey, New Horizons will be travelling at such a speed that the flyby will last only around two hours - beginning at 11.49am GMT (06.49am EST) on 14 July and ending just after 2.15pm GMT (9.15am EST). After passing Pluto, New Horizons will flyby one or several Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), other bodies beyond the orbit of Pluto. The mission will officially end in 2026. Pluto was demoted from a ‘planet’ to a ‘dwarf planet’ in 2006 when other objects of a similar or greater size were found. But regardless, the mission is of huge importance for our understanding of how bodies form even at great distances from their host star. ‘New Horizons is one of the great explorations of our time,’ said New Horizons Project Scientist Hal Weaver at the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. ‘There’s so much we don’t know, not just about Pluto, but other worlds like it. ‘We’re not rewriting textbooks with this historic mission - we’ll be writing them from scratch.’ The latest image of Pluto and Charon was captured by the Ralph camera on the spacecraft from a distance equivalent to the sun to Venus. At a relative speed of 30,000 mph (50,000km), New Horizons will cover that distance in just three months. The image shows Pluto with a sort of reddish colour and Charon - which is just over half the size of Pluto - considerably dimmer. Our best images of Pluto so far are mostly attempts from Hubble - but they are not much better than this photo. This makes the New Horizon mission particularly exciting, as it will reveal the surface of a world we know very little about. Not since humans first started sending spacecraft into the solar system has a comparable mission been seen. Our best images of Pluto so far come from the Hubble Space Telescope (shown is one of the images), so the arrival of New Horizons is hugely exciting for scientists, who have waited many years to catch a glimpse of this distant world and unravel some of its secrets . New Horizons (artist's illustration shown) was launched on 19 January 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph (58,536 km/h) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth orbit, 100 times faster than a jetliner. Owing to the speed of New Horizons, the observations of Pluto will last just two hours . The flyby caps a five-decade-long era of reconnaissance that began with Venus and Mars in the early 1960s, and continued through first looks at Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn in the 1970s and Uranus and Neptune in the 1980s. Pluto is an extremely distant world, orbiting the sun more than 29 times farther than Earth. It is about two thirds the size of our moon. With a surface temperature estimated to be -229°C (-380°F), the environment at Pluto is far too cold to allow liquid water on its surface. Pluto's moons are also in the same frigid environment. The moon Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The distance between them is 12,200 miles (19,640 km). Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 6.4 Earth days. Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of Charon always faces Pluto - this is called tidal locking. Compared with most of the planets and moons, the Pluto-Charon system is tipped on its side. ‘Scientific literature is filled with papers on the characteristics of Pluto and its moons from ground based and Earth orbiting space observations, but we’ve never studied Pluto up close and personal,’ said John Grunsfeld, Nasa Science Mission Directorate. ‘In an unprecedented flyby this July, our knowledge of what the Pluto systems is really like will expand exponentially and I have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries.’ Such is the mystery of Pluto that astronomers are not even sure what they will find on the surface. Pluto, the largest known body in the Kuiper Belt, is thought to have a nitrogen atmosphere and complex seasons. On its surface, it seems to have distinct markings, and it may have ice as well. The dwarf planet may even harbour an underground ocean. Among its five known moons, the largest - Charon - may itself sport an atmosphere or an interior ocean, and possibly even evidence of recent surface activity. Owing to the speed of New Horizons, the observations of Pluto will last just two hours. But it will collect a huge amount of data on Pluto and its moons, revealing unprecedented views - and with no other missions to Pluto in the pipeline, they will be our only images for a very, very long time. 'This is pure exploration; we’re going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes!” said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. 'New Horizons is flying to Pluto - the biggest, brightest and most complex of the dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt. 'This 21st century encounter is going to be an exploration bonanza unparalleled in anticipation since the storied missions of Voyager in the 1980s.' Not since Voyager 2 (illustrated left) flew past Neptune (right) in 1989 and started taking pictures has such a reconnaissance mission been attempted. New Horizons' mission represents the last of the worlds in the 'classical solar system' to be explored - and will be our sole visitor to Pluto for many, many years . Scientists still know very little about Pluto (illustrated left), its largest satellite Charon (right) and its other moons. Pluto, the largest known body in the Kuiper Belt, is thought to have a nitrogen atmosphere and complex seasons. On its surface, it seems to have distinct surface markings, and it may have ice as well . Pluto’s smaller moons also are likely to present scientific opportunities. When the New Horizons mission was first devised in 2001, it was a mission to just Pluto and Charon, before the four smaller moons were discovered. The spacecraft’s suite of seven science instruments - which includes cameras, spectrometers, and plasma and dust detectors - will map the geology of Pluto and Charon and map their surface compositions and temperatures. The spacecraft will also examine Pluto’s atmosphere, search for an atmosphere around Charon, study Pluto’s smaller satellites and look for rings and additional satellites around Pluto. Currently, even with New Horizons closer to Pluto than Earth is to the sun, the Pluto system resembles little more than bright dots in the distance. But teams operating the spacecraft are using these views to refine their knowledge of Pluto’s location, and skillfully navigate New Horizons toward a precise target point 7,750 miles (12,500 kilometers) from Pluto’s surface. That targeting is critical, since the computer commands that will orient the spacecraft and point its science instruments are based on knowing the exact time and location that New Horizons passes Pluto. This image, taken by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope, shows five moons orbiting the distant, icy dwarf planet Pluto. Styx (initially designated P5), is the innermost of the moons found by Hubble over the past seven years. This image was taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 on 7 July 2012 . 'Our team has worked hard to get to this point, and we know we have just one shot to make this work,' said Alice Bowman, New Horizons mission operations manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. 'We’ve plotted out each step of the Pluto encounter, practiced it over and over, and we’re excited the ""real deal"" is finally here.' The spacecraft’s work doesn’t end with the July flyby. Because it gets one shot at its target, New Horizons is designed to gather as much data as it can, as quickly as it can, taking about 100 times as much data on close approach as it can send home before flying away. And although the spacecraft will send select, high-priority datasets home in the days just before and after close approach, the mission will continue returning the data stored in onboard memory for a full 16 months. Beyond Pluto, Nasa is also planning to study one or two Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) with New Horizons in the years after its historic primary mission.","Nasa scientists in Maryland are preparing for historic mission on 14 July .

"Angela spent many years wearing high heel shoes . Four years ago, a shopping trip was torture for Angela Kelly, 67. Though still a super-fit events organiser, the former over-50s All England badminton mixed doubles champion was reduced to hobbling at a snail's pace, hanging onto her trolley for support. It may sound as though Angela was struggling with a debilitating disease or catastrophic accident. In fact, she was suffering from the painful legacy of a lifetime wearing high heels. Her story is a cautionary tale for those of us who blithely slip our feet into shoes several inches high on a daily basis. Most women are well aware that wearing high heels for any length of time can result in sore feet, pinched toes and tight calf muscles. But a worrying new study by researchers in the U.S. suggests high heels can also put dangerous pressure on knee joints, wearing away cartilage - the body's built-in shock absorber - and increasing the risk of osteoarthritis. Some women need invasive knee replacement surgery. In the study carried out by Stanford University's biomotion team, the knees of healthy women were scanned as they walked at normal pace in flat shoes, 1½ in heels and 3½ in heels. They found that in high heels, women's knees are held in such an awkward, bent position that their joints looked and performed like aged or damaged joints - increasing the risk of osteoarthritis. Physiotherapist and osteopath Tim Allardyce isn't surprised: patients with postural problems caused or exacerbated by heels are common at his Croydon clinic. 'Because of the odd angle at which the feet are held in high-heeled shoes, it increases the downward pressure on the knees by 25 per cent, placing significant stress on the kneecaps, even when you're standing still,' he says. At 5ft 3in, Angela had always loved the extra height afforded by her favourite heels. 'I wore vertiginous stilettos and towering platforms every day of my teens and 20s,' she says. 'And after that, a 3 in heel or more, whenever I wanted to look smart.' Even the first twinge of arthritis, which began in her right knee in her early 30s, couldn't persuade her to kick her heel habit - instead, she gritted her teeth and controlled the pain with anti- inflammatories, until it suddenly worsened four years ago. She had almost no cartilage left in her knee and needed to have a titanium knee replacement . 'I was struggling to get out of bed or in and out of the car,' she says. 'I sometimes had to use crutches to get about and would have to lean heavily on a trolley to get around the supermarket. 'All my lovely high-heeled shoes had to be banished and I started living in trainers. 'My husband Rob and my friends were all very sweet, telling me I looked great in my frumpy, flat shoes and encouraging me to get my knee sorted out - but I felt really down about it. 'If I walked any distance or tried to play badminton, my knee would swell horribly and I'd have to apply ice packs to control the pain. 'Tests showed that I had almost no cartilage left in my knee and it became obvious that I needed to have a titanium knee replacement, which involved major surgery and a lengthy recovery period.' Luckily, Angela's knee surgery at the Royal Bolton Hospital in 2011 was a success. After following the advice of her doctor and physiotherapist to swear off heels altogether, to avoid damaging her new, artificial knee, she is fitter than ever. She has lost 1½ st, is playing badminton several times a week and goes to the gym regularly. 'I miss my heels and envy friends who can still wear them,' she says. The average woman spends £136.52 on five new pairs of shoes a year . The knee op wasn't her only surgery. 'I had to have a bunion surgically removed from my left foot last year, too, which was caused - or certainly worsened - by years of wearing tight, pointy stilettos. 'I probably would have paid more attention to the fit of my shoes, rather than how fashionable they looked, if I'd known they would force me to go under the knife twice.' Vanity is the obvious reason why Angela is far from the only woman willing to suffer for fashion - there's no question that legs look longer and more elegant in beautiful heels. In a recent survey of 1,200 women, 93 per cent said they felt sexier and more feminine when they wore heels, 88 per cent said they considered themselves more stylish and 77 per cent said their heels made them feel slimmer. With statistics like those, it's no surprise that many women seem to take a dangerously 'no pain, no gain' approach to their footwear, however dire the warnings. Retired teacher Susan Owens, 61, has also suffered life-changing knee problems from wearing heels since she was a teenager. 'My husband and I go on a lot of cruises, and recently took up ballroom dancing, which call for lots of dressing up and wearing high-heels for hours on end,' she says. But unbearable knee pain that began in 2010, when she was 55, threatened to curtail her leisure activities altogether. Susan Owens has also suffered life-changing knee problems from wearing heels . 'At first, I just put the pain down to ageing and tried to soldier on, but as time went on, over-the-counter painkillers stopped working and the niggling, arthritic pains were keeping me awake at night,' she says. 'Six months after they started, I went to see my doctor and was given steroid injections in my knee. They really helped in the short term, but I still found I couldn't wear heels when we went out or on holiday - it was just too painful. 'I was still teaching young children at the time, but I struggled to kneel down beside them in the classroom. I couldn't drive and as I stopped being so active, I started to pile on weight and suddenly felt old, despondent and frumpy.' Susan had to undergo arthroscopies - keyhole surgery to remove damaged cartilage - on both knees before a right knee replacement by orthopaedic surgeon Shivanand Geeranavar at BMI Edgbaston Hospital improved things. 'Within six weeks of having my knee replaced I was driving again and went on holiday to Italy. 'Within nine weeks, I could ride my bike and go back to ballroom dancing. I still wear heels occasionally - mainly when I'm dancing - but the heels are lower than they used to be.' Of course, arthritis and bunions are not the only problems that can be caused by high heels - squeezing feet into too-tight points can lead to misshapen hammer toes, and regular wearers of 3 in heels may suffer from tendonitis, where the Achilles tendon shrinks and tightens painfully. Tim Allardyce says wearing high heels regularly can also be at the root of a raft of excruciatingly painful back, hip and even neck problems. 'Standing and walking on the balls of your feet throws the skeleton out of its usual, healthy alignment, which means muscles and joints throughout the body have to compensate to maintain its centre of gravity and keep the body upright,' he says. Despite being otherwise fit and healthy, former BBC television sports presenter Sally Jones, 60, blames her fondness for heels for the excruciatingly painful lower back problems that plagued her 40s and 50s. At times, the pain was so bad she was unable to drive and was forced to use a stick. 'High heels have always been considered part of a female TV presenter's uniform,' she says. 'Not that I complained - high shoes have always be my preferred choice of footwear when I've got to look smart. The shame is that I can't really wear them any more.' Though her back problems had been triggered by squash and tennis injuries in her 30s, Sally was advised by an orthopaedic consultant and osteopath that her penchant for heels was exacerbating her problems. 'I was told to stick to flats or shoes with a very low heel and to spend as much time barefoot as possible to help correct my posture, which had been thrown out of alignment by wearing heels day in and day out,' she says. Standing and walking on the balls of your feet throws the skeleton out of its usual, healthy alignment . 'I was also given exercises to follow to strengthen my abdominals and back muscles, and help correct the poor postural habits I had developed, which were putting strain on my lower back. 'For the past 15 years, I've had to stick to flat footwear and keep up the exercises to keep my back pain at bay. 'I still take heels with me to slip on for TV appearances, but the twinges in my back start if I have to stand in them for more than an hour.' For high-heel lovers not yet suffering painful problems, podiatrist Michael Ratcliffe advises picking shoes carefully. 'If you are after height, wear a comfy platform or a shoe with a heavy block heel -which will give you support - rather than a flimsy stiletto with a thin sole,' he says. And Tim Allardyce says: 'Take a break. If you're wearing a pair of heels over 2 in high, limit the time spent wearing them to two hours maximum. 'After two hours, sit down, take the heels off and walk around barefoot if possible for 30 minutes to allow time for your feet and knees to recover.' Interestingly, consultant knee surgeon Marcus Green, at the BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham, has even more hope for those who can't bear to part with their favourite footwear - he is not convinced the link between high heels and arthritis in the knees has been proved. 'There's no doubt that high heels change the forces on the knee joint, but none of the long-term studies I've seen suggest they go on to cause serious knee problems,' he says. 'Yes, there is a definite link to issues such as Angela's bunions and Sally's postural problems. 'But when it comes to knees, keeping your weight down and exercising regularly to keep the supportive muscles around the knees fit and strong are, in my opinion, by far the most important steps you can take to prevent or slow down arthritis in the knees.'","Angela Kelly suffered the painful legacy of a lifetime wearing high heels .

"Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet to the head nearly two months after going missing in may 2014 . Nearly a year after North Dakota college student Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet in the head, his mother still struggles with how her shy son who liked to bowl and belonged to a club of electricity enthusiasts got mixed up in the dangerous world of illegal drugs. Tammy Sadek believes the answer is that her 20-year-old son signed his own death warrant when he agreed to become a confidential informant for police after they caught him selling marijuana. Authorities say he knew what he was getting into and agreed to help them of his own free will. Still, people who knew Sadek are shocked by what happened. 'He was a gentle soul,' said Kristi Brandt, principal of Valley City High School, from which Sadek graduated. Investigators haven't concluded whether Sadek was slain or killed himself. Adding to the mystery, a gun that fires the same caliber bullet that killed Sadek is missing from their family farm near the tiny town of Rogers. An autopsy concluded that Sadek died of the gunshot wound, and that he had no drugs or alcohol in his system. How his body ended up in the Red River has not been explained and no gun was found. An investigative report from two-and-half months ago said the drug task force which recruited Sadek acted appropriately. But his death is raising questions about the use of young, low-level drug offenders as confidential informants and if they should they be given more detailed information about the dangers. Sadek had been working with a drug task force as a confidential informant after he was caught selling marijuana on campus in 2013.  His mother, Tammy Sadek believes that he signed his death warrant when he began working for the force . The circumstances surrounding the death of Sadek, who was a second-year student at the State College of Science, still remain unknown . American Civil Liberties Union spokeswoman Jennifer Cook said informants are doing a dangerous part of law enforcement, without the training. 'The safety risks associated with informant use can far outweigh the benefits,' she said. Sadek was a second-year electrical technician student at the State College of Science, a two-year community college in the southeastern North Dakota city of Wahpeton where about 3,600 students study everything from diesel technology to performing arts. He enjoyed lake activities and golfing in addition to bowling and electrical work while growing up on the family farm. Brandt said Sadek was never a troublemaker in high school, and was always polite and respectful of authority. She doubted his nature changed much in college. 'Sometimes there are changes, but usually it's more on the level of a maturity change, not necessarily a personality change,' she said. He wanted an electrical technician master's degree, but his plans began to go awry in April 2013 when he twice sold marijuana to a confidential informant. Both transactions were small - for a total of $80 worth of drugs - but they took place on campus, making them serious felonies. In November 2013, agents with the Southeast Multi-County Agency Drug Task Force searched Sadek's dorm room and said they found a grinder containing marijuana residue. Though investigators have not found the weapon or made arrests in Sadek's death, his mother Tammy believes he would not have killed himself . The next day, Sadek - facing the prospect of drug charges that could land him in prison for 41 years - completed paperwork to become a confidential informant. The attraction of cooperating with authorities is that it offers the chance to keep a felony off the record of a young person, said Wahpeton Police Chief Scott Thorsteinson. Richland County Deputy Sheriff Jason Weber, now the interim task force supervisor, won't say whether Sadek was specifically told of the dangerous nature of the work he would be doing. The document that Sadek signed to become a confidential informant did not explicitly state the potential risks. Drug investigators need to be more explicit about those dangers, said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project. 'You have to really say, ""This is the risk: You're entering a world that's dangerous, and you might end up dead,""' Harrington said. Sadek bought drugs three times for the regional task force over the next three months, one short of the four purchases required of him. Officials have said that confidential drug informants, who are often young and low-level drug offenders, need to be more educated of the dangers that come with the job . A security camera videotaped Sadek leaving his dormitory early on May 1, 2014. He wasn't seen again. His body was found in the river about two months later. Authorities estimate that he had died two days after he disappeared. Officials with the North and South Dakota state crime bureaus and a Cass County sheriff's detective reviewed the task force's involvement with Sadek and said in their late January report that they 'did not see anything that caused concern.' 'That's how drug task forces work all over the world,' said Weber, the task force supervisor. 'You're always constantly trying to find the bigger person and go to that person's supplier.' But Tammy Sadek believes that even though the probe was billed as independent, members of the law enforcement community 'have each other's back'. She has a point, according to John Burton, a California attorney and vice president of the National Police Accountability Project. Colleges have faced scrutiny for allowing police to use students as confidential informants, while Sadek's mother has questioned whether officers pressured her son . 'It's just a charade when they do these things,' Burton said of law enforcement agencies investigating one another. U.S. Justice Department guidelines state that authorities should consider the risk of harm to a potential l informant, but do not say that the person should be informed of the risks. North Dakota Attorney General's Office spokeswoman Liz Brocker declined to comment on any policies or procedures that might be in place for drug task forces in the state. Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School professor Alexandra Natapoff said the use of criminal informants 'is almost entirely unregulated' across the country, though that is beginning to change. The Florida Legislature in 2009 passed 'Rachel's Law,' requiring police to adopt policies to protect informants, after 23-year-old Rachel Hoffman was shot to death in 2008 while working as an informant. That law is 'only the beginning of the protections that we need for young, vulnerable informants,' Natapoff said. Tammy Sadek believes her son was scared into becoming a confidential informant. She's started a Justice for Andrew Sadek Facebook page that has more than 3,200 likes. 'I would like to see (task forces) stop using kids,' she said. 'I know it's common, but these are just little fish.'","Andrew Sadek, 20, was working for a narcotics task force after being caught dealing small amounts of marijuana, according to a report .

"We have most friends at the age of 26 after having spent the first quarter of our lives building up our friendship circle, a new study has revealed. The report into friendship showed that our social circle peaks at 26 years and seven months, at which we typically have five close friends. Women are most popular at 25 years and 10 months, with men hitting the friendship high point a little later at 27 years and three months. Women are most popular at 25 years of age, while men hit the friendship high a little later at 27. File image used . The research, by greetings card firm Forever Friends, shows that a third of adults (36 per cent) met their closest friends while at school with a fifth (22 per cent) saying they met them at work. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter now also play a major role in nurturing new friendships. The study found that 25 to 34-year-olds make 22 friends via Facebook, compared to 18 to 24-year-olds who make 12, and 35 to 44-year-olds who will have made just four. Forever Friends relationship coach Sam Owen said: 'It is no coincidence that over a third of us meet our best friends at school. 'It is a key time in our lives where friendships are grown through sharing notes, giving gifts, seeing each other regularly and laughing a lot. 'As adults we can often forget how powerful these small things are and how the little things can make a difference. Small gestures are just as important as big ones. 1. Trustworthy - 85 per cent . 2. Loyal - 79 per cent . 3. Funny - 62 per cent . 4. Respectful - 57 per cent . 5. Have a love of travel - 15 per cent . 6. Thick skinned - 13 per cent . 7. A good taste in music so we can go to the same gigs - 12 per cent . 8. Generous so they can be treated to things - nine per cent . 9. Stylish - seven per cent . 10. Attractive and popular with the opposite sex - six per cent . 'With growing external pressures being put on friendships these days, it's important to nurture and make time for our friendships. 'If we could only do one additional thing a week to show we care and love our friends, it would create a stronger framework for the future.' Later in life we find ourselves losing friends. Over half (54 per cent) of us have lost friendships through moving, while 36 per cent say that over time they grew apart from close pals. Having children has also caused 19 per cent to drift away from childless friends. And new relationships play a big role in finding - and keeping - friends, with one in 10 people (11 per cent) saying their friendship circles had expanded due to a new relationship and 10 per cent revealing their partner did not approve of some. The study also looked into the amount of friends we would like to have. It found that the average Brit has four close friends, but ideally we want six. Tellingly, almost half (48 per cent) of women and 39 per cent of men have at least one secret they share with their best friend, which they would never tell their partner.","New study reveals the average person's friends circle peaks at age of 26 .

"It’s the changing face of Russian politics. When Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on TV today to insist none of the country’s troops are positioned in the Ukraine, he looked decidedly fresh-faced for a man accused of war-mongering. The wrinkles on the 62-year-old's forehead, clearly visibly in previous pictures, have disappeared, while his skin look smooth, taut, tanned and younger than ever. Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV today like you have never seen him before - leading to questions that he has had cosmetic surgery to get rid of the bags under his eyes, wrinkles and make his face more chiseled . His appearance this week is radically different to how he was previously pictured in 2007 (left) and 2010 (right). In both photographs the skin of Putin's face is more saggy, and he has visible dark circles under his eyes . And as this series of pictures show, the Russian president's face has changed dramatically over the years – amid persistent rumours he has undergone cosmetic surgery to give himself a more youthful look. A black and white picture taken in 1991 when he was 37 years old shows him looking gaunt, and black bags under his eyes are clearly visible. Putin, pictured in 1985 (left) with his wife Lyudmila and daughter Katya, and in 1991 (right) when he was chairman of the External Relations Committee of Saint Petersburg, aged 37. His hair was already receding . Pictures taken in 2000 (left) and 2001 (right), when Putin was in his forties, also show 'crow's-feet' on his eyes . During his first term at President in 2007 Putin, then aged 55, looked his age while still healthy . In a photo dated 2000, Putin’s hair still has tones of blonde but the signs of ageing are becoming more apparent on his features. Fast-forward to 2010, and the 'action man', now 57, looks tired and haggared after taking part in a judo session . Questions over whether Putin had gone under the knife came to the fore in 2011, when the then-Prime Minister was photographed with a yellow bruise on his face. Russian media began to question whether Putin had had plastic surgery in 2011. Pictured here announcing his intentions to run to become the President of Russia, journalists wondered if that bid sparked the surgery . Putin's face was puffy but relatively wrinkle-free in December 2013 when he attended a conference in Moscow . Plastic surgeons at the time told MailOnline that Botox injections, a facelift, cheek-fillers, a brow lift and removal of the bags under his eyes would have helped improve his ageing features – although his spokesman denied at the time he had had any work done. But In the same year he announced he wanted to become the next President of Russia, leading commentators to ask if that was the reason behind his new look. In December 2013, after around two years in office as President, he looked vastly different again, his face puffy but wrinkle-free. And in March this year, the Kremlin was forced to deny rumours that he was unwell – or had undergone surgery – when the President disappeared for 10 days, cancelling a string of appointments and public appearances. Questions were raised about Putin's health when he met with the President of Kyrgystan last month after a 10 day disappearance. He refused to explain where he had been saying 'it would be boring without gossip' Putin, pictured on April 16 2014 - looking relaxed and youthful as he give a television interview about Ukraine . When he emerged to meet with the President of Kyrgystan his face was puffy and shiny, and eyes only able to partially open, leading journalists to wonder about the cause of his new look. However Putin has remained tight-lipped about his absence, laughing off the suggestions of poor health - or rumours that he had been attending the birth of a love child - saying; 'It would be boring without gossip.' His latest appearance is unlikely to quell suggestions that Putin has been knocking on the doors of plastic surgeons. Putin was recently reported as saying he won't be in office past the year 2024, when he will turns 71 years old - although these pictures suggest there is a good chance he won't look it.","Appeared on Russian television today looking tanned and wrinkle-free .

"Harking back to UK transformation show 10 Years Younger, people on the street are asked to guess a woman's age in a bold new advert. A French model starring in a television film for Garnier is filmed and photographed as she 'ages' an average of five years throughout a typical working day. The Parisian public observe her appearance and proceed to judge her as older - from as young as 26 to as old as 40 - as the day progresses. At 7am the actress looks bright and bushy tailed, ready for the day ahead - studio lights capture this in the ad . But by 9.47 she looks exhausted as she prepares the family dinner and does the laundry after a day at work . The working mother-of-two is seen drying her hair first thing, dropping her two young children off at school, working out, working on a computer in the office, food shopping and more as a camera follows her every move. She is photographed at the beginning of her day and at the end - at 7am and 9.47pm - and both images are then judged independently by people on the street. Looking at the morning photo, strangers generally thought she looked somewhere between her late twenties or early thirties, but with the evening photo, they guessed she was in her late thirties and forties. Researchers found she looked five years older in the evening photograph compared to the morning image based on the average ages guessed. The advert for Garnier's Miracle Sleeping Cream ends with the statement 'In only one day, fatigue can age you by five years.', followed by the answer to all your problems: 'But a miracle can change everything'. If there's a best way to sell face cream, this creation by Paris agency Publicis Conseil would surely take top prize. Probably because it can make you feel awful about yourself.

"Die-hard fans of the hit BBC series Poldark aren’t just flocking to Cornwall as tourists, as interest in the programme has spurred demand for holiday homes along the county’s picturesque coastline. A beachfront property with spectacular views has gone on the market for £3million, and it is already drawing interest from viewers who are enamoured with the series’ stunning setting – and actor Aidan Turner’s chiselled looks. Since the series started airing last month estate agents said they have seen a rise in enquiries about the cottage, overlooking an ancient smugglers’ cove on Cornwall’s north coast, and other properties where the title character, Ross Poldark, plies his trade. Scroll down for video . A beachfront property with summer and winter cottages (middle, bottom left) has gone on the market for £3million in Cornwall . The property has stunning views of Smugglers Cove, and the summer and winter cottages are linked via a lift (pictured: summer cottage) Poldark actor Aidan Turner has become a heartthrob for fans after his character took off his shirt on the popular BBC One show . Ben Standen, from estate agents Jackson-Stops & Staff of Truro, said Smugglers Cottage in Smugglers Cove, near Portreath, has a summer and winter cottage, cleverly linked via a lift. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the property has direct access to the beach and an amazing view of uninterrupted coast and open sea. The summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four, and they can be used separately to provide lots of space for a family. Mr Standen said: ‘The fact it has direct access onto the beach and has these two houses linked by a lift - it's the sort of thing that comes on the market once every 20 or 30 years.’ The scenic county has always been a popular destination thanks to its rugged coastline, but interest in the programme, based on Winston Graham’s Poldark historical novels, set in the 18th century, is giving the local tourism and housing market a boost. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the stunning property has direct access to the beach . One of the larger bedrooms in the summer cottage offers amazing views of Smugglers Cove on the northern coast of Cornwall . The summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four, with uninterrupted views of the sea . Smugglers Cottage is located just a few miles from some of the series’ filming locations, including nearby St Agnes Head, which doubles as Nampara Valley, part of the Poldark family estate, in the show. There are lots of 'Poldark experiences' now on offer in the county – with kayak, horseback and walking Poldark tours. Mr Standen added: ‘I certainly think the Poldark series has heightened Cornwall's appeal. There are lots of 'Poldark experiences' now on offer in the county – with kayak, horseback and walking Poldark tours . Smugglers Cottage is located just a few miles from some of the series’ filming locations, including nearby St Agnes Head . The show’s popularity is coupled with the county’s stunning scenery and history in making Cornwall a desirable destination . ‘There are more people coming down here more regularly and expressing interest in buying a second home. ‘Properties on the coastline with these breathtaking views have got a lot of appeal and are incredibly popular, which the series has made people more aware of.’ The show’s popularity is coupled with the county’s stunning scenery and history in making Cornwall a desirable destination. Estate agents said they have seen an increase in interest in holiday homes in Cornwall since Poldark began airing last month . Smuggling was rife in the 18th century, when Poldark is set, and Cornwall's coast is full of hidden coves and tucked-away inlets. It was popular with smugglers because it had a long expanse of rocky, virtually uninhabited coast. With few revenue men to patrol it, goods like tea, brandy, rum and tobacco were smuggled in. All four of Fowey's public toilets are out of service just weeks before summer . Poldark fans and thousands of other holidaymakers who are planning to visit a popular seaside town in Cornwall may have nowhere to go when nature calls. Located in the heart of Poldark country, the town of Fowey is locked in a bizarre and long-running wrangle over public toilets. All four of the main public conveniences in Fowey – where a Poldark exhibition is being planned in May – are closed and with the summer tourist season fast approaching, there’s no sign of the wee wrangle being resolved. The town council agreed to take over the running of the four public toilets from Cornwall Council at the start of 2013. But more than two years later, the details of the transfer of ownership of three of them - Caffa Mill, the main car park and Readymoney Cove – are still being worked out by the county council while the fourth block, at the Town Quay, is shut for refurbishment. Town clerk Sally Vincent said: ‘There is nothing more the town council can do to push it on... it is still in the legal loop. ‘I am hopeful it will be completed soon. ‘The town council is really pleased to be able to take on the ownership of the toilets. ‘As a town council we feel we need to get the Town Quay toilets up and running and then go from there. It's important that Fowey has these facilities.’ The Town Quay toilets were already owned by the town council but leased to Cornwall Council, which has meant the handover could be completed more quickly. Refurbishment work started last week and it is hoped they will be open within eight weeks, with the toilet for the disabled being available to use while work is done on the others. When they reopen, visitors will have to pay 20p per use to offset the cost to the town council of running them. Mrs Vincent added: ‘The cost of running toilets is astronomical. ‘The town council simply doesn't have the money to do it for nothing so it was felt that if we charge 20p it would be something towards it.’ Cornwall Council figures suggest it will cost a minimum of £26,000 a year to run the four sets of toilets, with the town having to cover insurance costs and business rates as well as cleaning, maintenance and consumables. Until the transfer of ownership on the three blocks at the main car park, Readymoney Cove and Caffa Mill, is completed, the responsibility for opening the toilets will rest with Cornwall Council.","Interest in the hit BBC series Poldark has given Cornwall's tourism and housing market a boost .

"Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian has been detained in Iran for eight months and faces trial for 'security charges' unspecified by the government . A Washington Post journalist who has been detained in Iran for eight months has been accused of 'espionage' and 'acting against national security', according to an Iranian news agency. Iranian officials announced in January that Jason Rezaian, who is the Post's Tehran bureau chief, would stand trial before the country's Revolutionary Court to face 'security charges', but did not elaborate what those charges were. The Fars news agency did not reveal the source for their information, but the agency is considered to be close to the ultra conservative Iran hard-liners. The report alleges that Rezaian, 39, obtained economic and industrial information from the country and then sold it to unnamed Americans. Rezaian was also linked to Omid Memarian, a US-based Iranian opposition journalist, in the report. Fars claimed that 'selling Iran's economic and industrial information at a time of sanctions is exactly like selling food at a time of war'. Iran is subject to sanctions from the U.S, Europe and the United Nations due to its nuclear program. In the Washington Post, executive editor Martin Baron called the allegations a 'farce and a sham'. 'Seven months have passed without Iranian legal authorities publicly outlining the allegations against Jason,' he said. 'Now we have someone outside the judiciary system making outlandish allegations that come with no evidence. This isn't justice.' Leila Ahsan, Rezaian's lawyer, would not comment on the specific charges that have been brought against her client but said she has studied the text of the indictment and will brief his family in the upcoming days. Ashan said she visited the journalist in prison last month and that he appeared to be 'in good health and spirits'. 'I can see him anytime,' she said. 'Jason asked me to provide a strong defense. I'm in constant touch with his wife and family. I've requested that the court hold the trial as soon as possible.' An Iranian news agency considered to be close to Iran hard-liners claims that Rezaian (pictured with his wife Yaganeh Salehi) has been accused of 'espionage' and 'acting against national security' Rezaian and his wife, Iranian-born Yeganeh Salehi, were taken from their Tehran home on July 22 and detained with two photojournalists. All were released except for American-born Rezaian, who  has dual citizenship that is not recognized by Iran. Rezaian was not allowed to hire a lawyer until seven months after he was first arrested. His family was also not permitted from hiring Masoud Shafiei, who was their first choice for Rezaian's attorney because of his experience with representing imprisoned foreigners and dual citizens. Shafiei was forbidden from taking the case by the judiciary for unspecified reasons, according to the New York Times. Last month President Barack Obama called on the Iranian government to immediately release Rezaian as well as two other detained Americans, Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati.","Fars News Agency alleges that Jason Rezaian sold economic and industrial information he obtained from Iran to Americans .

"The Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity at Clemson University in South Carolina has been put on probation for two years after the group held a Christmas theme party that flared up racial tensions on campus. The 'Cripmas' party, held last December, had white students throwing stereotypical gang symbols while dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and fake 'thug' tattoos. The party was also reportedly attended by female students from several sororities. Photos from the party flooded social media and were accompanied by comments such as: 'Merry Cripmas to all, and all a hood night.' The Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity at Clemson University in South Carolina has been put on probation for two years after the group held a Christmas theme party that flared up racial tensions on campus . Clemson University president, James Clements (right), speaks with students protesting last December's frat party which caused outrage for its perpetuation of stereotypes . The party, organized by several SAE members, was held off-campus at a private residence. 'Cripmas' appeared to be a reference to a primarily African-American gang, The Crips, founded in California. The incident caused a backlash as black students protested and said Clemson didn't do enough to promote racial tolerance. About 6 percent of Clemson's students are black. All SAE activity was suspended by Clemson indefinitely following the inappropriate theme party. Several SAE members resigned from positions and have been suspended from the fraternity. An internal investigation found that the fraternity violated alcohol rules and student conduct codes. It will be on probation until February 2017. Clemson University president, James Clements, sent an email to students last December making clear that the party was not sanctioned by the university and that such events would not be tolerated. White students dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and sported fake 'thug' tattoos . Clements wrote: 'At a time of year when our thoughts are turning to family, holidays and the start of a new year – all the things that unite us and bring us joy -- it is discouraging that so many events and issues are causing division and hurt, and making many students feel unwanted at this great university. 'It hurts to read disrespectful and just plain mean comments in social media. Last night's ''Cripmas'' party, which the university did not sanction, raised more concerns about the campus climate. Clemson is better than this. He added: 'Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion about events in Ferguson, Staten Island and the protest rallies that those events have spawned. Great universities are built on the free expression and exploration of ideas. 'But the free expression of opinion must not cross the line and become harassment or intimidation, just as rallies and protest marches must not cross the line to lawlessness.' A Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was disbanded last month after members were taped singing a racist song. The national organization didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

"Parents Craig and Bonnie Morgan want their children to have the best possible start in life. And like many others, they have come to believe that a private education is the best way to achieve it. But so desperate are they to get their son Craig – known to them as CJ – into a local prep school that they’ve put their house on the market in order to pay the fees. And that’s not all. They’ve also slashed their weekly grocery bills by more than half, taken in lodgers, and have pinned their hopes on a ‘crowd-funding’ initiative, hoping members of the public will help them achieve their dream. Scroll down for video . The Morgan family outside their home in Hastings with dad Craig, mum Bonnie and sons Craig Jr (known as CJ), nine, and Alfie, four. They are selling it for £185,000 to help pay for Craig Jr's prep school fees . ‘We believe any child will benefit more from what a private education has to offer,’ said Mrs Morgan. ‘There is simply no comparison.’ The Morgans, from Hastings in East Sussex, settled on the idea of a private education for their children after CJ, who they say is academically gifted, found that he wasn’t being stretched at his state primary school. ‘We always knew CJ was very bright,’ Mrs Morgan said. ‘By the age of two he could recite the continents and at nursery he was identified as gifted and talented. ‘By six he knew what every road sign meant and was reading paperbacks. Teachers say he is at least two years ahead academically compared with other children of the same age. And we’ve been told if he continues as he is doing with his maths, he is likely to gain a maths scholarship when he goes to senior school.’ Despite his success at the local school – rated as outstanding – the Morgans felt he was too bright for state education and not achieving as much as expected. And then, they say, came a problem with playground bullying. ‘He won a trophy for his go-karting hobby and after taking it to school he was constantly taunted by two boys,’ Mrs Morgan said. ‘He started coming home in tears. ‘The final straw came when one yob yelled in his face and another punched CJ for nothing. The staff agreed it was an unprovoked attack but CJ no longer wanted to go to school. He started biting his nails and becoming withdrawn.’ Battle Abbey School in East Sussex. ‘Friends and family can’t understand why we are giving up everything' to send CJ to the £4,000 a term school, says mum Bonnie . Heartbroken, the Morgans kept their son at home and contacted their local council to see if he could be transferred to a different primary school, but no places were available. Eventually in August 2014 – and with CJ refusing to return to his state school – he sat the entrance exam for Battle Abbey Prep School. Mrs Morgan said: ‘He sailed through the exam and when we looked round the school, we all fell in love with it. There is a big emphasis on good manners there – something that simply wasn’t emphasised as important at CJ’s old school. He loved it and in September started as a day pupil.’ But at £4,000 a term, the fees were crippling for the family, particularly as their income depended on Mr Morgan’s work as a taxi driver. However, having seen their son join the choir and become part of the water polo and hockey teams, all within just a term, the family decided to cash in the only real asset they possessed. ‘Our net monthly household income is £2,300,’ said Mrs Morgan. ‘After bills and the mortgage have been paid, I’m often left with just £50 a week for food. But we just want the best for CJ. ‘Friends and family can’t understand why we are giving up everything. They think we are mad to pauper ourselves to give CJ – and ultimately his four-year-old brother Alfie – a private education.’ As well as putting their house on the market, the Morgans have taken in a number of lodgers and have set up a ‘gofundme’ account in the hope of attracting donations of £115,000 from the public. Mr Morgan works as a taxi driver meaning the Bishop Abbey fees were crippling for the family, forcing them to sell their house, take in lodgers and attempt crowd-funding to afford them . ‘Holidays are out and even day trips aren’t possible as we can’t afford the petrol,’ said Mrs Morgan. ‘CJ and Alfie have given up their bedrooms so we can rent them out. It means they have to sleep in the same bedroom as Craig and me.’ Private school fees are a growing problem for parents, with those on middling incomes finding themselves increasingly forced out. Since 1990, fees have quadrupled, with the average cost of sending two children to private school now estimated at more than half a million pounds. Even so, figures from the Independent Schools Council suggest that demand for private education is increasing. Mrs Morgan said: ‘The fees include extras such as some after-school clubs and trips. His uniform alone with its different pairs of sports shoes and PE kit cost us £500. We owe £9,800 on three credit cards but can only afford to pay off the minimum amount every month.’ To help cut costs, the family’s £120 weekly grocery bill has already been slashed to £50, thanks to bulk-buying and plenty of home-cooking. The Morgans have had to slash their weekly grocery bills by more than half to try and give CJ, and in future his brother Alfie, the private education they believe they deserve . ‘Our clothes come from second-hand shops and we’ve even stopped the boys’ pocket money,’ Mrs Morgan added. Once their house is sold, the Morgans plan to rent a property, using about £85,000 of equity they have in their home to pay the fees. ‘Ironically, as our mortgage is only around £200 a month and renting will cost about £1,000, it is going to add to our outgoings,’ Mrs Morgan said. ‘But this way we can sleep at night. We can clear our debts and, most importantly, pay for CJ’s school fees. ‘Of course some people’s children are lucky – they sail through a state school and go on to become lawyers or doctors. Everyone has a choice and some parents would simply not want to make the sacrifices we are doing. But, the facilities, the ambiance, the atmosphere – it is all so much better than any state school. If your child is at a private school he is simply far more likely to reach his potential. ‘Every day I pick CJ up from school he has a smile on his face. He is full of enthusiasm and inspired by his lessons. ‘Craig and I will always know we did the very best we could.’ To donate to CJ’s scholarship fund go to gofundme.com/qrbd8w .","Craig and Bonnie Morgan are desperate to keep son Craig at prep school .

"Pope Francis has angered the Turkish government by describing the mass-murders of up to 1.5million Armenians in 1915 as 'the first . genocide of the 20th century'. The pontiff made the comments at a 100th anniversary Mass on . Sunday, prompting Turkey to summon the Holy See's ambassador in . Ankara in protest. Turkey told the Vatican ambassador it was 'deeply sorry and disappointed' in Pope Francis, adding that his comments had caused a 'problem of trust'. Scroll down for video . Turkey said Pope Francis has caused a 'problem of trust' after describing the mass-murders of up to 1.5million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 as 'the first genocide of the 20th century' While Turkey accepts that many  Armenians died in . clashes with Ottoman soldiers beginning in 1915, when Armenia . was part of the empire ruled from Istanbul, it denies that the victims reached the estimated 1.5million and that this amounted to genocide. Today was the first time a pope has publicly used  'genocide' to describe the massacre, although it is a term used by many European and South American governments. In 2001, Pope John Paul II and Armenian Apostolic Church . Supreme Patriarch Kerekin II called it 'the first genocide of . the 20th century' in a joint written statement. Francis, who has disregarded many aspects of protocol since . becoming pope two years ago, uttered the phrase during a private . meeting at the Vatican with an Armenian delegation in 2013, . prompting a strong protest from Ankara. As the archbishop of Buenos Aires before becoming the leader . of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, Jorge Maria Bergoglio had . already publicly characterised the mass killings as genocide. Pope Francis listens as the Patriarch of the Armenian Catholic Church Nerses Bedros XIX Tarmouni speaks during a mass on the 100th anniversary of the Armenian mass killings in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican . Mass: Pope Francis greets the Head of Armenia's Orthodox Church Karekin II, during an Armenian-Rite Mass on the occasion of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide . In memoriam: Prelates take pictures as Pope Francis during the mass in the Vatican today . In November, the Argentine-born pontiff made an official . visit to Turkey as part of his efforts to solidify relations . with moderate Muslim states. This April marks the 100th anniversary of the massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks. The anniversary of the mass killings in World War One will be commemorated by Armenia on April 24. The killings in 1915 are regarded by many historians as the first genocide of the 20th century, and are said to have inspired Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. Several European countries recognize the massacres as such, though Italy and the United States, for example, have avoided using the term officially given the importance they place on Turkey as an ally. Last year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a message of condolences to descendants of Armenians killed and said Turkey was ready to confront the history of the killings. More recently, Erdogan has accused Armenians of not looking for the truth but seeking to score points against Turkey, saying numerous calls from Turkey for joint research to document precisely what happened had gone unanswered. At the start of the Armenian rite Mass in St. Peter's . Basilica, Pope Francis described the 'senseless slaughter' of . 100 years ago as 'the first genocide of the 20th century', which . was followed by 'Nazism and Stalinism'. 'It is necessary, and indeed a duty, to honour their memory, . for whenever memory fades, it means that evil allows wounds to . fester. Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to . keep bleeding without bandaging it!' he said. Francis's comments were also published by Armenian President . Serzh Sargyan's office on Sunday. 'We are deeply grateful to His Holiness Pope Francis for the . idea of this unprecedented liturgy ... which symbolizes our . solidarity with the people of the Christian world,' Sargyan said . in a speech at a Vatican dinner on Saturday evening. After Francis's remarks on Sunday, Turkey swiftly summoned . the Vatican's ambassador in Ankara to protest and seek an . explanation. 'The pope's statement which is far from historic and legal truths is unacceptable. Religious positions are not places where unfounded claims are made and hatred is stirred,' Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted. The Foreign Ministry in Ankara later issued a statement conveying its 'great disappointment and sadness.' It said the pope's words signaled a loss in trust, contradicted the pope's message of peace and was discriminatory because Francis only mentioned the pain of Christians, not Muslims or other religious groups. Francis also urged reconciliation between Turkey and . Armenia, and between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed . Caucasus mountain region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The appeal came in . a letter handed out during a meeting after the Mass to Sargyan . and the three most important Armenian church patriarchs present.","Pope calls mass murder of Armenians 'first genocide of the 20th century'

"I felt as if I was treading on hallowed ground. A leather boot, white with mould, lay half-buried at my feet. Nearby I glanced down on a harness smothered in lichen lying beside the skull of a mule, while strewn all around me were the remains of rusty cans and oil drums. High above on the hilltop stood simple headstones and derelict wooden crosses marking unnamed graves. The infamous Chilkoot Trail in British Columbia, used by thousands of men during the Klondike Gold Rush . Keith Wolfe Smarch, a First Nation master-carver, had abandoned work on a totem pole to guide me along the infamous Chilkoot Trail, where hundreds of men and thousands of pack animals lost their lives as they headed to Canada's frozen wastes during the Klondike Gold Rush. He is descended from Skookum Jim, the first man to find gold in a remote riverbed in the Yukon in 1896. The discovery started a stampede along the treacherous mountain track through snowdrifts, blizzards and avalanches, each man weighed down with supplies. The 32-mile hike took weeks to complete but even then their journey was far from over. At the end of the trail they staggered into Bennett, a makeshift city of tents, hotels and saloons at the head of a deep green fjord, where they settled for a brief respite. All that is left of Bennett today is its split-log chapel and station, still used by the White Pass Railway. 'On May 29, 1898 more than 7,000 roughly hewn rafts set sail,' Keith told me. 'There was a further 400 miles of hazardous waterways, canyons and rapids to negotiate before they reached their goal.' Everything in the Yukon is of epic proportions. Bordering Alaska, it is almost twice the size of Britain, with ranges of sparkling snow-crusted peaks, emerald lakes and vast forests. There are few signs of habitation in this pristine wilderness, with only a few roads linking the small communities. Spectacular snowfield: Wendy flew over the world's largest non-polar icefield in the Kluane National Park . Distances between them are mind-boggling. Locals travel up to 100 miles for their weekly shop, and some days I drove for seven or eight hours along deserted highways, rarely passing another vehicle. In the Kluane National Park, I took a scenic flight over the world's largest non-polar icefield. We skimmed barren hillsides, almost touching the curly-horned Dall's sheep balanced on the rocky outcrops. As we soared higher, I looked down on immense snowfields before we swooped over glaciers. Kluane is home to a huge grizzly bear population, so one morning I set off in search of them with retired ranger Brent Liddle and his dog Blue. Carrying pepper spray for protection, he led me around a beautiful turquoise lake and up towards the saddle of King's Throne Mountain. Clapping hands to warn of our presence, we scrambled along a rocky path, stepping over tangled roots and clambering over fallen logs. Kluane is home to a huge grizzly bear population (left). Right, some of the original Gold Rush prospectors . Suddenly Brent pointed to a spruce tree. The bark was worn away and fresh hairs were glued to the sap. 'A bear has been rubbing his head and back here,' he explained. Eyes darting in all directions, we proceeded cautiously but there was no sign of the grizzly. I was quite relieved. In fact I saw more wildlife along the roadside than I did on foot, sometimes stopping the car only yards from black bears guzzling on dandelions among carpets of fireweed and blue lupins. At Tombstone Territorial Park we pulled in to watch caribou grazing on the tundra and beavers paddling to their lodge, mouths crammed with twigs. Unless you stay at one of the designated campsites, accommodation in the parks is limited. My favourite was the Tagish Wilderness Lodge - a speedboat whisks you across a lake on a 45-minute journey from the nearest road. Four log cabins are hidden in the trees, yards from the water's edge. The main building consists of a spacious living area decorated with moose and caribou antlers, luxury bathrooms and a pine-scented sauna. Dawson City, epicentre of the Gold Rush, was the largest city in Western Canada back in 1898 . Wendy pans for gold.. and finds a precious nugget . My hosts, Gebhard and Sarah, took me on boat trips along the shoreline and hikes up into the hinterland, passing their heatsensor camera on the way. In the evenings we'd upload the photos showing a lynx, bear and wolf prowling past. I loved the sense of isolation. I spent hours on the jetty watching speckled loons diving for fish. Occasionally a young moose would venture tentatively into the water nearby while bald eagles flew overhead. The views were breathtaking and the silence so intense I could hear a pine needle drop. My last stop was Dawson City, epicentre of the Gold Rush. In 1898 it was the largest city in Western Canada. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it looks much the same, with painted weatherboard houses and wooden boardwalks lining unpaved streets. Archive film in the visitor centre shows the city crowded with prospectors in dark suits and bowler hats. Now the restored buildings stand hugger-mugger with rusty, corrugated-iron shacks sinking slowly into the ground due to the permafrost. Head to Diamond Tooth Gertie's if you want to watch can-can shows or play blackjack with tourists from the cruise ships. I preferred The Pit, the bar in the Westminster Hotel, where I had a beer with locals and listened to live country music. Just a couple of miles away in Bonanza Creek, I met up with Sylvia and her sister, Ginny, who are both descended from an original prospector. Their site at Claim 33 was close to the spot where Skookum Jim made his historic find. Handing me a pan of gravel, Sylvia demonstrated how to sieve and sluice it. As I shook the pan back and forth, dipping it in water to drain off the excess sand, I stopped short. A tiny nugget was glistening in the bottom of the pan. I had found my own crock of gold.

"They have a reputation as rather brutish creatures who chomped their way through huge hunks of meat, but it seems Neanderthals may actually have been the first masterchefs. New research is suggesting that these extinct early humans may have used wild herbs to flavour their food. Scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old Neanderthal teeth found in El Sidron, Spain. Neanderthals (represented in the drawing above) may have been the world's first gourmets - using herbs like yarrow and camomile to flavour the meat that dominated their diet, according to a new scientific paper . At first researchers thought they might have been using these plants as a form of self-medication, but now new findings have presented a different theory. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues suggests they may have used them to make food more palatable. Neanderthals may have cooked stews in the skins of animals, according to some anthropologists. Animal bones found at sites known to have been inhabited by Neanderthals are 90 per cent free of gnaw marks. This suggests that fat and meat had instead been cooked off the bones. A study of tooth plaque from the teeth of fossilised Neanderthal remains also suggest that they may have heated grains of barley. However, there is no evidence that Neanderthals had any pots or pans to cook with. Instead Professor John Speth, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan, believes that they used animal paunches and folded bark to make bags that they could boil their good in. A study of plaque found on Neanderthal teeth like the one above suggests they ate grains like barley . They have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They say Neanderthals could also used herbs to improve their culinary creations in the same way. There is already evidence that they cooked their food and may even have created stews in the skins of animals. Writing in the journal Antiquity, Dr Krief and her colleagues said: 'Data on Neanderthal behaviour suggest that their subsistence and technological strategies were complex.' Neanderthals have long been portrayed as a rather primitive form of human that died out as they were unable to compete with the more sophisticated modern humans that arrived in Europe and Asia from Africa. However, recent discoveries have shown that they may actually have had a complex culture - capable of making stone tools and even jewellery. Three years ago researchers at the University of Barcelona examined ten teeth from the remains of five Neanderthals found in El Sidron, northern Spain. In the dental plaque of one young adult they discovered three compounds that occur naturally in yarrow and camomile. Dr Karen Hardy and her team, who conducted that work, suggested that these plants had been used to help ward off illness or treat a diease. Yarrow for example has been used in the past to treat fever and to stem bleeding. However it was also a popular vegetable in the 17th century, while the leaves can also be dried and used as a herb. It is said to produce a pungent odour while having a slightly sweet and peppery taste that has been described as similar to spinach. Camomile was also a popular treatment for inflammation, hayfever and stomach problems, but is still used to today to flavour foods in top restaurants. Neither of the plants have much nutritional value but both convey strong flavours. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. New archaeological discoveries are expanding our knowledge of how Neanderthals lived in ways that could not have been imagined when their fossilised remains, like the skeleton above, were first found by archaeologists . Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has become well known for his subtle use of flavours that contrasts with his rather brutish approach in the kitchen, but it seems he could also have learned some tips from Neanderthals . Neanderthals, like the one shown above, may well have been the world's first gourmet chefs, findings suggest . They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief said that previous work has dismissed the idea that Neanderthals were eating herbs to flavour food based on the assumption that their tastes were very basic. However, she says that if chimpanzees use plants to flavour their food, then it is entirely possible that Neanderthals also used herbs and spices. Writing in Antiquity, the researchers said: 'The strong, bitter taste of the leaves may modify the flavour of the viscera, muscles, organs or water. 'In a French cookbook, a recipe proposes cooking a blanquette of veal with camomile. 'The bitter taste of the cooked plant does not necessarily disappear completely; camomile, for example, remains bitter when infused. 'The presence of cooked carbohydrates, esters, phenols, pyrene and florathene in calculus samples from El Sidron supports the hypothesis that Neanderthals were cooking plant food and perhaps smoking food, confirming that they were able to practice different food-processing techniques. 'It is suggested that, among other cooking methods, roasting, heating or even potentially boiling to make soup, stew or stock might have been used by Neanderthals. 'Such a variety of practices, combined with the fact that the samples from El Sidr´on reveal the presence of smoke-related compounds, show that Neanderthals were using food processing at least as complex as flavouring food with plant material.' Other recent discoveries are starting to reveal what culinary creatures the Neanderthals were. Camomile is well known as a herb that can produce some interesting flavours for dishes and was eaten by Neanderthals according to recent research on dental plaque that had hardened onto fossiled teeth . Yarrow is a hardy plant but its leaves can be used as a herb known for its sweet flavour and bitter aftertaste . Research presented at the Paleoanthropology Society Annual Meeting this week suggests they tended to eat horses, deer and bovids rather than larger game like mammoths. According to New Scientist, Geoff Smith, from the Monrepos Archaeological Research Centre in Germany, said they also seemed to have sucked out the fatty marrow from bones. There is also some evidence from Neanderthal sites in Gibralter that suggests they also liked nuts and wild olives. Analysis of fossilised Neanderthal faeces has also revealed that while they ate meat, they also had a 'significant intake of plants'. Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said: 'This paper reminds us that the Neanderthals were complicated and sophisticated humans. 'While the data from dental calculus might be evidence for medicinal plants this new research highlights a number of alternative explanations; the most intriguing of which is the use of food flavourings. 'The comparison with chimps must be used carefully as they are a very different animal but the complex array of behaviours seen in world chimps gives us even more to marvel at when we think about what the Neanderthals were capable of.' Neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago, spreading to inhabit much of Europe and parts of Asia, but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago. The reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated Homo sapiens. They were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age Europe. However, a series of discoveries are now putting Neanderthals into a new light. Stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination. A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France also suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices . A recent discovery by researchers at the Muséum National d'Histories Naturelle in Paris suggests that Neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them. They discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones. Many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments. Cross-hatched engravings found inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art. DNA analysis has also shown that Neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak. Eight talons found at a 130,000 year old Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia are also thought to be the world's first jewellery, and may have been worn as a necklace. The traditional image of Neanderthals as primitive creatures like above is no longer holding up to evidence .","Scientists suggest that prehistoric human cousins used herbs like yarrow and camomile to improve the taste of their food around 50,000 years ago .

"A wily coyote gave the New York Police Department the runaround for more than an hour on Tuesday morning after it was spotted on the grounds of an apartment building next to a church in Manhattan. The male animal, which was eventually captured with a dart gun, was first seen by a local walking his dog in the park near the Church of the Holy Apostles at 28th Street and Ninth Avenue in Chelsea. After the resident alerted two workers to the sighting, NYPD officers arrived at the scene. However, the coyote did not surrender easily, sprinting across the grass and dodging the cops' attempts to catch it. It was only captured more than an hour later when Emergency Services Unit officers finally managed to shoot the animal with a dart laced with Ketaset. As the coyote nodded off, it was then collared. Scroll down for video . On the loose: This wily coyote gave the New York Police Department a run around for more than an hour on Tuesday morning after it was spotted on the grounds of a co-op building next to a church in Manhattan . Police chase: The male animal, which was eventually captured with a dart gun, was first seen by a local walking his dog in a park near the Church of the Holy Apostles at 28th Street and Ninth Avenue in Chelsea . Tranquilized: After the resident alerted two workers to the sighting, NYPD officers arrived at the scene. The coyote was captured (pictured) more than an hour later when it was shot with a dart laced with Ketaset . 'Safe capture': Shortly after 9am on Tuesday, Chief Harry Wedin, of the NYPD's Chief of Special Operations Division, tweeted a photo of the coyote curled up in its cage, writing that it had been 'safely captured' Finally, officers placed the urban animal in a  containment box and transported it to an Animal Care & Control facility in East Harlem, Upper Manhattan, for evaluation, the New York Daily News reported. Shortly after 9am on Tuesday, Chief Harry  Wedin, of the NYPD's Chief of Special Operations Division, tweeted a photo of the coyote curled up in its cage, writing that it had been 'safely captured'. It is the second time that a coyote has been sighted in New York  in little more than two weeks. On March 30, another coyote spent an hour on top of the LIC bar in Long Island City, Queens, after making its way through an abandoned building. It was captured after fleeing into an old paint factory. In the latest incident, the coyote - believed  to be a different animal from the Queens coyote - was filmed by members of the public running away from the NYPD, according to Eyewitness News. Richard Pichardo, who was walking to work when he noticed the commotion and began filming it, told the station: 'When I first got here, I was curious just like everybody else, and I asked what was it. On the run: The coyote did not surrender easily, sprinting across the grass and dodging on-scene officers . Predatory animal: After it was eventually captured, officers placed the urban animal in a containment box and reportedly took it to an Animal Care & Control facility in East Harlem, Upper Manhattan, for evaluation . Caught on video: The coyote was filmed by members of the public running away from the NYPD on Tuesday . Detective: ESU Detective Robert Mirfield (pictured) explained that officers were 'very careful' in their attempts to catch the 'large, full-grown [and] strong' coyote, which was seen hiding behind bushes as it evaded them . 'When they told me a coyote, I figured it was just a small one. When I caught a good video and I seen the size of him, was large, 60 maybe 70 pounds. If he was standing up, he would be taller than me.' ESU Detective Robert Mirfield explained that officers were 'very careful' in their attempts to catch the 'large, full-grown [and] strong' coyote, which was seen hiding behind bushes as it evaded capture. 'You have to approach these job very carefully, take your time, use your training and hope for the best,' Det Mirfield said, admitting he had feared being bitten. 'It's  in the back of your mind,' he said. He told the New York Post that ESU officers armed with snares and dart guns had arrived at the scene at 8.30am. Cops from the 10th Precinct were already on-site, keeping an eye on the animal . 'When we felt it was safe enough, we used our animal noose to capture the animal,' he said. Darting around: 'You have to approach these job very carefully, take your time, use your training and hope for the best,' Det Mirfield said, admitting he had feared being bitten. 'It's in the back of your mind,' he said . Witness: Richard Pichardo (pictured), who was walking to work when he noticed the commotion and began filming it, said: 'When I first got here, I was curious just like everybody else, and I asked what was it' Church: The coyote was seen near the Church of the Holy Apostles (above) at 28th Street and Ninth Avenue . 'Then we placed him in an animal containment box and had him taken out to the center for animal control so they could, I guess, evaluate his health and his future... He didn’t want to get captured.' Ketaset - which the coyote was drugged with - is a rapid-acting, nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats. It is also characterized by, mild cardiac stimulation and some respiratory depression. It is believed that the coyote may have crossed one of the bridges or tunnels leading to Manhattan in the early hours of the morning, before making its way to the  grassy site at 296 Ninth Avenue. It remains unclear when and where the animal will be released. There have been numerous sightings of coyotes living in New York over the past twelve months. According to the New York Times, the predatory animals have been spotted in Pelham Bay Park, Riverside Park and even on Stuyvesant Town on the East Side. Another sighting: It is the second time that a coyote has been sighted in New York in only two weeks. On March 30, another coyote spent an hour on top of the LIC bar (pictured) in Long Island City, Queens . Taking in the sights? The animal (pictured on the roof) was captured after fleeing into an old paint factory . There are also claims that there is one coyote living in Railroad Park, Jamaica, Queens. It is believed that increasing competition for food is  forcing coyotes to leave their dens and search for new territories to scavenge. Suburban areas have food availability and a lack of predators. As a result of the explosion in the numbers of coyotes living within the five boroughs, New York's Park Department has even issued guidelines on what to do if you come in contact with a coyote. It advises residents against feeding coyotes as they should be kept wary of humans, as well as pets. Coyotes are native to North America and were traditionally found in deserts or on the plains. However, now they have begun colonising urban areas and can be found in many parks across New York City. They can be mostly seen during the mating season of January to March. They can also be sighted when their pups leave between October and January.","Coyote was spotted in a park near Church of Holy Apostles in Manhattan .

"A New York City bus driver is facing possible termination after video emerged of him looking at papers and driving with his wrists and forearms. A woman who boarded the driver's bus in Ozone Park, Queens, recorded the unidentified driver marking a set of papers with a highlighter and  looking away from the road. She was 'shocked' that the driver's behavior continued the entire ten minutes she was on the bus, in which all the seats were full. A New York City bus driver running a route in Queens is facing possible termination after an unidentified commuter recorded him driving with papers in his hand . The driver was seen with both hands on a piece of paper, believed to be a timetable for his route replacing the closed section of a subway, and driving the bus with his wrists and forearms . The commuter who captured the distracted driving on a bus with only standing room said that the behavior occurred the entire time she was travelling . 'He jeopardized the lives of everyone on that bus and anyone on the street,' the commuter said. The papers in his hand were likely timetables used to make sure he was stopping at all the correct junctures on Saturday evening,  the New York Post reported, citing a transit source. The bus was being used to replace part of a subway line closed for maintenance during the weekend. New York's Metro Transportation Authority, which runs the city's buses, said that 'bus operators are expected to have their full attention on safe operations at all times'. The driver has been taken out of passenger service while the agency investigates, and could face possible penalties including termination or retraining depending on his work history, according to a New York Post source. New York City adopted new laws last year as part of an effort to eliminate traffic accidents, such as the February 2014 crash between an city bus and a truck that careened into a building on 7th Avenue . This weekend's video comes as New York City has targeted speeding and reckless motorists in a bid to eliminate traffic deaths . A  law pushed into law by Mayor Bill DeBlasio last August has increased penalties on drivers, including MTA employees, who hit pedestrians after failing to yield. Bus drivers have said they are under attack by the new regulations, and that accidents happen even when drivers are doing their jobs properly. At least nine pedestrians were killed by transportation authority buses last year, according to the New York Times.","Bus driver in Queens seen highlighting  timetables as he drives with wrists .

"A teacher at a Houston-area high school is facing disciplinary proceedings for allegedly giving students anti-Muslim propaganda during class. Officials with the Lamar Consolidated Independent School District say the eight-page handout, which included references to terrorism and beheadings, wasn't approved by administrators. Authorities haven't yet released the name of the teacher at Foster High School in Richmond or what discipline he faces. The handout, entitled Islam/Radical Islam (Did You Know), made unsubstantiated claims like: '38 percent of Muslims believe people that leave the faith should be executed' An unnamed teacher at Foster High School in Richmond, Texas, is facing disciplinary proceedings for allegedly giving his students anti-Muslim propaganda during class . The handout, entitled Islam/Radical Islam (Did You Know), made unsubstantiated claims like: '38 percent of Muslims believe people that leave the faith should be executed' and that: 'There are an estimated 190-300 million 'radical Islam' followers.' The handout also mentioned Sharia Law, jihad, and had a section entitled; 'If taken hostage by radical Islamists, what to do', report KHOU. At least one student, who was Muslim, showed the document to her parents who contacted the Council of American Islamic Relations (CAIR). The CAIR, which has complainted to school, said on Tuesday that the documents contained erroneous information from an online anti-Muslim site. Council officials also called for the teacher to be disciplined. 'We're disappointed to learn one teacher made independent changes to a lesson plan, resulting in information being given that didn't follow subject matter, or state and local curriculum plans,' said a Lamar ISD spokesperson.

"Odds on the new royal baby being a girl have tumbled after a bookmaker revealed that 90 per cent of bets placed on the sex have been in favour of a female child. The odds were slashed further yesterday after a Scottish punter from Edinburgh placed a whopping £2,000 wager on a new princess with Ladbrokes. Betting on the new royal baby's date of birth has also been hotting up, with the 18th, 19th and 20th April the most popular choices - even though the  official due date is the 25th. Scroll down for video . A little princess? The majority of punters are convinced that the Duchess will give birth to a girl . 'Money talks, and punters all over the UK are convinced Kate will give birth to a baby girl soon,' comments Ladbrokes spokesman Jessica Bridge. 'It looks like the only people hoping for a boy are the bookies, and maybe Prince George.' Despite there being more than a week to go until the 25th, royal fans have already begun staking their claim to spots outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington. The world's media are also expected to descend on London shortly, with media facilities at the hospital opening tomorrow. Names have also proved popular with betting fans, with Alice the current front runner for a princess, followed by Victoria. Both  have a suitably regal pedigree, with Victoria boasting a particularly spectacular history and a string of titled owners. Getting ready: Preparations have begun at the Lindo Wing, with police warning of a 'special event' Last engagements: The Duchess of Cambridge, seen here in Woolwich, hasn't been seen since March . Take two: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pictured with Prince George after his birth in 2013 . Most notable of those is the new baby's five-times great grandmother Queen Victoria, who ruled at the height of the British Empire and gloried in the title of Empress of India as well as Queen. Her eldest daughter, the mother of the future Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, was also called Victoria, as were an impressive 12 of Queen Victoria's granddaughters. Another famous Victoria is Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria, 37, who will follow her 68-year-old father King Carl XVI Gustaf onto the Swedish throne. Alice, meanwhile, was bestowed on another of Queen Victoria's daughters, Princess Alice Maud Marie, who went on to marry Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse. The couple had seven children, among them the doomed last Tsarina of Russia, Alexandra Fyodorovna, and Victoria, first Princess Louis of Battenburg and then Marchioness of Milford Haven. Pedigree: Contemporary royal Victorias include Sweden's Crown Princess, pictured at her 2010 wedding . Princess Alice: Famous royal Alices include Prince Philip's mother, Princess Alice of Greece and Denmark . Will it be James? Along with seven British monarchs, James is also the name of the Duchess' brother . Her daughter, also called Alice, produced the most famous of Alice of Hesse's descendants - Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, now the Duke of Edinburgh. Should the punters of Britain be wrong and the Duchess of Cambridge produce a second baby boy instead, favourites include James and Arthur. James, although boasting a royal pedigree the equal of Victoria, is also a Middleton stalwart and is the name of the Duchess' 29-year-old brother. The moniker has also been used by two kings of Britain as a whole, James I and James II, and another five Scottish monarchs. Arthur, meanwhile, is derived from the Celtic Artorīgios which translates as 'bear king' and has a pedigree that includes Britain's most famous mythical king. Alice 3/1 . Elizabeth 5/1 .

"The funeral for murdered 26-year-old high school teacher Stephanie Scott will be held next Wednesday at the venue where she planned to wed her childhood sweetheart. A memorial service has been finalised to take place at the Eat Your Greens function centre in Eugowra, near Ms Scott's home town of Canowindra in rural Central West NSW and around a three hour drive from Leeton where she worked. Ms Scott was excitedly preparing the last minute details for her wedding and her honeymoon to Tahiti with her partner of five years Aaron Leeson-Woolley, when she disappeared from her workplace at Leeton High School on Easter Sunday. She was set to tie the knot last Saturday at the Eat Your Greens centre, instead her life will be celebrated in the same place at a memorial at 1pm this Wednesday. On Thursday the parish priest officiating at the ceremony said he was bracing himself for a hugely emotional occasion. High school teacher Stephanie Scott's funeral will be held at the venue where she was set to get married . A memorial will be held for Ms Scott at the Eat Your Greens centre in Eugowra, near Ms Scott's home town of Canowindra . Reverend Jonno Williams, the parish priest of the Anglican-Uniting Church at Canowindra, confirmed the venue to the ABC. He told Daily Mail Australia he knows the family well and is expecting it to be a tough day for everyone. ‘I know Stephanie’s father relatively well through the time that he taught at the local Canowindra High School,' Reverend Williams told Daily Mail Australia. 'It’s going to be a very difficult time for everyone, especially for the young people in town who knew her well.’ Reverend Williams was also yet another person who sang the praises of the young teacher whose heart-breaking tale has gripped Australia in recent weeks. ‘She was vice-captain of Canowindra High School and worked at the local swimming pool when she was younger,' Reverend Williams told Daily Mail Australia. Reverend Jonno Williams, the parish priest of the Anglican-Uniting Church at Canowindra, confirmed Ms Scott's funeral will be held at the Eat Your Greens centre (pictured) The priest told Daily Mail Australia he knows the family well and is expecting it to be a tough day for everyone . Mr Leeson-Woolley and Ms Scott, who was allegedly killed on Easter Sunday, were due to be married last Saturday . Stephanie is seen here having a good time with her friends and family at her hen party . 'She also worked at the local supermarket, so she was well known by everyone here from a young age. ‘Throughout this time Stephanie was always known for her friendly disposition and she was always friendly with anyone that she met. ‘I met her a few times myself and she showed herself to be a very friendly and cheerful girl. The community both here in Canowindra and in Leeton will be out in force to say their goodbyes on Wednesday.’ Less than a week before her wedding the Leeton high school teacher went missing on Easter Sunday. For the past 12 months, Ms Scott had been excitedly preparing her wedding to Mr Leeson-Woolley. The pair met as children playing soccer in the NSW central west town of Canowindra, where they grew up. Ms Scott was a popular teacher at Leeton High School where students paid homage to her . The 26-year-old's burned body was found around five metres from a road in Cocoparra National Park, north of Griffith, NSW, on Friday April 10 by police in an area where her accused killer, Vincent Stanford went on regular camping trips. School cleaner Stanford, 24, has been charged with her murder and is due to appear in court in June. The remains of Ms Scott have been formally identified. NSW Health says a post-mortem has been completed at Glebe Morgue in Sydney and a report is in the hands of the coroner. 'Additional testing is being undertaken prior to the release of Ms Scott’s body to her family,' a spokeswoman said. For the past 12 months, Ms Scott had been excitedly preparing her wedding to Mr Leeson-Woolley . Last Saturday Ms Scott's father Robert (left), mother Merrilyn (centre) and sister Robyn (right) were among those gathered at a memorial service for her at Mountford Park, Leeton .

Mr Leeson-Woolley (right) was a forlorn figure at the Mountford Park memorial last Saturday in Leeton . The Department of Forensic Medicine has made contact with Ms Scott's family to provide specialist grief counselling. On Monday, Ms Scott's devastated father opened up about the grief her family is feeling as they struggle to come to terms with their daughter's brutal murder, which took place just days before her wedding. Ms Scott's grieving father Robert explained that it is especially painful that Stephanie's life has been taken away when she had so much to look forward to. She was also a person who gave so much joy to others. 'Stephanie's aim was to get everyone feeling like it was their wedding as much as hers,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph, describing Ms Scott's bubbly and thoughtful personality. There are reminders of the wedding all over the house, yet instead of a wedding the Scott family must tragically prepare for Stephanie's funeral. 'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott. Ms Scott and Mr Leeson-Woolley had been taking dancing lessons together to prepare for their first dance as an excited married couple, according to Robert.

"Former Arsenal and England defender Sol Campbell is part of a new campaign to encourage minorities to register to vote in next month's general election. Campbell has joined forces with Homeland actor David Harewood, musician Tinie Tempah and Paralympic medallist//television presenter Ade Adepitan. The campaign, run by Operation Black Vote, features the stars in striking photographs ahead of the voting registration deadline on April 20. Sol Campbell is part of a new campaign to encourage minorities to register to vote for the General Election . Ex-England star Campbell retired from football in 2012 and is considering a career in politics . Campbell, 40, last month ruled out standing for the Conservatives in Kensington after Sir Malcolm Rifkind announced he would be standing down. At the time he said his 'ambitions lie elsewhere in the political arena' which led to speculation he could run for London Mayor. Campbell posed for a photograph with his face coloured white alongside the caption, 'If you don't register to vote, you're taking the colour out of Britain.' And on launching the campaign, Harewood said: 'What it brilliantly illustrates is that if you don't register to vote, you are quite literally taking all the vibrancy we have in our community off the table . 'If you don't register to vote, politicians don't really care about you, politicians aren't really caring about what you have to say, what you have to do, anything. Campbell won 73 caps for his country, scoring one goal over the space of nine years . 'The only way they talk to you is if you register to vote. That is when you become an important part of the electorate.' Operation Black Vote also launched a 2015 general election manifesto with the aim of 'reclaiming democracy, empowering citizens and fighting race equalities'. It says that in the past black and minority ethnic (BME) groups presented a broad range of 'key policy demands' to all parties, but adds: 'Our experience shows that whilst all parties express interest in our proposals during elections, this interest soon evaporates once in power.' Instead OBV has created a list of manifesto points of its own, including automatic voter registration linked to the National Insurance system, the introduction of e-voting and proportional representation, voting from the age of 16, state funding of parties and a 'minister for race equality' in the Cabinet.

"A Catholic priest has told his parishioners to carry guns - warning that faith alone is not enough to keep them safe. Edward Fride, the pastor at Christ the King in Ann Arbor, Michigan, suggested churchgoers attend classes to gain a concealed pistol license. In a pro-gun letter to parishioners, he warned that crime had gone up in the area while budget cuts meant that there had been a ‘significant reduction in the availability of an armed police response.’ Edward Fride (pictured), the pastor at Christ the King church in Ann Arbor, has told parishioners to carry guns. He is pictured right in front of a target at a range wearing protective glasses . After highlighting mass killings at schools across the US, he wrote that police were supportive of ‘doing what is necessary to adequately protect our families and our homes.’ His letter was called ‘We’re not in Mayberry Anymore, Toto’ in a reference to the Andy Griffith Show set in a North Carolina town in the 1960s. According to the Detroit Free Press, he wrote: ‘It is very common for Christians to simply assume that they live in Mayberry, trusting that because they know the Lord Jesus, everything will always be fine and nothing bad can happen to them and their families. ‘How to balance faith, reality, prudence, and trust is one of those critical questions that we struggle with all our lives. Pretending we are in Mayberry, while we are clearly not, can have very negative consequences for ourselves and those we love, especially those we have a responsibility to protect. If we are not in Mayberry, is there a real threat?’ The newspaper reports that the priest informed parishioners about the CPL lessons during Palm Sunday mass and sent out the letter when some people questioned the idea. A bulletin on the church’s website offers parishioners 'eight hour' CPL classes, which include instruction from law enforcement personnel, time on a range and use of guns and ammunition. It says that the cost is $125 per person and urges parishioners to register early as class sizes aer limited. Edward Fride, pictured next to a cut-out of the Pope, warned that crime had gone up in the area while budget cuts meant that there had been a 'reduction in the availability of an armed police response’ Edward Fride posted this picture on his Facebook page along with the caption, 'Maybe I should get some of these - the way this day has been going, the zombies are bound to attack at sundown....' Edward Fride is the pastor at Christ the King Catholic Church (pictured) in Ann Arbor, Michigan . Rev Fride points out in his Mayberry letter that he was once a pacifist and had been a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. But after converting to Catholicism, he said he moved away from pacifism and questioned what his own response would be if he saw a woman being 'beaten or sexually assaulted, or somebody attacking kids.' He wrote: 'I eventually concluded that I was certainly no longer a pacifist absolutist; there were situations in which I would actively intervene, even to a lethal level if necessary.' The Free Press said it had been unable to reach Rev Fride for comment but that a spokesman for the Diocese of Lansing which oversees his parish had confirmed the letter had been sent out. Catholic Bishop Earl Boyea said that guns did not belong in a Catholic church while it was not appropriate to hold classes on church property, the paper reports. The statement added that Bishop Boyea 'has never given permission for anyone to carry a concealed weapon in a church or school in the Diocese of Lansing' and that churches in the diocese were 'gun-free zones'.","The Reverend Edward Fride invited parishioners to take part in gun classes .

"A British-born street artist is taking a bold stand against American culture in his most recent piece currently on display across Los Angeles. This week, artist Plastic Jesus put up seven 'NO Kardashian Parking Anytime' signs around Hollywood, including in front of the Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian-owned clothing store Dash and other hot spots such as the Ivy Restaurant and Cecconi's on Melrose. Plastic Jesus told The Hollywood Reporter that he came up with the idea for the piece while driving down Melrose Avenue a few weeks ago. London-born street artist Plastic Jesus erected several 'No Kardashian Parking Anytime' signs around Los Angeles this week - including one right outside the Kardashian sister's clothing store Dash . Plastic Jesus says he got the idea while driving down Melrose Avenue in L.A. a few weeks ago, when traffic was brought to a standstill because of a Kardashian shopping on the street . The Kardashian family pictured above attending Easter celebrations at a church in Calabasas, California on April 5 . He says traffic came to a complete halt when one of the Kardashian sisters walked out of a storefront and paparazzi swarmed to grab a picture. Plastic Jesus remembers thinking 'How has this become a news event?' 'The Kardashian family has become ingrained in our culture,' he said. 'We've allowed mainstream media to become so profit-driven, we are sacrificing genuine news stories to satiate our vapid celebrity obsessions.' 'I guarantee that same number of paparazzi was far greater than any number of photographers chasing real news.' After the incident on Melrose, Plastic Jesus thought up an idea to draw attention to the obsession with reality TV stars . 'The Kardashian family has become ingrained in our culture. We've allowed mainstream media to become so profit-driven, we are sacrificing genuine news stories to satiate our vapid celebrity obsessions,' Plastic Jesus said . Plastic Jesus says the stunt was not meant to target the Kardashians specifically but the reality TV star obsession in general . Plastic Jesus has been compared to street artist Banksy for his graffiti in L.A. He received attention recently for spraying signs that read 'Stop Making Stupid People Famous' around the town and for a touching tribute to Robin Williams following the actor's death . Anonymous: Above, a picture of the street artist posted to his Instagram page . However, Plastic Jesus says the signs aren't meant to single out the Kardashian family specifically, but rather the whole world of reality television. 'These signs are intended to be a practical joke and cause amusement. I hope the Kardashians will see the funny side of it. I don't have a problem with them,' he told the New York Daily News.

"Supermodel Maggie Rizer only gave birth to her daughter Cecilia Kathryn nine weeks ago, but the mother-of-three is already back to her trim and toned self. The 37-year-old fashion veteran sported a tiny string bikini as she posed with her two-year-old son Quinnlann Clancy for a sweet snapshot, which she shared Monday on her Instagram account. 'Boogie boarding with my baby,' she captioned the image. And online commenters couldn't help but note how fit Maggie looks only a few months after she and her husband Alex Mehran welcomed their first daughter into the world. Beach body: Supermodel Maggie Rizer donned a string bikini while playing with her two-year-old son Quinnlyn Clancy on the beach - just nine weeks after she gave birth to her daughter Cecilia Kathryn . Bundle of joy: The 37-year-old shared this precious baby photo to announce the birth of her third child and first daughter on February 9 . 'That body is right back!' one Instagram user posted, while another added: 'I. Just. Don't. Understand. [sic]' Maggie thanked her commenters for being 'very kind' before noting that she takes great care over which images she chooses to share on her account, saying: ‘I post carefully!’ But one fan insisted on giving the model credit for getting her amazing body back into such great shape so quickly, writing: '@maggierizer there's not enough careful in the world to make me look like this even though I have ONE kid and she's almost two. You are killing it! [sic]' And Maggie has been working hard. Two weeks before her family vacation she shared a picture of herself on a Pilates reformer. 'Can't be a slacker forever I guess,' she captioned the photo of herself working up a sweat. Happy family: Maggie posed next to her husband Alex Mehran to celebrate their newborn's 'first trip to the beach' Date night: Maggie and Alex were pictured enjoying a romantic dinner later that night . Maggie and Alex, who also have a three-year-old son named Zander, are spending time with their family, including their newborn at an unidentified tropical destination. Another Instagram snapshot, which was also posted yesterday, shows Maggie sporting patterned shorts and a pink tank as she poses next to Alex, who is holding their baby girl. 'Cecilia's first trip to the beach!' she wrote. Later that night, Maggie shared a picture of her and her husband enjoying wine and a glass of something bubbly during a romantic 'island' dinner. Maggie, who announced Cecilia's arrival into the world with a precious Instagram photo on February 9, continues to chronicle her children's adventures and their precious family moments on the social media site. Getting toned: Two weeks before her beach vacation, Maggie shared this photo of herself working out on a Pilates reformer . Pretty in pink: Maggie and Cecilia donned matching pastel outfits for Easter . All bump: Maggie showed off her growing belly with a selfie she took in January . Maggie rarely models but remains in demand, despite having moved to San Francisco for her husband's work. She was last seen on the catwalk in September 2014 at Michael Kors' New York Fashion Week show. Though her pregnancy was not public knowledge at the time, she would have been four months' pregnant - a point at which most expectant women start to show a small bump. Maggie, who originally hails from New York State, was one of the world's most popular models in the late Nineties and early 2000s. She stopped modeling in 2004 after it emerged that her stepfather, John Breen, who had been handling her finances, gambled away her entire fortune. Her professional earnings alone were estimated to be over $7million, though she also lost inheritance left by her biological father, Kevin Rizer, after his death from AIDS when she was 14. Since the loss of her father - her parents divorced when she was a baby when Kevin announced that he was gay - the model has been a staunch AIDS awareness activist.","The 37-year-old welcomed her first daughter Cecilia Kathryn into the world on February 9 .

"Britain is looking forward to another week of glorious weather as bookmakers revealed this spring is now odds-on to be the warmest on record. On what is expected to be another unseasonably warm week, forecasters say temperatures in the South could reach  23C (73F) by Wednesday. People have made the most of the sunny weather this weekend by heading to beaches and parks across the UK, with Brighton particularly busy. The best temperatures at 2pm today were 16.2C (61.2F) at Achnagart in the Scottish Highlands, followed by 14.5C (58.1F) in Plymouth, Devon. Scroll down for video .

Meanwhile Ladbrokes has cut its odds on this spring being the warmest on record to 4/6, while it is offering 2/1 on this summer being the hottest ever. Punters can also get 5/1 that the mercury will hit 100F (37.8C) in 2015, or 4/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 will be broken this year. Today will bring cloudy weather for central and eastern Britain with sunny spells and the chance of light showers, but it will be dry and bright elsewhere. And tonight will be fairly cloudy for the centre of the country with the possibility of showers, while most other areas of the UK will be dry with clear spells. Three-day forecast: Today will bring cloudy weather for central and eastern Britain with sunny spells and the chance of light showers . Absolutely soaking wet: Daniel Willcox cools down in a fountain at Southsea Splash Pool in Hampshire today . Jogging: A man and woman run through an avenue of cherry trees coming into blossom at Greenwich Park in south-east London today . Forecasters expect the South to reach 17C (63F) tomorrow, 21C (70F) on Tuesday, 23C (73F) on Wednesday and 20C (68F) on Thursday. Tomorrow will see mist and low cloud disperse from most parts of Britain in the morning to leave a bright day with sunny spells and patchy cloud. Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said yesterday: 'It is definitely very warm for this time of year as it should be around 12C (54F).' The South East and South West are already on course for their sixth hottest April since records began in 1910, according to Met Office figures. Surface chart: This Met Office graphic shows how high pressure is dominating this weekend in Britain with temperatures in the mid teens . Incoming high tides and strong winds: Five flood alerts are in place today - for Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, Bristol and Cumbria . Some 93 hours of sunshine - up 20 hours on the average - have brightened the UK already this month, but the South West is on flood watch today. Very high tides lashed by strong winds may hit seaside towns and villages along the south Devon coast this weekend, the Environment Agency said. Yesterday’s top temperature in the UK was 17.6C (63.7F) - observed in Achnagart in the Highlands and Pembrey Sands in Carmarthenshire. But that was still some way off last Wednesday’s 2015 UK high of 25.1C (77.1F) in Kent, making it the warmest April day in the UK for four years. Parts of Britain could face a drought as the Met Office cut its rain forecast following last week's heatwave. The unseasonably high temperatures last week saw highs of more than 25C (77F) in the South East - nearly double the average for this time of year. And forecasters warned that initial figures suggest that so far this month Britain has only seen 35 per cent of the average rainfall for April. The dry spell follows months of below-average rainfall and conditions are not expected to bring significant showers before May's arrival. Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said: ‘We are over halfway through the month but we've had around a third of the rainfall we get on average. ‘Over the next week temperatures are going to stay above average for most parts of the country, with the high pressure lasting until the weekend.’ Weather data for the year so far shows national rain fall has been significantly lower than average nearly every month. The year got off to a soggy start, with January seeing 20 per cent more rain than average but then 13 per cent less than usual fell in February. Last month the figure was 5 per cent below average.

"His penchant for topless scything has proved a hit with housewives around the UK - and sent many rushing to social media to declare their love for actor Aidan Turner, 31. But it seems not everyone is a fan of the gardening techniques featured on Poldark - not least the mowing community who have complained about Turner's 'excessive sweating and grunting' and say it should never be done shirtless. Turner set hearts aflutter when he stripped off to manfully mow a hay field with a scythe, an ancient cutting tool used for centuries prior to horse drawn and modern mowing machinery. Scroll down for video . More like Iggy Pop: Scything expert Chris Riley says his own physique is more like rocker Iggy Pop . But while the sexy scene helped send audience ratings through the roof, it prompted a scathing critique from a band of enthusiasts dedicated to keeping the age-old art alive. They say Turner’s macho grunts and terrible technique as he hacked at the hay tarnished the view of the usually 'sedate' action of scything. Expert scyther Chris Riley, 56, says in real life, Turner would have run out of breath long before completing the filed - and he would have kept his shirt on to protect him from the sun. 'When the Poldark episode in question aired, word got around our network of scythe enthusiasts very quickly that there had been this scene in it where Aidan Turner used a scythe,' he says. 'It was accompanied by a lot of comments saying his technique wasn’t very good. The story of Poldark highlights the romantic aspect of the scythe and its use in history but we weren’t very impressed with Aidan Turner’s scything.. That's how it's done: Mr Riley demonstrates how scything should really be done . Surely not? Mr Riley brushed off comparisons with Poldark and compared himself to Iggy Pop instead . That's more like it: Aidan Turner's shirtless Poldark has been setting hearts aflutter on Sunday nights . 'There was a lot of sweating and grunting going on but the only time you’d mow like that would be in a competition.' Mr Riley, from Gillingham in Dorset, also questioned whether Turner had been shown how to use a scythe properly before the cameras rolled. 'Scything is an efficient and poetic way of cutting rather than the way it was portrayed on Poldark where it was this very aggressive, manly action. 'Using a scythe should be a sedate, pleasurable activity rather than an arduous, backbreaking chore. It can be zen-like if you’ve got a sharp blade and good technique. 'That was how the programme makers wanted to portray it but it was clear to us that there wasn’t much effective work being done. 'The grass and flowers in the meadow weren’t flying everywhere, which you might expect if someone was good with a scythe. 'I would guess that Aiden Turner had not been shown how to use a scythe properly before filming. If an experienced scyther were to put the same amount of energy into it as on Poldark they’d be getting an awful lot done. 'A work rate like that is also not conducive to keeping the action up all day, but that was obviously in conflict with how producers wanted the scene to look.' Mr Riley also raised questions about Turner’s lack of shirt, claiming a real scyther would keep their clothes on to protect them from the elements. Exhausting: Mr Riley says Poldark puts too much effort into his scything and wouldn't  finish the job . Smooth move: Fellow expert Simon Fairlie, from Dorset, shows off his skills in a West Country meadow . The 56-year-old, who runs courses in how to wield a scythe, added: 'The fact that he had no top on was not particularly realistic - if you were in the field all day and wanted to protect yourself from the sun you wouldn’t take your shirt off. 'There are times when it is OK to scythe topless, like if you are in competition, but I’m more Iggy Pop than Aiden Turner.' Meanwhile... Female fans take to Twitter to complain about the lack of shirtless mowing in last night's episode of Poldark . Female fans of BBC One's Cornish period drama Poldark are complaining after dashing actor Aidan Turner kept his shirt on in last night's penultimate episode. Many have taken to Twitter to voice their upset after the Irish hunk, who plays Captain Poldark, went a whole episode without revealing his chest. In previous episodes the star has been seen scything topless and skinny dipping in the Cornish sea. Where are the abs? Fans were disappointed by the lack of topless action in last night's Poldark . Recap: Poldark has appeared topless in nearly every episode and is seen here in episode three . Memorable: Episode two featured Aidan Turner taking a naked swim in crystal clear Cornish waters . Last night the BBC continuity announcer said there would be 'distressing scenes' as one of the characters is murdered, but many women joked it was 'distressing' seeing Turner fully clothed. One fan named Stacey tweeted: 'Distressing scenes my arse. Only 'cos he kept his clothes on all night #Poldark.' Verthless added: 'Despite the @BBCOne warning before #Poldark my wife is traumatised by some of the scenes in which Aiden Turner kept his shirt on.' Jacqui Walls posted: 'All bad news on the #Poldark front tonight. @Aidan Turner didn't get his shirt off once.' Others complained about the lack of any obvious carer for Captain Poldark and Demelza's baby Julia because she was absent from most of the scenes. Although Poldark sacks his servants Jud and Prudie, Demelza is later seen visiting Francis and going for cliff top walks without her baby daughter. 'Can someone tell me who looks after #Poldark's baby @BBCOne,' tweeted MursMums. Cross: A viewer complained that the real source of distress was a lack of shirtlessness . Traumatic: Viewers had been hoping that Poldark would take his top off - but had no such luck . Compensation: One concluded that at least Poldark's trademark smoulder had been left in place . Denouement: Next week's finale will reveal whether Ross and Francis manage to patch up their quarrel . Fired: Other viewers questioned who was doing the childcare following Jud and Prudie's sacking . Gallery 45 tweeted: 'It's all very good swooning over Ross, but we have some serious concerns for the welfare of Baby Julia! #homealone.' Others joined a growing chorus of fans who want the series to continue beyond the final episode which airs next Sunday. Fenteroon Hol Cotts tweeted: 'Have a feeling there's be lots of tears shed next Sunday eve, approx 10pm.' Caley added: 'I genuinely don't know what I'm going to do after nxt wk. First #fortitude ends, now #Poldark.' Heidi wrote: 'Can't believe #Poldark is near the end its been the highlight of my weekends!!!!' Jaime Watson posted: 'Can't believe it's the last #Poldark next week. How am I going to survive without seeing @AidanTurner every Sunday?' Another, Hannah, tweeted: 'Last episode of #Poldark next week. Sad times. I like my weekly Aidan Turner fix.' Luckily for fans of the 18th century mining drama and Mr Turner, the BBC announced last week that it has commissioned a second series of Poldark.","Chris Riley, 56, from Dorset, says Turner has the technique all wrong .

"What do you get when you cross a mango and a plum? The answer is the latest tropical fruit to go on sale in the UK, nicknamed the ‘plango’. Marks & Spencer is stocking the Bouea macrophylla – or mango plum – after years of work with specialist growers in Thailand. Marks & Spencer is stocking the Bouea macrophylla (pictured) – or mango plum – after years of work with specialist growers in Thailand. It has been nicknamed the plango and it is expected to be a big hit . The fruit has a bright orange edible skin, which is firmer than a plum, and a sweet taste similar to an Alphonso mango but with a softer texture. M&S fruit expert Shazad Rehman said: ‘We know our customers like to try new and interesting fruit and we’re sure this will be something they will really enjoy. ‘It has a soft texture and all the delicious flavour of a mango without any of the hassle to prepare as you can eat the skin.’ The fruit, smaller than a mango, will be on shelves this weekend. It's not the only unusual hybrid on the market. The fruit has a bright orange edible skin and will go on sale at Marks & Spencer from this weekend . The Meyer lemon is a naturally occurring cross between a lemon and a mandarin. The first sweet lemon to be sold commercially in this country can be eaten much like an orange, but it is best used in thin slices – peel, pith and all. The fruit, native to China, was discovered growing by Frank Meyer, an employee of the US Department of Agriculture who was exploring the country at the turn of the last century. The skin is fragrant and thin, while the flesh is a dark yellow and contains up to ten seeds. Other fruits include the Nectacotum, which is part nectarine, apricot and plum, while the boysenberry is a mixture of the blackberry, raspberry and loganberry.","New tropical fruit to go on sale in the UK is cross between mango and plum .

"The son of Linford Christie was caught with almost £1,500 worth of crack cocaine and heroin - just months after he was jailed for allowing his home to be used as a drugs den, a court heard today. Liam Linford Oliver-Christie, 29, whose father is the former Olympic sprinter, was caught with the drugs under his floorboards during a police raid in West Kensington, west London. Officers uncovered the haul and ‘drugs paraphernalia’ with the help of a sniffer dog at his council flat in September 2013 - and Oliver-Christie today admitted two counts of possessing class A drugs. Drugs charges: Liam Linford Oliver-Christie (pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court today) was caught with the drugs under his floorboards during a police raid in West Kensington, west London, in September 2013 . Isleworth Crown Court in Middlesex was told today that the drugs cache included 14.1g (0.50oz) of cocaine of up to 40 per cent purity and 841mg (0.03oz) of heroin of up to 60 per cent purity. Neil Griffin, prosecuting, said: ‘There was a search warrant executed on September 30 but Mr Oliver-Christie was not at home. However, under the floorboards there was a box containing drugs.’ Oliver-Christie, who today wore a black leather jacket and bright pink trainers, was jailed for 15 months at the same court in August 2012 for ‘turning a blind eye’ to drug dealing at his home. When officers burst into his home - on a road with an average property value of nearly £600,000 - they saw cocaine and heroin being thrown from the window of his raised ground floor flat. Raid: When officers burst into his home in West Kensington (above) - on a road with an average property value of nearly £600,000 - they saw cocaine and heroin being thrown from the window of his flat . A tub of white protein powder - used to ‘cut’ the drugs and up dealers’ profits - was also discovered, and the drugs found in the box had a street value of £1,410. Sprinter: Linford Christie (pictured above in 1993) was the toast of British athletics for a decade . He had denied possessing criminal property but was convicted after a trial. Oliver-Christie also has a previous burglary conviction from 2002. Bailing him before sentencing on May 15, Judge Martin Edmunds QC said: ‘You have pleaded guilty to counts two and four of the indictment and those have been accepted by the Crown. ‘Sentence in this case will take place on May 19, and in the interim I will ask the Probation Service to prepare a pre-sentence report about you and address your drug issues.’ The court was told Oliver-Christie’s drug issues are now ‘under control,’ while he is being supported by friends and relatives. Emma Fenn, defending, said: ‘He has sought voluntary help and that has been resolved with family help. He is suitable for unpaid work if this passes the community threshold.' Two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs, which Oliver-Christie denies, were ordered to lie on the court file. His gold-medal winning father did not attend his latest hearing today. The sprinter was the toast of British athletics for a decade after sprinting to victory at the Barcelona Games in 1992 and later glory at the World, Commonwealth and European 100m. But his career was hit in 1999 when he tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone and was banned by the Monaco-based International Association of Athletics Federations. However 55-year-old Christie has always denied taking performance-enhancing drugs and was cleared by UK Athletics.","Liam Linford Oliver-Christie caught during police raid in west London .

"Eric Jackson took a bullet in the forearm during the deadliest mass shooting on a U.S. military base, and returned to Fort Hood five years later with other survivors on Friday to receive Purple Heart medals. Some smiled over an honor they felt was overdue, but also clenched their teeth over needs in their scarred and injured lives they say the Army has denied. 'I try not to be bitter. But it's kind of hard not to be bitter,' said Jackson, a former staff sergeant. 'You wonder, where's the respect? Where's the recognition? Where's the support for what you've gone through and what you're continuously going through?' Scroll down for video . An honor: Teena Nemelka, right, mother of Private First Class Aaron Nemelka who was killed during the attack by Major Nidal Hasan in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, looks down at her son's Purple Heart . Building bonds: Teena Nemelka, left, mother of Private Firtst Class Aaron Nemelka, left picture, and Sheryll Pearson, right, mother of Private First Class Michael Pearson, right picture, visit one another on Friday . Thirteen people were killed and 31 were injured in the 2009 attack carried out by an Army psychiatrist who is now on military death row. Following years of tension, the Army gave the Purple Hearts to survivors and relatives of the dead in a somber ceremony on the Texas military post, just two miles from where Nidal Hasan had opened fire in a room of unarmed soldiers. Top military commanders recalled tables that became makeshift stretchers to transport the wounded and dying. Ten of the survivors remain on active duty. 'It is our sincere hope that in some small way this will help heal the wounds you have suffered,' Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland said. But words of gratitude from military leaders and elected officials, including Republican Texas senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, gave way to medal recipients pressing and chastising the Pentagon over combat benefits. The Purple Heart, given to military personnel wounded in battle, offers increased retirement pay. Cornyn said he expects Fort Hood victims to finally get approved for entitlements within weeks, noting that he spoke to Army Secretary John McHugh before the ceremony. Terrorist: Hasan (pictured) was convicted by a military judge in 2013 in the killings, and he recommended the death penalty . He snapped: Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan opened fire on November 5, 2009, killing 13 men and women at the military post in Killeen, Texas, injuring 30 others before he was shot himself . Rememberence: Joleen Cahill, foreground, wife of Michael Cahill who was killed during the attack by Major Nidal Hasan , carries her husband's Defense of Freedom Medal back to her chair . Many survivors are also seeking separate financial damages in a lawsuit, claiming the U.S. government should have known of Hasan's extremist views. During his 2013 trial, Hasan told jurors he had 'switched sides' in what he called America's war with Islam. He admitted beginning the rampage by pulling out a pistol and shouting 'Allahu akbar' (God is great) and said he wanted to stop American soldiers from being deployed to kill fellow Muslims. Kimberly Munley, a Fort Hood police officer at the time, helped end the attack in a gunfight with Hasan. She was awarded the Defense of Freedom medal but after the ceremony expressed frustration over uncertainty about the level of benefits Fort Hood victims would receive. 'These soldiers are going to get what they rightfully deserve,' Munley said. The award: Dozens of Purple Hearts and two Defense of Freedom Medals were awarded at Fort Hood, Texas to victims and family of the 2009 terrorist attack . Military officials had long denied the Purple Heart awards because they called the attack an act of workplace violence, not terrorism. Cornyn and others have long condemned that classification, but he said changing the distinction could have jeopardized the case against Hasan, who was not charged with terrorism. Last year, Congress approved new eligibility requirements for Purple Hearts that forced the Defense Department to reconsider. The daughter of Michael Cahill, a physician's assistant who was the only civilian killed in the attack, accepted the Defense of Freedom medal for her father and used the occasion to draw attention to veteran suicides. Cahill was shot while as he rushed toward Hasan with a chair lifted over his head. 'The first month after dad died, everyone asked us, ""What can I do?"" And it was great,'Kerry Cahill said. 'Nobody asks me that any more. We're not done.' A moment of silence: Texas Governor Greg Abbott, seated, and Sen. John Cornyn, right, bow their heads during the invocation of a Purple Heart ceremony held at Fort Hood, Texas on Friday .","Some smiled over an honor they felt was overdue, but also clenched their teeth over needs they say the army has denied .

"It was meant to be the ultimate symbol of menace: carving '666' into his forehead. But in a phenomenal case of idiocy, convicted murderer Nikko Jenkins used a mirror - so the numbers came out backwards. The symbol is described in the biblical book of Revelation as 'the sign of the beast', and has since been popularized by the horror movie The Omen. However, with a series of upside-down 9s, Jenkins has fashioned himself an entirely unique - and irreversible - engraving. Botched: Nikko Jenkins (pictured in 2014) recently tried to carve '666' into his forehead but did it backwards . According to Omaha.com, Jenkins told his attorney about the incident in a phone call from his cell in Omaha, Nebraska. It comes amid the 28-year-old's ongoing appeal that he is mentally unstable and therefore ineligible to face the death penalty. Jenkins was jailed exactly one year ago for shooting dead four people in 10 days after being released from prison. During his murder trial in Douglas County, Jenkins was assessed by a doctor who concluded that he was 'a psychopath' and 'one of the most dangerous people' he had ever encountered. 'Psychopath': The 28-year-old, who a doctor described as 'one of the most dangerous people' he had ever encountered, may use the botched case of self-mutilation as evidence he is mentally unstable . Jenkins pleaded not guilty, then guilty, then ineligible for trial on the grounds of insanity. However, a judge dismissed the appeals and he was sentenced to life. The decision of whether he would be sentenced to death was delayed after Jenkins revealed he had carved a swastika into his skin. Following months of delays, he will face a panel in July to decide his fate. It is believed Jenkins may use his latest botched case of self-mutilation as further evidence that he is mentally unstable.","Nikko Jenkins, 28, was trying to etch the Revelation sign of the beast .

"Radio DJ Neil Fox forced himself on a girl of 13 at a theme park after she asked him to pose for a photo, it was alleged yesterday. Fox – known to his millions of listeners as Dr Fox – also indecently assaulted two star-struck girls under the age of 16 at a motor show, a court heard. The 53-year-old is accused of a total of nine offences against three girls and three women over 23 years. One alleged victim says Fox repeatedly assaulted her at Capital Radio’s studios in Leicester Square. Scroll down for video . Support: DJ 'Dr' Neil Fox leaves court with his wife Vicky where he denied nine sex attacks on six victims - including three children . Two others say they were sexually touched against their will by him at Magic FM’s studios in Central London. Fox denies seven counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual touching without consent against six females between 1991 and 2014. As the charges were put at Westminster Magistrates Court, his barrister Jonathan Caplan QC asked for reporting restrictions to be lifted because there had been false statements about the charges on social media. Fox, who wore a dark pinstripe suit and was accompanied to court by his wife Vicky, asked for his case to be heard by a district judge at the court, rather than facing a jury trial. Prosecutor Darren Watts told the court: ‘The Crown argue that the complaints show a consistent and determined pattern of sexual predatory behaviour.’ He said Fox, a former Pop Idol judge, allegedly assaulted two girls at a motor show in Bromley, South East London, in the summer of 1991 while appearing there as a DJ. Mr Watts said: ‘In relation to the first allegation the complainant was approximately 13 or 14 years of age. She... asked for a photograph with him and he is said to have kissed her and forced his tongue down into her mouth.’ Fox, who denies sex attacks on women and children, smiles after he left today's hearing . A second teenager alleged Fox kissed her and put his hand up her skirt. The attack on the 13-year-old girl at Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey took place in 1996 and allegedly involved Fox forcing his tongue into her mouth after she asked for a photo. He faces four charges of indecent assault against a former female colleague at Capital Radio, where he worked from 1993 to 2005. The woman claims he squeezed her breasts and would regularly grope her bottom. Fox, of Chelsea, was granted bail and is next due in court on April 30. Fox was first arrested in September last year and the DJ, who categorically denies the allegations, was then questioned for more than seven hours over four alleged offences. At the same time, officers swooped on his £3million home. Darren Watts, prosecuting said: 'In relation to the second allegation the victim was approximately 15, at the same motor show. 'The defendant was present and has again been asked for a photograph, and it is alleged he kissed her - forcing his tongue into her mouth while putting his hand up her skirt and touching her bottom. Mr Watts explained that the next four allegations related to the same victim, a woman over 16 years old, at Capital Radio between 31 January 2003 and 31 December 2003. 'In four separate incidents he has shown unacceptable behaviour,' Mr Watts said. 'The first time he has put his arms around her, squeezing her breasts tightly. 'He would regularly touch her bottom, be that a caress or a squeeze. 'The third incident happened while he was in the recording studio - he bent her over from behind and stimulated sex.' Mr Watts said on the fourth occasion Fox had touched the woman between her legs, albeit over clothing. Defence: Lawyers for the 53-year-old, from Fulham, south west London, said he 'categorically denies' the allegations . The final two allegations of inappropriate touching are said to have taken place at Magic FM between January and November 2007, and March and August 2014. 'The next incident (eighth allegation) happened in the work place,' Mr Watts said. 'It is said the defendant started touching her and putting his hand up her top, exposing her bra and breast.' Suspended: Dr Fox is one of Britain's most famous DJs but has been unable to work since his arrest . Fox then allegedly pushed her onto a sofa and simulated having sex, the court heard. The final incident also took place at Magic, where Fox is said to have approached a woman from behind and said 'Oh, I have just got to,' before kissing her on the shoulder. He allegedly said to her: 'You look as if you taste so good.' Charge one: Indecent assault on a girl under the age of 14 years in Bromley in 1991 . Charge two: Indecent assault on a girl under the age of 16 years in Bromley in 1991 . Charge three: Indecent assault on a girl under the age of 16 years at Chessington World of Adventures in 1996 . Charge four: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge five: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge six: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge seven: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge eight: Sexual assault on a female in 2007 in central London . Charge nine:Sexual assault on a female in 2014 in central London . Mr Caplan said it was 'regrettable' that he had to apply for reporting restrictions to be lifted, but qualified he was doing this to ensure a 'fair trial' for his client. Mr Caplan added that misreporting in the press and on social media as to what the allegations and charges amount to  had 'courted inferences' about the allegations which were 'wholly wrong.' He said the alleged offences amounted to 'inappropriate kissing and touching over clothing.' Mr Fox, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM. There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon. The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival. He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans. Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career. But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade. Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since.

"A marathon runner stopped one and a half miles before reaching the finishing line - to propose to his girlfriend. Romantic Ben Parsons, 34, of Brighton, East Sussex, stunned girlfriend Anna Jefferson, 36, by getting down on one knee after running 24 and a half miles. She was watching her boyfriend run in the Brighton marathon with their children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months. Ben Parson, 34, paused in the middle of the Brighton marathon and proposed to his surprised girlfriend, Anna Jefferson, 36 . Anna feared her boyfriend was struggling when he started to slow down on Hove seafront, because she was unaware of his proposal plan. Ben then got down on one knee and popped the question and Anna said yes, before Ben ran onward towards the finishing line, still managing to get a personal best timing and completing his sixth Brighton Marathon in 3hrs 36min. Ben, a media law lecturer at the University of Brighton, carried the ring in his bum bag and waited to spot Anna in the crowd on Sunday. He said: 'I wanted to do something romantic to surprise Anna and the marathon has such a feelgood, loved-up atmosphere anyway so I knew it would be the perfect time. Ben Parson had already run 24.5 miles of the 26.2-mile Brighton marathon when he stopped to propose to girlfriend and mother of his two children, Anna Parsons . At the time, Anna had been stood in the crowds with children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months . 'Judging by the look on her face, she was certainly surprised. 'Once Anna had said 'yes' and we'd had a big sweaty hug I had to get on the move again so my legs wouldn't seize up. 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com. 'I had an extra spring in my step for the last mile and a half.' 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com': After Anna said yes, Ben carried on with the marathon . He said that the pressure of the proposal spurred him on and brought the finishing line a bit closer. But he joked: 'If I hadn't seen her in the crowd maybe I would have just carried on to the end and taken the ring back to Argos.' Anna, who works for Arts Council England, and has been dating Ben since they met at City College Brighton in 2002, said she never expected the proposal. She said: 'There had been a guy just before him who had got a cramp and had to stop for his friends to massage his leg. Newly-engaged: The happy couple are stood after the surprise proposal with their two children . 'Then Ben started slowing down and I thought 'oh god he's going to collapse or something'. 'I had no idea what he was planning. 'In hindsight he had suggested before that I wear something nice so we could go out for something to eat afterwards. I should really have twigged when he asked me to take his brogues in the bottom of the pram.

"A man dying of terminal cancer has decided not to check into the hospital but rather hit the streets as an Uber driver. Ken Broskey, 69, of Livonia, Michigan, has been diagnosed with stage 4 Oropharyngeal cancer, and his doctors have urged him to check into hospice care. Instead, Broskey, formerly a real estate agent, has taken a job with Uber, hoping to make enough money in what time he has left to pay off his mortgage so his daughter and two grandchildren can continue to live in his house. Scroll down for video . Ken Broskey (above) has stage 4 cancer, and has taken a job as an Uber driver . This so he can earn money to pay off his mortgage before he dies so his daughter and grandchildren (above) can have his house . Now he is getting a little help too from Uber after they heard about his story. The company has donated $5,000 to the man, and is also donating $1 to a GoFundMe campaign set up for the man for every rider who enters UberPartnerKen into their app when requesting a car before Monday. This is all thanks to the work of Roland Gainer, a college student who started a campaign to help Broskey after riding in the man's car. 'His situation reminded me of the helplessness I felt watching my mother battle (but beat) cancer when I was in high school,' writes Gainer on the aforementioned GoFundMe page he set up for Broskey. And in just a few days, the fundraiser has almost reached its $95,000 goal. Roland Gainer (above), a college student, started a GoFundMe page for Broskey after meeting him which has almost reached its $95,000 goal . 'For Ken, if we could buy him time, that would be our request, but we can’t,' says Gainer. 'We can, however, using our relationships and resources help to give him peace—and his family their home- in his final days.' It is not just the money either, as Boskey and Gainer also seem to have forged a true friendship. Says Gainer; 'My unlikely friendship with Ken has defied age, race, geographic, and economic boundaries and is bound by the common good of mankind.' He then adds; 'But, it won’t defy time.'","Ken Broskey Livonia, Michigan, has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and his doctors have urged him to check into hospice care .

"With his lively eyebrows, winkled cheeks and eyes that follow you around the room - this state-of-the-art robotic head is menacingly lifelike. The humanoid, known as Ham, has been drawing in crowds with his incredible range of facial expressions at an electronics event in Hong Kong this week. The head, designed by American robotics designer David Hanson, is able to answer basic questions and can also be used in the simulation of medical scenarios. Scroll down for video . Incredibly lifelike: Known as Ham, this humanoid is made using specialised software and can recognise and respond to facial expressions . Ham is currently on exhibit at the Global Sources spring electronics show at AsiaWorld Expo - the largest event of its kind in the world, with more than 4,000 booths displaying the latest gadgets. The head is created with malleable material called Frubber using soft-bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology. It contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across (there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre). Using specialised software the machine can recognise and respond to a number of human facial expressions in a natural way. According to Hanson Robotics's website, the humanoids can actually see your face, make eye contact with you, and understand speech to 'engage you in witty dialogue'. Such reactions are a major feat of engineering, according to chief designer David Hanson, the founder and and president of Hanson Robotics. Reactive: The robot smiles using multiple motors - which whir into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes . State-of-the-art: The head is created with malleable material using soft-bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology. It contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across (there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre) It is not the first human-looking robot that his firm has created either. An earlier version of Ham drew headlines as it was sculpted to look like Albert Einstein, complete with a bushy moustache and a shock of white hair. The Einstein humanoid made facial expressions by using multiple motors - which whir into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes. Mr Hanson sees robotics as his calling and works on many fronts, from sculpting features to developing artificial intelligence. To advance to the next step of producing robots for everyday applications in entertainment, health care and education, he decided to move to Hong Kong with his family - his wife Amanda and their son Zeno. The city has a booming robotics community with a high amount of expertise and design infrastructure and new technology can be developed at a lower cost than in the US.

"It's the nation famed for its gastronomy which gave birth to haute cuisine and the Michelin Guide . But almost three quarters of all dishes served in French bistros, brasseries and cafes are shipped in from a factory and microwaved, according to a top restaurateur. Xavier Denamur sparked fury after he exposed France as a country of microwave cheats and even went as far as to compare it as being the culinary equivalent of a low-cost airline. Xavier Denamur sparked fury after he exposed France as a country of microwave cheats and even went as far as to compare chefs' corner-cutting as being the culinary equivalent of a low-cost airline . 'The microwave has become the chef's best friend,' he told The Times. Unesco has named France's 'gastronomic meal' a world treasure and the country still welcomes more tourists than any other nation. But there are signs that its crown as the world's culinary king has been slipping for some time. Last year, the country that gave us the croissant, coq au vin and moules mariníères, as well as introducing the concept of L'apéritif, did not get a single entry in to the top ten of the World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards. Xavier Denamur has claimed that almost three quarters of all meals served in French bistros, brasseries and cafes are shipped in from a factory and microwaved . Instead the list was dominated by Spain, the UK, USA, Brazil with Denmark as number one, with only five French restaurants making it into the awards at all. The French government was so concerned they called on two multi-Michelin-starred chefs to draw up battle plans. But even chefs Alain Ducasse and Guy Savoy, who have now put together a 20-point plan, admitted that France's global culinary influence 'is no longer the same'. They added that France's mid-to-low range restaurants, particularity in tourist traps like Mont Saint Michel or the banks of the Seine, let the country down. The chefs recommended stricter criteria should also be introduced on food with the 'home-made' label in restaurants which currently allows most frozen and vacuum-packed food. A survey by catering union Synhorcat in 2014 suggested 31 per cent of restaurants (not including cafeterias, bars and fast food outlets) used industrially prepared foods. But Mr Denamur, who revealed the trade secrets in his book Et si on se mettait enfin a table? (And if We Sat Down to Eat at Last?) claimed the figures were as high as seven in ten dishes served in cafes, brasseries and bistros were made in a factory and re-heated. In his book he said the dominant low cost model imposed by the 'greedy' producers of frozen food has 'trapped independent restaurants and sacked the planet.' Last year the French government passed a law which was meant to force restaurants to label the dishes they prepare from fresh ingredients in their own kitchens as 'fait maison' (homemade). But ministers have been forced to admit that the law had failed as diners had little faith in the new label. Commerce minister Carole Delga said the scheme was meant to promote traditional cooking and those establishments that cook from scratch. A survey by catering union Synhorcat in 2014 suggested 31 per cent of restaurants (not including cafeterias, bars and fast food outlets) used industrially prepared foods (stock picture) A new law to try and promote freshly made dishes has been criticised as chefs are still able to buy in read-made ingredients . She claimed the fait maison logo would 'allow all, at a glance, to distinguish food that has been assembled from industrially prepared elements from cuisine created from raw produce'. But the new law was criticised for not going far enough as restaurants were still able to use ingredients such as factory-made pastry and claim the food was homemade. Mr Denamur, who starred in République de Malbouffe (Republic of Junk Food), a documentary investigating the state of French food said he had been 'bitterly disappointed' by the label. 'I chop all my steak tartare to order, but someone who buys it in, vacuum packed in a controlled atmosphere, where it might have come from 10 different cows, can call theirs fait maison too. It's ridiculous,' he told the Guardian last year. 'If you can't make the base for a sauce, don't make one. Don't use an industrial one – that's not real cooking, it's not fait maison.' Mrs Delga has now pledged to tighten up the rules around the law. Star chefs Alain Ducasse (right) and Guy Savoy (left) will be putting together a 20-point plan for the 'gastrono-diplomacy' report to try and repair France's reputation . The rising cost of raw materials and staff may be partly to blame for putting cooking from scratch beyond the reach of many restaurants. A traditional boeuf bourguignon costs as much as 7.50 Euros to produce, according to the restaurateur who owns four French bistros. It is often much cheaper for chefs to simply buy frozen ingredients and ready-made dishes from industrial producers such as Transgourmet, Métro, Brake or Davigel. Last month, the French ministry launch the Good France project which saw 1,000 chefs of different nationalities serve French food and wine in restaurants and embassies across five continents as part of its national 'gastrono-diplomacy' drive. The elaborate four course meals aimed to emulate those of celebrated 19th century cook and culinary ambassador Georges August Escoffier.","Xavier Denamur claims most dishes in French bistro aren't made on site .

"Muhammed Tahir at the Old Bailey. He was banned from using London Underground during rush hours after rubbing himself up against a woman in a busy carriage . A dry cleaner in his fifties has been banned from using the Tube during rush hours after targeting a young woman and rubbing his crotch and pot belly on her bottom. Mohammed Tahir, 53, of Leytonstone, east London, got off his train at Mile End and picked a target on the platform - a 'confident and articulate' professional in her 20s, a court heard. He then followed her onto a Central line service and stood as close to her as he could. Tahir sidled up to the victim and pretended to accidentally slide his hand across her thigh as she stood with other passengers in the busy carriage on a hot summer’s day. Unable to leave the packed train, she tried to change position and lean as far away as possible to escape his advances. But Tahir moved even closer and began rubbing his crotch and pot belly against her thigh and bottom. His behaviour was so obvious that it had attracted the attention of undercover police officers who were watching his every move. Eventually, the horrified young woman managed to attract the attention of one of them and Tahir was arrested, finally putting an end to the nightmare ordeal. Detectives later discovered that Tahir was charged with two similar offences in 2003 only to be cleared after the prosecution file failed to arrive in court in time. At the Old Bailey, Judge Rebecca Poulet QC said that the experience was clearly very 'frightening and shocking' for the victim, who cried while giving evidence, despite seeming very confident and self-assured. He was convicted of sexual assault after a two-day trial at the Old Bailey, but the judge decided not to jail Tahir in the hope that he can tackle his problems under the supervision of Probation officers - despite saying 'there must be a custodial sentence'. Tahir was given a six-month prison sentence suspended for two years, a 12-month supervision order, told to complete to do 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay an £80 victim surcharge. The judge also prohibited him from travelling on the Tube or entering any London Underground station between 7am and 10am and 4pm and 8pm for five years. Undercover police officers first spotted Tahir when he got off his train at Mile End at around 8am on 24 July last year. He followed a young woman onto a train, unaware that officer were watching his every move . The judge told Tahir: ‘Your purpose in getting off was not because you were hot as you claimed but in order to look for a suitable young woman and to follow her on to the train for your activities. ‘That is exactly what you did. So blatant was your conduct that no less than three undercover police officers saw you doing it and saw you looking at young women. ‘You spotted [the victim] and followed her on to the Central Line train. It was fairly crowded and she stood centrally in the area near the double doors holding the rail with her right hand. ‘When the train moved off she felt something brush her left side. She looked down and saw your hand by her side in a somewhat unnatural position and it made her uncomfortable. ‘She moved to get away from you, still thinking the touching might be accidental. When the train moved again you came closer, pushing your stomach up against her and then your crotch. ‘She leaned as far as she could in order to move herself away from you but you moved with her, pressing up against her. You pressed your crotch on her thigh and buttock. She could feel you pressed firmly against her buttock. ‘Despite being a confident and articulate and fair witness she cried giving evidence and the experience was clearly frightening and shocking for her. ‘In my view there must be a custodial sentence. You were in grave peril of going immediately to prison. I want to impose a sentence that will prevent you from behaving like this ever again and the public is best served by suspending this sentence.’","Muhammed Tahir, 53, followed woman in her 20s onto Central Line train .

"A New York man who became known as the 'Cannibal Cop' wants to give the public a taste of what's really going on inside his mind. In the HBO documentary Thought Crimes which premiered on Thursday at Tribeca Film Festival, Valle talks about his 2012 arrest and the claims that allegedly plotted to kidnap, torture, and eat his wife and other women online. For those hungry to learn  about Valle and his stomach-churning fantasies, the film will also be shown on HBO in May. Scroll down for video . Thought Crimes :In the HBO documentary Thought Crimes 'cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle talks about his 2012 arrest and the claims that allegedly plotted to kidnap, torture, and eat women online . Family time: Gilberto Valle, often at his mother's house, is seen cooking in the film but he's only making bacon and eggs and he makes jokes about people feeling afraid when they see him with a fork . Months before his arrest in late 2012, Gilberto Valle, then a New York police officer, sat at his computer, hiding behind fictional online identities and exchanging messages about murdering and eating women . 'When you’re behind a computer screen late at night, no one knows who you are, where you are,' Valle says in the opening of the documentary. 'I became part of this cyber-community, where people are exploring deviant thoughts and exploring their fetishes,' he added. 'And then you shut the computer off, and that’s it. I go back to being the regular me. But someone might say the anonymous nature could also bring out who you really are. In my worst nightmare, I could never guess that this would have happened.' Valle, often at his mother's house, is seen cooking in the film but he's only making bacon and eggs. 'Nobody’s alarmed I have a fork in my hand with people around? Everybody's good?' Valle asks at one point when sitting down to eat. Valle insists throughout the film that he never intended to actually hurt anyone. He says he just has dark fantasies. 'This was something that was private, anonymous, it was a little bit of a skeleton in my closet,' Valle says, brushing off his dark thoughts. The New York Daily News reports that the director of the film Erin Lee Carr said that she wanted to portray Valle in as neutral of a light as possible. Originally convicted: Former New York City police officer Gilberto Valle, dubbed by local media as the 'Cannibal Cop' after a guilty verdict was delivered at his trial as seen in this courtroom sketch . 'He wanted me to paint a portrait of him as an American family man and I couldn’t do that,' Carr said. 'I could portray him as someone you could try and understand.' Carr is the daughter of New York Times columnist David Carr who died in February. In the film Valle's father, Gilberto Valle Sr., says his son was guilty of being an imaginative writer. 'He created a monster. He’s a good writer,' he says. At the end of the film, Valle expressed his desire to meet a woman. 'I think sometimes I’m craving a little, you know, craving some companionship,' he says. Walking free: Former New York City police officer Gilberto Valle and his mother Elizabeth Valle leave the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York after his conviction was thrown out . Valle has been out of jail since July after being cleared of conspiring to abduct, cook and eat women. His trial included lurid details of how he sought advice from others in the online 'death-porn' community over how to kidnap, kill and eat his wife and friends. He was sentenced to time served in November for illegally accessing a federal database. He was also given a year's probation on a charge of misusing police resources to search for women as part of his fantasies. Valle was ordered to continue mental health treatment and was banned from contacting women involved in the case. 'I really want to say I am sorry - it was not a crime but it was wrong,' Valle said outside court in November. Another chance: District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan threw out the conviction of Gilberto Valle, 30, after federal public defenders argued that the U.S. Constitution grants people the right to fantasize . During his trial, the jury heard how Valle communicated in chat rooms about killing and cooking his wife. He told one man he met in a fetish chat room: 'I want her to experience being cooked alive. She'll be trussed up like a turkey. ... She'll be terrified, screaming and crying.' In another exchange, Valle suggested a woman he knew would be easy prey because she lived alone. The chat room discussion centered on cooking the victim, basted in olive oil, over an open fire and using her severed head as a centerpiece for a sit-down meal. Valle had been facing life in prison but the charges were thrown out in July, with the judge writing that ' more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play'. Family support: Former New York City police officer Gilberto Valle , his mother Elizabeth Valle, and his father Gilberto Valle leave the U.S. District Court . The former cop's defense lawyers said Valle recognized that the substance of his Internet chats was 'deeply troubling and disturbing' and now meets weekly with a counselor to discuss it. They added: 'Gil does not want his life's legacy to be the story of the ''Cannibal Cop.'' 'He is only 30 years old and intends to make something more out of his life. Inspired by the team of people who defended his innocence, Gil wants to go to law school.' Valle, then a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com. The FBI found a list of 100 women he said he planned to kill, cook and eat. They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body. Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out. Valle's ex-wife, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce last July. She took the couple's young daughter and completely cut off contact with Valle and his family.","'Cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle stars in an HBO documentary called Thought Crimes which premiered on Thursday at the Tribeca Film Festival .

"A blind man was left 'completely embarrassed and humiliated' after staff at his local Post Office refused him entry with his guide dog. Craig Roberts, 36, from Chadderton, Manchester, walked into his town's Post Office and an employee shouted from behind the counter that he would have to leave his guide dog Bruce outside if he wanted to be served. Even when Mr Roberts explained his two-year-old Golden Labrador Retriever Cross was a guide dog, the employee allegedly still insisted he should be left outside. Scroll down for video . Humiliated: Craig Roberts, 36, was told by Post Office staff in Chadderton, Manchester, that he would have to leave his guide dog Bruce outside if he wanted to be served. He said he was left feeling 'angry and shocked' Mr Roberts said: 'I was left feeling so angry and shocked. It is unacceptable that I should be made to feel like I had done something wrong by going to the Post Office with my guide dog. In this day and age there should be more awareness than that.' He added: 'Luckily a couple of customers heard him and said he wasn't allowed to do it because I had a guide dog and that he would have to let me in. He was told a few times and wasn't happy about it.' Mr Roberts, who had gone to the Post Office to top up his electric meter with his payment card, was eventually served by the employee after a ten minute standoff. He said: 'He did serve me in the end. I think he only served me because the other customers interjected. You could tell they were angry and a couple shouted ""you can't do that, he has a guide dog"".' The Post Office in Chadderton, Manchester, where Mr Roberts was told he had to leave his guide dog outside . Mr Roberts was born with glaucoma, a condition which affects eyesight as a result of pressure built up behind the eye, but in the last 12 months has seen a radical decline in his sight. He now has only 30 per cent vision in one eye which means he can't work and struggles with everyday tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The 36-year-old, who lives alone, said: 'I find it difficult doing everyday tasks at home as it is. Making a meal is tricky as I have to make sure it is cooked and cleaning is quite hard because I can't see dust and dirt. Under the Equality Act 2010, people with disabilities have the same right to services supplied by shops, banks, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis and restaurants as everyone else. Service providers also have to make 'reasonable adjustments' for guide dog and assistance dog owners which might mean offering extra help, and this includes allowing guide dogs and assistance dogs into all public places with their owners. 'It takes quite a lot to go out to the shops as it is and so to be made to feel that I can't even go to the Post Office to simply pay a bill is ridiculous.' Mr Roberts said he has 'never experienced anything like this before' but that he has been told a similar incident with a fellow guide dog user at this particular Post Office has happened. He added: 'This incident has really knocked my confidence and made me think if I can't take Bruce to the Post Office, will this happened again at the shops or a café? It was really embarrassing and humiliating.' So angered was Mr Roberts by the incident that he went straight to a nearby library and lodged an official complaint with the Post Office. He also contacted Manchester Guide Dogs Association, which has been in contact with the Post Office. Sorry: The Post Office has issued an apology 'for any distress caused' following the incident . A spokesman for Guide Dogs said: 'We're always saddened when we hear about a shop or another service provider refusing access to a guide dog owner. The Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to deny access to a guide dog owner. We are always happy to work with the Post Office, or any other organisation to help them understand their duties under the Equalities Act.' Mr Roberts said: 'I want a written apology from the Post Office and assurance this will never happen to me or any other guide dog user again. 'It is totally unacceptable and they should have greater awareness.' Having posted the incident on Facebook he said he had received numerous comments in support of his complaint. 'One gentleman said that if that is the way the Post Office deals with a disabled person he would never come into the Post Office again,' said Mr Roberts, who has had Bruce for seven months and says he's his best friend. He has called the Chadderton Post Office employee's response to his guide dog 'outdated'. 'It is clearly an outdated view of things. I think something needs to be done to educate people that if you have a guide dog it should not stop you from getting about and shouldn't stop you from doing the things that everyone else gets to do,' Mr Roberts said. 'I was determined to get this into the public eye because it probably does happen too often and happening just once is too many times.' A spokesman for the Post Office said: 'Post Office policy is to allow guide dogs and other assistance dogs into branches and we would like to apologise for any distress caused.' Chadderton postmaster Mr Parekh said: 'I have spoken to Craig and arranged for him to come back into the shop. Any misunderstanding between Craig and my staff will be rectified.'","Craig Roberts, 36, went to Chadderton Post Office to top up electric meter .

"As the daughter of actress Nanette Newman and film director Bryan Forbes, and the wife of a super-rich banker, Emma Forbes was never destined for a life on the breadline. But even she has astonished her showbusiness friends by buying a £27 million London mansion – for cash. The four-storey home has five kingsize bedrooms, five bathrooms, an underground pool, a gym, and a lift to take cars to the basement garage. Extravagant: The red-brick mansion with a neo-classical facade was torn down by the previous owners . But it is not to everyone’s taste – one neighbour has described it as looking like a ‘down- market mortuary’. The purchase comes after Ms Forbes, 49,  made a handsome profit on the sale of her previous flat, in Chelsea. Cash buyers: Emma Forbes, 49, pictured with her hedge fund boss husband Graham Clempson, 51 . Land Registry documents show that she sold that seven-bedroom home for £43 million in February. She and her hedge fund boss husband Graham Clempson, 51, had bought it for £18.5 million in 2007, before spending large sums on revamping it. Registry records show there is no mortgage on the couple’s new home. Ms Forbes and Mr Clempson moved into her new-build house with their children, Lily, 19, and Sam, 16, in February. Neighbours have expressed mixed views about the house, which was completed this year after a two-year build. It replaced a red-brick mansion with a neo-classical facade that was torn down by the previous owners. Although the architects said they designed the new yellow-brick house to blend in with other Victorian and Georgian townhouses in the conservation area, some residents complain that it ‘just sticks out’. One neighbour said: ‘Apparently the council approved it, which is outrageous. ‘In an area like this it’s important the buildings fit a certain look. But it just sticks out, it doesn’t look like anything that belongs here.’ Another resident added: ‘It looks like a downmarket mortuary. There was more taste to how it was before. Now it looks like a council estate.’ London property developers have revealed that the sale of Ms Forbes’s previous apartment for £43 million made it one of the most expensive flats in the UK. The priciest apartment in the UK is believed to be in the One Hyde Park development in Knightsbridge, which sold for £140 million last year. Tristan Ward, a solicitor acting for Ms Forbes and Mr Clempson, said it was ‘inaccurate’ to say that she made a profit of £24.5 million on their previous flat as the couple spent considerable amounts of money refurbishing it before selling it. Mr Ward added that his clients’ property affairs were a ‘private matter’. Ms Forbes’s mother, 80, is famous for her roles in the 1970s British film classics The Stepford Wives and International Velvet, both of which were directed by Mr Forbes. He died in 2013.

"This little bear cub has picked a comfy place to take an afternoon nap so shouldn't be grizzly when he wakes up. The heartwarming scenes, captured by professional photographer Denis Budkov, 35, during a trip to Kuril Lake in Kamchatka, in Russia, show the animal family have bear-ly a concern in the world as they play and snooze in the sunshine.

"In the United States, women earn an average of 78 cents for every dollar that men make — and a new pop-up shop in Pennsylvania is using this blatant gender-biased wage gap in order to charge its female customers lower prices than its male visitors. Pittsburgh-based pop-up store, Less Than 100, has priced its entire stock to reflect the local gender pay gap, meaning that female customers are only charged 76 per cent of the retail price while men pay in full. More active protest than business venture, Less Than 100 is not-for-profit and aims to highlight the disparity in salaries between the sexes. Scroll down for video. Woman's worth: Elana Schlenker has opened a pop-up shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where women are charged only 76 per cent as much as men in order to highlight the problem of wage inequality . 'It’s incredible how deeply unconscious biases still permeate the ways in which we perceive (and value) women versus men,' owner Elana Schlenker told Refinery29. 'I hope the shop’s pricing helps to underscore this inherent unfairness and to create space for people to consider why the wage gap still exists.’ Ms. Schlenker can afford the gender-conscious pricing because her shop isn't aiming to make money; all sales from the ceramics, textiles, publications, art prints, and stationery sole will go back to the female artists who made them. 'This is a small way that I can do something about [the pay gap], and I think many of the artists involved are coming from a similar place,' Ms. Schlenker added. Price adjustment: Less Than 100 sells ceramics, art, and textiles by female artists as a discount to female customers . In addition to adjusting its prices, Less Than 100 is also holding events promoting wage equality at the pop-up space, including one for April 14's Equal Pay Day, which represents how far into the year a woman must work to earn as much as her male counterpart did the previous year. Ms. Schlenker said she is concerned that women are undervalued in the workplace and underrepresented in executive positions and wants to draw attention to the problem through this venture, and added that she's been excited about how much support her shop has received. 'Everyone that's walked in, from women to men, has said ""I love this idea"",' she told WPIX. 'Women are worth what men are worth, of course, and just that community that's sprung up around this has been amazing.' She has also reached out to local organizations for grants to help maintain the pop-up shop, which will be open in Pittsburgh for the entire month of April. Ladies pay less: At the original location, women pay 76 per cent; in New Orleans this fall, women will pay 66 per cent, since women in Louisiana make even less compared to men than women in Pennsylvania . Fans of the idea who want to get in on the action but don't live in Pennsylvania can continue to check in on the organization's website, as Ms. Schlenker intends to travel with the shop, changing prices everywhere she goes to reflect the local pay gap. She will be re-opening the the store in New Orleans this fall, where prices for female shoppers will drop even more to 66 per cent of the original retail value, corresponding with Louisiana's pay cap. Male customers will continue to pay 100 per cent of the price for items like a $224 pitcher, which costs $195 for female customers in Pittsburgh, and a $120 Gamma Folk necklace, for which women this month are charged $92.","A store in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is charging women 76 per cent of what they charge men, reflecting the local pay gap .

"The mutilated body of a missing elderly British woman has been found 'in two different areas' of a southern French region and a man charged with her murder, local prosecutors say. Violet Price, 80, had been missing from her home in Moustier village since last week, after her son -  a businessman who lives in the area - was unable to reach her by phone after she attended a dinner party. A 32-year-old man has now been arrested and charged with murder after he told police where to find the body parts. Prosecutor Pascal Prache (left) speaks during a press conference in Agen, where it was revealed body parts believed to be that of missing Violent Price had been found in two separate locations . Local police have arrested and charged a 32-year-old suspect, who they say was known to Mrs Price . Violet Price (pictured), 80, had been missing from her home in Moustier village since last week . Mrs Price's son, who lives in the same area, raised the alert on Saturday after he went to her house when she failed to respond on the phone. Police immediately started looking for the 80-year-old widow who lived alone, mobilising 70 officers, a helicopter and divers, and searching hospitals as well - to no avail. A source close to the probe had said she was 'neither depressive nor suicidal', adding that there was no apparent reason for her disappearance. The Daily Telegraph reported the 32-year-old man has now been arrested and charged with two counts of murder, although prosecutor Pascal Prache could not give any information on a possible motive. The suspect told police where to find the body parts in two different areas of the southern region. Mr Prache said: 'Given the declarations of the suspect and observations on site, it appears to be the body of Violet Price,' he said, adding that an autopsy would confirm this. He added the suspect had already been sentenced in 2005 to eight years in prison for manslaughter and the man and Mrs Price knew each other, though they were not close. They were both present at a meal hosted by the in-laws of Mrs Price's son Saturday, both left separately mid-afternoon, but for reasons as yet unknown, both found themselves at her home later in the day. When officers visited Mrs Price's house on Saturday they found the lights on, and two cups of coffee – one half full. The source said Mrs Price did not own a mobile phone, but had plenty of friends and family in the Dordogne, and had been enjoying life. Mrs Price is a widow whose maiden name is Finnis. She moved to France from London three years ago so as to be closer to her son. She speaks very little French. The Dordogne, east of Bordeaux, is hugely popular with British expats and second home owners, who move there for the beautiful countryside and relatively cheap property prices. French police collect evidence at the home of Violet Price, who went missing on Saturday after attending a dinner party . Mrs Price and her late husband, Harry, bought the house in Moustier 15 years ago, originally as a holiday home to rent out. Mr Price died last year. Mrs Price also moved to Moustier to be closer to her son, Paul, who is married with two children, and lives in nearby Pardaillan. Claudine Eon, the Mayor of Moustier, said: 'I never expected it to end like this. I'm a natural optimist, and thought she had gone off with friends. 'I've spoken with a lot of people in the village who, from now on, will be keeping their doors locked. They've already barricaded themselves in.' Mr Eon said Ms Price was 'charming and courteous', and mainly spent her time with members of the British community in the area.","The mutilated body of Violet Price discovered in two different locations .

"At first glance the rectangular island of Por-Bajin looks like a foreboding fortress or prison, with its regular structure and ruined sections. But it is unknown for certain what the rectangular island and its labyrinthine ruins, located in a lake in deepest Siberia, was actually used for when it was built 1,300 years ago. Historians and scientists are divided, but some experts believe the isolated area may have been built to attract people instead imprisoning them, and suggest it was a summer palace, monastery, or an astronomical observatory. The mysterious island, Por-Bajin, was found in the centre of a remote lake high in the mountains of southern Siberia . A reconstruction sought to show what the island could have looked like before it was ruined . The fortress is located about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition . The name Por-Bajin translates as 'clay house' in the Tuvan language, and the island sits between the Sayan and Altai ranges, about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border. The location was first discovered in 1891, and the purpose of island has still not been explained over a century later. More in-depth research took place in 2007 with archaeologists discovering clay tablets of human feet, faded coloured drawings on the plaster of the walls, giant gates and fragments of burnt wood. Experts say the island was built during the period of the Uighur Khaganate (744-840 AD) but it is not clear what their motive would be for constructing a fortress for in such a solitary place – as it is far from big settlements and trade routes. Archaeologists conducted limited and inconclusive excavations at the site in the 1950s and 1960s . The ruined structures have led experts to believe the island was used as a fortress or prison . The island has baffled experts for over a hundred years who say it could have been anything from a prison, to a palace or monastry . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition. Scientists were able to use laser mapping to create a 3D image of what the 3.5 hectare plot could have been used for. Although it is said to be around 1,300 years old, many walls were intact and well preserved with a main structure in the inner courtyard being separated into two parts, covered by a tiled roof walkway supported by 36 wooden columns on stone bases. Isolated ruins! The fortress is connected to other land via a small walkway . Irina Arzhantseva of the Russian Academy of Sciences is now digging here for the Por-Bajin Cultural Foundation to find out just when the complex was built and why . Even more confusing than the debate of why it was created is the question of why it was abandoned. Researches have noted the lack of heating systems on the island, despite it enduring harsh Siberian weather and being located 7,545 feet above sea level. Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the island with Prince Albert of Monaco in 2007 and echoed the confusion. 'I have been to many places, I have seen many things, but I have never seen anything of the kind,' he said. Por-Bajin ('clay House' in the Tuvan language) was long thought to be a fortress built by the Uighurs . The few artifacts unearthed at the site seem to date it to the mid-eighth century .

"Sitting with a set of felt-tip pens and a book full of black line drawings just waiting to be filled is most children's idea of heaven. But now thanks to an illustrator and designer from Tenby, West Wales, colouring in is the latest stress-busting hobby for adults. Millie Marotta, 36, is giving colouring books an adult twist with her sellout volume Animal Kingdom, filled with intricate and designs of animals filled with stylised flower shapes, patterns and shapes. Scroll down for video . Embellished elephant: Millie Marotta's colouring book features an array of intricate designs, including this elephant . Millie Marotta, 36, took eight months to complete the illustration in Animal Kingdom . The beautiful black and white book is made up of detailed line illustrations of animals, plants and birds and encourages users to 'add your own touches with colours or line drawing.' And the art book, which was published in August last year, has achieved unheard levels of success, selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages. The success of Animal Kingdom's has come as a huge surprise, not least to Millie herself. 'My illustrations are a real labour of love, they take a long time and I think people really can and do appreciate that,' said the former art teacher. 'Because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book. 'This is why I would say they are so well suited to adults and have proved so popular in that area of the market.' This coloured-in image of a dragonfly taken out of Animal Kingdom shows the vibrant level of detail . An image of a donkey from the colouring book is creatively constructed from flora and fauna . Millie has had a successful freelance illustration careeer with clients including Virgin Atlantic, Penguin books and Marks & Spencer, but it's her best-selling colouring book that really propelled her to fame. In 2013, she was approached by Batsford Ltd, her now-publisher, to see if she would be interested in doing the book. She took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia. She explained: 'I would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in. 'It's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today's busy and fast paced world. A bluebird illustration has been coloured in to show the creativity and consistency needed to finish one of Millie's illustrations . This blue whale has an immense level of detail and would take a considerable amount of time to finish colouring in . Millie worked from her studio in Tenby, Wales, to create her range of detailed illustrations . 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world and those things which may be causing us worry or stress. A little bit of escapism if you like.' And reviewers have taken to the UK Amazon site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits. One user commented: 'Received this book yesterday and haven't stopped since. 'I've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work. The pics are amazing an the paper quality is good. I have already completed four pics in one day!' 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world': The 36-year-old illustrator (pictured) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic . The book, Animal Kingdom, retails at £3.99 and is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list . The Welsh illustrator has said that, although it is mostly adults buying the book, the influence of Animal Kingdom is widespread. She has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings. 'From parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring, to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision,' said Millie. Many fans are  busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family. Millie says that Animal Kingdom is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness, while there are, 'Ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club!' Millie agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books, could be down to their therapeutic quality. She explained: 'I think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them. 'In that sense I think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to 'switch off' as they become really absorbed in what they're doing.' The artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images. This image of striking stag was created by the Welsh designer out of detailed fauna line drawings . Plenty more fish in the sea! Millie's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations . She said: 'I also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it. 'Someone said to me that with Animal Kingdom they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book. 'I think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish.'","Millie Marotta's book, Animal Kingdom, features detailed line illustrations .

"Thousands of live earthworms have been falling from the sky in Norway - a rare phenomenon being reported across large swathes of the south of the country. A biology teacher discovered the worms on the surface of the snow while he was skiing in the mountains near Bergen at the weekend. Numerous reports have been coming in after he told his story, and there have been sightings of worm rainfall. Worm rainfall: Karstein Erstad took this photograph of the worms he discovered in the snow on Sunday . Teacher Karstein Erstad told Norwegian news website The Local: 'When I found them on the snow they seemed to be dead, but when I put them in my hand I found that they were alive.' Initially he thought they had wiggled their way through the snow, but dismissed this when he realised it was up to a metre deep in some places. Following Mr Erstad's discovery on Sunday, there have been similar reports in southern Norway and sightings of worm rainfall in Lindås and Suldal near Bergen, and also hundreds of miles away in Femunden. The biology teacher told The Local: 'It’s a very rare phenomenon. 'It’s difficult to say how many times it happens, but it has only been reported a very few times.' After Mr Erstad found the worms on Sunday, there have been multiple reports or worm rainfall in Norway . He said he found reports of the same strange phenomenon taking place in Sweden in the 1920s. In 2011, a group of pupils playing football at a school in Scotland witnessed worms falling from the sky. The students at Galashiels Academy in Selkirkshire had to abandon their game when the invertebrates began falling on them. According to the Mother Nature Network, some incidents of creatures falling from the sky have taken place after tornadoes and storms and scientists think they could have been picked up and carried for miles.","Teacher Karstein Erstad found thousands of live worms on top of the snow .

"A 22-year-old University of Kentucky student was shot and killed near campus in what police describe as an attempted robbery. Jonathan Krueger, the photo editor at the school newspaper and a junior in the College of Communication and Information, was shot in the chest around 2 a.m. Friday while walking home. Police  charged Justin Smith, 18, with the murder Friday afternoon, this after he fled when they tried to stop him earlier in the morning while driving a minivan that matched the one described by someone who was with the victim. Smith was also charged with robbery, tampering with evidence, and fleeing and evading. Police are still looking for more suspects. Jonathan W. Krueger (above), the photo editor at the school newspaper and a junior in the College of Communication and Information, was shot Friday . The Lexington Police Dept. investigate the scene of the fatal shooting (above) Friday morning . Dazmond Morgan told the Lexington Herald-Leader he rushed to the Krueger's side after hearing four gunshots around 2am on Friday. Morgan said he was 'alone when he reached him and was jerking as he struggled to breathe.' He also said that Krueger had a a gunshot wound on his chest. Another man who was with Krueger told officers a minivan pulled up and confronted them. He claims the men grabbed his watch, and that he then threw his wallet and them and ran. He said as he was running he heard gunshots. He was not injured in the attack. 'The look on his face was just like, incredible. He was in so much shock. He was asking us if like, he could trust us, cause he was just scared of anything at that point in time.That was his friend who got shot at so it's, terrifying,' Thomas O'Mara, who helped the victims, told WKYT. Chris Poore, the student adviser for the university's newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel, remembered the young man as funny and talented. 'He was an easy friend,' Poore said. 'He was comfortable with everybody and people felt comfortable with him. He looked you in the eye.' University President Eli Capilouto sent a note to students and staff Friday morning calling the killing 'incomprehensible.' 'Although this tragedy occurred off-campus, it is a stark reminder that all members of our campus community should at all times be vigilant about their safety and the safety of others. We are each other's keeper,' Capilouto wrote. 'It is also in a moment like this that we are reminded of how fragile and previous life is.' His friend Adam Pennavaria wrote on Facebook; 'Terrible, terrible way to wake up this morning. I can't even begin to tell you all what a beaming light Jonathan was to every single person in his life. nothing I could write here can adequately describe how we're all feeling right now. rest in peace, brother.' Two men, one in a red hoodie, who were driving a red minivan are believed to be responsible for killing Krueger (above on left with camera) Chris Poore, the student adviser for the university's newspaper, called Kruger (above) an 'easy friend' Krueger grew up in Toledo, Ohio, Poore said. His family owned a greenhouse that grew poinsettias and other flowers. He was proud of his family's work; he showed off pictures of their flowers and farm. The newspaper staff is grieving for the loss their friend, he said. 'It's a hard day for them,' Poore said.

"Baltimore police who said a 25-year-old they arrested was taken into custody 'without incident' are facing questions about what happened to lead to his death from a severed spine. Freddie Gray died Sunday after he 'had his spine 80 per cent severed at his neck' following his arrest by three bicycle officers for a violation that's been kept 'secret' until today. Official police documents filed Monday said that the man was arrested by Officer Garrett Miller for having a switchblade knife after being stopped because he 'fled unprovoked after noticing police presence'. Gray, who was screaming in pain as he was taken to a police van, then lapsed into a coma and was taken to a University of Maryland trauma center where he struggled to stay alive for seven days before his death. Police still have no answers about exactly what happened that led to the neck injury though Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said, 'Whatever happened happened in the back of the van'. Six officers have been suspended, but investigators say they still don’t know how it happened. Scroll down for video . Freddie Gray died Sunday after he 'had his spine 80 percent severed at his neck' during an arrest in Baltimore last Sunday . Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (right, with Police Commissioner Anthony Batts) said that she is frustrated by the lack of answers given in the police report . Rawlings-Blake, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts and Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez held a press conference on Monday pledging a thorough investigation of the incident. The mayor had vowed in the aftermath of the death to ensure the city held 'the right people accountable' after his early-morning death at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. She expressed frustration on Monday as authorities could not figure out the exact circumstances that led to Gray's neck injury and said that the description of events given in a police report may not have shown probable cause in his arrest. 'When Mr. Gray was put in that van, he could talk, he was upset. And he was taken out of that van, he could not talk and he could not breathe,' Rodriguez said . “We are not in the business of hiding facts.' Six officers were involved in the arrest and transportation of Gray after he was taken into custody. Their races are not known. They have all been suspended from the department, though Batts said that they would be paid, as per state law. The recent disclosure marks the first time authorities have given a reason for Gray's interaction with police. Though his arrest was for the switchblade, officers said that his arrest in a 'hot spot' area of Baltimore known for narcotics was because he was running away after seeing police. In a video of the arrest, it appears the officers dragged Gray to a police van while he screamed out in pain . Gray was placed in restraints in the van and then an ambulance was called to the police station 30 minutes later . Video shows Gray screaming out in pain as he is taken to the van. Spectators thought he had broken legs though police said an autopsy showed he did not . Rodriguez said Monday that the police involved believed that the 27-year-old was committing or had just committed a crime when they chased and subdued him. The switchblade knife was found in his front right pants pocket, according to documents obtained by the Baltimore Sun. The knife was punishable by a year in prison and a $500 fine. A timeline released by police said Gray was taken by a prisoner transport van from the 'crime' scene to the Western District station shortly before 9am. He asked for his asthmatic inhaler while he was being arrested, and requested medical assistance at another unknown point in time, according to Rodriguez. An officer pulled out his Taser for use during the incident, but an autopsy that came back Monday showed no Taser marks. While he was in the van, Gray, who is 5'8'' and 145 pounds, was put in leg restraints after he became 'irate'. Thirty minutes after he was arrested, an ambulance was called to the police station to take Gray to the hospital after he had a 'medical emergency', according to NBC Baltimore. The van made multiple stops, including stopping to pick up another suspect who could hear but not see Gray because of a partition in the vehicle. Gray died on Sunday morning at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center from his spinal injuries . Anyone who witnessed Gray's arrest or has video of the incident is being asked aid in the investigation, which the Baltimore mayor said has frustrated her due to its lack of answers . Gray suffered a broken vertebra and an injured voice box, according to his family. Civilian video showed him being loaded into the van, but did not show the entire encounter. During the video, a woman said: 'That boy's legs look broke.' Attorneys said that he suffered three broken bones, according to CBS Baltimore. However, the autopsy report said that Gray had no physical injuries beyond his spine. It concluded that no force was used, a claim echoed by officers. An attorney retained by Gray's family, William 'Billy' Murphy, spoke out on Sunday and described the circumstances leading up to the young man's death, saying that police chased the man 'without any evidence he had committed a crime'. He added: 'His take-down and arrest without probable cause occurred under a police video camera, which taped everything including the police dragging and throwing Freddie into a police vehicle while he screamed in pain.' Murphy also took issue with the police's previous silence about the issue for Gray's arrest. 'We believe the police are keeping the circumstances of Freddie's death secret until they develop a version of events that will absolve them of all responsibility.' Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said the department would try again to share information with the Grays . The incident comes as relations between police and black communities have taken on new levels of tension following several incidents of alleged police brutality that received national headlines. About 50 people marched from City Hall to police headquarters Monday, carrying signs reading 'Black lives matter"" and 'Jobs, not police killings.' They unfurled a yellow banner reading 'Stop police terror.' Rodriguez tried to differentiate his department from police in a St. Louis, Missouri suburb that were the subject of a federal racial discrimination investigation after the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. 'This is not Ferguson, this is a city where we've worked very hard' to have dialogue with the black community. Gray's family has declined, so far, to interact with police, according to Police Commissioner Anthony Batts. He said the department would try again this week to share information with them. Protests continued Monday as police released the arrest report for Gray that ultimately led to his tragic death . Justice League NYC organized a rally Saturday night at the Western District station where Gray was taken . 'He's gone,' Richard Shipley said after confirming the death of his stepson. 'What else is there to say?' The police, an independent review board and the Baltimore prosecutor's office will investigate the case. Rodriguez said that homicide investigators and the police training academy will be included in the task force that gives a report to the state attorney general's office by Friday, May 1. He said that the investigation is particularly interested in deciding whether police waited too late to call paramedics and whether an officer placed a knee on Gray's back during the arrest. Monday's press conference included CCTV footage of part of the incident, though it does not show the fatal spine injury. Citizens and groups including Justice League of NYC took to the streets to protest following the death of Gray . Peaceful demonstrators walk with their hands on their heads yesterday in protest over the death of Gray . Civilian video showed Gray being loaded in the van, but did not show the entire encounter or how he was hurt . Mayor Rawlings-Blake said that whatever injury occurred to Gray must have happened in the van, where cameras that allowed the driver to see the back of the vehicle do not record the footage. Commissioner Batts, who has been a proponent of body cameras, said that he was looking into changing the cameras so they would record. Mayor Rawlings-Blake said she was 'frustrated' by Gray's death and the lack of immediate answers and said that the police department had been working to 'overcome decades of mistrust'. The mayor added that the information about Gray running in the police report does not necessarily represent probable cause for an arrest and that authorities will 'provide the community with all the answers it deserves'. The commissioners announced immediate changes to arrest policies on Monday, including immediately giving medical attention to suspects who ask for it.","Freddie Gray, 25, died Sunday a week after his arrest in Baltimore .

"A farmer has lost a nine-year legal battle to save the dream home he built without planning permission and hid behind hay bales for four years. Robert Fidler, 66, secretly constructed the mock-Tudor castle complete with battlements and cannons and lived there with his family from 2002. He unveiled it officially in 2006 when he thought he would be able to exploit a legal loophole that prevents enforcement action against a structure if no objections have been made for at least four years. Scroll down for video . Robert Fidler has lost a nine-year legal battle to save the dream home (above) he built in Salfords, Surrey, without planning permission and hid behind hay bales for four years . But the local authority immediately laid siege by refusing to grant retrospective permission. Now, after numerous court appearances costing tens of thousands of pounds, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has finally ruled the four-bedroom home on Green Belt land at Honeycrocks Farm in Salfords, Surrey – worth well in excess of £1million if sold on the open market - must be pulled down within 90 days. Mr Fidler yesterday compared the situation to an artist being made to destroy a piece of work. ‘It would be like Rembrandt being asked to rip up his masterpiece of an oil painting or something for me to demolish it,’ he complained. He added: ‘I don’t think I have any choice, to be honest. What they’re saying now is if I don’t demolish it in 90 days they’ll put me in prison.’ Mr Fidler started as a tenant farmer at Honeycrock Farm in the 1970s and bought the farmyard and ten acres of land in 1985. There was no farmhouse, however, so from 2000 he began building the house around two grain silos at a cost of £50,000. Features include weathered brick and stone, carved wooden pillars and beams and a stained-glass dome above the stairwell. The 66-year-old used dozens of hay bales, blue tarpaulin and tyres to hide the house (above) from 2002 to 2006 . Mr Fidler, pictured (above) outside the house, compared the situation to an artist being made to destroy a piece of work . Mr Fidler and his wife, Linda, went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son Harry, now 14, off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes. ‘We couldn’t have him drawing a big blue haystack – people might have asked questions,’ Mrs Fidler explained previously. Neighbours expressed anger at the brazenness of the plan when the property’s existence was declared. One said: ‘It was a complete shock when the hay came down and this castle was in its place. Everyone else has to abide by planning laws, so why shouldn’t they?’ Reigate and Banstead Borough Council served an enforcement notice requiring it be razed to the ground, claiming the four-year period after which the building would be allowed to stay was void as no one had been able to see it. Mr Fidler, who has five children from a previous marriage, appealed to the Planning Inspectorate which found in favour of the council because the property had not been ‘substantially complete’ for the four years required. Mr Fidler and his wife, Linda (above), went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son Harry, now 14, off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes . The four-bedroom house, complete with chandeliers, would be worth well in excess of £1million if sold on the open market - but it must be pulled down within 90 days . Features include weathered brick and stone, carved wooden pillars and beams, and a stained-glass dome above the stairwell . This was a reference to the bales and tarpaulins that had been used to conceal it, meaning the project had effectively continued after 2002. The farmer then took his case to the High Court in 2009 and to the Court of Appeal the following year, both of which dismissed his challenge. Further delays were caused when he submitted applications for the house to be retained for agricultural use. He claimed it was needed to provide accommodation for a worker in connection with a beef farming business on the site. These were rejected by the Planning Inspectorate last year but another appeal was heard in a Public Inquiry before Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, intervened and dismissed the claim, which raised ‘important or novel issues of development control and/or legal difficulties.’ A council spokesman yesterday said it had a ‘duty’ to uphold planning rules designed to protect the Green Belt. He added: ‘The Secretary of State’s decision demonstrates that people who ignore planning rules for the good of everyone are likely to find themselves in this unfortunate position.’","Robert Fidler has lived in castle in Salfords, Surrey, since 2002 with family .

"Excrement thrown at the statue of British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes has triggered a wave of protests across South Africa against 'racist' historical figures. Memorials to South Africa's colonial past were defaced by mainly young black protesters as statues of British monarchs Queen Victoria and King George V were splashed with paint in the cities of Port Elizabeth and Durban respectively. Vandals poured paint over Scottish-South African missionary Andrew Murray's statue in the Western Cape. War memorials were also defaced. A bronze rider marking the Anglo-Boer War from 1899 to 1902, was toppled from his horse. Object of anger: This statue of Queen Victoria outside the Port Elizabeth city library in South Africa is among a number of memorials to British colonials that have been vandalised during protests against 'racist' figures . A statue of a British soldier lays on the ground after being broken off its base in Port Elizabeth, South Africa . The defaced statue of British mining magnate and politician, Cecil John Rhodes, is lifted by a crane, from its position at the University of Cape Town (left), while (right) a chair marks the spot on the plinth where the decades old bronze statue stood before it was vandalised . In the latest demonstration, vandals smeared paint the figure of a young Mohandas Gandhi. Standing in the square in downtown Johannesburg named for Mahatma Gandhi, the memorial marks the Indian anti-colonial leader's time in South Africa, where he formulated the principle of passive resistance. The protester, who smudged white paint on Gandhi's cloak, accused him of being racist during his time in the country. Founding fathers of Afrikaner nationalism were also targeted. In Pretoria, the memorial of 19th century Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger was twice daubed with bright green paint, while the statue of Marthinus Pretorius, who founded the capital city, was splashed with reddish brown paint, according to local media reports. The statue of Louis Botha, the president of the South African Union in the early 1900s, was smeared with red and blue paint outside parliament in Cape Town on the same day that the Rhodes sculpture was removed from its perch overlooking the University of Cape Town after weeks of student protest. In the Free State province, a statue of Boer General Jan Fick was splashed with red paint in the town named after him in 1883, Ficksburg. Another statue is cleaned down after being splashed with green paint on Pretoria's Church Square . Security guards (left) walk past a statue of former South African statesman and Afrikaner leader Louis Botha, which has been defaced with red paint outside the South African parliament building in Cape Town . Several people have been arrested and local authorities have spent thousands of dollars cleaning up the statues. The opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, has come out in support of its members who have claimed responsibility for these acts of vandalism. It comes days after white solidarity groups held protests over the removal of a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes from the University of Cape Town after it was daubed with excrement. Members of the university council ordered that the bronze sculpture be removed after hearing its presence made black students feel uncomfortable and was seen a symbol of historical white oppression. The defaced statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes is tied by straps to a crane before its removal at the University of Cape Town. It follows weeks of protests at the university over the symbolism of the statue . The monument has been vandalised in recent weeks. It has not yet been decided where it will be moved . The government backed the move, with Sandile Memela, the spokesman for the arts and culture ministry, saying they are working to see if the country can take an 'official position' on statues and other colonial symbols. 'It marks a significant... shift where the country deals with its ugly past in a positive and constructive way', he said to press agency AFP, adding the government did not encourage the violent removal of statues. But the decision to move the monument of Rhodes – a 19th century imperialist who critics say helped pave the way for apartheid – has sparked protests in itself. The youth wing of white Afrikaner solidarity group AfriForum handed a memorandum to parliament in Cape Town to 'demand protection' for their heritage. The same statue was covered in plastic bags after protests by students and staff at the university in March . The university's council heard that black students felt uncomfortable because of the bronze monument . Politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes is called a 'racist' by his opponents. Born in 1853, he made his fortune in diamond mines, and entered into politics as an outspoken supporter of colonialism. He later founded Rhodesia - modern-day Zimbabwe - which was named after him. He believed England was the 'master race', and wanted to draw a 'red line' railway from Cairo to Cape Town for the British Empire - spanning the entire continent of Africa. While his supporters say he brought political and physical infrastructure to South Africa, others say his actions laid the groundwork for apartheid by restricting the rights of black Africans to work. While they are not recognised as supporters of Rhodes, statues of their heroes have been attacked during the university protests. A monument of former president Paul Kruger was splattered with paint, and Afrikaner men, some of them in quasi-military outfits, demonstrated next to it on Wednesday. 'The Afrikaner is -- from a historical perspective -- increasingly being portrayed as criminals and land thieves,' solidary group Afriforum said in a statement. 'If the heritage of the Afrikaner is not important to Government, our youth members will preserve our own heritage.' It has not been decided where the statue of Rhodes will end up, although it will likely be held in a museum. But as tension grow on campuses about the statues of historical South African figures, Jonathan Jansen – the first black vice-chancellor of the University of the Free State – denied that there was a race war coming. He wrote in South African newspaper The Times on Thursday: 'The reason is simple: the overwhelming majority of South Africans, black and white, believe in a middle path somewhere between reconciliation and social justice.'

"Tina Fey was seen out with her husband Jeff Richmond and daughter Penelope Friday morning in New York City. This is the first time the Emmy-award winning writer, producer and actor has been spotted since the tragic suicide of renowned cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Fredric Brandt on April 5 at his home in Miami. Dr. Brandt was said to have been devastated in his final weeks over a caricature of himself on Fey's show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, though that is not the reason friends say he took his life. Scroll down for video . Tina Fey (above) was spotted for the first time since the suicide of Dr. Fredric Brandt on Friday . The writer, actress and producer was on a school run with her youngest daughter Penelope and husband Jeff Richmond (above) Dr Brandt (left) took his own life on April 5 and was said to be devastated over a caricature of him, Dr. Franff (right), on Fey's show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . Richmond the entire incident was 'very sad' a few days after the dermatologist's death . Fey, 44, looked solemn as she and Richmond appeared to be taking their daughter to school. The 30 Rock star has yet to comment on Dr. Brandt's suicide, though her husband did say the entire incident was 'very sad' a few days after the dermatologist's death. The Kimmy Schmidt character that was so upsetting to Dr. Brandt was Dr. Franff, a Upper East Side cosmetic dermatologist with  a grotesquely exaggerated face that was so full of fillers and Botox that the man was unable to speak. The character, played by Martin Short, also had shockingly platinum blond hair, just like Dr. Brandt, and a long list of celebrity and society clients. He first appears in the show's fourth episode, which also features a cameo from Fey's daughter, Penelope. Fey has yet to publicly speak about Dr. Brandt's suicide . The second season of Kimmy Schmidt will start production soon . Penelope (above) appeared in the episode that featured Dr. Franff . Fey has won eight Emmy awards for her work on 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live . Dr. Brandt also had a long list of celebrity and society clients, some of whom gathered in New York City to remember and honor him on Thursday. The invitation-only service, at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall, was hosted by Lisa Marie Falcone, wife of billionaire hedge fund manager Philip Falcone. WWD reports that among those in attendance were Kelly Ripa, Joy Behar, and Linda Wells, editor-in-chief of Allure. 'This is the saddest thing that I never thought I would have to do. When I look out into this room I see so many beautiful faces and I realized that Fred is all around us,' said Ripa as she stood in front of a wave of 3,000 white orchid blooms, Dr. Brandt's favorite flowers. 'He is with all of us now.' Dr. Brandt's other celebrity clients included Madonna and model Stephanie Seymour. Sources said that Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Tina Fey's new show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the son and step-daughter of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy. Franff's platinum blond hair and tight skin have a stark resemblance to that of cosmetic dermatologist Fredric Brandt .","Tina Fey was spotted for the first time since the suicide of Dr. Fredric Brandt on Friday .

"A New York taxi driver has been ordered to pay a lesbian couple $10,000 in damages after he told them to stop kissing in the back of his cab. Mohammed Dahbi discriminated against actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer after ordering them to 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He warned that if they ignored his request during the trip on September 18, 2011, he would throw them out. Outraged: Mohammed Dahbi was accused of discrimination after ordering actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer to stop kissing and 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He was ordered to pay the couple $10,000 in fines . When they got out, Dahbi also called the pair 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away. He claimed during the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings they were 'touching each other all over' and 'kissing heavily' . But according to DNAinfo New York, Judge John Spooner disagreed and ordered him to pay the fine. He also made him attend anti-discrimination training and pay a $5,000 civil penalty to the city. Ms Spitzer told the news website: 'We felt that what happened to us was wrong and he needed to take responsibility for his actions. The trip began at Columbus Circle when Ms Spizter climbed into the yellow cab with her dog and headed to pick Ms Thronton up in Chelsea, before heading to Sunset Park in Brooklyn. However, when they hit the Meatpacking District, Dahbi turned around and barked the orders at them. Verbal abuse: When the pair (pictured) got out, Dahbi also called them 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away . They said he was discriminating against them because they were gay, to which he replied: 'Don't make me out to be an a**hole.' They insist it was just a peck on the lips. Spizter told DNAinfo she knew this because she had just been to the dentist. She said: 'That’s why I’m so aware of what my behavior was in the taxi.' Dahbi's lawyer, Ali Najmi said he had never mentioned anything about the pair's sexuality and has a 'standard of decency'. They are now planning to appeal the decision. In a statement on his firm's website, he said: 'We will be pursuing an appeal of this decision. The Administrative Judge acted unreasonably and made conclusions of fact that cannot be substantiated based on the record. The fine amount is completely unfair given that there was no real injury here.'","Mohammaed Dahbi barked orders at Kassie Thornton and Christy Spitzer .

"Films and TV shows depicting 'beautiful young vampires' have led to a surge of young people dabbling in occult forces, an exorcism expert says. Notable TV shows including True Blood and the Twilight film series - starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson - are said to be encouraging the surge and driving a new generation of what the Church considers demonic 'possessions'. Professor Giuseppe Ferrari, head of the Italian occult watchdog The Group on Research and Socio-Religious Information, made the revelation when speaking to a Vatican-backed exorcism course in Rome. Hollywood films portraying 'beautiful young vampires', such as Robert Pattinson in Twilight, are said to be driving an increase in young people dabbling in the occult . True Blood, featuring Anna Paquin (left) and Joe Manganiello (right), is another TV show which depicts vampires living in modern society . He told those in attendance: 'There are those who try to turn people into vampires and make them drink other people's blood, or encourage them to have special sexual relations to obtain special powers,' The Independent reported. 'These groups are attracted by the so-called beautiful young vampires that we've seen so much of in recent years.' Such incidents are considered a form of demonic possession by the Vatican. Although it continues to celebrate the role exorcisms play within the Church, it maintains strong guidelines on how and when they should be carried out. In 2013, Pope Francis appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair-bound man who said he was possessed by the devil. The Vatican insisted the pope 'didn't intend to perform any exorcism,' and it released a statement that said 'he simply intended to pray for someone who was suffering who was presented to him'. The man later said that Francis had failed to banish the demons from his body. However, after Francis placed his hands on him, he was able to walk again, he claimed. The ancient rite of casting out Satan and his demons from the souls of the possessed has been carried out in the Catholic Church for centuries. In 2013, Pope Francis appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair-bound man who said he was possessed by the devil . But the practice of exorcism saw a revival of interest following the 1973 film The Exorcist and other popular film and literature references. Speaking to Vatican Radio, Dr Valter Cascioli, a psychiatrist and spokesman for the International Association of Exorcists, last year warned of 'an extraordinary increase in demonic activity'. He said that this makes it even more worrying that 'the number of people who are turning to these practices, which are damaging psychologically, spiritually and morally, is constantly growing'. The Association, which brings together Catholic priests and psychiatrists, was founded in 1990 and given formal recognition by the Vatican in June. Dr Cascioli said that too many people today undervalue the temptation to engage in 'ordinary demonic activity', which leaves them unprepared to fight off greater attacks by the devil. In societies marked by 'rushing, superficiality, exaggerated individualism and secularization,' he added, 'the battle against evil and the devil increasingly is becoming an emergency'.","Films and movies are said to be driving a growing interest in occult forces .

"Magistrates at Rotherham Magistrates Court took just 15 minutes to find Ms Gaynor not guilty . A mother-of-two was locked in a police cells for six hours and put on bail for seven months before being put on trial for chopping back tree branches hanging over her garden. Karen Gaynor appeared at Rotherham Magistrates Court accused of causing criminal damage by pruning the tree, after a complaint was made by her next door neighbour Kay Daye, as part of a long-running boundary dispute. But magistrates took just 15 minutes to find the 53-year-old not guilty, saying that she had acted with good intentions. The court heard how council officials had told Ms Gaynor that she could trim the tree near her home in Rotherham but physically refused to show her how much. However, the prosecution then told of how her pruning of the tree 'went way beyond the lawful excuse' and caused 'unnecessary damage'. Adam Walker, prosecuting, said that any trimming of a tree belonging to someone else could be criminal damage and that Ms Gaynor had lawful excuse, which she had exceeded. He said: 'In July 2014, Alan Hepinstall, a council mediator, visited Ms Gaynor's home. 'Mr Hepinstall told Ms Gaynor she could cut overhanging branches back vertically and in line with the boundary but did not show the defendant what he meant. 'There remains one disputed issue of fact and that's the state of the tree before it was pruned.' Neighbour Mrs Daye then told the court that before the tree had been cut last September, it was in a good condition but after she pruned it, 'it was terrible, all chopped back and dead.' However, Helen Shepherd, mitigating, said the conifer had already been dying in the middle which had created a gap but the top of the tree was healthy. Ms Gaynor confirmed to the court that she had a 90-minute meeting with three council officials at her home last July. She said she asked Mr Hepinstall to demonstrate how to cut the branches as she 'didn't want to get in any trouble.' Her daughter, Hayley, also told the court Mr Hepinstall refused to show them because he 'did not have the time.' Ms Gaynor went voluntarily to Main Street police station in Rotherham following the complaint of criminal damage but said she had been reassured she would not be arrested. She added: 'I didn't have a solicitor with me so I feel I was coaxed in. 'I went into the interview and the police read me my rights. I told them I could not understand what 'rights' meant. 'Then the officer slammed his book shut and said: 'Right, I am now going to arrest you'. 'For all the scandal in Rotherham at the moment to think that the police and council have time, money and resources to waste on such a silly thing as a tree is disgusting.' Mr and Mrs Daye have refused to comment on the case. Michael Quinn, a senior district prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, Yorkshire and Humberside, said the incident followed an acrimonious eight-year long neighbour dispute. Karen Gaynor, next to the hedge that she pruned, that ended up with her being locked in a police cell for six hours, put on bail for seven months and being put on trial for criminal damage . Ms Gaynor's neighbour Michael Daye. A complaint was made about the hedge as part of a long-running boundary dispute . He said: 'The allegation was that the damage to the tree went well beyond pruning and that it had been hacked back to little more than a stump. 'A caution was not available as no admissions to the offending were made and so the police took the decision to charge the suspect. 'We respect the decision of the Magistrates' Court and note that it made no criticism of our case.' Under common law, you can cut back a branch from a tree that overhangs or encroaches on your property. The conifer hedge in this case formed the border between the gardens of Karen Gaynor and her next door neighbours. At dispute was whether she had cut back too much of the hedge. The law allows a householder to carry out limited pruning from their own side. However they are not allowed to trespass on their neighbour’s property or alter the height of trees and hedges. The work must be carried out carefully to avoid damage or cause the tree to be unsafe. The prosecution was brought under a charge of criminal damage. This may have been because prosecutors considered the damage caused to the hedge was intentional and related to a neighbour dispute. Rotherham Council's housing and estate services manager Paul Walsh said the matter of the 'boundary hedge' would normally have been discussed between neighbours but the ongoing dispute made this impossible. He said: 'Ms Gaynor was provided with appropriate advice about what she could reasonably and legitimately do. 'Clear and concise instructions were given and the officers did not leave until they were satisfied that those instructions were understood. Ms Gaynor was also advised to act reasonably.'

He said the decision to prosecute was made by the police and CPS. While a South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said the council had provided them with a statement that demonstrated that permission was not granted for the tree to be cut. She added: 'Police received complaints about criminal damage that the complainants felt had been caused intentionally. 'A thorough investigation was conducted that resulted in a woman being charged and brought before the courts.'","Karen Gaynor appeared in court accused of causing criminal damage .

"Sandra Bullock hid in her bedroom closet and sounded panicked and tearful at times as she guided police into her house after spotting an intruder last year, according to a 911 call played in court Thursday. The Oscar-winning actress called police after seeing a man in her home heading for the attic. The roughly 15-minute conversation with a 911 dispatcher is the first piece of evidence a prosecutor presented against Joshua Corbett, who is charged with stalking the actress and breaking into her home in June. 'I'm in my closet. I have a safe door,' Bullock, breathing heavily, is heard telling the dispatcher. 'I'm locked in the closet right now.' Scroll down to hear 911 call . Hiding his head: Joshua Corbett (right) appeared in court today at a preliminary hearing for charges of stalking and breaking into actress Sandra Bullock's house last summer . Panicked: Bullock's distressed 911 call was played in court on Thursday. Pictured above with her son Louis in 2013, who was fortunately not at the home during the incident . Preliminary phase: A judge is currently deciding whether there is enough evidence for Corbett to go on trial. Corbett pictured above at an earlier hearing . Bullock gave the dispatcher a description of the man and said she went out to investigate noises in her home. 'I thought it was a wind blowing,' Bullock said. 'Then I saw the person.' A police officer testified that Corbett was clutching a black notebook with a two-page letter to Bullock and magazine photos of the actress when he was arrested. 'He said, ""I'm sorry. I love you Sandy,""' Los Angeles police Officer Jose Bermudez testified. Security footage showed Corbett outside Bullock's gate each of the three days before his arrest. Los Angeles police Detective Christina Carlozzi read entries from Corbett's notebook and a letter he wrote to Bullock the day before he was arrested at her home. The writings called Bullock his wife, professed his love for her, said he wanted to have sex with her and noted the security measures at her home. 'There is two large impervious gates that no one can open but you,' Carlozzi said, reading from the writings found on Corbett. 'I hope one day you open them to me.' Bullock is not expected to testify during Corbett's preliminary hearing, during which a judge will determine whether there is enough evidence for Corbett to stand trial. Corbett also is charged with having an arsenal of illegal weapons, including assault weapons, tracer ammunition and machine guns, that were found when authorities searched his home. Corbett was not armed when he was arrested at Bullock's residence, police have said. Corbett, 39, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Bullock told police she was not armed and her son was not home at the time. She tried to navigate police through security at her home, which included a gate at her driveway. The actress attempted to open the gate from her cellphone, but it didn't work. 'Now my phone is not working so maybe they know how to override my system,' Bullock told the dispatcher. Bullock gave officers instructions on how to find her bedroom. When officers got there, Bullock, who sounded like she was in tears, thanked the dispatcher. In the call, Bullock says she locked herself in her closet which has a 'safe door'. It's unclear whether Bullock was in a panic room or a room with a reinforced locking door - similar to that of an actual safe. Some celebrities and wealthy persons have so-called panic rooms built into their homes, which they can retreat to for security. These structures can't be broken through from any side and are usually stocked with the necessities to survive for days or weeks at a time. However, a closet with a safe door would likely not have reinforced walls on all sides. While a safe door protects against easy entry to a sealed off room, a panic room's steel structure can keep out fire and has even been built into Tornado alley homes as shelter.

"More than half of voters do not want to see Nicola Sturgeon or the SNP calling the shots in the next British government, a damning poll revealed tonight. Ms Sturgeon today launched her party's manifesto setting out demands for as the price propping up a Labour government, promising the rest of the UK the 'hand of friendship'. But a new ComRes poll for ITV News reveals 54 per cent want her kept out of the next UK government, and 59 per cent want the SNP as a whole to play no part in running the country. Scroll down for video . A new ComRes poll for ITV News reveals 54 per cent want her kept out of the next UK government, and 59 per cent want the SNP as a whole to play no part in running the country . Nicola  Sturgeon today launched her party's manifesto setting out demands for as the price propping up a Labour government, promising the rest of the UK the 'hand of friendship' Polls in Scotland put the SNP on course to make huge gains north of the border, taking dozens of seats from Labour and robbing Ed Miliband of all hopes of securing an overall majority. Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon have ruled out a formal coalition with SNP MPs sitting in Cabinet. But they have left open the possibility of the SNP supporting a Labour government on a vote-by-vote basis, raising the prospect of Mr Miliband being forced to bow to their demands to get any legislation through. The SNP has already suggested that it will be 'entitled to vote against any bit of legislation' and 'any bit of spending' it does not agree with. It means that for Labour to pass new laws or agree to spending in England, Wales or Northern Ireland they would have to strike a deal with the SNP. With the election too close to call, and polls pointing to another hung parliament, ComRes surveyed voters to see which parties they would like to see sharing power with Labour or the Tories. The SNP got the biggest thumbs down, with 59 per cent against them playing a role in the British government and only 19 per cent in favour. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured campaigning in Chester today, warned an SNP-Labour deal would be a 'match made in hell' for the British economy . 36 per cent of voters back the Lib Dems playing a role in the next government, with only 40 per cent against . The manifesto includes demands for extra spending, an end to benefits cuts and the scrapping of Trident . Key election promises in the SNP manifesto include: . Ms Sturgeon has made clear that in the event of a hung parliament she will take charge of talks with Labour. 'I am the leader of the party, I would lead those discussions if we're in that scenario.' she said yesterday. However, just 22 per cent of voters across the UK back the idea with 54 per cent against. It makes the SNP by far the least popular potential coalition partner. Pollsters said older British adults were the most likely to be opposed to SNP influence. An astonishing 71 per cent of those aged 65 and over want to lock Ms Sturgeon out of power, compared to 44 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds. By contrast, 36 per cent of voters back the Lib Dems playing a role in the next government, with only 40 per cent against. Voters are more split on Ukip, with 32 per cent in favour of Nigel Farage entering a power-sharing deal, but 51 per cent opposed. Amid fears of a backlash south of the border, Ms Sturgeon claimed she was offering the 'genuine hand of friendship' to the rest of the UK. She stated: 'The SNP isn't going to Westminster to seek to bring down governments or block budgets. We're going to Westminster to build an alliance for good, positive, progressive, sensible change.' She unveiled her her £140billion  'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. David Cameron warned any deal with the SNP to put Labour in power would force Mr Miliband to negotiate 'day by day, vote by vote, favour by favour'. This would mean 'endless bargaining and backroom deals' to keep Labour in power - even if it hit English voters in the pocket. Mr Cameron said: 'Every single decision taking the form of a ransom note – written by the SNP. 'Make no mistake, if Labour and the SNP get into power, you are going to see an alliance between a party that wants to spend, borrow and tax more…with a party that wants to spend, borrow and tax even more. 'It might be a match made in heaven for them but it is a match made in hell for the British economy.' More than half of people do not want Ukip leader Nigel Farage to play a part in the next government, but Lib Dem Nick Clegg proved the most popular with 36 per cent wanting his party back in power . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today made a fresh pitch to be returned to power in a second coalition. He told ITV's Lorraine: 'I know the Conservatives are playing footsie with Ukip, with this right wing alliance with Ukip, and Labour are playing footsie with the SNP. 'I'm not going to have an alliance, I'm not going to have an arrangement, nor a coalition, with Ukip or the SNP. 'The question is not is Ed Miliband or David Cameron, are one of those two going into Number 10, it's who is going to go in there alongside them. I personally think it is much better to have the Liberal Democrats around the cabinet table than Alex Salmond or Nigel Farage.'","54% want Sturgeon kept out of UK government, 59% oppose the SNP .

"Pensioners aged over 75 will be guaranteed same-day appointments with their GP, as part of Tory plans for a huge cash injection for the NHS. David Cameron will announce the move today as he pledges to commit £8billion to fund the health service. This is the figure named by NHS boss Simon Stevens as the amount needed to help plug a £30billion hole in the health service’s accounts over the next five years. David Cameron will announce the move today as he pledges to commit £8billion to fund the health service . Prime Minister said last night he was ‘utterly committed’ to health service . The move is designed to demolish cynical Labour claims that the Tories would ‘cut the NHS to the bone’ and will mean ‘at least’ an extra £8billion a year for the NHS by 2020. The Prime Minister said last night he was ‘utterly committed’ to the health service. However, the promise that all over-75s will get a guaranteed same-day GP appointment will raise eyebrows among critics who say GPs are already struggling to cope. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last year announced a plan to ‘train and retain’ an extra 5,000 GPs, which Tory sources said last night would allow them to deliver the same-day pledge. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the move as a ‘good start’, but warned that, on current trends, an extra 8,000 GPs would be needed by 2020 just to stand still. Mr Hunt said: ‘The NHS has set out its vision for how we best improve the health service for patients, and today we are backing that plan with the money it needs. But we can only have a strong NHS if we have a strong economy. ‘We need to do much more to ensure our vulnerable elderly can be treated in the community. That is why we are building on our decision to bring back named GPs for the over-75s by ensuring that, as part of this, they are guaranteed a same-day GP service when they need it. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last year announced a plan to ‘train and retain’ an extra 5,000 GPs . ‘This means family doctors can focus on giving elderly people the care they need, and prevent unnecessary trips to hospital.’ The guarantee will build on the new ‘proactive care programme’, which requires GPs to offer a priority service to their most vulnerable 2 per cent of patients. The decision to back the ‘Stevens plan’ is designed to neutralise Labour attacks on the issue. Mr Cameron said the commitment to find the money would be included in next week’s Conservative Party manifesto. Referring to the care given to his late son Ivan, the Prime Minister said: ‘As someone who has been supported by the NHS at the most difficult time in my life, I’m utterly committed to ensuring it is there for everyone when they need it too. ‘That’s why I’m backing the NHS’s own plan with the cash required to ensure it can continue to deliver an amazing service to patients and their families in the future.’ The Tory move will pile pressure on Labour to put its money where its mouth is on the NHS. This week, Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said he could not commit to Mr Stevens’s five-year plan, adding: ‘I’m not in the business of making false promises or giving cheques to the NHS that will bounce a few days after the election.’ Tory sources last night insisted the money could be found through efficiency savings and the proceeds of economic growth. They pointed to official figures showing that NHS spending has increased by £7billion in real terms since 2010, despite the austerity programme. A source said: ‘We have delivered a £7billion increase even when the economy was really struggling from Labour’s recession in the first few years. Now we have got years of economic growth forecast, so it is do-able and we will do it.’","David Cameron set to announce move today to help plug NHS £30bn hole .

"'Screaming in agony': UPS driver Tom Ryan (pictured) lost a leg after getting crushed against his own truck by a car swerving to miss a jaywalker . A UPS driver had one of his legs ripped off after being crushed against his own truck by a car which swerved to avoid a jaywalker. Tom Ryan, 40, was struck by a Toyota while making deliveries on Staten Island, leaving the hanging by a thread. Onlookers used a shirt as a tourniquet in a desperate attempt to stop the bleeding. Witness Moe Sattar, a mechanic at the tyre store on Hylan Boulevard, said: 'Tom was screaming. 'One of his legs was laying next to him under the truck. Then he got quiet when he was bleeding out.' Mr Ryan, a married father-of-two, was taken to Staten Island University before being transferred by air ambulance to the trauma unit at Belleview hospital, FDNY sources told the New York Post. He has lost one leg, but is expected to live, a UPS representative said. The driver of the Toyota, which had North Carolina licence plates, told officers he swerved to avoid a pedestrian, according to law enforcement sources. Mr Sattar backed up this account, adding that the driver was believed to be a teenager. The NYPD said no charges were filed against the driver. He said the jaywalker stopped to rubberneck but left before emergency services reached the scene. According to Mr Ryan's Facebook page, his son, Malachy, believed to be aged eight or nine, was hit by a bus around four years ago while walking home from school. Malachy was a 'bloody mess' and needed a neck brace, but doctors said 'he would be OK', he wrote.

"Adding a gritty edge to Tuesday at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Australia, Phoenix Keating, Alice McCall, Zhivago and Khim Hangall embraced a raw, punk style on the catwalk. Punk fashion took to the runway at Sydney's Carriageworks, with stocking caps, fishnets, tattoos and leather harnesses reigning the catwalk. Khim Hang, 22, displayed a bold collection with brooding models donning stocking caps and attire that could be likened to that of war soldiers. Scroll down for video . Karate Kids: Models go oriental with loose metallic  pants, skorts and tied kimono blazers at Khim Hang . Eighties revival: Fishnets were brought back into fashion in the new Phoenix Keating collection . Tatts are back: Models were seen to have a colourful display of tattoos on show at the Alice McCall show . Spice up your life: Model is seen wearing nineties Spice Girls bun hair style on runway at Phoenix Keating . The collection, which adopted its own  punk-look, showed a strong oriental influence - an obvious nod to his cultural background (his parents are originally from Cambodia). The line featured oriental influenced prints, rigid soldier tailoring as seen in the kimono jackets, waist ties, loose pants and eyebrow raising stocking shoes and caps that could overall look be described as a modern fusion of war soldier meets lay monk. This year also marks a record for Hang who has been said to be the youngest designer to show at MBFWA. Green with envy: Metallic shades of olive green and emerald dominated on the Zhivago runway . Killer geishas: Models mimic geishas in with white asymmetrical dresses and gold shoes at Zhivago . At 22, the Brisbane designer already has over 30 international stockists - despite it only being his third year as a designer. Fashion Bloggers star Margaret Zhang teamed up with the designer to style the runway show. In a striking contrast to Hang's conservative punk adoption, dark eyes, wet hair a sexy  attitude ruled at Phoenix Keating runway. Prom night: Model wears Barbie pink prom inspired dress at Alice McCall but loses a sleeve along the way . Sydney-based designer, Phoenix Keating, who has previously wowed the likes of Lady Gaga, brought a dark, glam punk showcase with fish netted models taking to the runway with bronzed skin, smoky eyes and wet look hair. The collection  featured black satin and emerald crepe fabrics amongst the fishnet overlays and captured the on-trend netting style seen in sport luxe looks, but adding a sophisticated, edge to the smouldering models. Satin show stopper: Black satin was used in conjunction with fishnet fabric to add sexy, edge to Keating show . Oversized office attire: Models wore lose black and white pants and men style shirts in the Khim Hang show . The Alice McCall show also grabbed the audience's attention in a clearly visual punk representation, with colourful, tattoos displayed across the back of a catwalk model. The model wore a open backed top, which clearly highlighted the punk-rock tattoos, a obvious statement rebelling against the fashion norm, in what follows throughout the gritty collection. Contrasting the tattoo laden model, another model mimics a prom Barbie, with innocent blonde locks and a satin pink frock, but is fast made punk with smoky eyes reminiscent of the heroine chic look. Crepe on the catwalk: Models wear crepe, flowing dresses at the  Michael Lo Sordo . Corporate cool: Models wear sophisticated high-neck designs at the Ginger and Smart show . The model  is also seen to lose one of her sleeves mid-catwalk in what's not is a mistake or a obvious tribute to her late night, rolled-out-of a-gutter chic look. The last triumphant punk  look came from Western Australian design duo Zhivago. Zhivago's Lara Kovacevich and Lydia Tsvetnenko swapped rag-doll, wet look hair for bold, black, cut-throat bob-cut wigs, in what can be described as a killer geisha models. All that glitters: Models wear  gold asymmetrical dress (left) and contrasting muted grey (right) at Toni Maticevski . White out: It was all about crisp, textured whites at the Haryono Setiadi show . Wearing leather harnessed stiletto heels, striking black wigs, high-cut asymmetrical dresses and arm cuffs the collection was a strong edition to the modern punk look on display. Models also were seen to have dark eye lined eyes and dominant brushed eyebrows. The remaining designers that presented including Jason Brunsdon, Toni Maticveski, Ginger and Smart,Michael Lo Sordo and One Fell Swoop chose to take a more safe approach, sticking with classic couture - with frills, pastels, draping and long-line gowns.

"Manchester United star Ryan Giggs has apologised to his brother for the eight-year affair he had with his  wife. His apology came nearly four years after bedding her for the last time. Ryan, 41, phoned Rhodri, 38, and the two brothers are now reconciling in an attempt to rebuild their relationship. Celebrity Big Brother star: Natasha Giggs had an eight-year affair with football legend Ryan Giggs . Reconciliation: Rhodri (left) and brother Ryan (right) have ended their four-year feud over the affair . A source told the Sun newspaper that 'Ryan rang Rhodri out of the blue a few weeks ago. Rhodri moved on a long time ago but was adamant Ryan had to make the first move as he was the one who had done wrong.' On Easter Sunday the two brothers were spotted out together with friends at the Neighbourhood bar in Manchester. A clubber said: 'They were sitting in the VIP area and looked like they were enjoying each other's company again.' Happy families: Ryan with wife Stacey Cooke on the red carpet in 2011 before the affair revelations . High Court injunction battle: Ryan Giggs spent £150,000 trying to silence Big Brother star Imogen Thomas from revealing details of their affair . Rhodri with his wife Natasha before he knew about her eight-year affair with his brother Ryan . The affair was first revealed in June 2011 when Rhodri's wife Natasha admitted an eight-year affair with the former star winger. Natasha also said she had aborted Ryan's baby just weeks before she got married to Rhodri in Las Vegas. She decided to go public in 2011 after Ryan Giggs' controversial attempt to place a gagging order on Big Brother star Imogen Thomas after their six-month affair ended. Ryan Giggs' attempt at silencing Imogen Thomas backfired when a Twitter campaign resulted in an MP naming him in parliament . He spent £150,000 getting a High Court injunction against her. However, his attempt to silence her fell apart after a sustained Twitter campaign that resulted in an MP naming him in parliament. In January 2012, Natasha went on to Celebrity Big Brother, where she openly talked about the affair to her fellow housemates. Ryan lives with wife Stacey and their two children in a £4m mansion. He is currently part of Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal’s backroom staff with his side third in the Barclays Premier League. Natasha originally left Rhodri but the two later unsuccessfully tried to reconcile, and they divorced in 2013. Natasha, 32, had a son last year with a new partner. Rhodri is now married to Ashleigh Turner, 24, and they have a baby son. Much happier times: Ryan (left) with his  brother Rhodri (right) as young children before their fallout . Ryan Giggs (left) now works as the Manchester United assistant manager to Louis van Gaal (right) Yesterday he was banned from driving for six months, after being caught driving his Mercedes with no insurance  in Ardwick near Manchester. Manchester Magistrates Court also ordered him to pay £215 in fines and costs. He told the court he would lose his job as a HGV driver for an agency if he lost his licence. 'I’ve been awaiting the outcome of this. It’s been difficult. They only allow certain people to drive for them. I will lose my job if I lost my licence,' he said. 'It’s not exceptional hardship but I would obviously have to find something else.'","Ryan Giggs apologises for his eight-year affair with brother's wife .

"Nicola Sturgeon today faced claims she would 'paralyse' the UK economy with her demand for another referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP leader, who has spent the day campaigning in a nursery in Loanhead, sparked outrage with her suggestion by refusing to rule out a second vote on breaking up the Union. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg warned the entire country would suffer if the SNP chose to 'constantly ask everybody the same question until they get an answer they want'. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon today faced claims she would 'paralyse' the UK economy with her demand for another referendum on Scottish independence . The SNP leader has spent the day campaigning in a nursery in Loanhead, where she set out her 'triple lock' for a second referendum . The First Minister took a shot on the pool table as she played a game against children at the after-school club and community nursery . Ms Sturgeon was booed after saying on a TV debate this week that Scots should be given another say on breaking away from the rest of the UK. In September's referendum, 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the UK, but the SNP has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from Labour in the general election on May 7. Speaking during an election campaign visit to a nursery in Loanhead near Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon set out details of what she called a 'triple lock' that exists on independence. She said: 'Firstly, there would have to be a change of circumstances from the referendum last year for a proposal for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future. 'Secondly, people would then have to vote for that manifesto ... thirdly, people would then have to vote for independence. The point I am making is that this is a decision that lies in the hands of the people.' But the prospect of another referendum has been condemned by rival parties. Ms Sturgeon was booed after saying on a TV debate this week that Scots should be given another say on breaking away from the rest of the UK . Ms Sturgeon said next month's General Election is not a 're-run' of the referendum, but is buoyed by a surge in support for the SNP which suggests she could hold the balance of power after May 7 . Ms Sturgeon later escorted children to a bus, as she continued to set the political pace north of the border . Mr Clegg today warned of the impact on Scotland and the whole of the UK. Campaigning in Cornwall, he said: 'It is of huge significance that despite their protestations that they have got no plans to keep constantly asking everybody the same question until they get an answer they want, actually that is precisely what they intend to do. 'I think that would have a paralysing effect on the Scottish economy and would have a paralysing effect on the UK economy as a whole if we're constantly trying to guess every few years whether the SNP are going to get their way. 'They just don't seem to be able to accept the answer they received at the ballot box. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg warned the entire country would suffer if the SNP chose to 'constantly ask everybody the same question until they get an answer they want' 'There is almost a sort of Maoist tendency which says that the people must be wrong according to the SNP and that they must be forced to ask themselves the question over and over and over again until they give the answer which is satisfactory to Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon.' Mr Clegg went on: 'It is a bit like that Japanese soldier who emerged from the jungle after 30 years and he thought the Second World War was still on. I sometimes think the SNP's a bit like that.' In an STV debate on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon said next month's General Election is not a 're-run' of the referendum, . But she pointedly said 'that's another matter' when asked about her Holyrood manifesto for 2016. Her weak response was met with audible groans from the audience. During the show, the SNP leader insisted: 'I do accept the result of the referendum. There is a triple lock on this. 'Before it is inserted in the manifesto, public opinion has to change, and then people have to vote for the manifesto if it is in it, then people have to vote for independence.' Today Ruth Davidson, Tory leader in Scotland, said: 'The SNP seem to by trying to ride two horses, saying to people, 'It's okay, we're a safe vote, we're not going to push for another referendum', and then saying to their tens of thousands of new members 'don't worry another referendum is just around the corner and we can push for it in one more heave'. 'Nicola Sturgeon is all over the place on whether there is going to be a second referendum. 'She says that there has got to be a material change and then says an opinion poll may be that change. 'I think a lot of people would have been quite disturbed last night to hear Nicola Sturgeon talking about full fiscal autonomy within the next year.'","SNP leader sparked outrage after refusing to rule out another vote .

"With just 28 days to go before polling day, Labour and the Tories remain neck and neck. The latest polls have the two main parties locked on around 35 per cent, pointing to another hung Parliament on May 7. But while voters are saying one thing in public, Britain's bookies are seeing a completely different picture in private – with punters placing a flood of cash on the Tories. Scroll down for video . While voters are saying one thing in public, Britain's bookies are seeing a completely different picture in private – with punters placing a flood of cash on the Tories . Twice as many bets on who will win the most seats have been placed on the Conservatives than Labour, MailOnline can reveal. One bookie alone has taken five bets for more than £10,000 on David Cameron's party to emerge with the most seats – with not a single bet of this size on Ed Miliband's Labour. The betting market echoes polls which have revealed that people expect Mr Cameron to remain Prime Minister – even if they are not planning to vote for the Tories themselves. With the election going down to the wire, bookies have seen a flood of political bets. Gambling industry experts told MailOnline this year's general election to be the first in history with more than £100million placed on its outcome – three times the amount staked in 2010. The bookies Paddy Power said they are expecting the election to be the biggest non sporting market in its history – topping the market on the next Pope after Benedict's retirement and the flood of bets on the royal baby in July 2013. So far it has seen twice as much staked on the general election this year than at the same point last time. The largest bet placed with Paddy Power was a £50,000 punt on a hung Parliament which was made at the end of March with odds of just 1/5. The lucky punter would scoop £10,000 if neither party won a majority. Overall, the betting market is pointing to another hung Parliament but with the Tories as the largest party . The latest polls have the two main parties locked on around 35 per cent, pointing to another hung Parliament on May 7 . 3/1 Ed Miliband to be photographed eating another bacon butty . 16/1 David Cameron to get the average supermarket price of a pint of milk wrong by 10p or more . 10/1 Eric Pickles to be photographed visiting more than five chippies . 20/1 Royal baby to be born on general election day . While most of the bets have been placed on who will be the biggest party, there have also been a host of left-field punts. More than 100 bets have been placed on  Ukip becoming the largest party in the House of Commons – at odds of 100/1. If either party were to pull off the shock feat, the bookies would be forced to pay out more than £100,000. Overall, the betting market is pointing to another hung Parliament but with the Tories as the clear largest party. The betting suggests the Tories will win 285 sears, twelve ahead of Labour on 273 - with the Lib Dems finishing with just 25 MPs, Ukip 4 and the SNP 42. Despite the Lib Dems' struggles, Mr Clegg is still expected to stay on as the party's leader at the end of the year – with 80 per cent of bets on his future backing him to stay in place. The SNP, meanwhile, are being backed to triumph in Scotland – scooping 43 seats – while Ukip are only expected to win in four constituencies. Betting at another bookmaker Coral paints a similar picture. A spokesman for the bookmaker said the bets it had taken suggested that that the Conservatives will win 285 seats, with Labour finishing on 264. Coral is forecasting 45 seats for SNP, 27 for the Liberal Democrats and 7 for UKIP. Coral's Simon Clare said: 'This promises to be the most open, exciting and unpredictable General Election in history but we are putting our necks, and our odds, on the line with this Coral Election Forecast and are confident that it will prove a reliable guide to the outcome on 7th May.' Ladbrokes' forecast meanwhile shows the Conservatives ahead of Labour by just four seats. The map forecasts a total win of 278 for the Tories compared to 274 for Labour, with the SNP on 41 ahead of 30 for the Lib Dems and 3 for UKIP.","EXCLUSIVE: Punters  backing the Tories to finish as largest party .

"Justin Braddock ran from officers in hospital after a deputy sheriff saved his life when he found him unconscious after allegedly taking heroin . A police officer saved the life of a unconscious heroin user, only for the man to flee without a thank you when he was taken to hospital. Patrick O’Melia, 39, a deputy with the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office, was flagged down while he was on patrol near DeLand in Florida and asked to help 34-year-old Justin Braddock. When Mr O'Melia found Braddock unconscious in the front seat of a car he spent seven minutes giving him CPR and eventually revived him. Braddock, who had injected a large amount of the drug that day, was taken to hospital but fled, according to the Daytona Beach News Journal. He was later caught by deputies as he ran away from Florida Hospital. A two-year-old child was also said to have been found in the back of the car and the pair were later charged with neglect. Officials also found pills, other drugs and paraphernalia in the car. Mr O'Melia, who had worked as a deputy in the Sheriff's Office for just nine months, was flagged down for help by Braddock's sister Kelly Boan, 31, near New York Avenue near DeLand at about 4pm on Sunday afternoon. When he got to the car he found 34-year-old Braddock slumped in the front seat, without a pulse. Miss Boan told the deputy that they had just bought some of the drug and her brother had injected a large amount of it himself, it was claimed. It then took Mr O'Melia seven minutes to revive Braddock. Braddock was then able to stand up and get back into the front seat and an ambulance was called. He was taken to hospital by paramedics and as deputies arrived to question him, he was seen running away. Braddock continued to flee, even when officers told him they would use a taser gun. Mr O'Melia was flagged down in New York Avenue in DeLand (left) by Braddock's sister Kelly Boan (right) However his bid for freedom was short lived as he tripped and fell and was captured. Boan and Braddock were charged with possession of heroin, failure to report suspected child abuse, abandonment, neglect and possession/use of narcotics paraphernalia. Braddock is being held without bail and Boan was released on $2,500 bail.","Patrick O'Melia flagged down by Kelly Boan after her brother took heroin .

"Among the green rolling hills in the Larung Gar Valley in China, the last thing you would expect to see in the countryside are thousands of red wooden huts that have been built in a massive cluster. Despite its secluded location it is home to the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, the world's largest Buddhist settlement. A vibrant splash of red, this colourful settlement has sprung up in the 1980s and is now a haven for over 40,000 monks and nuns. Larung Gar Buddhist Academy is home to 40,000 monks and nuns, who travel to the settlement of Sertar to study Tibetan Buddhism . The red and brown houses are nearly identical, with one to three rooms per hut and no heating or toilets installed . The settlement is home to 40,000 nuns and monks, who flock to study, attend lectures and dwell in the mountains . Local children gather after class on one of the banks in the hilly religious institution. Monks and nuns are segregated by a winding road . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study at the remote dwelling. The wooden huts are built so closely together, they look like a red sea spreading up the hilly terrain. Nuns and monks are housed near to their colleges, and separated by age and sex. The segregation of male and female living quarters is marked by a winding road, which weaves through the dense mass of huts. All monks and nuns live close to the college but are housed in different district according the age and sex of students . Prayer forms an important part in the life of the monks who travel from multiple countries to attend lectures and classes in the area . Sky burials are common in the province of Tibet and involve corpses being cut and left for animals to devour. The human bodies are placed on mountaintops in order for the elements or predatory animals, typically vultures, to prey upon it. The majority of Tibetans and many Mongolians adhere to Vajrayana Buddhism, which teaches the transmigration of spirits. They believe after death the body is an empty vessel and there is no need to preserve it. By allowing nature or animals to take command of the body, they are disposing of the remains in the most generous way. In many areas of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave, and, due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical. Conditions are basic, with residents having to share communal toilets, and each unheated hut ranging from one to three rooms in size. An isolated religious haven, Sertar is located around 370 miles from Chengdu, and those wishing to visit have to travel by coach for a gruelling 20 hours. TVs are prohibited at the picturesque retreat, with monks and nuns flocking to benefit from the studies, prayers and lectures ran at the academy. The settlement has grown from a handful of disciples in the 1980s to become one of the largest centres for the study of Tibetan Buddhism . Prayer is undertaken by spinning the decorative prayer wheels which are located around the Buddhist settlement . Monks study after their lessons. Visitors are welcomed into the monastery to learn and witness the classes . Monks pray inside the biggest temple of the town. Inside, children and adults gather on the floor to sing songs . Photographer Wanson Luk journeyed to the secluded location from Chengdu on a 20-hour bumpy coach ride. The 34-year-old Buddhist said the Larung Area has two small guest houses, but as these were occupied, he had to stay near the entrance. He stayed two days at the Buddhist centre, taking part in ceremonies. Luk said that the settlement welcomes everyone, and they maintain their life in the hills from donations and by small businesses like the guest house or small grocery store. Sertar attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia . Tibetan monks, also known as lamas, are pictured at a grocery in the Serthar Buddhist Institute in China . 'I was most surprised about how people feel about death,' Luk said. 'I took part in the sky burial ceremony where there were hundreds or thousands of condors waiting quietly. There were 7 corpses on that day...one of them was a child. 'During the ceremony a monk will pray then the ""sky burial master"" will start cutting the corpses. When he is done, the condors will all fly to the corpses . 'They believe the more the condors eat, the better it is and they will not eat bad people's body.' Nuns travel to school by walking down the steep verges which can peak at nearly three miles high . Snow covers the surrounding hills of the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, where conditions can be bleak in the winter months . The resplendent Buddhist monastery is the focal feature of the academy, with a wall to prevent monks and nuns from mingling . At the peak close to the town, monks tie colourful prayer flags as a practical sign of their religious devotion . One encounter which struck a chord for Luk was the meeting of a nun who was on her 'no speech day'. When the photographer was asking how to get to the top of the hill for night shots she resorted to all forms of gestures to try to assist. She ended up taking him around the whole monastery, showing him how to spin the prayer wheels and teaching him how to pray. Although TVs are prohibited in the monastery, iPhones strangely are permitted, with her typing words to instruct him as they went. At night the view of the Serthar Buddhist Institute is magical, with thousands of little lights illuminating the rolling hills . The settlement is also home to a number of Tibetan people who share the land with the monks and nuns . Prayer stones decorate the colourful Buddhist academy, which is only accessible by a long coach journey . Tibetan nuns, also known as lamas, are pictured on a street in the Serthar Buddhist Institute . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study here . Many of the Buddhists own second-hand  iPhone 4s. The incredible academy was established in 1980 in the uninhabited valley by Jigme Phuntsok, an influential lama of the Nyingma tradition. Despite its remote situation, Larung Gar evolved from a handful of disciples to be the largest Buddhist settlement in the world. It attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, who attend separate classes taught in Mandarin, while larger classes are taught in Tibetan.","The Larung Gar Buddhist Academy in China has basic amenities for the 40,000 monks and nuns who stay there .

"The handwritten notes of Samir al- Khlifawi explains in detail how ISIS were able to take control in Syria by infiltrating villages and using spies . The rapid growth and establishment of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been far from an accidental rise of religious fanaticism, but a calculated move orchestrated by one of Saddam Hussein's closest men. A cache of documents, including the blueprints for an ISIS secret service and instructions on how to infiltrate and take control of local villages have been discovered in Syria, Der Spiegel reveals. The handwritten charts and notes of Samir al-Khlifawi, a former Iraqi Army colonel better known by nom de guerre Haji Bakr, explains in detail how ISIS were able to take control in the area. Earlier this month, MailOnline reported that ISIS militants are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 execution. Haji Bakr is widely considered to have been ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of a rebel group known as the Syrian Martyr's Brigade in January 2014. The new documents detailing the plans to take over Syrian villages and establish the caliphate, seen by the German magazine, were found in Haji Bakr's former home in Tal Rifaat, north of Aleppo in Syria, after his death. The 'blueprints' outline exactly how the group intended to infiltrate villages and cities by recruiting young men as spies and establishing a 'Stasi-like' secret service for internal surveillance. Haji Bakr writes how the group would open a 'Dawah office', an Islamic missionary centre, which would be used as a cover to screen young men for potential suitability. One or two men, in their late teens or early 20s, would then be asked to spy on their village on behalf of what would then become the Islamic State. Militants: Almost all the highly secretive officials overseeing the day-to-day running of the Islamic State (pictured) are former members of Saddam Hussein's Baathist army . Close: Haji Bakr is widely considered to have been ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution  in January last year . One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (left) who led the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. Abu Ayman al-Iraqi (right), a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council . Haji Bakr list specific information the 'spies' would be required to obtain, including; 'lists of the most powerful families, their source of income, size of rebel brigades and their leaders' and potential illegal activities and information which could be used for blackmail in the future. Haji Bakr also outlines that men loyal to ISIS would be selected to marry the daughters of the most influential families, in order to 'ensure penetration of these families without their knowledge,' Der Spiegel writes. Another document charts a command structure for an internal intelligence organisation, outlining who would spy on who 'in case they don't do their jobs well.' One former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. As well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s. Crucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income. Influence: Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of Saddam Hussein (pictured) Past: The process of giving former Iraqi commanders senior roles was started by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi (left) who was a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (right) The former Iraqi Army generals' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income . Middle East analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former Iraqi army commanders have joined ISIS is due to the de-Baathification law brought in L.­ Paul Bremer - the American who served as temporary head of the Iraqi state following the ousting of Hussein. The law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated Iraqi army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions. Many of these highly-trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid-2000s, which was dominated by ISIS who at the time were known by the name Al Qaeda in Iraq. When al-Baghdadi took control of the group in 2010, many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the Sunni tribes who dominate Western Iraq and who have been largely ignored by the country's Shia-led Baghdad government. The process had, however been started by al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi who was himself a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, who used the code name Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, and was in charge of all the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. He had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in Hussein's Republican Guard. Other senior figures include Abu Ali al-Anbari, who currently acts as Baghdadi's deputy leader in Syria and is a former military general in Hussein's Iraqi Army, and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence and now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council. Less prominent militants with an Iraqi Army backgrounds include Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member, Abu Kassem - a former Iraqi officer and now in charge of ISIS suicide bombers and foreign fighters.","German magazine uncover 'blueprints for Islamic State' in Syria .

"When the ultra-rich splash out on a new superyacht, they expect it to come with all the latest accessories. And that's exactly what they get with the 223ft Explorer, which comes with its own helipad, infinity pool and plenty for space for supercar and jetski storage. With space for 12 lucky guests on board, the concept yacht from British yacht designer Tony Castro is the ultimate toy for the extremely wealthy and has been dubbed the 'Range Rover of the seas'. The 223ft Explorer is an exclusive superyacht which comes with its own helipad and car storage as well as space for 12 guests . For those who don't fancy taking a dip in the sea, there is an infinity pool on deck which is two decks deep . For those who would rather board unseen, there is a helipad and helicopter storage as well as space for a submarine . It was designed to withstand any weather conditions and is sturdy enough to circumnavigate the globe - all while looking incredibly stylish, of course. When it comes to transporting all those extras any cruising millionaire needs to hand, there's plenty of space for all of them. The company explains: 'With a large carrying capacity for toys and tenders, she is capable of carrying a helicopter in a climate controlled garage, twin limo tenders, car, submarine, jetskis, paddleboards and a variety of inflatables water toys.' Once the helicopter has landed, it can be store din a climate-controlled garage area . There is storage for jetskis and a submarine on the decks, while leaving plenty of other areas free for passengers . But of course, the life of the ultra-wealthy comes at a cost. According to Tony Castro Design, the superyacht costs approximately 40million euros (around £29million/$43million) to build, which means it is likely to cost even more to purchase. While the yacht has been designed with 'rugged utilitarian-looking aesthetics', it is actually a sumptuous retreat at sea. For the 12 guests, there is space on the yacht for 15 crew, ensuring there is nothing always someone on hand to make sure the journey goes smoohtly. The layout means there are a huge variety of different areas for guests to retreat to, ensuring they don't get fed up with each other while sailing around the world. And for those who can't bear to leave their convertible at home, they can even bring their car on board . Special sundecks open out form the yacht, providing areas for loungers, complete with ladders down into the sea in case guests want to cool off in the water . Unfortunately for most, the superyacht costs 40million euros to build, meaning it will retail for even more . The designers explain: 'Her unique layout holds a full beam enclosed observation deck with opening roof, cinema, beach club, sauna, scuba diving pool, gymnasium, pool, wine cellar and ample space to accommodate a total of 12 guests.' And of course, there are all the other luxurious finishing touches you would expect to find on board. The guests of honour can enjoy accommodation in the Master Cabin or VIP suite, while others can choose between four other double guest cabins. There are also plenty of 'terrace' area, with sunloungers, giving the impression of sitting on the beach as the water laps the sands. In reality, the wooden areas just out into the sea with ladders down so guests can take a dip to cool off whenever they wish. And the entire design is offset with panoramic windows offering views across the ocean. The sleek yacht is a design by Tony Castro, who is base din The Hamble, Hampshire, which is known as a true home of yachting .","The Tony Castro design is estimated to cost 40million euros (£29m/$43m) to build and more to buy .

"A bloodstained document revealing a life-or-death episode that could have derailed the whole US space programme of the 1960s is tipped to sell for £80,000 ($120,000). The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge £80,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity (EVA), before having to come back in, which he said was 'the saddest moment of my life'. But the hatch to get out had proved difficult to open and it was equally difficult to close when White was back inside. It's thought one of them cut their hand or finger on the hatch locking mechanism and their blood ended up on the checklist after they removed their gloves while safely inside. Had the pair not been able to lock the hatch after themselves, they wouldn't have been able to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and would have been lost in space. And had that worse case scenario happened, it could easily have scuppered the Apollo missions that followed including the first of the moon landings four years later in 1969. Edward White, pictured, became the first US astronaut to perform a spacewalk on 3 June 1965. He spent 20 minutes in space, and said coming back in was 'the saddest moment of my life'. As it was the first spacewalk, there were a number of complications. White used a small jet propulsion unit to move around in space . The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. Shown is the first page of the checklist (left) and the Suit Integrity Check (right) for the spacecraft . The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. On the left is part of the checklist used for leaving the spacecraft, and on the right, part of the checks the astronaut leaving had to go through . Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. Pictured is the later Gemini 7 in orbit, as seen from Gemini 6 during a rendezvous mission in December 1965 . Checklists from space missions are said to be highly collectable items because they flew in space and were so vital to the astronauts. The spacewalk checklist for the Gemini 4 mission of 1965 belonged to McDivitt who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago. The document is now being sold at auction to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic mission. Cassandra Hatton, of auctioneers Bonhams which is selling the item, said: 'The Gemini 4 mission was the first time [an American] walked in space and it was a huge step in the development of the space programme. Gemini 4 (pictured) launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board . Shown are astronauts Edward H. White II (left) and James A. McDivitt, command pilot for Gemini 4 . 'We knew we could get into space but until this point we didn't know if we could walk and float around out there. Jim McDivitt and Ed White's achievement is second only to landing on the moon. 'The checklist was vital for making sure things didn't go wrong and they didn't get sucked out into space. 'They had a difficult time in getting back in the capsule afterwards as the hatch got stuck. There was a problem with the latch on the hatch. It was a really scary, life or death moment. 'If they hadn't been able to get the hatch closed they would have died in space. It would have been the first major space programme disaster which could have jettisoned the whole space programme.' The auction takes place on April 24 in New York. The Gemini spacecraft (illustrated) was fairly cramped, leaving the astronauts little room to move around .

"A journalist for a Russian TV station has been severely injured after stepping on a land mine in Ukraine, following a night of heavy fighting between Russian-backed rebels and government forces. Andrei Lunev reportedly walked on a tripwire while reporting on recent fighting in Shyrokyne, a village near Mariupol in East Ukraine, and suffered serious head and lower extremities wounds. Mr Lunev, reportedly from Donetsk, Ukraine, received first aid at the scene by medics and visibly shaken colleagues, before he was taken to hospital. Scroll down for video . A OSCE medic provides first aid Andrei Lunev, a reporter for a Russian television channel, after he stepped on a landmine trip wire in Shirokine near Mariupol while covering the conflict in East Ukraine . Mr Lunev stepped on the landmine while inspecting the ruins of Shyrokyne, which has seen heavy shelling and changed hands repeatedly throughout the conflict, with a small group of journalists. Russian media reported that Mr Lunev was taken to hospital in Novoazovsk near the Russian border, where he later regained consciousness. The incident took place in the wake of several exchanges of fire overnight and in the early hours on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, despite an agreement reached by the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers a day earlier. The yearlong military conflict between Russian-backed rebels and Kiev government forces has claimed more than 6,000 lives and left large parts of Ukraine's once industrial heartland in ruins. Casualty: Mr Lunev, reportedly from Donetsk, Ukraine, received first aid at the scene by medics and his visibly shaken colleagues, before he was taken to a hospital near the Russian border . Run for cover: A group of reporters take cover while medics provide first aid to Mr Luneov, a journalist working for the Russian TV station Zvezda . Aid: Mr Lunev stepped on the landmine while inspecting the ruins of the village of Shyrokyne, which has seen heavy shelling, with a small group of journalists . Fighting in the east had largely subsided following a cease-fire deal signed in February but has rekindled in recent days. Recovering: Reporter Mr Lunev was taken to hospital where he later regained consciousness . Heavy shelling was heard in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, late Monday evening and in the early hours on Tuesday. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told a televised briefing that six troops were killed and 12 wounded in a 24-hour period, while rebels reported one fighter dead and five wounded in the overnight clashes. The death toll is the highest since the February cease-fire was signed. Lysenko also reported civilian casualties, including two teenagers who were wounded in shelling in the Horlivka area, north of Donetsk. Russia and Ukraine agreed in Berlin on Monday to call for the pullback of smaller-caliber weapons from the front lines of the conflict that has claimed more than 6,000 lives. On the ground, however, even the previous agreement that called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of large-caliber weaponry appeared to be shaky. The U.S. State Department supports the steps taken in Berlin, spokeswoman Marie Harf said Tuesday, but she also voiced concern about the ongoing fighting. 'The Russian-backed separatists continue to take aggressive action in Ukraine,' she said. 'And the Russian-backed separatists continue to stall Minsk implementation.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"US authorities have confirmed that the highly toxic pesticide methyl bromide caused a Delaware family to become seriously ill at a U.S. Virgin Islands resort, and that the chemical was used at the resort several times in the past year, officials said Tuesday. The US Environmental Protection Agency said it is contacting people including employees at Sirenusa resort in St. John to determine how many others might have been exposed to the pesticide. It was banned for indoor residential use in 1984. 'Methyl bromide is a potent neurotoxin, so it really affects your central nervous system,' EPA Regional Administrator Judith Enck said in a telephone interview. Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay at the Sirenusa Condominium Resort on the island of St. John . The Esmond family had rented a second-floor condominium at Sirenusa, a resort of 22 villas, late last month. Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay on the  island of St. John. The family were airlifted to separate hospitals in Philadelphia suffering major respiratory trauma. Sean, 16, and Ryan, 14, were  in critical condition. The family attorney James Maron confirmed the two parents are recovering but their two sons are in critical condition. James Maron, the family's lawyer, said the boys were in 'rough shape'. 'The family are all fighters,' he told WPBF News. 'They're fighting for everything right now. I understand it's a long recovery.' The US Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation. Sean, 16, (pictured) and his 14-year-old brother Ryan remain in comas two weeks after being hospitalized . Enck said the pesticide was used March 28 on the condominium's first floor, and agents are trying to determine how much was employed. She said the EPA found that methyl bromide was used at other Sirenusa units in the past year, but declined to say how many, citing the investigation. Sea Glass Vacations LLC, which rents units at Sirenusa, said in a statement it has terminated its contract with Terminix and the townhome under investigation is unoccupied. 'We are sending our thoughts and prayers to the family impacted by this tragic incident,' the company said. 'We remain committed to full cooperation with all local and federal authorities.' Terminix spokesman Pete Tosches said in a statement that the company is conducting its own investigation and is cooperating with authorities. 'We're committed to performing all work we undertake in a way that is safe for our employees, customers and the public,' he said. The family was staying at the $875-a-night  Sirenusa Condominium Resort on St. John in the US Virgin Islands . Enck said the EPA is awaiting results of air and wipe samples taken from the condominium. Maron said Esmond, who is an administrator of the private Tatnall School in Wilmington, is conscious but unable to move. Devine, a dentist, was treated and released from the hospital and is currently in occupational therapy. The Tatnall school, where Sean was a star lacrosse player, posted on their Facebook page that they had the Middle School students write get wall cards for Esmond and his family. 'The entire Tatnall community continues to direct its supportive energy toward the Esmonds and asks that everyone keep the family in their thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.' On Friday  the US Environmental Protection agency said preliminary tests showed there was 'a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying' Tuition at the Tatnall school can range from $20,000 to $25,000 a year. Methyl Bromide, which is odorless, can be fatal or cause serious damage to the central nervous system and respiratory system, according to the EPA. It is acutely toxic, and only permitted to be used outdoors by certified professionals in the US. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa Condominium Resort, said the unit where the family was staying was not treated with a pesticide, but rather the unit immediately below their suite. Maron said when paramedics arrived at the villa Esmond was found unconscious.","Steve Esmond, his wife Theresa Divine and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill while staying  at the Sirenusa Resort in St. John .

"Mary Day (pictured outside court) fraudulently claimed £16,500 of income support and disability allowance and used the money to go on holidays . A benefits cheat who pocketed almost £17,000 of taxpayers' money and spent it on a string of luxury holidays despite having £27,000 in the bank has avoided jail. Mary Day, 60, of Swanage in Dorset, used taxpayers' money to go on luxury holidays to the Indian resort of Goa for up to a month each time. Day fraudulently claimed £16,500 of income support and disability allowance despite having £27,000 of her own savings in the bank. Her savings were £11,000 above the £16,000 threshold for savings while claiming such benefits, which meant she was overpaid benefits for more than four years. Day went on three trips to tourist hotspot Goa in 2009, 2011 and 2014, but failed to tell the authorities. She was caught following an anonymous tip-off to benefits officers. Day has now pleaded guilty to five counts of dishonestly failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of a change in circumstances affecting her ability to claim benefits. District Judge Stephen Nicholls sentenced her to three months in prison, but suspended the sentence for 12 months as she pleaded guilty and had repaid the money. Sentencing Day at Bournemouth Magistrates Court, he said: 'You have been credited with the guilty plea and I have taken into account that you have no previous convictions. 'Clearly this is rather a large sum of money which you have claimed. But you pleaded guilty to all matters and monies have been repaid. 'This does cross the custody threshold and I will impose a sentence of 12 weeks' custody suspended for 12 months.' Day was also ordered to pay £85 towards prosecution costs and a victim surcharge of £80. Tax watchdog The Taxpayers' Alliance said Day's sentence would do little to discourage others from committing benefit fraud. Chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: 'Benefit fraud isn't just stealing from taxpayers, but takes money away from those who really need it. Day went on trips to tourist hotspot Goa in 2009, 2011 and 2014, but did not tell the authorities . 'With finances so tight, we must crack down on those who seek to game the system for their own advantage and minimise the amount of taxpayers' cash swindled by fraudsters. 'Taxpayers will wonder whether punishments like this - or the lack thereof - do enough to discourage others from attempting the same crime.' A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'Benefit payments should go to those who really need them. 'We know it's a small minority of people who commit benefit fraud, but deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime.'

"Rehomed: Nellist's young spaniel cross called Coco . A drunken restaurant owner has been banned from keeping animals after he was caught on CCTV punching, kicking and throwing his dog across the room. David Nellist, 38, of Keswick, Cumbria was foiled after a neighbour heard the young spaniel cross called Coco 'screaming'. Nellist was sentenced to two months in prison, suspended for 18 months, banned from keeping animals for five years, ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work and pay costs of £1,580 at Workington Magistrates Court in Cumbria last week. The court was told the incident took place early on Monday January 19 at the tapas bar Nellist co-owned at the time of the incident in Keswick. RSPCA inspector Martyn Fletcher said: 'A neighbour was awakened in the middle of the night by a noise that she described as ""an animal in extreme pain or distress"".' Scroll down for video . Sentenced: David Nellist, 38, has been banned from keeping animals for five years by magistrates in Cumbria . Caught on camera: Nellist was foiled after a neighbour heard the young spaniel cross called Coco 'screaming' The woman said it sounded like a scream, as if the dog was being tortured. 'She told us the sound continued intermittently, causing her to be so concerned that she actually got up, left her home and followed the noise to the restaurant,' Mr Fletcher said. 'This was 3.30am.' CCTV footage from several cameras inside the restaurant showed Nellist beating the dog. Mr Fletcher said: 'There is no audio recorded on it, but it’s horrible to watch. 'He’s seen pursuing her relentlessly as she moves from room to room, clearly frightened and trying to get away from him. 'He repeatedly punches her, kicks her and on two occasions picks her up by the throat and throws her across the room onto the ground. 'It’s not difficult to imagine what might have happened had it not been for the actions of the neighbour.' Police were called to the restaurant but left after finding no obvious injuries to the animal. The RSPCA was called and after viewing the footage, Coco was seized by police on veterinary advice and placed in RSPCA care. Video contains footage some viewers may find upsetting . CCTV footage from several cameras inside the restaurant showed David Nellist, co-owner at the time, beating Coco the dog . The drunken restaurant boss caught on CCTV punching, kicking and throwing his dog across the room . On examination, the vet found no injuries but prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs based on what she had seen on the footage. In mitigation, the court heard that Nellist was drunk at the time and was appalled by his actions. Coco has since been rehomed. 'I’ve seen her since and she’s like a different dog,' Mr Fletcher added. 'She’s got a fantastic owner who has another dog too, and they’ve become great friends. 'She’s a really cheeky girl.' Nellist admitted causing unnecessary suffering to his pet by subjecting her to unnecessary physical violence.","David Nellist was caught on CCTV attacking his dog Coco in a restaurant .

"A new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video . The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques . Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate . The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have . Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China . The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age. Infants can be seen in the images A and B while a juvenile is labelled C. Adult females are in the image D and adult males are seen on the far right of image E. Adults have few dark hairs on their faces . 'Discovery of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern Tibet and calls for more intensive surveys, studies, and environmental protection in this area.' Dr Fan added that it was possible there could be other species of primate still to be discovered in the area. He said: 'This area has been little studied. 'Although primates have been intensively studied for decades, two new macaque species (Macaca munzala and M. leucogenys) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years. 'As for other species groups that received less attention, We believe there are still some species remain undiscovered. 'It is highly possible that some primate species still remain undiscovered.'

"Whistleblower Chelsea Manning has given in an in-depth interview from behind bars in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, describing the 'painful and awkward' process and conditions of transitioning to a woman from inside a military prison. Born Bradley Manning, the 27-year-old former intelligence analyst was convicted of espionage in July 2013 for sending a trove of classified documents to the WikiLeaks website and was subsequently sentenced to 35 years prison. One month after being found guilty, Manning announced that he had always identified as female and planned to start living as a woman named Chelsea Elizabeth Manning, officially switching names in April 2014. In February this year, after suing the Defense Department, Manning was approved for hormone treatment, allowing the former Army private to make the transition into a woman while serving out her sentence. Speaking: Chelsea Manning, 27, the soldier convicted of leaking a trove of secret documents and sentenced to 35 year prison, has given her first in-depth interview since announcing plans to transition into a woman . Manning, a former army private who enlisted as Bradley, has had her name officially changed to Chelsea and recently received approval to undergo hormone therapy for gender reassignment while in prison . She was also permitted to have some amenities, including makeup and underwear, but is not allowed to grow her hair long, which she sees as a major affliction. Just this month, Manning started Tweeting and interacting with supporters online from prison. There is no internet access, making it a complicated process that involves her dictating messages over the telephone. Now, Manning has done an interview for the May edition ofCosmopolitan, which was conducted through written letters back and forth. Manning said not being able to grow her hair is 'painful and awkward', because she is forced to reject one of the biggest physical transformations her body will go through now she is taking hormones. 'I am torn up,' she told the magazine. Revelations: In the new interview, Manning speaks of a tumultuous childhood, why she enlisted in the military, and realizing she was a woman trapped in a man's body . 'I get through each day OK, but at night, when I'm alone in my room, I finally burn out and crash.' Manning grew up with a dysfunction home life in Oklahoma, and that combined with bullying at school made him retreat into denial. He found solace by sneaking into his older sister's room and trying on her clothes makeup. She had a mirror that allowed you to see yourself under different lighting, which Manning found fascinating. Manning was constantly being called 'girly boy' and 'faggy' at school, however his father would tell him to 'man up' in the face of such comments. This caused Manning to get into a lot of fights at school, she says. After her mother attempted suicide and her marriage to Manning's father brokedown, she moved with her mother to Wales. Of attending high school in overseas, Manning recalled: 'I don't think I ever said ""I'm gay"" or ""I'm trans."" It was more like, ""Is it normal for guys to crossdress a lot?""' Projection: Manning recently started a Twitter account operated using the telephone from prison, and this is her profile photo, which is believed to be an impression of what she will look like as a woman . Former life: Manning,had already secured permission last year to be known under the name 'Chelsea' instead of 'Bradley' Manning returning to Oklahoma after graduating and moved back in with her father, starting an internship as a software programmer and designer. However a falling out with her father lead to a period of homelessness. She lived out of her car in Chicago for a while until moving in with an aunt in Washington D.C. There she attended Montgomery College and worked two sales jobs to pay for her tuition. She was growing more and more to understand her transgender self, and wanted to seek therapy, but could not afford it. On top of studying and working so much, she was falling apart with stress. 'It was all exhausting me to the point I was turning to soda, cigarettes, and the Internet for an escape,' she told Cosmopolitan. Suddenly, enlisting in the military seemed like a good alternative, and her father supported the move. Despite a troubling experience in training, where Manning received school-like bullying and torment, she went  to become an Army intelligence analyst in New York and prepared to deploy to Iraq. There she started a relationship with a student at Brandeis University. 'I fell in love with him,' Manning told the magazine. 'He was not my first relationship, but he was certainly the most serious one. It was the first time Manning spoke to someone about wanting to become a woman. While the relationship fell apart once Manning got to Iraq, his understanding of self only intensified. The experience 'made me absolutely certain of who I am,' Manning said. 'Dealing with reams and reams of emails, memos, and reports of people dying around me every day — to the point it becomes just a statistic to many people — made me realize just how short and precious our lives really are. 'I could've been killed at any moment too. We all can, really. 'So what better day to start being ourselves than today, right? Yeah, it sounds tacky, but it's absolutely true. 'When I went on leave in January 2010, I was comfortable dressing as a woman in public. 'I wouldn't have been able to do that before I deployed to a combat zone.' Prison: Manning is serving out a 35-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth for violating the Espionage Act . Manning refused to be drawn on leaking documents, which occurred a little after this time. The former army intelligence analyst was convicted in August 2013 of espionage and other offenses after admitting to handing over more than 700,000 classified documents, including military intelligence reports and State Department cables, to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. US officials describe Manning's document dump as the biggest leak of classified files in American history. She could be eligible for parole in about seven years, however may have to answer to an army parole for the duration of her 35 year sentence.","Chelsea Manning gave an interview to Cosmopolitan from Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas, serving 35 years for violating the Espionage Act .

"Ed Miliband has overtaken David Cameron as the most popular political leader for the first time. In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day, according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings, a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader’s personal character – after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign ‘into the gutter’. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight’s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror, with less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35, the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage’s Ukip, meanwhile, are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent. The SNP and the Greens are on 4 per cent each. It is the biggest Labour lead in a Survation poll since February and was conducted after the party announced plans to scrap a ‘tax loophole’ used by wealthy ‘non doms’ to lower their tax bills. With less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader . According to tonight’s poll, nearly seven out of ten voters back Mr Miliband’s proposal to scrap the non dom tax status. Four out of 10 voters ‘strongly’ support the move – with just 14 per cent opposed. The poll surveyed 1,111 people on Wednesday and Thursday. Miliband announced on Wednesday that he wanted to scrap tax rules that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce the amount of tax they pay on money earned overseas. The Survation poll found 59 percent of respondents supported the idea. A separate poll, by Yougov for The Sun newspaper on Wednesday, gave Labour a one percentage point lead over the Conservatives.","Miliband overtakes David Cameron as the most popular political leader .

"Labour appeared split on its proposed new 50p top rate of income tax today after shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said it should only be a temporary measure. Mr Umunna, increasingly tipped as a likely successor to Ed Miliband, said he was opposed to 'taxing for the sake of taxing'. His remarks highlighted divisions in Labour's top ranks over the 50p rate, introduced for the last few weeks of Gordon Brown's government as a trap for the Tories. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, increasingly tipped as a likely successor to Ed Miliband, said he was opposed to 'taxing for the sake of taxing . When George Osborne reduced it to 45p, arguing the rate was deterring businesspeople and ‘wealth creators’, Labour railed against what it has ever since called a 'millionaires' tax cut'. In fact, the rate applied to income over £150,000, and Labour has said it will reintroduce it if re-elected. The Scottish National Party has pledged to vote in favour of a 50p top rate if it holds the balance of power after May 7. But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is said to want the new top rate to be temporary, while Mr Miliband is more ideologically wedded to maintaining it. During the Labour leadership race in 2010, Mr Miliband said the 50p rate should stay in place and was 'not just about reducing the deficit, it’s about fairness in our society'. Today, in an interview with with the New Statesman magazine, shadow business secretary Mr Umunna broke ranks to insist that how long to sustain the measure should be a purely economic decision and not a moral one. 'I wouldn’t want to do it permanently because ... I would like to see the tax burden as low as possible,' he said. 'I don’t believe that you tax for the sake of taxing: you tax to fund public services and, currently, to reduce our deficit and our debt. 'I'm very clear: I did not go into politics to tax people. We should be very clear about that as a party.' Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, speaking in Birmingham today, is said to want the new top rate to be temporary, while Mr Miliband is more ideologically wedded to maintaining it . During the Labour leadership race in 2010, Ed Miliband - pictured campaigning in north London today, said the 50p rate should stay in place and was 'not just about reducing the deficit, it’s about fairness in our society' Mr Umunna also argued that Labour needs to make a more positive and confident case for reducing the deficit in order to cope with the Left-wing backlash it would encounter in office. 'I don't think there is anything progressive in spending more on your debt interest repayments every year than you do on housing, than you do on transport,' he said. 'That is where there is an argument from a progressive position to be made for balancing the books. We need to make that argument and we need to make it more confidently. 'Because if we get elected . . . we're going to have to make some really tough decisions. And we need to be clear why we're doing this - we will be attacked from the left, not just by the Green Party but the Socialist Party and others, and we've got to have a confident, not a defensive position.' Asked whether he would like to be Labour leader, Mr Umunna failed to rule it out. 'I always listen to Tessa Jowell, who's like my political mum, who says you've got to keep your feet firmly on the ground and for every person who writes up something like that there'll be another slagging you off,’ said the 36-year-old. 'So I think you've got to keep a sense of perspective and you've got to remember in politics that it isn't about you, it's actually about the ideas, the arguments and the party.' Mr Balls yesterday published an audit of spending and tax commitments in the Conservative Party manifesto which he claims shows the Tories have made £25 billion a year of promises which they have not explained how they will pay for. In a speech in the West Midlands, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor will say that this £25 billion is the equivalent of £1,439 a year for every working household in Britain. 'The Conservative Party manifesto contains billions of pounds of panicky promises with absolutely no idea where the money is coming from,' he said. Chancellor George Osborne has rejected Mr Balls's criticisms of the Tory manifesto as 'absurd'. He has refused to rule out reducing the top tax rate back down to 40p, where it was during Tony Blair's entire period of office.","Mr Umunna said he was opposed to 'taxing for the sake of taxing'

"Forget oysters and Champagne, it seems the go-to food for the best lovers is the humble cheese toastie. According to a new survey of 4,600 people, almost three quarters (73 per cent) of toasted cheese sandwich eaters have sex at least once a month, compared with 63 per cent who steer clear of the comfort food. And as if bedroom prowess isn't enough, fans of grilled cheese are also more charitable and are more likely to travel than those who steer clear of the snack. A survey by social networking and dating site Skout revealed that grilled cheese lovers have more sex . The type of cheese you put in your sandwich could also reveal a lot about you, the survey by US dating site Skout found. If you like the simplicity of American cheese, maybe you’re easy going. But making the  sandwich with gourmet ingredients such as  a 15-year aged cheddar, indicates a more high maintenance personality. In fact, 32 per cent of lovers of grilled cheese have sex at least six times a month. For those who don't like cheese toasties, only 27 per cent have sex with the same frequency. The survey also discovered that 81 per cent of its participants who love grilled cheese - the US version of the snack, in which a cheese sandwich made with bread buttered on the outside, is fried until hot and crisp on the outside and gooey in the middle - say they have donated time, money or food to those in need. And although the sandwich might be the ultimate safe, warming comfort food, those who eat it are adventurous types. It's all in the filling! Turn up the heat in the bedroom by eating more grilled cheese sandwiches . Some 84 per cent of grilled cheese fans love to travel, compared with 78 per cent of those who aren’t keen on the sandwich. The survey also examined the kinds of cheese respondents preferred and whether they made their sandwiches with the crusts on or off. 1. American - 41% . 2. Cheddar - 33% . 3. Mozzarella - 10% . 4. Swiss cheese - 8% . 5. Provolone -6% . 6. Brie - 2% . The most popular filling is American cheese, picked by 41 per cent, followed by cheddar (31 per cent) and, controversially, mozzarella (ten per cent). Continental varieties were at the bottom of the league table with only eight per cent picking Swiss cheese, six per cent opted for provolone and brie was the least popular and only chosen by two per cent. A picky ten per cent of participants say they would remove the crust from their sandwich but almost half (47 per cent) say they like to add extras such as pesto and tomato. But the majority of toasted cheese sandwich lovers are purists, with 53 per cent preferring to make those with only cheese in the filling. The choice of bread is also a point for debate although 51 per cent pick white bread; a third (29 per cent) like wholemeal but only 13 per cent chooses sourdough, even fewer like rye (four per cent) and baguettes come bottom at only three per cent.","Dating website Skout's survey reveals cheese lovers more active in bed .

"Comedian Dave Hughes has refused to apologise for calling radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television. Hughes and Hinch appeared on Monday night's Q&A panel discussing depression and alcohol, following the emergence of a video featuring Prime Minister Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a pub. Audience member Lauren Hayes asked Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb if he thought Mr Abbott's  'display of irresponsible drinking was an act of peer pressure or an attempt to become more popular with younger voters'. Scroll down for video . Australian comedian Dave Hughes (pictured) called radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television . This sparked Hinch to question if binge drinking was as prevalent back when he was younger as it was today. But Hughes interjected and said this culture had existed and people drank to get drunk. To which the radio personality replied: 'I drank because I like the taste of wine.' Without missing a beat, the Australian comedian fired back: 'That's because you're a w**ker.' Hinch (above) and Hughes were on ABC's Q&A on Monday night discussing alcohol and depression . But Hinch would not have any of it, saying: 'It takes one to know one.' Hughes told Kiis 101.1 radio he would not recant his comment about Hinch. 'I absolutely stand by it. In that moment, and I think Derryn would agree... he was a w**ker,' the comedian said on Tuesday morning. And the veteran radio personality did not seem to mind the put down. 'I've been insulted by experts so I can handle it,' Derryn told the Melbourne radio station. 'I thought David Hughes was quite quiet last night. The episode came after a video surfaced of Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a Sydney pub on the weekend . Mr Abbott downed a schooner of beer in about six seconds while patrons cheered and encouraged him . 'Normally I look at him and he belongs to that breed of... comedians who think the louder you tell a joke the funnier it gets. I wasn't offended.' On social media, one Twitter user stood behind the radio broadcaster, saying: 'Boogly-eyed comedian Dave Hughes' high-horse 'w**ker' comment was way out of line; great response.' Another called Hughes out by using the comedian's same insult: 'Dave... is a w**ker.' But others were supportive of Hughes' view. '[Hughes] calling [Hinch] a w**ker... gold!' one supporter said. 'Hughesy is winning [Q&A] because you're a w**ker hinch,' another Twitter user said. Monday night's Q&A also saw a more serious Hughes tell the audience about his battles with alcohol and depression. 'When I was 21, I was drinking heavily and smoking marijuana and having sort of episodes at night, and I said to my mum that I think I've got schizophrenia,' the comedian said. 'We went to the doctor together - she was a beautiful mother - obviously, she helped me out. 'The doctor, we had a chat about it. I told him I smoked marijuana and he told me, made me stop doing that. And I did, stopped smoking marijuana and I stopped drinking. 'When I walked out of that doctor's surgery I felt so much better just at having told people about it.'","Comedian Dave Hughes called Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on Monday's Q&A .

"A gay-friendly bar has shocked regular customers by coming out in favour of UKIP because of its policies on the pub industry. The Harewood Arms in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, has publicly revealed its support for the right-wing party, which is running a 'Save the Pub' campaign in the run up to the election. The pub, which is known for proudly flying the gay pride flag outside its premises, declared its support for Nigel Farage's party over the weekend. Scroll down for video . The Harewood Arms, a gay-friendly pub in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (pictured), has publicly revealed its support for Nigel Farage's UKIP, which is running a 'Save The Pub' campaign in the run up to the election . Announcing the decision to support UKIP, landlord Matt Eason wrote on Facebook: 'We believe in a lot of the policies UKIP stands for regarding the pub industry and would like to let you know we show our support' It has left regular customers stunned and provoked a 'Marmite' reaction of divided opinions. Announcing the decision to vocally-support UKIP, landlord Matt Eason wrote on Facebook: 'We believe in a lot of the policies UKIP stands for regarding the pub industry and would like to let you know we show our support. 'I had a lovely chat with Alan [Hazelhurst, UKIP candidate for Wakefield] this week and we will be organising a few things at the pub to help the campaign and will let you all know more when we know what's happening!' He added that the pub had received a 'Marmite love it or hate it of reception from some people' over the announcement - with gay regulars shocked at the pub's ignorance of the string of homophobic comments made by some UKIP candidates. One customer said: 'Drinking elsewhere now. F*** this UKIP.' While another responded: 'A gay pub that supports UKIP. This pub should be given a miss.' Mr Eason said the Harewood Arms was holding a 'rally style meet and greet evening' with Mr Farage's party. He added: 'Anyone offended by politics or the party in question will know about the event so if they choose not to visit the pub that night they can do just that. The pub said it had received a 'Marmite love it or hate it of reception from some people' over the declaration . Nigel Farage, who has been pictured many times drinking in pubs, wants to amend the smoking ban to enable clubs and pubs to make their own decision as to whether they enforce outside smoking or in a special room . 'We've said many times we won't be ramming our UKIP support in the face of customers you can still come in and have a normal drink in a normal pub, our view isn't to try and brainwash our customers into voting for someone they don't want to.' It is UKIP's 'Save the Pub' campaign which has swayed the Harewood Arms' support towards the right-wing party. The party believes 'not enough is being done to help the ailing pub trade' and claims to make supporting the industry a priority if in power. In its manifesto, UKIP also promises to amend the smoking ban to give pubs and clubs the choice to open properly ventilated smoking rooms which are separated from non-smoking areas. It believes an amended smoking ban will go some way to help reignite trade in pubs across the country. UKIP Wakefield and UKIP LGBT have both praised the pub for the announcement. UKIP's deputy leader Paul Nuttall MEP is spearheading the party's 'Save the Pub' campaign .

In its manifesto, UKIP promises to amend the smoking ban to give pubs and clubs the choice to open properly ventilated smoking rooms which are separated from non-smoking areas. It also states that it opposes minimum pricing of alcohol. The party believes the smoking ban, cheap alcohol in supermarkets and rising business rates are among the reasons why an estimated one in four pubs are closing every day. It believes tackling these issues will go someway in helping revive the great British pub. Several UKIP candidates have already spoken out in favour of supporting the beer industry and leader Nigel Farage is often spotted during photocalls drinking in pubs. Last month, UKIP MEP James Carver slammed the EU Commission for formally requesting the UK to cease its duty exemption for small-scale producers of cider and perry. The exemption concerns producers, whose production does not exceed 70 hectolitres over a period of 12 consecutive months and who make such products for sale. He said: 'This EU move is terrible news for the British cider and perry industry. 'Cider and perry makers would be hit by rising costs as a result of this EU diktat which will leave a sour taste in the mouths of small-scale producers. 'Our Government should stand up to this Commission attack on small businesses and launch a spirited defence of our superb cider and perry industry.'

"A British businessman and his partner were arrested in Hong Kong yesterday after their 15-year-old daughter fell to her death from their £7.5million apartment. Nick Cousins, 57, and Grace Garcia Cousins, 53, were held over alleged 'ill treatment' of their child after it emerged that her birth, and that of her 14-year-old sister, were never registered and they did not attend school. The couple were also being questioned by police over claims that Filipino Mrs Cousins had overstayed her visa. The 15-year-old daughter of Briton Nick Cousins (left) and his partner Grace (right) fell to her death from their multi-million pound flat in Hong Kong . Police said the girl, Blanca Cousins (right) had been unhappy and a police source said she locked herself in a bathroom before falling to her death as her parents tried to unlock the door . Police sources say Blanca (pictured) was watching television in the apartment's master bedroom while her parents watched TV in the living room shortly before the tragedy . A police spokeswoman said a security guard found Blanca lying on the ground at the foot of the apartment block shortly after 1.46am . Tragedy: Blanca fell to her death in an apparent suicide early on Tuesday morning after locking herself in a bathroom of the apartment in Hong Kong's exclusive 3 Repulse Bay Road (pictured) Mr Cousins, originally from Thurrock, Essex, is managing director of the Hong Kong arm of international insurance broking firm Jardine Lloyd Thompson, and has worked for the firm in Asia for more than 20 years. There were claims last night that Mrs Cousins had originally moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines in the 1990s and worked as a domestic helper before becoming the partner of Mr Cousins. It is unclear whether they had married, although she uses his surname. It is believed the couple had been watching television in the family's home on the 21st floor of one of Hong Kong's most luxurious apartment buildings before Blanca's mother found her daughter was locked in a bathroom shortly before 2am. Blanca fell to her death from a window just before dawn. Paramedics declared her dead at the foot of the building in Repulse Bay. Police sources claimed while no suicide note had been found they were aware the girl had been 'unhappy' in recent weeks. The girl's father has been named as Nick Cousins (pictured) the managing director of insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson's Hong Kong office . Blanca – who was known as Blancs – was due to celebrate her 16th birthday in July. She was a member of the Hong Kong Pony Club and was understood to have been educated at a private tuition centre along with her younger sister. School attendance is mandatory in Hong Kong, but a more relaxed approach is taken with expatriate residents and some 'home school' their children without official permission. However, not having their births registered meant the girls would not have been able to get either compulsory identity cards or passports to pass through the territory's strictly controlled borders, which suggests they spent their entire lives in Hong Kong. Last night, one expat who knows Mr Cousins described the family as 'down to earth and decent'. He added: 'He isn't a Hooray Henry at all, like so many of the expats in top jobs in Hong Kong. He's more of an Essex-boy type who worked his way up the corporate ladder and is just very bright and very good at what he does.' Both of the Cousins girls appeared to have a wide circle of friends among the city's well-to-do expatriate community. Carla Cousins – Blanca's younger sister – recently posted pictures on Facebook revealing that her father had a company box at last month's Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament and invited friends to join her at the event. The 21-storey apartment block is one of the city's most prestigious addresses, with four-bedroom apartments selling for £7.5million each while they rent for £8,000 a month. The 21-storey apartment is one of the wealthy city's most prestigious addresses with luxury four-bedroom apartments selling for prices in the region of £7.5million . A police source last night said: 'Initial investigations showed there were no suspicious circumstances and [Blanca] was suspected to have fallen from a height. 'We arrested a 53-year-old Filipino female for overstaying and a 58-year-old British male for aiding and abetting an overstayer. 'Both have also been arrested for suspected ill treatment of the girl. Our investigations indicate the girl was unhappy with her life.' Last night a spokesman for the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group said: 'We can confirm that our colleague Nick Cousins, the managing director of our Hong Kong office, has suffered the loss of his eldest daughter in tragic circumstances. We are giving Nick our full support through this difficult time and he will be on compassionate leave until further notice. 'We are aware that the authorities are investigating a number of matters that have come to light in the wake of this tragic event. As these are private matters, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further. 'Our thoughts are with Nick and his family.' Mrs Cousins was last night still being questioned over allegedly overstaying her original visa while Mr Cousins was released on bail.

"A young mother diagnosed with dementia at only 41 is living in fear that she will forget her teenage daughter as doctors predict her condition will deteriorate in just five years. Kelly Watson, of Gateshead in Tyne and Wear, started having problems three years ago when she began struggling with her words and co-ordination. Despite regular trips to GPs, it was never suggested she might have dementia as she was too young. Most likely she was bipolar or depressed. But after tests and a brain scan, she was hit with the horrifying news of early-onset dementia on her 41st birthday on June 23 last year. Now she is terrified of forgetting her 17-year-old daughter Holly and said the joys of watching her grow up had 'all been stolen from me'. Kelly Watson, 41, (right) said she is scared about forgetting her 17-year-old daughter, Holly (pictured left) Since being diagnosed with dementia on her 41st birthday, Kelly relies on her mother Moira to wash her hair . Kelly said the joys of watching Holly grow up; graduate, marry and have children had been taken from her . Kelly told theSunday People: 'Doctors predict my mind will deteriorate in a matter of years. I will forget I'm a mum, forget my beautiful girl Holly. 'I ­wanted to see her graduate, get married and have kids. It's all been stolen from me.' The mother-of-one now attends a dementia support group five days a week and is the youngest by 20 years. Until 2011, Kelly worked as a clerical officer in the civil service in Longbenton, Tyne and Wear, and lived with her partner and Holly. But she developed uncharacteristic mood swings and started slurring her speech. Her relationship broke down and in February last year she had to quit her job. She could not write and kept losing things such as her purse and keys. Confused and unable to ­afford her house, she and Holly moved in with her mother, Moira, nearby. Kelly said: 'My mum started helping me dress as I struggled. She even had to wash my hair and shave my legs for me.' After brain scans and cognitive tests, the devastating news revealed the dementia diagnosis. Kelly told the Sunday People: 'We were shattered. With so much life ahead of me it seemed so unfair. 'How do you tell your own daughter there will come a time that I may not remember who she is?' After her condition deteriorated, Kelly and Holly moved in with her mother, Moira, nearby . Kelly, who tries to keep her brain active with quizzes, said she felt lucky to have the love of Moira and Holly . Her mother, Moira, was angry they had to 'beg' for a year and a half to get a scan and is now hoping specialists can give the family an exact diagnosis of Kelly's condition. The 62-year-old said: 'At first they just thought she was depressed and anxious, but I knew there was something more wrong. 'I felt it in my gut, believed she was suffering from some type of dementia. 'I begged people for help but they didn't listen, they just kept telling me she was too young to have it.' She added: 'It took years before they even diagnosed dementia. If we hadn't have pushed for scans, they would still be saying she was just depressed.' Now Moira is hoping to send her daughter to a specialist clinic in London to help the family get the precise diagnosis they have been waiting years for. They also have no treatment for Kelly. They are hoping to raise £2,000 to go to a private clinic in London. Friends will be holding a fundraising event in Heworth, in Tyne and Wear, tomorrow. To donate, visit Kelly's Go Fund Me page.

"Technology: A study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job . A generation of older workers are risking redundancy and long-term unemployment because of poor technology skills, it is claimed. Experts said training was ‘heavily geared’ towards young people, meaning many older workers were left behind in the workplace. This left them vulnerable when companies start ‘shedding’ jobs. While older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills, even these could ‘go stale’ with age, a study warned. The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) said research showed that over-55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 – and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s. The AAT said the death of a ‘job for life’ meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer. Instead, older workers could not become complacent and must constantly ‘reskill’ and retrain to boost their job security, it said. In a new report on the value of training for older workers, it said: ‘The old model of training in youth and a ""career for life"" thereafter no longer applies’. A survey by the AAT found that, while people in their twenties, thirties and forties aspired to take a master’s degree in the future or a vocational qualification, this stopped at 55, when most respondents said they were unlikely to undertake a formal qualification. A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification. The majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job, while an astonishing one in 10 have never used a computer. But the AAT said the reality was they may have a ‘lack of knowledge of what modern and technological tools there are available which could assist them carrying out their tasks’. Education: A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification . Mark Farrar, of the AAT, said: ‘Older generations are faced with the greatest barriers when it comes to reskilling. ‘Given rapid economic and technological changes, many traditional jobs are less secure than in the past and older workers are increasingly facing the threat of redundancy. ‘The UK’s ageing population is growing and the increased retirement age means people are working for longer. ‘The challenge is therefore to ensure people can continue to participate in the labour market at the later stage of their working lives.’ According to the Office for National Statistics, workers aged 55 and over are less likely to be unemployed than younger workers. But older unemployed people are more likely to have been out of work for 12 months or longer, suggesting they find it harder to find a new job if they do find themselves out of work. The accountancy body said older men were particularly vulnerable to job losses in the declining mining, agriculture and manufacturing industries, while women were heavily over-represented in the public sector so could face risks from cuts to civil servants.","Experts say older workers are left behind in workplace because of training .

"Kent Sprouse was put to death by lethal injection Thursday night in Texas. Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. He died 22 minutes after being injected and is now the fifth inmate to be executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . In his final statement shortly before he was killed, Sprouse said; 'I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them. 'I would like to apologize to my family for all of the trouble that I have caused them. I would also like to thank my family for all of their support. I guess that’s it.' Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) and customer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said that a recent purchase of pentobarbital meant they had enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.","Kent Sprouse, 42, died of a lethal injection Thursday in Texas .

"A family in far eastern Russia has adopted an orphaned bear cub which was found alone after its mother was likely killed by poachers. The Shcherbakov family has been caring for the cub, which is unable to survive on its own, since it wandered up to their house gate three weeks ago. With scenes reminiscent of the fairy tale Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the family matriarch cooks porridge for the little bear at the family’s home in Tulun, in Russia’s Irkutsk region. The Shcherbakov family adopted the bear cub after it wandered up to the gate at their home in Tulun, Russia . The family matriarch (pictured) feeds the bear porridge and milk from a refashioned beer bottle . She also feeds him milk from a refashioned beer bottle, and she told Reuters that he loves snacking on sweets. The bear, nicknamed Mishutka, may be a cute little cub right now, but he will soon grow to become a massive beast that will pose a danger to the family and become expensive to feed and shelter. The family is hoping to find a new home for the hand-reared bear and has posted adverts on the internet. They hope the publicity will encourage a circus or zoo to take him in. Wildlife experts caution against bringing an orphaned bear cub or any other wild animals into the home . The bear, nicknamed Mishutka, will soon become a massive beast that will pose a danger to the family . The family has placed adverts on the internet and are hoping the publicity will lead to a new home for the bear . While it may seem like a heartwarming tale local hunter and biologist Nikolai Tereshenko said there are few places to relocate a bear in that region, and he told Reuters that people should not adopt wild animals. He said: ‘In a home setting, when he's small, he's safe. But when he grows up, there are a lot of cases in the past, where a grown bear could even kill his caretaker. ‘To kill with one move of his paw and tear up, and do anything. So I wouldn't recommend taming a wild beast, and I have never done it myself, although I have had a lot of chances.’","Shcherbakov family has been caring for the cub after finding it alone .

"Diamond fraudster Anna Foord jetted around the world buying designer shoes and bags using cash she swindled from her victims . A diamond fraudster who jetted around the world buying designer shoes and bags using the cash she swindled from her victims is facing jail. Anna Foord, of Elstree, Hertfordshire, convinced investors to buy low grade gems overvalued by up to 2,000 per cent, a court heard. The 30-year-old even flew to New York to shop in Fifth Avenue's most exclusive boutiques using the money she made. She was part of a gang of fraudsters who lived lavish lifestyles by selling investors coloured diamonds in the £1.5m 'boiler room' scam. But they were arrested and Foord was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering today while other members of the gang admitted similar charges. Foord was clutching a £1,000 Louis Vuitton bag when police arrested her while it was later revealed how she had her collection of expensive Jimmy Choo shoes destroyed in an attempt to conceal the fraud. The court heard how smooth-talking salesmen convinced clients the diamonds were a better investment prospect than gold and would pay handsome returns. But in reality, the diamonds were 'what the miners leave on the floor' and the gang were using their victims as 'cash cows', the court heard. Prosecutor Esther Schutzer-Weissman told how diamond investors lost in excess of £1.5m. 'The caller was persuasive, the caller was persistent and always suggesting to the investor that purchasing coloured diamonds was an investment that would get good and reliable returns,' she said. 'They were told often that diamonds would be scarcer and rarer and therefore more valuable because a mine, or mines, were closing or had closed. 'They were told this was a limited time opportunity and they were told that the investment was guaranteed to provide a good return, depending of course on how long the diamond was kept before selling on. 'Calls would be followed by letters that provided more concrete information about the investment prospect of the stones.' Shopping sprees of £6,135, £1,240 and £1,726 took place at Selfridges and Harrods in London and Bloomingdales in New York, the court heard. One conman, Hider Eshpari, 28, boasted that he lived in a penthouse and drove a top of the range Audi A6 before duping a retiree out of £15,500. The court heard one victim was told an orange yellow diamond's worth would rocket at Chinese New Year when demand for the diamonds increased and he bought it for £14,450. But the gem was in fact worth just £440. Farouq Eshpari (right) was found guilty of money laundering while Safia Eshpari (left) admitted a similar charge . A jury unanimously found Foord guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering . Co-defendant Farouq Eshpari, 55, of Enfield, Middlesex, was also found guilty of money laundering. Farouq's sons, Omar Eshpari, 34, and Hider Eshpari, 28, admitted conspiracy to defraud before the trial while wife Safia Eshpari, 52, admitted money laundering. Omar is already serving a seven year sentence for a £3million land banking fraud which preyed on elderly and vulnerable people. Co-accused Billy Cosma, 23, was unanimously cleared of conspiracy to defraud and defendants Anton Howell, 28, and Rommell Brown, 31, were also cleared of two charges each of conspiracy to defraud. Foord and the Eshpari family, all of Enfield, Middlesex, will return for sentence at Southwark Crown Court in May. Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Claire Bailey of the City of London Police, said: 'Boiler room fraud is a crime that destroys retirements and ruins lives. Farouq's sons, Omar Eshpari (left), 34, and Hider Eshpari (right), 28, admitted conspiracy to defraud before the trial . Shopping sprees of £6,135, £1,240 and £1,726 took place at Selfridges and Harrods (pictured) in London and Bloomingdales in New York, the court heard . 'Victims were led to believe they were investing their savings in diamonds that could only increase in value and would provide them with regular and healthy dividends when in reality they were putting their money and trust in a carefully constructed scam designed to make the fraudsters a fortune. 'The City of London Police are very pleased this complex and extensive investigation has finally resulted in this organised crime gang facing the justice they deserve, something that I hope will provide some solace to their victims. 'We would also advise anyone who is contacted by a cold-caller trying to sell them something to simply hang up the phone and do not engage with this person on any level.' Speaking after the verdicts Rommell Brown, 31, spoke of his relief at clearing his name. 'The right verdict has been passed - the correct people have been found innocent and the correct people have been found guilty. 'I just want to say to the victims as well, I am sorry and I did work for those people in good faith and I am sorry for the losses that have been incurred as well - I truly am,' he said.","Anna Foord sold low grade diamonds at hugely inflated prices, court is told .

"A transgender comedian is the latest real life model to star in a campaign for clothing label ModCloth, in which she models a variety of her favorite feminine styles. Rye Silverman, 32, a Los Angeles-based writer and self-confessed 'gender rebel', has been a fan of ModCloth's designs for years, and often posts pictures of herself wearing the clothing on the company's Style Gallery, an open fashion forum where customers can showcase how they have styled each item to suit their own personal tastes. It was through these images that Rye caught the eye of the label's executives, who were quick to contact her about starring as one of ModCloth's monthly Fashion Truth campaign stars, a group of individuals who help the brand to get across the message that fashion is for everyone, no matter what their size, shape or gender. Fashion star: Comedian Rye Silverman (pictured) is the newest star of ModCloth's Fashion Truth campaign . Dressed to impress: The 32-year-old Los Angeles resident has long-been a fan of the brand's clothing collection, and frequently posts images of herself on the ModCloth open fashion forum . 'Five years ago today, I came out of the closet,' Rye explained on the ModCloth website. 'Today, these are the clothes that came out of my closet. 'I try to have new adventures or do things that scare me. That’s what my cross-country moves [from Ohio to New York to LA] were about, and in a big way, my coming out as transgender. 'I’d started getting real open and honest onstage in my act, and one day I realized I couldn’t really be honest if I was living a lie. So I guess that’s what the most important thing is to me, living an honest, real life and not holding back. 'I waited years for someone to come along and tell me that it was okay to be myself before I finally realized that someone was me. That’s what fashion is all about for me - taking how you feel and using your style as an expression of that.' While speaking to the brand about the campaign, Rye explained how society's attitude toward her has changed since she made the decision to come out as a transgender, noting that many people feel that they are entitled to question her motives for doing so. Breaking out: Rye, who came out as a transgender when she was 27, says that 'living an honest life' is the most important thing to her . Personal style: One of Rye's favorite items from the ModCloth range is the Mewseum Visit Dress (L), but she admits she enjoys experimenting with her style . 'I think the downright most rude thing is when people flat out just ask me about my plans for transitioning, usually some variation on if I intend to have surgery or not, which is an extremely personal question if you break it down. It’s basically “So what’s up with your junk?”' she explained. 'It’s also an issue because it puts an emphasis on specific treatments as being indicative of if someone is or isn’t ""really"" trans. That can be a really dangerous attitude to run into for someone who’s just coming to terms with themselves or on the cusp of coming out.' When it comes to her sense of style, Rye admits that she loves experimenting with different ensembles and trends. '[My sense of style] evolves over time but I think right now my best way of describing it is a bit of a quirky or edgy twist on vintage,' she explained.  'I love rockabilly-type stuff or circle skirts that have interesting prints on them. 'The two garments I currently get the most positive responses to are my Mewseum Visit Dress from ModCloth and my PacMan-themed circle skirt. I’ve noticed in the last year or so more and more of my skirts and dresses have fun prints. But when I’m kind of just looking for a more relaxed, chill look I shift into a more 90s vibe.' Polka dot: Rye was chosen to feature in the campaign by ModCloth's co-creator Susan Koger . Call for change: ModCloth's Fashion Truth campaign hopes to prove that fashion is accessible to everyone, no matter their shape, size, gender or style . In honor of her starring role in the campaign, and her ongoing love of fashion, ModCloth has actually named a dress from its range after Rye, the aptly-named All About Rye Dress. ModCloth's Fashion Truth campaign was first launched back in September, pledging at the time that the company would endeavor to feature diverse, real life models, and offer a variety of clothing sizes and styles. Earlier this year, the brand used a group of its own employees as models for its most recent swimwear campaign, with the aim of proving that its styles were fit for real people of all shapes and sizes. 'The real hope around this is that we are putting the idea in everyone's heads that every size and shape and body, every single person - every woman - is just beautiful,' ModCloth employee-turned-model Christen DiClaudio said of the campaign at the time. 'And as long as she is trying to be the best version of herself, which we say a lot here at ModCloth, that's perfect. We hope that this is eventually the regular mindset in our society: that the best version of yourself is the best version there is.'","Rye Silverman, from Los Angeles, was chosen as one of the brand's monthly Fashion Truth campaign stars .

"A mother-of-four calls herself the 'real life vampire' as she has a rare medical condition that makes her allergic to the sun. Lorraine Valentine suffers from the rare disease erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight or UV light. A holiday abroad left the 42-year-old in hospital for six days, as the heat caused her entire body to swell. Her sun allergy means she has to keep herself completely covered, as even a small dose of sun on her skin leaves her in pain. In summer, everyday tasks like picking her children up from school or going to buy some milk become extremely difficult. Lorraine Valentine, 42, calls herself the 'real life vampire' as she has a rare medical condition meaning she is allergic to the sun . Miss Valentine suffers from erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight . Now, as temperatures in the UK are set to soar, she is desperate for a drug that can help her. Miss Valentine, of Bournemouth, said: 'It's always worst when the sun first comes out because I have no time to adjust. 'I have to pull the curtains closed and have to have a fan on, as any heat is painful.' She was first diagnosed with EPP, a rare blood condition which attacks the liver, when she was nine. The condition – which is incurable - is caused by a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and it can also cause the tissues to swell up. For Miss Valentine, even tasks like going to the supermarket are painful, as UV light reflects up from the floor, burning her skin. EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As . blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy . from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly . damage surrounding tissues. The . nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, . and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing . swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation . 'From March to November I completely cover up when I'm going to pick up the kids,' she said. 'When it's boiling hot and I'm wearing boots, jeans, a big cardigan, scarf and hat, I do get funny looks off the parents. 'They think I'm a bit strange. 'I try and do normal things and not let it affect me.' Her children. Chloe, 18, Elisha 14, Ben, 12 and Josh, 10, are understanding, but the family lives very close to the beach and so Miss Valentine feels guilty she cannot join them when the weather is good. She said: 'It was difficult for them growing up. 'When I was crying because I was in so much pain, they couldn't even hold my hand. 'The slightest touch puts me in agony.' 'They're understanding, but the beach is just ten minutes away. I should be on the beach with the kids, but I can't. 'I'm just trying not to get sunned on. 'Even driving somewhere, my arm is in pain from the sun coming through the window. 'I don't know what I'll do when it gets even hotter.' In June last year, Miss Valentine decided to take her children on a summer holiday to Lanzarote, as she didn't want them to miss out on this right of passage. She bought special UV protection socks to block out sunlight, and booked an expensive apartment right near the pool. She hoped this would mean she could stay indoors if she needed, but could watch her children enjoy swimming. She found the only way she could enjoy the holiday was to stay indoors, emerging at night to go to the beach and explore the town in the dark. 'We went in June because I thought it would be less hot, but how wrong I was,' she said. Last June, Miss Valentine went on a holiday to Lanzarote but was hospitalised for six days afterwards, as the sun irritated her skin. She must wait until the sun sets before going to the beach near her home (pictured) Miss Valentine, pictured on holiday with her 10-year-old son Josh, said her children are 'understanding' but when she is crying in pain they are unable to hold her hand, as any touch puts her in agony . 'Even though I stayed in the shade, I ended up being covered up and in pain wherever I went. 'I had to borrow a fan to sleep and spent most of the evenings in the toilets of the entertainment area putting cold water on my burning feet. 'The kids would give me the ice from their drinks to put on my feet.' When they flew back a week later, her ordeal wasn't over. She said: 'On the plane I cried, trying to sit there for four hours with the pain of the burns. I was in agony. 'I had the air hostesses get me ice in the end. I was in such pain, I was crying and so upset. 'I went through security and left the kids while I raced to get some cold water and some paper towels to try and ease the pain. Miss Valentine, pictured (left to right) with daughter Chloe, 18, Ben, 12, Josh, 10 and Elisha, 14, is now fundraising for other sufferers of the disease . Five hours later, when the family landed in the UK, Miss Valentine was admitted to hospital. She was kept in for six days as her liver wasn't functioning properly; the condition can cause liver damage in severe cases. Now, she is running the London Marathon for British Porphyria Association to help raise funds for other sufferers of the disease. She is hoping an experimental drug called Scenesse will bring hope for her and other sufferers. The drug acts as an anti-oxidant and activates melanin in skin, providing a barrier between the skin and wavelengths of light that trigger the burning and itching. 'I'll battle for this,' she said. 'I've suffered for so long and been through so much. There needs to be treatment available.'","Lorraine Valentine, 42, suffers from erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP)

"Easter is here! And whilst many Australians are enjoying an abundance of sugary treats, many are wondering how much it's going to cost them around the waistline. According to the ABC, the key is to maintain an even balance of 'energy in' and 'energy out.' This means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight. A small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off . Indulging in two hot cross buns (without jam and butter) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work off . It may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of Easter treats. For four solid mini chocolate Easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules. A female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes, whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes. One medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off. The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' and balancing food and fitness . Experts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterward . Two hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam, it would take 80 minutes of running. Exercise physiologist Alex Lawrence from Exercise Sport Science Australia has said that many Australians still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume. 'It's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption, than to try and work off the energy after you've taken it in,' he said. Lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat. He advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then. 'What we're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time. That way when holidays, like Easter, come around they don't have to feel like they have to deny themselves,' he said.","The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out'

"Former American President Ronald Reagan asked Mikhail Gorbachev for help from Russia to 'fight the alien invader'. The president and former actor went off-script during a peace summit in Geneva in the 1980s to ask the Soviet leader for his support in the event of an invasion from extra terrestrial life. Reagan repeated the warning when he spoke to a group of students, and his subsequent speeches were examined by his advisers to remove any mention of aliens in them. Ronald Reagan (right) met Mikhail Gorbachev (left) for the first time at a peace summit in Geneva, Switzerland in 1985  and asked for his support in the event of an alien invasion . The warning was revealed in a book about UFOs by Dr David Clarke, which examines the extent to which Americans believed in stories about aliens. He suggests his words may show that Reagan, who was inspired by science fiction movies, saw there could have been a threat from aliens. The President is believed to have become an avid science fiction fan while working in Hollywood as a B movie actor and was said to be addicted to films like The Day the Earth Stood Still and Close Encounters. He confessed his favourite story was 'the invasion from outer space that prompts earthlings to put aside nationalistic quarrels and band together to fight the alien invader'. Reagan even arranged a private screening of Stephen Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind at the Whitehouse in 1982 for top judges, astronauts and other VIPs. In 1985 he went a step further and directly addressed Gorbachev at a summit to ask for his support in the event aliens were to invade. Ronald Reagan asked Mikhail Gorbachev for support fighting a future alien invasion at a peace summit . 'He surprised Gorby by saying he was sure the two superpowers would co-operate if Earth was threatened by alien invasion,' Dr Clarke said. 'Taken aback, the Soviet leader politely changed the subject.' Reagan apparently then told his inner circle he felt he had 'scored a point' over his counterpart. Deputy national security adviser Colin Powell was said to be horrified by the mention of aliens at the meeting. He then found Reagan repeated the story to a group of Maryland high school students after his return to the US in 1985. Powell's solution was to go through the President's public speeches deleting 'interplanetary references' right until Reagan's final months in office. Dr Clarke said that at any mention of an alien invasion Powell would roll his eyes and say 'Here come the Little Green Men again.' The book suggests Reagan was secretly appalled by nuclear weapons and his approach to Gorbachev may have been inspired by the 1951 movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still. In the film, an interplanetary peace-keeping force lands on earth using an invincible giant robot to force the warring nuclear powers to put aside their differences. Dr Clarke said: 'For a generation that lived in fear of the bomb, this message of salvation from the stars, delivered by technological angels, was a welcome alternative to the Cold War stalemate. 'Ronald Reagan was a born-again Christian and saw no contradiction between his faith and a belief in aliens.' Mikhail Gorbachev, pictured in Germany in November 2014, was said to be shocked by Reagan's request . Dr David Clarke, who wrote How UFOs Conquered The World, said Reagan appeared to believe in aliens . Dr Clarke said the President may also have been convinced he was speaking for the American public because of a poll released, shortly after Close Encounters hit film screens. According to a Gallup poll, 57 per cent of Americans believed that UFOs were real, compared to 27 per cent of the British population. Seven per cent claimed to have actually seen one. Dr Clarke added: 'Ronald Reagan is remembered for his warnings about the danger posed by the ""evil empire"" by which he meant the Soviet Union. The former US President was said to be obsessed with science fiction films like Close Encounters . 'But he was also obsessed with science fiction movies - in particular The Day the Earth Stood Still - and his comments to Gorbachev at the 1985 summit in Geneva imply that he might have believed the real threat came not from behind the Iron Curtain but from hostile extra-terrestrials. 'He wasn't the first world leader to suggest that the nations of the Earth would only unite in the face of a common foe from outer space. 'In 1947, just a couple of months before the Roswell incident, the British foreign secretary Anthony Eden - who was to become Prime Minister in 1955 - said he feared the world would only be united when we ""find someone in Mars to get mad against.""' Dr Clarke's book, How UFOs Conquered The World, is due to be released next month.","Ronald Reagan asked Mikhail Gorbachev for help with aliens at summit .

"Michael Schumacher's daughter Gina Maria has revealed her impressive  riding skills at a horse show in Germany. The 17-year-old was one of the participants in the NRHA European Futurity Horse Show in the Bavarian town of Kreuth and looked every inch the professional rider throughout the tournament. Dressed in a variety of elaborately decorated cowboy-style outfits and wearing a brown stetson hat, Miss Schumacher was seen riding a number of different horses as she took part in what is known as the 'First Go-Round 2nd Section' yesterday afternoon. The NRHA European Futurity Horse Show continues until Saturday evening, when Miss Schumacher is expected to take part in the grand final of the tournament providing she isn't knocked out of the competition over the course of the week.

Miss Schumacher's impressive performance at the horse show comes just days after her 16-year-old brother Mick returned to the racing circuit just weeks after he was involved in a 100mph crash - and once again ended up going off the track. He made his pre-season test debut in Formula 4 at the Oschersleben circuit in Germany - but at one point was pictured accidentally driving through gravel. Mick, whose father Michael won the Formula 1 championship seven times, reached the new category after seven years of karting in what is seen as a stepping stone for junior drivers hoping to reach the top. Michael Schumacher, 46, remains under the care of medics at his home on Lake Geneva following his catastrophic ski accident in the Swiss Alps in 2013.

Trotting along: Miss Schumacher's put in an impressive performance at the horse show yesterday afternoon . Gina Maria Schumacher and boyfriend Riccardo are pictured at the NRHA European Futurity Horse Show . Michael Schumacher spent months in a coma following the accident before being transferred to a rehab clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland. He was then moved to a medical suite built into his mansion last September. Since being transferred to the medical suite built into his home, a news blackout has fallen over his condition, but insiders report he remains mute and unable to move. In February, it was revealed that Schumacher had sold his Norwegian mountain holiday home for £2million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries. The sale of the retreat, in Trysil, north of Oslo, comes after it emerged last year that his family was planning to build a £10million 'hospital' room for the star at their home in Switzerland. Road to recovery: Michael Schumacher (pictured with wife Corinna in 2004) was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France when the catastrophic accident happened in December 2013 . Liquidating his assets: Michael Schumacher's family has sold his Norwegian mountain holiday home (pictured) for £2million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries . Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened in December 2013. He was skiing with then 14-year-old Mick on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am, he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. Laughing: Gina Maria Schumacher's impressive performance at the horse shows comes after her 16-year-old brother Mick (left and right) returned to the racing circuit just weeks after being involved in a 100mph crash . Back in action: The protege was back on the circuit just weeks after a 100mph crash at the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany . The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident. Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry, Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out. He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. Since September last year he has been looked after by medical experts at his home in Gland, Switzerland.","Gina Maria Schumacher took part in an event in the German town of Kreuth .

"With just over a week to go until the Duchess of Cambridge hits her due date, preparations for the new arrival at her Norfolk home, dubbed 'Fortress Anmer', have been heating up. Carole Middleton, the new arrival's grandmother, has become a permanent fixture at the country home, while in the nursery, nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo is preparing to welcome a second charge. But while much of the effort has focused on Prince George and making sure he doesn't feel left out, more still has gone in to giving the nursery a makeover. Scroll down for video . Preparation: The birth of Prince George's new brother or sister is expected to happen later this week . Overseen by Mrs Middleton, both the Anmer nursery and the one at Kensington Palace, have been given a Beatrix Potter theme. Fittings for both are thought have come from luxury children's furniture emporium, Dragons of Knightsbridge, where Moses baskets start at £75. But in a curious twist, it is understood that Kate had several pots of pink paint delivered to Anmer Hall from the Annie Sloane store a couple of weeks ago. In a move certain to invite further speculation over the sex of the baby, among colours chosen was Henrietta, which is described as a 'beautiful rich complex pink with a hint of lilac.' Another was Antoinette, a 'soft pale pink with a hint of brown' that is redolent of 'old-fashioned roses and the colour of old plaster' and the third, Emile, a 'warm soft aubergine colour with pink and red undertones'. Home: The new baby will spend its first few weeks at his or her parents' Norfolk home, Anmer Hall . London pad: The new arrival will also have the run of a second nursery at Kensington Palace . Each pot comes with a price tag fit for a royal, with just one litre of the paint costing £18.95. Kensington Palace refused to comment on the story saying that they could neither 'confirm' nor 'deny' that the couple had plans to paint the nursery. Echoing the palace's line, a spokesman for Annie Sloan said the company could not ‘confirm or deny’ that it had supplied paints to Anmer Hall. Nonetheless, a pink nursery appears more likely than the African-themed one hinted at by Prince William in an interview with CNN. 'I'll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room,' he joked. 'We'll cover it in lots of bushes and things like that, make him grow up as if he's in the bush.' Boy or girl? Kate's pink coat and pink paints have fuelled speculation over the new baby's sex . Compelling: Annie Sloan has  supplied three feminine paint samples to Anmer Hall . Whatever the nursery's eventual colour, more work still has gone in to turning Anmer Hall into a secluded property where Prince George - and his new sibling - can enjoy a relatively normal childhood. The refurbishment, which has taken two years and cost £1.5 million, has seen new security features added to the ten bedroom property which also has a swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds. As part of the costly renovations – which also included installing a new roof, a state-of-the-art kitchen and a conservatory – William had the driveway to the property, which used to belong to his close friends the Van Cutsem family, rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees. More money has been spent on filling the royal nursery and with both William and Kate known to have traditional tastes, it's safe to say that that extends to the toy box. Prince George has been cutting his teeth on old-fashioned wooden toys, while his reading material includes the Curious George books - the first of which was published in the 1950s. Toys for the new baby will be no exception and are likely to have a homespun wholesome feel much like this £34 Anne-Claire Petit Crochet Lamb Music Box. Prepared: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also have plenty of pieces left over from Prince George . Traditional: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have traditional tastes and prefer old-fashioned toys . One for George: The couple were presented with a Dorothy and Theodore box when George was born . Tally ho! Both royal children are likely to start riding as soon as they are big enough, much like the Queen . Kate, who has made no secret of her liking for traditional fittings such as Moses baskets, is also likely to follow suit when it comes to toy boxes. Indeed, the couple already own one, having been gifted a £360 Dorothy and Theodore toy box by 10 Downing Street following Prince George's birth. Another Dorothy and Theodore piece likely to feature in the royal nursery is the company's £550 rosewood rocking horse. William is a keen horseman and both Prince George and the new baby will have no shortage of steeds to choose from when they get a bit bigger. Indeed, the royal baby's great-grandmother, the Queen, has been riding since the age of four when she was presented with a Shetland pony named Peggy.","The Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth on the 25th April .

"A delivery driver was questioned under anti-terror laws after taking pictures of police vehicles parked at a bus stop. Kieron Power’s wife had previously been given a £110 ticket for stopping in the same place for 45 seconds behind a police car and van. A week after she received the ticket given out by a council CCTV ‘spy car’, he went back to gather evidence of police cars parked at the stop in Kingston upon Thames, South-West London. Delivery driver Kieron Power was pulled over and questioned under anti-terror laws after taking these pictures of police vehicles parked in a bus stop . Mr Power, 54, from Esher, Surrey, was on his way home after taking the photographs when a police car came up behind him with its blue lights flashing. He said: ‘I didn’t think much, because I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but then all of a sudden another police car appeared in front of me in a pincer movement and I was forced to stop. ‘They told me they were stopping me under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. They said I’d been seen taking pictures of police cars, which I admitted. 'I told them why, but they still demanded my pictures be deleted. I refused, because I had done nothing wrong, and the officer spoke to his commander. Eventually I was allowed on my way – it seemed so heavy-handed. Mr Power, 54, was stopped in a pincer manoeuvre by a pair of police cars after he took photographs of two vehicles parked up in a bus stand - because his wife was given a £110 ticket for doing the same thing . ‘I was annoyed that my wife had been given a ticket for briefly stopping somewhere the police always park, but I never dreamed I would be accused of being a terrorist.’ Mr Power’s wife has paid the ticket for parking behind the Bittoms centre in Kingston after an appeal on the grounds that police were blocking the ‘bus stand’ markings failed. A Kingston police spokesman said: ‘The man was initially requested to delete the photos, however after the officer clarified the Metropolitan Police Service’s approach towards photography of police officers and vehicles with his supervisors, he realised the man was allowed to keep them. ‘The police vehicles parked on the bus stand are part of the Met’s Safer Transport Command and have been given permission by the local authority to park there.’ Mr Power said: ‘I appreciate that police cars need to stop wherever they can for operational matters, but these vehicles are always there. It’s one rule for them and one rule for us, I suppose.’","Kieron Power took photographs of police vehicles parked in a bus stand .

"A lost photograph showing a woman killed by the tornado that leveled an Illinois village last week was found 35 miles away after being carried there by the storm. The image - showing Geraldine Schultz, 67, was blown from the home where she died in Fairdale, Illinois, to the town of Harvard, 35 miles away. It showed her alongside her husband Clem Schultz, 84, and was taken around 1980 to feature in a church directory. Lost and found: A 1980 photograph, left, showing Geraldine Schultz with her husband Clem, was returned to the family after being found 35 miles away. Mrs Schultz, pictured right more recently, died aged 67 when a tornado struck her home in Fairdale, Illinois, last week . Storm: A tornado obliterated the Schultz family home, and caused a collapse which killed Geraldine Schultz and also injured her husband, Clem . Going the distance: . Harvard resident Alyssa Murray found the photograph in the wake of the powerful storm, which also killed another Fairdale woman in her 60s. Using a Facebook group set up to reunite owners and their property, Murray posted a picture of the photograph, which eventually led to it being claimed. The photograph provided some comfort to the family, who were left with the arduous task of clearing up the wreckage of their home, one of around 20 wiped out by the fierce winds. Clem Schultz was in the house with his wife when the tornado struck - but survived because he had gone upstairs to fetch a lantern. Destruction: This aerial photograph shows the trail of chaos left by the tornado, which cut a path straight through the small down of Fairdale . Reunion: Widower Clem Schultz was miraculously reunited with his dog Missy after she was spotted wandering . Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, he said the couple thought the tornado would not hit Fairdale, so was most concerned with getting a source of light in case the electricity cut out. When the winds struck he felt the house collapse underneath him - and by the time he made it out, his wife had been killed. He said: 'I felt the house shudder and move and I got buried in rubble. When it was all over, I dug myself out and saw people walking in the streets and I heard propane hissing from the tanks.' Schultz said he checked his wife's pulse after finding her body, but knew she was dead. He also lost his dog, Missy, in the tornado. But she was spotted by an electrical worker driving through the countryside and was returned to the family. Debris: This restaurant sign was found near Harvard, Illinois - some 50 miles from its home in Rochelle . Wrecked: Pictured above are the remains of the Grubsteaker's restaurant in Rochelle, where the sign originated . Other items posted online have made it even farther afield. A family photograph traveled 70 miles - and over the state line - to wind up in Racine, Wisconsin. A Fairdale town sign made it 28 miles to land between the towns of Belvidere and Harvard, while a sign from the Grubsteakers family restaurant in Rochelle was carried around 50 miles to a field near Harvard. The restaurant was badly hit in the storm, and customers sheltering in its basement were trapped for almost an hour when debris collapsed on top of the basement entrance.","Geraldine Schultz, 67, was killed last week by vortex in town of Fairdale .

"We’re used to reading about construction projects springing up in China at lightning speed – but things don’t always go according to plan. Sometimes stubborn house owners get in the way, as these incredible images show. These are the ‘nail’ houses in China left standing after their owners refused to give in to property developers vying for their demolition. Homes such as these in China are known as 'dingzihu' or 'nail houses' because they stick out and are difficult to remove, like a stubborn nail. Scroll down for video .

"Disgraced teacher Mary Kay Letourneau and her student-turned-lover are set to talk about their controversial relationship in a tell-all interview on the eve of their 10th wedding anniversary. Letourneau, 53, and her husband, Vili Fualaau, 31, will talk about her rape trial  and their married life in an interview with Barbara Walters on '20/20', which will air on Friday. The former Seattle teacher shot to infamy after starting a relationship with Fualaau when he was a 12-year-old sixth-grade student and falling pregnant with his child when he was just 13. After she served a seven-year prison term for the relationship, they married and now have two children together. She also has four children from a previous marriage. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau and her husband Vili Fualaau have spoken to Barbara Walters in an interview that will air on 20/20 on Friday - nearly 20 years after Letourneau's arrest for the relationship . Family: The couple's two teenage daughters, Georgia and Audrey, will join their parents for the interview . Their two daughters, Audrey and Georgia, who are now both teenagers, will join their parents for the interview, ABC News said. While speaking with Walters, Letourneau will discuss her plans to get her status as a registered sex offender lifted, as well as her hopes to teach again one day. She will also talk out about how they make their marriage work despite the 21-year age gap, ABC News reported. Fualaau will discuss his struggle with alcoholism and depression and how he believes he was failed by the system as a minor. After his teacher was convicted, his family filed a lawsuit against the police department and the school district for failing to protect him from sexual exploitation. No damages were awarded. Relationship: The duo first met when Fualaau (pictured in 1998) was in second grade and went on to have a sexual relationship when he was 12 and Letourneau (right in a 1996 school photo) was his teacher . In court: She is pictured listening to testimony in 1998; she went to prison for seven and a half years . Proud: She is pictured showing off her pregnancy bump in a photo released in 1998. She fell pregnant with their first daughter before she was arrested and with their second after she was released . Reunited: Letourneau is pictured with her daughter Audrey during a prison visit in 2003 . The pair originally met when he was in her second grade class and then she taught him again in sixth grade in 1996. As she taught him, their relationship turned sexual and a friend of her husband's ultimately went to the police with his suspicions. But before she was arrested, she fell pregnant with the boy's child and gave birth to his first daughter, Audrey, while she was on bail in May 1997 while waiting for the outcome of her trial. She was sentenced to six months in county jail - although three were suspended - and was ordered to have no contact with the boy. But weeks after he release, she was found having sexual relations with him in her car and fell pregnant with their second daughter. Family: She was married and had four children before the affair. She is pictured, right, with one of her sons . Back together: The couple is pictured during a photo shoot at their Normandy Park, Washington home in 2006. She was released from jail in 2004 and they got married a year later . At home: The couple is pictured with their daughters as they drive near their home near Seattle in 2005 . Going strong: The couple will talk about how they've stayed together despite the 21-year age gap . Letourneau gave birth to the baby while she was in jail after being sentenced to an additional seven-and-a-half years behind bars. She was released from jail in August 2004 and Fualaau, who was then 21, asked the court to have the no-contact order overturned, which it was. The couple got married a year later at a Washington winery - when she was 43 and he was 22. They have been together ever since. Letourneau also made headlines last year after she was booked into Washington's King County Jail for failing to go to court following a 2013 third-degree charge of driving on a suspended license.","Letourneau and Vili Fualaau will speak to Barbara Walters in a 20/20 interview that will air this Friday .

"Neanderthals may have eaten recently deceased friends and family either for food or in bizarre funeral rituals. This is according to marks found on the fossils of two adults and a child unearthed in the French region of Poitou-Charentes. Similar marks have been seen at other Neanderthal sites showing how our ancestors cut and fractured the bones of their dead relatives. Neanderthals may have eaten deceased friends and family either for food or in bizarre funeral rituals. This is according to cuts seen on a number of fossils dating back 57,600 years. Pictured is cuts on a forearm bone . Since the Marillac site in France was unearthed, the discovery of fossil remains of animals, humans and tools has allowed the site to be identified as a hunting area for Neanderthals. The latest study has, for the first time, studied the bones of three individuals found between 1967 and 1980 at the French site dating back some 57,600 years. These are an incomplete diaphysis – or the middle part of long bones - of a right forearm bone, another of a left leg bone and the majority of a right thigh bone. The latter belonged to a child. When compared to the remains of other Neanderthals and modern humans, scientists found bone marks made shortly after death. Cut marks seen on the thigh bone of the Neanderthal child. María Dolores Garralda, professor at the Complutense University of Madrid, and lead authors told SINC: 'Some Neanderthal groups cut and tore apart child or adult corpses shortly after death using lytic instruments' Several years ago, Spanish researchers came up with a dramatic new theory for the end of the Neanderthal - that humans ate them. The researchers point out we have already contributed to the extinction of 178 large mammals. They are now involved in further research on the bones of Neanderthal man to look for signs of human tooth marks. 'Except in its native Africa, in the other continents Homo sapiens can be considered as an invasive alien species,' write researchers Policarp Hortolà and Bienvenido Martínez-Navarro of the Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona, Spain. 'The only manner to test it is to find direct evidences of modern human eating marks on Neanderthal remains, such cut or broken marks on bones in artifacts made by modern humans,' he said. The team believe that as Homo Sapien spread into Europe and Asia, where Homo neanderthalensis was, it was treated just another food source - and a competitor. María Dolores Garralda, professor at the Complutense University of Madrid, and lead authors told SINC: 'Some Neanderthal groups cut and tore apart child or adult corpses shortly after death using lytic instruments.' The thigh bone fragment, which appears to be from a child who died at the age of 9 or 10, shows two large cut marks half a centimetre apart. From its state of preservation, the researchers suggest that the bone was fractured when still fresh with the aim of separating the upper and lower extreme of the thigh bone, where the joints are located. The upper edge exhibits marks of a 'post-mortem' impact with markings that do not follow natural separation of the bones. The lower region had a clear, oblique spiral break which seems to have occurred while the bone was fresh. 'Given the morphology of the fractures, it may be that the body of this child was manipulated shortly after death,' Professor Garralda said. 'The right leg received a series of blows that fractured the femur, and the cut marks identified are anthropic in nature; in other words, there is no visible evidence of animal bites.' The bones of the two adults show these and other markings. The fragment of the radius, possibly belonging to a man, also has small, fine cut marks made with flint tools shortly after death. 'The most significant are three striations together crossing over each other while the bone was still fresh,' the study says. In the leg bone, although the fresh fractures of both extremes can be seen, there are also signs of damage at the lower end.But 'there is no evidence of cut . Similar marks have been seen at other Neanderthal sites showing how our ancestors cut and fractured the bones of their dead relatives . As for the leg bone, although the fresh fractures of both extremes can be seen, there are also signs of damage at the lower end. But 'there is no evidence of cuts or traces of carnivores' teeth,' the researcher insists. The expert remains cautious regarding the of cannibalism, due to the large number of animal bones found on the site . 'They might have been rituals – still in the 21st century these continue in certain parts of the world – or for food – gastronomic cannibalism or due to need,' the authors claim. 'To date we have been able to demonstrate these manipulations at several Neanderthal sites in Europe, which are of course much more recent, including in groups of contemporary humans, but we have not been able to demonstrate the consumption of human meat by Neanderthals,' Professor Garralda said. The expert remains cautious regarding the of cannibalism, due to the large number of animal bones found on the site. The discovery was made in the French region of Poitou-Charentes in south-western France .","Study looked at Neanderthal forearm bone, left leg and right thigh bone .

"A divorcee who claims her ex-husband cheated her out of a multi-million-pound fortune has won the right to reopen their divorce battle in the Supreme Court. Alison Sharland, 47, agreed a £10.35million settlement in a deal that saw her give up her claim to an equal share in her husband's software company. But husband Charlie had lied about the value of his share in AppSense, and she now says she is entitled to more. Battle: Alison Sharland (left) accepted £10.35m from her ex-husband Charles (right) in the belief it was half his fortune. But his firm AppSense was later valued wildly higher, and his stake was said to be worth £132m . The Court of Appeal found that Mr Sharland, 54, had deliberately hidden information and lied to the court but refused to overturn the divorce settlement. Mrs Sharland will now take her fight to the Supreme Court. The Sharlands, from Wilmslow in Cheshire, married in 1993 and Mr Sharland founded the software company AppSense in 1999. The couple, who have three children, separated in 2010 and agreed to split their assets. But they could not agree over the value of Mr Sharland's share of AppSense, which has grown to become one of the biggest firms of its kind in the world with offices in Silicon Valley, New York, Australia and across Europe. She eventually agreed to accept £10.35million in cash and property and 30 per cent of the proceeds from her husband's shares when they were put on the market. The deal was agreed on the basis that they were worth no more than £32million. But within days of the agreement an initial public offering on the stock market – which never took place – valued the company at more than £460million, meaning his shares were worth around £132million after tax. Mr Sharland did not dispute that he misled his ex-wife and an Appeal Court judge said his conduct was 'deliberate and dishonest' but the court ruled that Mrs Sharland was bound by the agreement she had signed and refused her appeal. The case will now be heard at the Supreme Court in June. Popular: AppSense provides remote access software to 4,000 companies and was said to be worth £460m . Landmark: Ms Sharland's case will be heard at the Supreme Court, opposite the Houses of Parliament .","Alison Sharland agreed a £10.34million settlement with her ex-husband .

"An Australian teenager has told how she was raped twice on Christmas Eve in Bali while holidaying with her family - and has slammed Indonesian police for letting her attacker escape back to his native Nigeria. Audrey Pekin, 19, says she was attacked by a man, Henry Alafu, who she had met with other friends a few days earlier when he lured her to his remote home - and then assaulted her again in a taxi as she tried to flee. According to Channel 9's A Current Affair, the pair began drinking together at the Bounty Bar in Kuta, before moving to the nearby Sky Garden to continue the night. Scroll down for video . Audrey Pekin has detailed the alleged rape and attack she suffered while on a Christmas holiday to Bali with her family . Alafu lured Ms Pekin back to where his property away from the bustling tourist centre of the city, and brutally raped her on two separate occasions. Alafu told Ms Pekin a party was taking place a nearby villa, and the pair agreed to go to it together. According to ACA, during in taxi ride to the home, Ms Pekin began to feel unwell due to her type 1 diabetes. Once they arrived at the house, she was not put off by the lack of noticeable noise that suggested there was no party taking place, because her illness made it 'impossible to think', she told the show. Inside the house, Alafu locked the door and forced Ms Pekin to the bed where he allegedly attacked her. 'He went from a man to a monster,' Ms Pekin said. 'I can't quite describe the feeling, the sadness, to know what was about to happen and that I would or could not have done anything to stop it. 'I was literally shaking and drooling... I threw some very feeble punches, but I could not move my arms...I could not move anything.' After the first alleged attack, Ms Pekin said she desperately tried to escape. Alafu then followed her, and tormented her as she struggled to flee. She sought help from passing motorists and workers in a nearby service station, but Alafu allegedly told staff to ignore her and 'to stay out of it', the show reported. Ms Pekin believed she was safe when a cab picked her up, only for Alafu to force his way into the cab and again allegedly rape her. Henry Alafu is the man the Pekin family believed attacked their daughter . CCTV footage captured Alafu waiting in the lobby for Ms Pekin, as she stopped at the hotel before they continued with their night out. It was before the alleged attack took place . 'He kept trying to kiss me... he molested me in the back of the taxi for everyone, for the taxi driver, to see,' she claimed. 'He wouldn't stop.' Ms Pekin escaped the cab when it got back into the city of Kuta, when Alafu stalked after her again. 'He loped after me... he was laughing - he was taunting me,' she told ACA. It was only after another man, believed to be a fellow Australian, saw Ms Pekin was distressed and stepped in to help her. Ms Pekin said she tried to escaped from her alleged attacker by getting a cab back into the middle of Kuta, but he forced his way into the back of the car and  allegedly raped her a second time . 'I wish I could find that man... he deserves a medal, that man saved my life,' Ms Pekin said. Ms Pekin's sister, Frances, discovered her on the floor of her hotel room hours later. 'She wasn't even on the bed - she was next to the bed crying, shaking... in that moment I knew something, the worst had happened,' Frances Pekin said, according to the report. The family rushed Ms Pekin to hospital, where doctors found her entire body covered in bruises. 'He was crushing me, he nearly suffocated me... He could have killed me,' Ms Pekin said. 'It's so hard to get justice here,' Dawn Pekin (left) said. 'Men like him will cross path with many women. Don't think it can't happen to you' The 19-year-old then had a 'virginity test' at Sanglah Hospital, which she said was similar to a 'third assault'. 'The test was horrible, It was invasive... It was painful.' The test not only confirmed to police Ms Pekin had been raped, but it also revealed she had contracted a sexually transmitted infection in the attack. The Pekin family's torment was worsened by the fact the alleged predator was allowed to escape the country, and remains on-the-run. Alafu lured Ms Pekin back to where his property away from the bustling tourist centre of the city, and brutally raped her on two separate occasions,  according to ACA . A number of Facebook posts by Alafu, under a different name, including a picture he uploaded of the two together the night before, led to the Pekins family to believe it 'evident' he was the man who allegedly attacked their daughter. Police were in possession of Alafu's phone number, Facebook profile and current address, but the Pekin family says they did not do enough. 'It's just so hard to know what to do,' Ms Pekin's father, Karl, said. 'It's incredibly frustrating... They could have picked him up - he was still a threat. 'It's clear who he was, clear where he was, so we don't know why he wasn't picked up.' It was not until January 12, 18 days after the alleged attack, an attempt to arrest the Nigerian national. 'We're terrified. He's still free - we don't know if he is going to rock up on our doorstep,' Ms Pekin said . Four of Alafu's friends were arrested in a raid on the property on January 14, however it is believed he had escaped by that point. Police tracking revealed his phone was later used in Jakarta before being deactivated. His Facebook account was later opened from Nigeria. The Pekin family was paid more than $14,000 in legal fees over four days to proceed with the case. 'I think Bali is a lawless country,' Ms Pekin said. 'It has laws when it feels like it.' Police were in possession of Alafu's phone number, Facebook profile and current address . The family also called on the Australian government to help bring their daughter's attacker to justice. 'The Indonesian authorities have asked us why the AFP hasn't done anything, and it's a good question,' Mr Pekin said. The AFP said it did not have jurisdiction in the case, according to A Current Affair. According to the report, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it supplied comprehensive consular assistance to the family, but would not comment on an active investigation. 'It's incredibly frustrating... They could have picked him up - he was still a threat.'It's clear who he was, clear where he was, so we don't know why he wasn't picked up,' Mr Pekin said . The Pekin family said the country's lax policing of the problem means it is only a matter of time before another similar attack occurs. 'If you can rape a woman in Bali and just walk straight out of the country, that's not a deterrent, that's an invitation,' Dawn Pekin told the program. 'Either you get a cheap holiday, or you can have a safe one,' the 19-year-old Ms Pekin said. 'You can't have both.' Interpol was notified last week that Alafu is a wanted man. The Pekins are currently waiting for Interpol to issue a red notice for his arrest, which would allow the Australian government to push for Mr Alafu's arrest.

"A second Utah student has filed a lawsuit against the Davis County School District for hiring an English teacher who then allegedly went on to have sex with him and two other boys. Disgraced Davis High School educator Brianne Altice, 35, was ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Utah school district accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him. More legal trouble: Two students have now filed lawsuits against the Davis County School District in Utah accusing officials of failing to fire English teacher Brianne Altice, pictured in court in January, who is accused of having six with three boys . The latest lawsuit, filed last week, describes how Altice began flirting with the student, then 16, and other boys in her class, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents detail how at times, the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with Altice, sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her. On her part, the 35-year-old Altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems. According to the complaint, the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical. Court documents state that Altice's dalliances were an open secret at Davis High, where the running joke among students was: 'Who is Ms Altice sleeping with now?' Similarly to the first lawsuit, the new complaint alleges that the school district was aware of Brianne Altice's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on  bail for charges relating to the first two students. Her bail was then revoked and she remains behind bars. Not happy: Altice is pictured in court in February after her motion to drop one of the charges against her was denied . The student who brought the initial lawsuit in March accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. School district spokesman Chris Williams said at the time he was unaware of the lawsuit. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 . He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal. Altice's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. 'It is her defense that they did not happen at all,' he wrote in a motion. 'That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students.' But prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 . Brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in October 2013 to interview her. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' In February, she requested to drop one of the charges, claiming she had not been in a position of authority when she was accused of having sex with one of the boys. But a judge denied the motion. Altice would be tried separately in each student's case--meaning she'll get three different trials.","Former English teacher Brianne Altice, 35, 'had sex with three students'

"A woman in her 70s may be forced to sell her childhood home to fund her elderly mother’s care after losing a landmark court case that could have implications for families across Britain. Theatre director Glen Walford has been told by judges that the house, where she has recently invested £40,000 in renovations, was not her home at the time when her mother went into care because she rents a flat in London. Miss Walford, 75, has spent two years fighting Worcestershire County Council over whether the £205,000 house should be used to recover the cost of her mother’s care. Glen Walford (left) has been embroiled in a legal battle with Worcestershire County Council since her mother Mary (right) moved to a care home in 2006. The theatre director intended to retire to the property . Now the council has won the right to force Miss Walford to use the equity in the house, where she intended to retire, for care home fees, which can be up to £600 a week. Solicitors warned that the case could pave the way for relatives across the country to be liable for their parents’ care. Charlotte Kelly, an associate at Worcestershire legal firm Kerwoods, said: ‘This was a very significant judgment and one which will affect many in similar situations.’ When her mother Mary Walford, now aged 100, was admitted into care in 2006, the council agreed that the house in Stourport-on-Severn should not be taken into account during means testing. But in 2013 they reversed their decision and said that Miss Walford would need to begin contributing towards bills. Frustrated by the U-turn, Miss Walford became embroiled in a legal battle with the council which was taken to the High Court in January 2014. Miss Walford said she had always planned to retire to her mother's house in Stourpour-upon-Severn (above) There, a judge ruled that her home should not be taken into account when means testing was carried out on her mother’s finances. In his ruling, Justice Supperstone concluded: ‘A “home” is a place to which a person has a degree of attachment both physical and emotional.’ But the council took the case to the Court of Appeal, arguing that although the property may be her home, it was not at the time her mother was taken into care. Yesterday Miss Walford said: ‘I am now in a position where I will almost certainly have to sell my home to pay for my mother’s care bills which will leave me homeless. I have no energy or money left to fight them.’ Sunnydene has been in the family for decades and was built by her grandmother’s aunt in the mid-1800s. Miss Walford’s car is parked in the drive, her belongings fill the bedrooms and she has an office where she carries out her work. Yet she is often posted across the globe and, when working on national productions, needs to be based in London. As a result Miss Walford rents a bedsit owned by a friend in the centre of the capital. Miss Walford, who has never married and has no children, said: ‘Sunnydene is my home. I have lived there since I was 13. ‘I pay council tax, the electricity bills and have spent £42,000 renovating it. It was always my intention to retire in the house. A judge at the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Worcestershire County Council in January. Earlier the High Court (above) had sided with the Walford family . ‘It is quite simply my home and it is going to be sold from underneath me. God knows how many other people will face the same heartache following this ruling.’ In the Court of Appeal hearing on December 9 last year, her barrister Fraser Campbell argued that the only reason his client did not permanently live at Sunnydene was because her work ties her to London. By saying that the house would have been Miss Walford’s residence had she not worked in London, the council was discouraging people over the age of 60 from working, Mr Campbell argued. Despite the submissions, two out of three judges ruled in the council’s favour. Lord Justice McCombe, who rejected the council’s appeal, said he saw ‘no reason’ to assess whether the property was Miss Walford’s home based on a ‘historic’ date. Yesterday a Worcestershire Council spokesman said: ‘This was an important legal challenge and we are pleased that the Court of Appeal ruled in our favour. ‘There are ever increasing demands being made on the public purse and it is important that decisions about how public money is used to support individuals are fair and consistent.’","Glen Walford, 75, grew up in her parents' house in Stourport-upon-Severn .

An ex-boyfriend flew into a furious rage and attacked his former partner in the middle of a courtroom. Lee Keeley grabbed the unnamed woman and hit her head against a wall before stamping  on her head and chest at Lincoln County Court, after a judge ruled against him in a civil matter. The 38-year-old defendant chased her round the courtroom and tore out clumps of her hair after losing his temper in January. A court heard Keeley launched a chair at his ex-girlfriend before he started attacking her and barristers had to step in to break the pair up. The victim suffered a cut to her right ear, bruising and swelling to the ear, a grazed cheek as well as bruised ribs. Last Thursday, Keeley appeared before another judge at Lincoln Crown Court and admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was jailed for two years and given an indefinite restraining order, preventing him from contacting his former partner. Sentencing, Judge Michael Heath said: ‘I understand your disappointment but your behaviour after the decision was outrageous.’ A court heard Keeley, from Lincoln, had become increasingly agitated during the hearing and then erupted as Judge Richard Toombs announced the decision. Shocking scene: Keeley chased the woman round the courtroom at Lincoln County Court (above) and tore out clumps of her hair after losing his temper when the judge ruled against him in a civil matter in January . Keeley, who had represented himself, began arguing with the judge then turned on his ex-partner. David Outterside, prosecuting, said Keeley shouted an insult at the woman before adding: ‘He then picked up a chair and threw it at the victim but missed her. ‘He then chased after her. Twice they ran round and round the court as he tried to get hold of her.’ The court heard Keeley later told police he went into a rage when the decision was announced. He said he recalled throwing the chair but could not remember anything after that. David Eager, defending, said Keeley had ‘simply lost control’.","Lee Keeley flew into a rage after a civil case in Lincoln went against him .

"A mother-of-one crippled by her 30-year phobia of snakes was cured live on TV today in an astonishing ten minutes. Before today, Dawn Williamson, 39 and based in Scotland, could not even confront a plastic snake without panicking, and would obsessively check her toilet for the reptiles every day. But viewers of ITV1’s This Morning were amazed as therapists Nik and Eva Speakman broke down Dawn’s phobia with their no-nonsense approach, which involved 'proving' to Dawn that her fear was irrational. Trimuph: Dawn Williamson (centre), 39, was cured of her crippling snake phobia live on TV today by therapists Nik and Eva Speakman in an astonishing ten minutes . At the beginning of the show, Dawn - who was hooked up to a heart monitor throughout - broke down in tears at the mere sight of a plastic snake, which sent her heart rate soaring. By the end of the show she was able to touch a real-life 9ft Burmese python as it stretched out across her lap, leaving hosts Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden gob-smacked. 'It’s a miracle,' Amanda said. 'The results have been absolutely extraordinary.' Dawn, who is now able to take her seven-year-old daughter on a dream holiday to Florida later this year thanks to her treatment, said: 'All my life I’ve been terrified of snakes. 'But to sit down with one on my knee is just unbelievable.' The Speakmans have now helped 60 people overcome there fears and phobias live on TV, from balloons and snowmen, to frogs and spiders. But today’s was the first time viewers have been able to see the process in action. Lifelong phobia: Dawn had been petrified of snakes ever since she watched B-movie Venom when she was seven years old . Therapy: When presented with a tray of plastic snakes (pictured) she shook with fear and broke down in tears . Nik said: 'Usually we’ll go into another room away from the cameras, and spend a bit more time with the person and it can take a fair amount of time. 'But this time we spent just ten minutes going through it with Dawn, so viewers can see how we did it. It was very special as Dawn was the 60th person we’ve treated. We were thrilled at the result.' The Speakmans had never met Dawn, from Scotland until five minutes before the show and knew nothing about her phobia until they saw a VT recorded in Dawn’s home, showing how her life was being blighted by her phobia, known as ophidiophobia. Dawn had been petrified of snakes ever since she watched B-movie Venom when she was seven years old, she explained. 'If I see a snake on TV, I immediately have to get my feet up, the TV turned over. Then I’ll go to bed that night I’ll be checking under the covers. 'I also check in the wardrobe where we keep all the shoes because you just never know, they could be hiding in there. I’ll check in my boots, give them a wee shake, make sure there’s nothing in there.' Obsessive: Dawn used to compulsively check her home for snakes, and would frequently shake her boots to make sure they weren't hiding any . Philip asked her: 'Do you find it irrational? I don’t know when a snake was last found in a loo in Scotland.' Dawn replied: 'Yes. But I read a story in a newspaper once that someone had found a pet snake in the toilet, so ever since then I’ve checked.' Dawn was then asked by Philip to scribble down the word snake on a piece of paper - sending her heart rate soaring from 90 to over 130. She was also shown clips of Carl Fogerty with a snake slithering over him in the I’m A Celebrity jungle, as well as having to confront a tray of plastic toy snakes which made Dawn shake with fear and break down in tears. Eva continued the session by getting Dawn to concede that her fear of snakes was indeed irrational, before pointing out the irony that in hunting for snakes around the house, she was seeking out her fear. Irrational? Dawn also used to check under the loo seat every time she was about to use it, despite living in Scotland, which is not known for it's teeming serpent population . 'What’s happened is that you watched a film when you were seven years old and you reacted and created a schema,' Eva explained. 'The reason you now react irrationally is because you’re actually consulting a seven-year-old on how to react when you see a snake.' Dawn was then asked to talk about Venom, the horror movie which ignited her fear of snakes in the first place, in which a snake kills everyone involved. Nik then asked: 'So just from that one event, watching that film you’re frightened of snakes? 'You’ve been scratched by your cat but you're not frightened of it. What’s a snake ever done to you?' He added: 'You’re frightened of something that’s never hurt you, something that you’ve never physically held, that you only saw in a film when you were seven years of age. Does that make sense? 'Essentially, for 30 years, you have victimised snakes for no reason at all.' Relief: After accepting that her fear of snakes was irrational, Dawn was able to touch a real-life 9ft Burmese python as it stretched out across her lap . Logic: Eva (right) explained that it was essential to their techniques that the person being treated can feel the difference and see the evidence for themselves that they have overcome their fear . The Speakmans then held up a series of pictures of snakes to test Dawn’s reaction. To everyone's amazement she remained calm and said: 'I can look at it.' Nik remarked: 'This is the difference between seeing a snake through the eyes of a 30-odd year-old woman and not a seven-year-old child. You’re looking confused right now. 'That’s because you've spent 30 years believing something that essentially is not true.' Dawn was then presented with a tank of live snakes, and admitted that although 'bizarre', she was no longer has a phobia of them. At the end of the show, producers brought out a giant, 9ft-long Burmese python which laid across the laps of Dawn and The Speakman’s, with Dawn stroking the python. Remarkably, her heart rate stayed below 100. 'I never thought I’d be able to hold one,' she said. Eva explained that it was essential to their techniques that the person being treated can feel the difference and see the evidence for themselves that they have overcome their fear. She added: 'It’s about proving to the person that their fears are completely irrational.'","Dawn Williamson, 39, had been petrified of snakes since the age of 9 .

"Model and actress Sulinh Lafontaine is not a daredevil stunt driver who raced in Furious 7 - she just plays one on TV. In the run-up to the premiere of the latest installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, the athletic, petite brunette gained notice with her claims she was the sole female stunt driver in the action flick starring Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Dwayne Johnson. But as the car blog Jalopnik reported Thursday, Lafontaine has been brazenly misrepresenting herself as a member of the film's crew. Scroll down for video . Pump the brakes: Model and actress Sulinh Lafontaine has repeatedly said in interviews that she worked as a stunt driver on Furious 7, but this week she was unmasked as a fraud . Need for speed: The 5-foot-5, 95-pound actress told a blogger during the Furious 7 premiere in LA Friday that she raced at speeds reaching 140mph on set . At a Furious 7 premiere in Los Angeles last week, Lafontaine posed with a lime-green Challenger used in the movie and was interviewed by a blogger for a segment that was later featured on CNN's iReport. In the interview, which has since been taken down, the 5-foot-5, 95-pound actress gushed about how thrilling it was for her to join a major franchise like Fast & Furious. 'Being both an actress and stunt driver, there is no better film to be involved in,' she told her interviewer. When asked what it was like being the only female stunt car driver, Lafontaine addressed some of the challenges of working in a male dominated-industry. 'Female stunt drivers are far and few in between,' she lamented, without missing a beat. 'It’s hard to break into the stunt industry, even harder if you are a female. 'But to be the only female stunt driver on a set of this magnitude was absolutely mind blowing! I feel very honored. And blessed.' Ms Lafontaine then talked about the filming process, saying she did most of her driving in the desert and that her record speed on the shoot was 140mph. Joel Kramer, the supervising stuntman for Furious 7, told Jalopnik that his drivers usually don't go above 50mph for safety reasons. Nice try: Lafontaine even Photoshopped herself into a poster of the film, wedging her picture between Michelle Rodriguez and the late Paul Walker . Cog in a machine: A stunt supervisor on Furious 7 said Lafontaine worked as an extra on the set (pictured) - one among some 1,500 people . More lies: During an interview with New York Fashion Times, Lafontaine said she became licensed with the International Stunt Association in Europe and later got certified as a stunt driver in California . When asked about the passing of Fast & Furious franchise stalwart Paul Walker, who was killed in a car crash last year, Lafontaine said that he was sorely missed on the set, where she described the mood as very somber. 'But the job had to be done. The film had to be complete. It definitely ​was not an easy task,' she noted. Lafontaine then launched into a monologue about how proud she was to be part of the Furious 7 stunt family, how she has never sought public recognition for her 'craft,' and how driving was in her blood. 'It’s a lifelong passion, and I am just simply grateful I am able to live my passion,' she concluded. During that interview, Ms Lafontaine causally mentioned that she has been in the stunt industry 'for a while' - a statement that would come back to haunt her later on. The iReport from the Hollywood premiere last Friday raised some eyebrows among stunt drivers, who wasted no time calling Lafontaine out as a con artist. Backlash: Members of the stunt community quickly called out Lafontaine for her fibs on Twitter and Facebook, insisting that she was a fraud and a liar . Brazen: Lafontaine, pictured right with director Marc Scarpa, talked about the somber mood on the set after Paul Walker's passing last year . Eddie Perez, a director and stunt coordinator, tweeted in response to Lafontaine’s bold claims: 'Social media and self promotion can be deceiving but you will get caught.' Stuntwoman Heidi Pascoe also did not mince words, calling the wannabe racer a 'liar' and a 'fraud.' Tamiko B, another member of the stunt community, was equally harsh in her appraisal of Lafontaine. All smiles: Lafontaine proudly posed with action star Jason Statham, who starred in Furious 7 . 'What a pathetic excuse for a person, you should be banned from the entertainment industry,' she tweeted in reaction to the eviscerating Jalopnik takedown of the bogus Furious 7 crew member. As the automotive blog reported, Lafontaine’s lie-riddled interview on iReport was not a matter of an ambitious performer getting carried away or fudging a few minor details, given that she has made similar claims on other occasions. During an interview with New York Fashion Times, Lafontaine asserted that after being asked to perform car stunts in a movie she was in, she became licensed with the International Stunt Association in Europe and later got certified as a stunt driver in California. After offering a jumbled response to a question about car brakes - Lafontaine claimed stunt drivers don't use brakes but instead 'rig' emergency breaks - she mentioned that the latest film she worked on was Furious 7. Kramer, the stun supervisor on the film, stated that Lafontaine was not employed as a driver. Her connection to the project did not go beyond her role as an extra in a crowd of 1,500. He also refuted Lafontaine’s assertion that she was the only female driver on set, saying that the production involved at least seven or eight female stunt doubles, including the veteran racer Debbie Evans Leavitt. But Lafontaine’s Flickr account and IMDB page painted a very different picture. On her photo-sharing page, the fashion designer and actress uploaded a black-and-white Furious 7 poster, with her face crudely Photoshopped between Michelle Rodriguez and the late Paul Walker. The post was accompanied by the hashtags #stuntdriver #workingactress #workinggirl . On her IMDB page, Lafontaine, who has about a dozen and half minor movie credits – including a manicurist in What Just Happened and a hotel guest in Will Smith’s Hitch - is listed as an unaccredited 'race car driver' in Furious 7. About-face: In response to the growing outrage sparked by her claims, Lafontaine issued a statement on her Facebook Monday apologizing for a 'misunderstanding' Small-time thespian: Lafontaine has about a dozen and half minor movie credits – including a manicurist in What Just Happened and a hotel guest in Will Smith’s Hitch . She listed Furious 7 as her most recent project on IMDB, describing herself as an unaccredited 'race car driver' in the film . In response to the growing backlash sparked by her Furious 7 premiere interview, Lafontaine issued a muddled statement on her Facebook Monday apologizing for a 'misunderstanding.' ‘Dear friends and co-workers, please accept my humblest apologies for any confusion and/or misunderstandings with regards to the CNN iReport article “Furious 7 World Premiere with female stunt car driver Sulinh Lafontaine,’ she wrote. ‘As you are all aware I am new to this industry and I am learning as I go along. I had no idea that an inconsequential interview of a few questions about my experience working with all of you, would create such a rift between us. ‘I assure you, I meant no harm and I hope you will accept my apologies for any inconvenience it may have caused. I am new to this industry and I hope that in the future you can give me advice on how to better handle this type of situation, if it ever arises again. ‘The article has now been taken down. Thanks for being understanding while I learn the Hollywood ropes.’ Miss Lafontaine has since deleted her Facebook and Twitter accounts. Daily Mail  reached out to the actress for comment but has not received a reply as of 10pm Thursday.","Sulinh Lafontaine presented herself as a daredevil stunt driver who appeared in newly released blockbuster .

"A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.","Andrew Steele, 40, claims that the terminal disease affected his brain .

"An eight-year-old abuse survivor, who was beaten so severely as an infant that she permanently lost the use of her legs, has written a heartwrenching open letter to her social workers and detectives thanking them for investigating her case and placing her in a happy home where she is loved.

After her biological mother and her boyfriend were arrested, Marie was placed into foster care and later adopted by Michele Surprenant.

Marie wrote a detailed account of how her biological mother's boyfriend lied in the emergency room about how she got her injuries, claiming that she fell out of bed. She noted that because her social workers 'got involved and solved' her case the 'bad guy' is no longer hurting her - or anyone else. 'I think that if you never helped me my life would still be awful and lonely. Because they might not help me, not feed me or they would hit me when I cried' she said. 'But now I'm much better. I now have a safe happy environment. I am also around smart people. [sic]' Marie said her life 'is so much better', although she noted that her dog Jo's snoring drives her crazy. She continued by giving detailed descriptions of her cats Gypsy and Mr Fluffy. Marie, who said she 'loves pets', also talked about her class' bearded dragon Mr Cuddles. She ended her candid letter by writing: 'I wish that you keep doing what you do to make the world a better place and to make kids feel protected. I also wish that no matter how big or small the case is you will at least try and help the kids.' And amazingly, Marie's letter, which has become one of the blog's most read posts, found its way to one of the people who helped change her life. Grateful child: The eight-year-old wrote this later because she wanted to thank the social workers who 'investigated and solved' her case after she was abused by her biological mother and her boyfriend . Animal love: Marie also described her two cats and her dog in her handwritten letter . Never quit: She ended her message by encouraging other social workers to always do their best to help children like herself . 'This is Ms Rita your case worker,' social worker Rita Goodman wrote in the comment section of the post. 'I'm in a wheelchair sometimes myself now. I had to retire [two] years ago. I'm so glad to hear you are happy [sic.]. She added: 'I am also so proud of you. You are one of my best memories of the 12 years I spent in child welfare.' Marie's adoptive mother Michele, who is also a social worker, revealed in the blog post that it was her daughter's idea to write the letter because she is grateful for what she has. I now have a safe happy environment . Michele explained that Marie is 'living proof that ""social work works""', adding that her little girl is nearly nine-years-old and she is a straight A student who is 'wise beyond her years'. She recalled how Marie learned to push her wheelchair on her own when she was only 17-months-old. '[Marie's] future looks bright, and we know very well that none of this success would have been possible without the amazing team of social workers, detectives and medical staff in Atlanta,' Michele wrote. 'Thank you for being the stepping stone that [t]his little, baby girl needed. While Marie's paralysis causes scoliosis, requiring her to have rods in her back and surgery every six months, Michele told ABC News that her injuries have inspired her to become an orthopedic surgeon. 'Every time she sees her orthopedic surgeon, she's asking him career planning questions,' she said. 'But I told her sometimes he has to be at work at 6am some days, and she thinks that's a little too early. She's wondering if she'll be able to work the night shift.'","Marie Surprenant, from Atlanta, Georgia, was left paraplegic after being severely abused as an infant .

"Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. Scroll down for video . Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorists, according to an Iraqi source . However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian. Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren’t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. News of the attack follows contradictory accounts of al-Baghdadi being killed in air strikes in November and December . Another, an Iraqi expert on Isis used by the government in Baghdad in an advisory capacity, revealed that he had in fact been wounded. He said: ‘Yes, he was wounded in al-Baaj near the village of Umm al-Rous on 18 March with a group that was with him.’ This area is known to be largely lawless and a hotbed of jihadi activity, with very little Coalition air presence. Raffaello Pantucci, Director of International Security Studies for defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute, told MailOnline that it’s entirely plausible that the infamous leader had been hit, but warned that it might not have a long-term impact on the group if he didn't survive. He said: ‘We’ve heard these stories before. It's possible, as they would be going after him and they would be trying to drone him, but it’s right to be suspicious. 'If he was killed it would have a big effect on the group as a lot of the group is wrapped up in his identity. The whole of Islamic State is built on success and if the leader is bumped off it’s harder to say you’re winning. ‘But it’s quite a resilient group. They would do a PR piece on it and say he’s gone to a better place – but coherence often comes from leadership. ‘However, it would not mean the end of the group by any stretch.’ Last year there were two reports that Baghdadi had been wounded, but they turned out to be inaccurate. He escaped death in December when US jets attacked a two-car convoy on the outskirts of Mosul. His close aide Auf Abdul Rahman al-Efery was killed when a rocket fired from a war plane hit one of the cars. Baghdadi was believed to be in the second car, which was not hit. Figures from February showed allied airstrikes, including those carried out by British warplanes, had killed more than 6,000 fighters since September. The figure included more than half of the militants on the IS ruling council. Among the dead jihadists was also Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi’s number two and the most senior IS militant in Iraq. His death and that of as many as nine others on the 18-man leadership council forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders, as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists became increasingly small. Baghdadi, 43, was the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq before founding the Islamic State in Iraq in 2010, while he was declared head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2013. In June last year, the Islamic State declared itself a caliphate, with al-Baghdadi declared as its ‘Caliph’ or ruler.","Iraqi source said he was wounded after his three-car convoy was attacked .

"They have invited us into their kitchens and proudly shown off their families. But most of us are fed up with hearing about the wives and children of the party leaders, it seems. For 71 per cent of voters say they are choosing politicians and have no need to know about their spouses or offspring, a ComRes survey for the Daily Mail and ITV News reveals. Only a quarter say it is important to know about leaders’ domestic lives. Scroll down for video . Voters don't feel the need to know about politician's wives, a poll has found. Above: Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez were seen in their £1.5million Putney home in an ITV interview broadcast last night . Only 25 per cent of voters believe it is important to get to know party leaders’ families, the new ComRes poll shows. The party leaders have made their wives more prominent in this election campaign than ever before . The findings may come as a shock to Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, who have all invited the TV cameras into their homes and given their wives prominent campaign roles. Yesterday Mr Clegg became the latest to show off his kitchen, only to have it criticised for being mismatched and dated. It follows an interview with Mr Miliband and his wife Justine in one of their two kitchens and footage of the Camerons in the kitchen in Downing Street and in their Witney home. In the ITV interview broadcast last night, Mr Clegg and his Spanish wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez were seen in their £1.5million Putney home, sipping white wine while, in the background, a paella was cooking on the hob. However, one interior designer said the Clegg kitchen was ‘middle of the road’, too much a mix of city and country – and in need of refreshing. In the interview, Mr Clegg revealed what many have long suspected, that in key decisions his wife wears the trousers. The poll found that women are marginally more likely to want to know about politicians’ spouses and families than men, by 27 per cent to 24 per cent. Above: Ed Miliband is supported by wife Justine during the campaign . The ComRes poll shows Conservative voters are the most likely to think it is important to get to know the wives and children of the party leaders – 32 per cent, compared with 25 per cent of Labour voters. Labour would lower the voting age to 16, the party confirmed yesterday as Ed Miliband launched its education manifesto. The move – the first change in the voting age since 1969 – would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17-year-olds. Party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote Labour. The idea is also backed by the Lib Dems. But polls show that the public, including most 16-year-olds, do not support the idea. It is also opposed by the Conservatives. David Cameron said this year he was willing to hold a Commons vote on the issue, but did not support the move. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year. He warned the move would ‘politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school’. Women are marginally more likely to want to know about politicians’ families than men, by 27 per cent to 24 per cent. This follows a campaign that has seen the wives play unprecedented high-profile roles. Mrs Cameron has accompanied her husband on a series of election visits. She has even made a solo visit to the seat of Rochester and Strood, in Kent, where the Tories are seeking to dislodge Ukip defector Mark Reckless. Justine Miliband has given a national newspaper interview while Mr Clegg’s wife has also taken part in campaign visits. A separate poll found that Mrs Cameron is twice as popular as other leaders’ wives. The YouGov survey found that 54 per cent of voters though Mrs Cameron was the best election asset, with 26 per cent for Mrs Miliband and 20 per cent supporting Miss Gonzalez Durantez. The Prime Minister’s wife scored well with men and women alike, as well as voters who have backed other parties. Some 90 per cent of Tory supporters chose Mrs Cameron, compared with 82 per cent of Lib Dem supporters who opted for Mrs Clegg. Only 61 per cent of Labour supporters backed Mrs Miliband.","71% of voters say they don't need to know about families of politicians .

"A mummified monk who is believed to have lived for 102 years has become a major tourist attraction after he was put in a crystal display case sitting in the traditional lotus position of prayer. Buddhist Wu Yunqing was preserved wearing a golden cloak and beads in 1998 at Lingquan Temple in central China's Anyang City. Now 17 years on, his facial features and wispy beard are still clearly visible, the People's Daily Online reports. Macabre attraction: Buddhist monk Wu Yunqing was preserved at Lingquan Temple in Anyang . Records show that his parents died he was 15-years-old, leading him to run away to became a monk in Shanxi Yanan Qing Hua Temple. When Wu Yunqing passed away his disciples placed his body in the lotus position and sealed it inside a large porcelain vase with cement. The body was later taken out and placed beneath a crystal glass cover in the Wu Yunqing Memorial Garden at Linquan temple. Then and now: Buddhist Wu Yunqing, pictured left, looks remarkably similar 17-years after his death after he was mummified . Self-mummification was a way to preserve a person’s body after death and was practised in various areas of the world including Asia. Earlier this year, mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position were unearthed in Mongolia with experts estimating the human relic was 200 years old. The amazing mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position were unearthed in Mongolia . Mummified remains of a monk were also found encased in a Buddha statue dating back to the 11th or 12th Century after a CT scan and endoscopy were carried out by Drents Museum at Meander Medical Centre in the Netherlands. It led to hundreds of villagers signing a petition demanding the return of the relic which they believe was stolen in 1995 from Spring Village in eastern China's Fujian province. The mummified remains were discovered at the end of February after he took the statue to the museum in the Netherlands to be restored. According to various Chinese media, the Dutch collector said he is willing to return the Buddha statue if it is proved to be the one stolen from Fujian. A Buddha statue (left) containing a mummified monk (right) was stolen from a village temple twenty years ago, Chinese experts believe . Zhu Guosheng, a mummification master who has preserved the bodies of dozens of monks since 1990s, told Guangzhou Daily that a large porcelain vase is the key to the success of the Buddhist tradition. 'The process can be divided into resting the body in the vase, sealing the body in the vase and opening the vase,’ said Mr Zhu. To help with the preservation, a variety of ingredients are put into the vase, such as ground lime, shredded wood, coal and sandalwood. The body is usually kept in the container for three years before being taken out. Mr Zhu said if it's not rotten, then the deceased monk will potentially be wrapped under a layer of gold foil and turned into a statue.","Monk Wu Yunqing, who was 102, sits in lotus position in golden cloak .

"In a world where online shopping is king, Toshiba hopes technology can change the in store experience - with a robo-assistant. The firm's humanoid robot is set to start work at the information desk of a department store in Tokyo to help customers find their way around. The female-looking robot, named Aiko Chihira, will only speak Japanese - but she is also capable of sign language. Scroll down for video . Toshiba's humanoid robot known as Aiko Chihira, is set to start work at the information desk of a department store in Tokyo. Chihira in the work outfit created for the robot . However, Chihira is unlikely to engage in smalltalk its makers admit. Instead the robot was created to appear, talk and move as humanly as possible. Chihira blinks, bows and moves its mouth and lips smoothly while speaking. A Toshiba spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that Chihira is programmed with multiple human-like expressions, and that it will offer six-minute guidance to customers with information about the department store including events. Chihira has appeared at exhibitions and events, but this is the first time it will provide customer service. The robot’s appearance wasn’t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression, according to Toshiba. The robot will be set up at the Mitsukoshi department store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, on Monday and Tuesday. Ms Chihira uses sign language to introduce itself to humans. Toshiba describes the eerie android, which has blinking eyes and a fixed smile, as having the appearance of 'a friendly young woman.' At present, the android can mimic only simple movements, such as exchanging greetings and signing in Japanese. The technology was first shown off at Ceatec 2014 in Japan. One of the most popular devices there was TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 (2.1 metre-tall) reptile droid. A smartphone application makeS the dinosaur walk or jump, while a shake of the smartphone prompts the TE Saurus to bark. TE Saurus can also play trivia games as users answer questions through the app. Another highlight is Omron's three-legged robot, which is capable of playing a relaxed game of ping pong. It watches its human opponent to predict the ball's path, and can even decide to take it easy on opponents by missing a few hits. The robot’s appearance wasn’t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression, according to Toshiba. With five motors to control paddle movement, it is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return. 'This ping pong robot is really a demonstration of how a robot can interact with a person and react in an appropriate manner,' said Takuya Tsuyuguchi, an Omron manager. 'We envision this robot perhaps being used in a factory or production line and having a role in which it would have to interact with a worker to do or build something. 'This would involve the robot understanding the needs of its human counterpart and behaving appropriately.'

But the company soon hopes to integrate its technologies in areas including sensing, speech synthesis, speech recognition and robotic control to create a more social robot by 2020. The goal is to design a companion for the elderly and people with dementia, to offer telecounselling in natural speech, communicate through sign language, and allow healthcare to keep an eye on elderly people. Weebles may seem like basic toys now, but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘wobble but never fall down.’ To bring this childhood toy into the modern-day, a Japanese firm has created a troop of Weeble-style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball. And thanks to built-in gyroscopes and infrared sensors, the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over. The Murata Cheerleaders were built by Murata Manufacturing. Instead of wheels, the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball, which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move. They remain upright due to three advanced gyro sensors, which incorporate inverted-pendulum control technology, to detect tilt angles. Similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras, car navigation systems, and more recently, the electronic stability control (ESC) systems that prevent cars from skidding. Each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors, and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects, even in the dark. And, based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves, this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet (16 metre square) space. Meanwhile a group of 14-inch (36cm) tall cheerleader robots showcased their flawless choreography. Murata manufacturing, an electronic component manufacturer, presented the cheerleaders with colour-changing pom-poms that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance. 'These robots use our proprietary balancing technology combined with technology that prevents, in real time, the robots from clashing together,' said Tomoyuki Mori, a Murata engineer.

"An 84-year-old man has died in hospital from severe burns to his upper body - nearly a month after he accidentally set himself on fire with a cigarette while driving along a suburban New York road. Christopher Flowers was traveling down  Chili Avenue, near Route 390, in Rochester on March 9 when he dropped a lit cigarette into his shirt, causing several layers of clothing to burst into flames. He immediately pulled over and tried to extract the burning cigarette from his top. But the windy conditions at the time seemingly fanned the flames so much that they engulfed his entire torso. As the flames surrounded the pensioner's head, three Good Samaritans  pulled over and frantically tried to extinguish the blaze - at first, using their hands, then by hurling the man into a snow bank. Burned alive: Christopher Flowers, 84, has died in hospital nearly a month after he accidentally set himself on fire with a cigarette while driving along a suburban New York road. Above, the interior of Flowers's vehicle . Flammable: Flowers was driving down Chili Avenue near Route 390 in Rochester on March 9 when he dropped a lit cigarette into his shirt, causing several layers of his clothing (pictured at the time) to burst into flames . Hospital: Flowers, of Chili, was rushed to Strong Memorial Hospital (pictured), where he was listed in guarded condition with severe burns to his torso and neck. But on Sunday, hospital officals announced he has died . Emergency crews arrived at the scene and Flowers, from Chili, was rushed to Strong Memorial Hospital, where he was listed in guarded condition with severe burns to his torso and neck. But on Sunday, hospital officials told The Democrat and Chronicle that the retired marine had passed away. Additional details of Flowers's death, including the date, have not been released. Last month, Flowers's wife of over 56 years, Flora, spoke of her wish for him to regain his health, saying: 'He has bandages all over him. Just covered up with bandages and you can't touch him.' Speaking to WHEC, she added: 'It was terrifying. We're hoping and praying that he'll get better.' Flowers was wearing several layers of clothing at the time of the incident, including two or three flannel shirts and a couple of T-Shirts topped by a hooded sweatshirt, witnesses told reporters. Widow: Last month, Flowers's wife of over 56 years, Flora (pictured before her husband's death), spoke of her wish for Flowers- who was rushed to hospital with severe burns to his upper body - to regain his health . Retired marine: Mrs Flowers holds a photo of her husband during his time as a marine, many decades ago . Some of his attire was made out of polyester, which is highly flammable. As the flames spread across his clothing and body shortly before 9am on March 9, one man and two women pulled over to help. Mike Peters was heading to his job driving veterans to and from outpatient services when he saw Flowers standing at the side of the road, engulfed in flames 'from his waist to above his head'. Speaking to the Associated Press last month, Peters told of how he immediately stopped and ran past a woman making futile attempts to pat out the fire, before tackling Flowers into a snow bank. 'I scooped the guy up and did an end-zone dive into the snowbank,' the 52-year-old former Army helicopter mechanic, from Gates, said. He then used handfuls of dirty snow to douse the flames. Good Samaritan: Mike Peters (left), who pulled over after spotting Flowers standing at the side of the road engulfed in flames - tackled the pensioner into this snow bank (right) in a bid to extinguish the deadly flames . Scene: Gates's Fire Chief, James Harrington, said an ember from Flowers's cigarette likely fell on to his shirt while he was driving along Chili Avenue (pictured) shortly before 9am on March 9, causing him to burn alive . The three rescuers removed Flowers's smoldering clothing and wrapped him in a blanket that one of the women, named as Deborah Zielinski of Henrietta and Kathy Baleno of Gates, had in her trunk. 'I've just never seen anything like it,' Peters concluded. 'It was like newspapers catching on fire.' Flowers was subsequently transported to hospital, where he never recovered. At the time, Gates's Fire Chief, James Harrington, said an ember from Flowers's cigarette likely fell on to his shirt. The flammable nature of the pensioner's clothing will have only strengthened the flames, he added.","Christopher Flowers, 84, was driving on Rochester, NY, street on March 9 .

"An 18-year-old student who stripped naked and ran through the streets of Byron Bay to win a free kebab has been labelled a 'goose' in court. Jack Mascitelli, from Victoria, took up the unsavoury dare in broad daylight at 8.45am during schoolies week in the popular NSW beach town. The prank backfired when he accidentally ran 'screaming and yelling' past a group of police officers, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The officers then found him hiding in a nearby kebab shop. Jack Mascitelli, from Victoria, ran through Byron Bay naked during schoolies week for a free kebab . Mr Mascitelli, who is studying law and commerce at university, was fined $500 for offensive behaviour. Appearing in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court on Monday to argue against the fine, Deputy Chief Magistrate Chris O'Brien told Mr Mascitelli: 'What a goose. That's what you are.' 'This is 8.45 in the morning and you are running through the streets with no clothes on. I don't know why you would want a kebab at that time of day,' he added. Mr O'Brien pointed out how children could have seen Mr Mascitelli expose himself and called his actions 'embarrassing'. 'If people had been there with their children, or in my case my grandchildren, to see you exposing yourself ... they're wandering off to have a swim and there you are in all your glory,' Mr O'Brien said. Despite the dressing down inside the courtroom, Mr O'Brien did not record a conviction and said Mr Mascitelli was apologetic. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Mascitelli for comment.

"Three people have been sent to prison and another two are awaiting sentencing for their roles in a horrific assault on a 53-year-old man, who was beaten, tied to a chair,  and covered in offensive tattoos. A Philadelphia court heard Thursday that Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21, was the ringleader of the gang, who have become known as the 'tattoo terrorists'. Campbell believed the victim, Greg Valecce, had hurt his cat, Pebbles. Valecce, an unemployed drug addict, had been staying in the basement of Campbell's mother's house in Mayfair, in the city's northeast, however that basement would become a torture chamber where he would be strapped to a chair and violated for three days. Torture chamber: Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21 (left), the ringleader of a gang dubbed the 'tattoo terrorists' was jailed for 20 years Thursday for the abuse in March/April 21. David Harrison (right) is awaiting sentencing . Accomplices: Sandra Ng, 19 (left), Campbell's girlfriend, was sentenced to 23 months in state prison for her role in the shocking assault last year, while another defendant Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial . Campbell apparently discovered that Pebbles had suffered a broken leg and had reason to believe Valecce was responsible. The incident occurred in late March 2014, according to Philly.com. Campbell, his girlfriend Sandra Ng, 19, and friend Carl Halin, 18, cornered Valecce in the basement and took turns punching, slapping and spitting on him. On top of hurting Pebbles, Campbell believed Valecce had also stolen money and some weed. The trio, described by the paper as 'wannabe gangsters', filmed the abuse, with the video played in court this week. 'Please stop,' Valecce could be heard saying while crying into his hands. 'Please, please stop.' Ng could be heard in every video screaming at Valecce to stand up, so she could pummel him and call him a 'b----'. After Valecce was beaten he was tied to a chair. While restrained Campbell tattooed 'RIP Pebbles' onto his right arm along with a smiley face that had breasts for eyes and a penis for a nose. Halin then took over the tattoo gun. He inked swastikas, Stars of David, two variations of the N-word and a penis ejaculating on a rainbow with the words 'Gay Pride' beside it, Philly.com reported. Valecce suffered three busted ribs, two broken wrists and fractured bones in his face. He was able to escape on April 1 while the others slept and contact police. The incident lasted about 42 hours, the court was told. Scene: The abuse occurred in the basement of a rowhouse on Brighton Ave, Mayfair in north Philadelphia . Dur­ing a search of the house, po­lice al­legedly found a tat­too gun, needles, ink vi­als and re­lated paraphernalia, along with 155 grams of marijuana, sev­er­al bottles of pre­scrip­tion drugs and Valecce's deb­it card, which he claimed had been stolen from him. Valecce has since had the tattoos removed, with a local parlor giving him free service, but says the incident has left him with irrevocable damage. 'I'm scared to go outside now,' Valecce told Common Pleas Court Judge Charles Ehrlich Thursday. 'I have nightmares. I can't sleep.' All three were charged with aggravated assault, conspiracy and false imprisonment. They all pleaded guilty. Campbell's attorney said his client had a rough childhood, with his father leaving, suicide attempts and dependencies on Xanax and weed. He was sentenced to 20 years in state prison. Halin received the same sentence for what he did to Valecce. Ng, whose attorney who said she had fallen in with the wrong people at school, was sentenced to 23 months in a state prison. Another man involved, David Thomas, 28, is awaiting sentencing, while another defendant Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial.","Greg Valecce, 53, had swastikas, Stars of David, two variations of the N-word, a penis and other offensive symbols tattooed on his arms .

Judge Davis decided against putting Pettingill behind bars, due to fears his surname would attract unwanted attention and interfere with his rehabilitation. The judge also accepted Pettingill's crime spree was an 'unsophisticated, spur of the moment' act. The 26-year-old was ordered to pay more than $5000 in compensation for the mobile phones he had stolen, and was banned him from entering gaming venues. Pettingill robbed two women, a man and two schoolboys of their phones, and sold them to fund a gambling addiction he was hiding from his family, County Court Judge Sandra Davis said . Pettingill avoided jail time, with the judge fearing his surname would bring the 26-year-old unwanted attention in prison . Pettingill is the son of Trevor Pettingill, who was acquitted of shooting two police constables in Melbourne's infamous 1988 Walsh Street murders. Trevor Pettingill, along with Victor Peirce and two other men, were charged with the murder of Victoria Police Constables Steven Tynan, 22, and Damian Eyre, 20. The officers were brutally killed when responding to a report of an abandoned car around 5am on October 12, 1988.

Two of the men, Jedd Houghton and Gary Abdallah, were shot and killed by Victoria Police before being brought to trial . Kathleen Pettingill, who was dubbed 'Granny Evil', ran a number of brothels and had a glass eye after she was shot through the door of a housing commission flat. She was matriarch of the family, and another of her sons, Dennis Allen, was known as 'Mr Death' The Pettingill family inspired the 2010 Australian film Animal Kingdom . Peirce was himself murdered in 2002, gunned down outside a Melbourne supermarket. His wife, Wendy, said in a 2005 interview her husband had planned and carried out the killings. It is believed Peirce was driven to murder by a desire to gain retribution for his best friend, Graeme Jensen, who was killed by police.

"A woman is set to marry after falling in love with the driver who crashed into her car while she was parked waiting for her husband to return. Ranette Afonso, 42, will marry Marko Conte, 30, this October after they fell head over wheels in love and moved in together within two months of the fateful bump. Ranette, from north London, who has a 21-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter with the husband from whom she is now divorced, said: 'I was waiting for my husband, who had popped into the bank, when I noticed a sporty Nissan Skyline trying to squeeze into a tiny space behind me. Ranette Afonso, 42 (right), is set to marry Marko Conte, 30 (left), in October after they met thanks to a  car accident in August 2013 . Ranette (pictured left) was married at the time of the accident, but her and Marko (pictured right) began dating shortly after her marriage ended . 'I felt a massive thud and I knew a car had crashed into me - I was fuming. 'When Marko stepped out I was angry with him for being so careless. The car is his pride and joy so we spent a few minutes arguing with each other about who was to blame. 'At the same time, I found him really attractive and as we swapped insurance and contact details - I could somehow tell the feeling was mutual.' Ranette's 20-year marriage was already coming to an end by the time Marko unexpectedly came into her life at the end of August 2013. Ranette, a laywer, said: 'We had been together for a long time, but we had reached the end of our marriage. We both knew it. 'As I drove back home with my husband beside me I couldn't get Marko out of my mind. Five days after the incident I sent him an email asking how is bumper was and, before I knew it, we were texting each other regularly. Marko's car suffered notable damage after crashing into Ranette's parked car back in August 2013 . After the accident, the pair exchanged insurance and contact details and began to text regularly . 'I soon discovered that we had so much in common and, as things were not going so well between my husband, I found myself drifting closer and closer towards Marko.' Two days later Marko was surprised when Ranette sent him a text telling him she had suddenly split from her husband. Marko, a car hire company owner, invited her to stay with him while she made arrangements for her new life. He said: 'It was completely unexpected. After she arrived on my doorstep we had one of the best weekends of my life. 'There was so much passion between us - I knew we had a connection. We're both passionate people.' Ranette eventually moved in with her sister but still saw Marko frequently on dates. And they continued sending each other flirty texts using the contact numbers they had swapped for insurance purposes. Lawyer Ranette Afonso, 42 (pictured) was married at the time of the accident, but had been growing apart from her first husband of 20 years . On the couple's third date, Marko (pictured left) surprised Ranette (pictured right) by asking her to marry him . On their third date, just two months after the smash, Marko surprised Ranette by asking her to marry him. She said: 'We were having an incredible time in the nightclub and then - when I least expected it - Marko popped the big question and asked me to marry him. 'My initial response was 'did he actually say that?' I thought that he was trying to see my reaction. 'But when I discovered that it was a genuine proposal, I didn't think twice about saying ""yes"". 'Sometimes you just know when something feels right and that was definitely one of those moments.' Wild ride: Ranette is pictured sitting in the very same car that Marko crashed, which underwent a green paint-job following the accident . The pair moved in together in October 2013 and Ranette's divorce from her ex-husband was finalised two months later. She said: 'My close family want me to be happy so they have supported my decision to marry Marko. 'My friends thought I was crazy - particularly as it happened so fast - but now they understand.' Marko said: 'Everything has happened so quick. It's been such a crazy ride. At first I thought it was going to be casual but I am glad that we're now engaged. The happy pair, from Edmonton Green, north London, were engaged just two months after the car accident and are hoping to get married this October . 'We have found something really special.' Ranette said: 'I am so happy that Marko crashed in to me on that day. 'Both of our birthdays are in October so we're hoping that we can get married then. 'It will be the first time for me to finally meet Marko's family from Italy so it will definitely be an exciting occasion.' He said: 'We haven't made any honeymoon plans just yet but we are planning to travel the world, from Italy to South Africa.'","Ranette Afonso, 42, will marry Marko Conte, 30, this October .

"A Kentucky woman was forced to give birth on Interstate 65 on Thursday while stuck in traffic waiting for the Presidential motorcade to pass. Fortunately there was a nurse also stuck in the gridlock, sitting in her car nearby, who was able to run over and help deliver the little boy, Arley, safely. It was bumper-to-bumper all up the I-65 in Louisville for President Obama's visit to the city to tour a technology plant and give a speech about the economy, worsened because Obama had been caught up in Washington D.C. Jessica Brown was on her way to hospital with her husband, Zakk Satterley, when the couple realized, in standstill traffic, they weren't going to make it. Their baby was coming. Dramatic arrival into the world: Baby Arley was born on the I-65 in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday, after his parents became stuck in traffic en route to hospital due to the Presidential motorcade . Motorcade: Obama gets a green-light corridor when his motorcade travels, and the motorcade is usually comprised of about 20 cars. He was visiting Louisville to tour a technology plant . Emergency: Tonia Vetter (right), a high-risk nurse and mother of five, was sitting in the traffic a few cars back when she realized something was happening up ahead (left) and went to check it out . Safe and sound: Baby Arley and his mom, Jessica Brown, are now both in hospital after the dramatic delivery . Tonia Vetter, a high-risk nursery nurse, was sitting in her car listening to music, when she realized something was happening up ahead. 'You could tell something was wrong,' she told WDRB News. 'I wasn't quite sure what is was.' Vetter, a mother of five, approached the car Jessica Brown was in, and her husband said she was in labor. They had called an ambulance, but it couldn't get through. Vetter introduced herself as a nurse and attended to Brown. 'It actually happened very, very quickly,' she said. 'I think she pushed one time and the head delivered, and then she pushed again and the baby was born.' Lucky: Fortunately for little Arley, there was a nurse nearby to help bring him into the world . Happy parents: Jessica Brown was on her way to hospital with her husband, Zakk Satterley, when the couple realized, in standstill traffic waiting for Obama to pass, they weren't going to make it . Baby Arlie arrived weighing 8 pounds, 9 ounces. Other drivers at the scene also helped, with one handing over a shoestring to cut the umbilical, and the other a blanket to keep the baby warm. 'I've attended a lot of deliveries, but I've never delivered a baby on my own, and I've certainly never delivered one in the middle of an interstate,' Vetter told WDRB. 'God was definitely watching over me, the baby, the mom, because she could have hemorrhaged.' The Facebook post also says the baby's name is Arley Keith Satterly, son of Jessica Brown and Zakk Satterley. Both mother and the baby boy are doing well . Resting up: An ambulance finally got through the traffic and was able to take Arley and his mom to hospital . Vetter continued: 'The baby could of had a cord or a shoulder or any number of complications could of happened.' The new parents happily shared photos of their Facebook so all those who witnessed the dramatic birth could stay abreast of what was happening. The little boy's full name is Arley Keith Satterly. Both mom and baby are doing well.","Jessica Brown and husband Zakk Satterly were en route to hospital Tuesday when they became stuck in standstill on the I-65 in Louisville .

"If it feels as though summer has come early, that’s because we’re already enjoying August temperatures. This week’s remarkable spell of sunshine in southern England is to continue – and warm up. The temperature in the South is forecast to reach 24C (75F) today and 25C (77F) tomorrow, surpassing the highest seen so far this year, the 21.9C (71.4F) recorded in London on Friday. The delightful weather, caused by warm air blowing up from the Azores, is creating conditions we might usually experience in July or August. Scroll down for video . Beach life: People enjoy the weather at Barry Island  in south Wales yesterday, as most of England and Wales enjoys  warm spring conditions . Sunseekers: People sit on the beach at Barry Island in Wales, as forecasters predicted temperatures could reach 24C by tomorrow . Anyone for cricket?

Unusual sight: A man appears to walk across a rainbow at the beach at Barry Island, near Cardiff in south Wales yesterday . Stunning: A fog bank rolling onto Portsmouth from the Solent, after cool air moved quickly over the surface of the warm water . Britons are so confident of a scorching summer that bookmakers are receiving tens of thousands of pounds in bets on this year breaking records. The record for the hottest day ever in Britain was set more than a decade ago in August 2003 when temperatures hit 38.1C (101F) in Gravesend, Kent. Coral’s price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1, while Ladbrokes has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever. There has been a surge in bets after the recent warm weather, and William Hill has 8/1 odds that the temperature will exceed 100F (37.8C) this year. Ladbrokes is also offering 8/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 in Camden, north London, will be broken by the end of the month. The forecast for today is actually warmer than the 18C (64F) average daytime temperature in August, and way ahead of the 11C (52F) normally expected in April. This weekend will be slightly cooler than the dizzy heights expected tomorrow, but the clear skies and above-average temperatures are forecast to last well into next week. Met Office spokesman Laura Young said last night: ‘We are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days. Unless you are in north-west Scotland, which will see quite a lot of rain, it will be dry and sunny. ‘On Tuesday we could see 23C to 25C (73F to 77F) in prolonged sunshine. That is double the daytime average for this time of year. ‘Wednesday will be 22C to 25C (72F to 77F) or higher in places. Thursday will probably be slightly cooler but still in the high teens. Wednesday warmth: Most of England and Wales will enjoy sunshine over the next few days with temperatures hitting 24C later this week . Peak District awakening: The morning mist looking out across the Derbyshire village of Foolow, near Grindleford, which woke to a frost . Going for a walk: A deer in the morning mist near Foolow in Derbyshire yesterday, as Britons prepared for the warmest weather of the year so far . ‘There is a cold air mass arriving on Thursday night but it is expected to stay dry well into next week. After that we can be less certain.’ The spell of warm weather, which has now lasted more than a week, has seen people flocking to the nation’s beaches. Among them were swimmers in the South-West who were stunned to see giant jellyfish in the waters. Barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to six feet long, were spotted near Hope Cove in south Devon. The species are usually found in the sunnier climes of the Mediterranean, but the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant that more plankton becomes available and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The species is harmless to humans, but with the weather warming up then other jellyfish could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Devon vet Rupert Kirkwood, whose son Henry had an encounter with one of the jellyfish while kayaking, said: ‘No doubt they are encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’ After the bad smog seen late last week in the South-East, the air will be relatively clear for most parts over the next few days.

Over the water: Sunrise near Cullercoats bay in North Tyneside, as Britain basked in the hottest temperatures of the year so far . But pollution levels will increase again on Thursday and Friday, particularly in the South-West, where Cornwall and Devon are expected to see fumes rise to dangerous levels. The Met Office three-month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer. But thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, the weather we get in April doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect. ‘We’re still in the midst of spring, so it’s far too early to say what the months of June, July and August may hold.’ Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said yesterday: ‘The money flooding in on weather bets is unusual and has taken us a bit by surprise. ‘This is the first time we have seen quite significant sums wagered on this specific bet - so obviously people out there sense something hot is coming.’ And Nicola McGeady from Coral added: 'The British public are obsessed with the weather and that is reflected in the interest in weather betting.' Hot day: These graphics show the cloud coverage and temperatures tomorrow, with the South East expected to have the best weather . Arriving: The predicted hot weather this week is the result of a plume of warm air heading towards the UK from the south west . Green for cold, red for hot: These graphics from Netweather show the forecast temperatures for tomorrow (left) and Wednesday (right) A third of weather bets to Ladbrokes have come from punters in the South East - the area that has enjoyed the best conditions over the past week. And the bookmaker said its biggest bet of the year so far has been £1,000 on 2015 to be the hottest year on record at 8/1 - placed in January. Meanwhile, Coral - MailOnline's official betting partner - said it has even had a request from someone asking to bet on rain every day this summer. The Met Office has confirmed that hotter-than-average temperatures are more than twice as likely than below-average conditions until June. It said in a long-range forecast that ‘much of the tropical Pacific Ocean remains warmer than average and close to El Nino thresholds’. El Nino - the warming of Pacific sea surface temperatures - can trigger drought in south-east Asia and Australia as well as floods in South America. The Met Office says most climate models ‘now suggest that sea surface temperatures will exceed El Nino thresholds in late spring or early summer’. With Britain set to bask in its hottest temperatures of the year so far this week, thousands of parents and children are expected to head to the beach. But firefighters have warned those thinking about stripping off and diving into the water - with more than 650 water-related deaths in the UK in 2013. The act, known as ‘tombstoning’, can lead to people suffering ‘cold water shock’ when the air temperature is much higher than that of the water. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Peter Cowup said: ‘Rivers, lakes and canals may look inviting, especially on a hot day and after a drink. ‘But it’s important to realise that open water has hidden dangers that can hurt you and at worse, kill you.’ On the first-ever Drowning Prevention and Water Safety Week, firefighters added that the 16-30 age group was worst-hit by water deaths in 2013. Giant jellyfish are being spotted off Britain earlier than normal thanks to the warm weather, it was claimed yesterday. Kayaker Rupert Kirkwood, a seasoned sea watcher, was stunned to see the giant creatures off Hope Cove in Devon. The barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to 6ft long, were pictured floating next to Mr Kirkwood’s kayak in the sun-drenched blue waters. Up close: Rupert Kirkwood's son Henry had this encounter with a barrel jellyfish near Hope Cove off the coast of south Devon . The species are usually found in more tropical areas such as the Mediterranean Sea. But the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant more plankton is available - and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Floating: The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way . The Red Cross says that anyone who does get stung should not try to use urine to provide relief as the healing properties of this are an urban myth. Vinegar is said to be far more effective. Vet Mr Kirkwood said: ‘No doubt they [are] encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. ‘I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’","Tomorrow will be week's warmest day and Met Office says above-average temperatures are forecast until June .

"A Connecticut judge spared today a father from prison time in the death of the young son he left in a car on a hot day, saying the man had suffered enough. Kyle Seitz, 37, of Ridgefield, received two years of conditional release, a sentence similar to probation, at the hearing in Danbury Superior Court after his lawyer read aloud a letter written by his wife asking the judge for leniency on his behalf. Authorities say Seitz forgot to take his 15-month-old son, Benjamin, to day care on the morning of July 7, 2014, and left him in the car for seven hours while he went to work. Scroll down for video . Spared: A Connecticut judge spared Kyle Seitz, pictured in court in November, from prison time in the July death of his 15-month-old son, Benjamin (right) whom he left in a hot car . Temperatures that day soared into the upper 80s. Co-workers at Owl Computer Technologies said Seitz spent the day working as usual, even making a trip in the car to a sandwich shop, not realizing Benjamin was still buckled up in the backseat, according to the arrest warrant. It was not until Seitz drove to his son's day care at the end of the work day to pick him up that he realized Ben was dead in the back of his Jeep Cherokee. The software programmer told the authorities that he 'felt shock and terror' when he discovered that his son was in the back seat 'motionless'. After discovering Benjamin lying unresponsive on the car's back seat, he rushed the toddler to Danbury Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Benjamin died as a result of hyperthermia due to environmental exposure. Just weeks after Benjamin's death, the child's mother said she forgave her husband of 12 years. In anticipation of her husband's sentencing Thursday, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz wrote a letter that was read aloud in court pleading for leniency. Plea for mercy: Lindsey Rogers-Seitz (left) had her husband's lawyer read in court a letter she had written to the judge asking him for leniency and compassion for her husband . Daddy's boy: Rogers-Seitz wrote that her husband and their son enjoyed a very close bond, and the little boy was the apple of his dad's eye . 'It is with my greatest respect, your honor, that I ask this of you today — for compassion and leniency in sentencing my husband. For him to be released to be with his family, so that we can finally be at peace to grieve and heal together,' she wrote in the letter read by her attorney. Seitz pleaded guilty March 10 to criminally negligent homicide under an Alford plea, in which he did not admit guilt but agreed the prosecution had enough evidence to convict him at trial. He had been facing up to a year in prison. When asked if he wanted to say a few words, Kyle Seitz thanked all of his family's supporters. 'I cannot punish him more than this event has punished him, nor would I choose to do so,' Judge Kevin Russo said, according to WCBS. Seitz, who has two other children, has been free on bail. His wife and two daughters moved to Colorado following Benjamin's death and Seitz is now free to join them. In the wife's emotional letter, published in full on her personal blog, The Gift of Ben, Lindsey Rodgers-Seitz, a lawyer by trade, wrote that she fell in love with Kyle at first sight, and that the tragedy that rocked their family last year did not change the way she feels about her husband. 'My love for him is based on the fact that he is the most good-hearted, the kindest and most loving man I have ever met,' the wife said in her statement. 'He is not an average father or even a good father…he is an amazing father.' Parent's worst nightmare: Seitz, a software programmer, told the authorities that he 'felt shock and terror' when he discovered that his son was in the back seat 'motionless' She then went on to describe Ben and Kyle's close bond, and how her husband, blessed with what she called a 'magic touch' with kids, would rock his son to sleep and run to him when he cried. 'Ben was a daddy's boy all the way... they were inseparable,' Mrs Roger-Seitz recalled. After explaining her husband's decision to take a plea deal last month - the family sought to avoid a an emotionally draining, drawn-out trial - the grieving wife and mother concluded her blog entry Thursday on a hopeful note. 'My takeaway from all of this, which I hope to guide my life as I move forward is simply - love wins. That's it. Very simple.'","Kyle Seitz, 37, of Connecticut, entered a so-called Alford plea in which he didn't admit guilt but agreed there was enough evidence to convict him .

"Teachers are suffering broken arms and severed fingers at the hands of violent pupils as young as six. The NASUWT union said indiscipline is a ‘significant problem’, with teachers sworn at, kicked and punched. Last year, staff at eight schools refused to teach pupils who threw chairs, brought fireworks in and threatened to slit other children’s throats. Teachers are suffering broken arms and severed fingers at the hands of violent pupils. A deputy headteacher fell and fractured her arm while trying to restrain a six-year-old boy with autism . Paul Nesbitt, NASUWT executive member for the West Midlands, said the union ‘doesn’t hesitate’ to launch so-called ‘refusal to teach’ ballots. Mr Nesbitt, who is a member of the union’s health and safety committee, told the NASUWT’s annual conference in Cardiff: ‘This year alone I have been personally involved in some refusal to teach, where at one school a six-year-old boy broke the arm of a deputy head teacher. ‘It was difficult to go in and speak to four members of staff who actually cried and broke down and were in fear of their personal safety within the classroom. ‘Most people say: ‘A six-year-old?’ But that six-year-old was able to break someone’s arm. That’s a concern.’ The woman had fallen while trying to restrain the boy, who had autism and behavioural problems, at the primary school in Walsall, West Midlands. Mr Nesbitt cited another teacher whose finger was severed by a student at a pupil referral unit in Solihull, West Midlands, a few weeks ago. He said: ‘We’ve been contacted recently where a member had to be rushed off to the local QE (Queen Elizabeth Hospital) in Birmingham to have an emergency operation to reattach the top part of her finger because one of the students had kicked the door and caught her hand and took the top off the finger.’ The revelations were made at teachers' union NASUWT’s annual conference in Cardiff today (general secretary, Chris Keates, pictured) Mr Nesbitt pointed out that under the Health and Safety At Work Act 1974, employers must make sure as far as ‘reasonably practical’ that employees are protected. He said: ‘At times, at some of the schools I visit, that is questionable. ‘As a union, we accept that most schools and colleges, remain relatively safe and secure, but we are seeing the increase of numbers of incidents within school: a minority of pupils who continue to challenge authority and behave disruptively, using threatening behaviour, abusive language and sometimes physical violence towards our members.’ He warned that some schools are ‘continually reluctant’ to impose sanctions such as exclusions because they do not want to inform their local authority or gain a ‘bad reputation’. Mr Nesbitt added: ‘In a scenario recently when I looked at a school’s behavioural system there were 1,200 behavioural issues that had been reported internally but only 12 had been reported to the authority. ‘According to the authority, that school was deemed as a good, well behaved school but we know that’s not the case.’ Dan McCarthy, NASUWT’s national executive member for the Eastern region, said a female teacher at a local primary school had been ‘kicked repeatedly by a six-year-old’. Later, the woman ‘discovered she was pregnant and the child was now punching her in the stomach’. She went on sick leave as a result. ‘I was working in a department where a student stabbed another student in one of the classrooms,’ he said. ‘We actually had as a school a procedure for that. In that school there was a tannoy system. ‘The tannoy system would talk about a Ford Escort, and depending on how certain numbers were said about that Ford Escort’s lights being on, staff knew how to react in different ways. ‘But I’m asking you, in your school is there an emergency protocol? Is there a facility in your school to lock your school down if necessary?’ Neil Lawrence, a teacher from Nottingham, told the conference that a Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT) injured her back after a pupil pulled a chair from beneath her as a prank. Staff at eight schools refused to teach pupils who threw chairs, brought fireworks in and threatened to slit other children’s throats, last year . He said: ‘This NQT still hasn’t returned to work. She’s still in a lot of pain.’ Jane Setchfield, an NASUWT executive member for Wales, said some schools are operating a sliding scale discipline policy. This means that ‘a pupil verbally abusing a main scale teacher will have a minor sanction’. She added: ‘Verbal abuse to a head of department or even the headteacher may result in a more serious sanction or even exclusion.’ NASUWT delegates yesterday passed a motion condemning an ‘increasing blame culture’ that attempts to hold individual teachers responsible for poor pupil behaviour.","NASUWT union said indiscipline is a 'significant problem' at many schools .

Skydiving instructor Mike Robinson was one person who found himself in a sticky situation – after a plane collided with the aircraft he was in. Together with eight other experienced skydivers and two pilots from Skydive Superior split between Cessna 182 aircraft, Mike was preparing to make the last jump of the day at 4,000ft in Wisconsin. Each skydiver was equipped with cameras on their headgear – but none knew they were about to live through an event more commonly seen in a Hollywood blockbuster. The two aircrafts were flying in formation and the skydivers had planned to jump in tandem. Mike was travelling in the lead plane with three other skydivers and they had all moved onto the outside of the plane and were poised to jump. Three skydivers in the following plane were in the same position with the remaining two ready inside the aircraft. Suddenly, the second plane crashed into the lead, pinning one skydiver in between the two aircraft. Cameras were rolling when one plane crashed into another, pinning one skydiver in between the two aircraft . The situation became deadly when leaking fuel ignited but none of the passengers sustained serious injuries . The two planes broke into fiery pieces and hurtled to the earth while witnesses looked on and shot video . Three skydivers were thrown into the air as the starboard wing of the lead plane broke off. The situation became deadly when leaking fuel ignited. Footage taken from the jumper’s headgear shows the pilot urging the remaining skydivers to jump from the burning plane. The divers tumbled into the air as fireball engulfed one of the planes – but luckily both pilots jumped free. Remarkably, none of the jumpers or pilots sustained serious injuries and all landed safely on the ground, enabling them to watch the two planes break into fiery pieces and hurtle to the earth. But danger doesn’t just occur thousands of feet above the air, as Marc Wells and daughter Josie found. Marc had his camera to hand as a deadly tornado tore through his town in Illinois. But when it became clear the category F4 storm – one lower than the most deadly – was heading his way, Marc fled to his underground storm shelter with his daughter and dog. And despite being safe in the bunker, the merciless storm can be heard ripping apart their home in the astonishing camera footage. The 300km/h wind had torn nearby houses into pieces and had destroyed Marc’s home in just six seconds. Caught-on-camera footage can also reveal incredible moments of escape and rescue. A diver in the Gulf of Guinea was sent to retrieve the bodies of a sunken tugboat when he found a survivor . Each occurrence in the show is deconstructed with graphics, illustrations and an explanation of the facts . The adrenaline-filled program dispenses with onscreen experts to focus exclusively on the raw footage . One of the most astonishing pieces of footage features in the second episode. A diver in the Gulf of Guinea had been sent to retrieve the bodies of a sunken tugboat. The Jascon 4 had been 30m under water for three days and all 12 members of the crew were believed to have perished. But as diver, whose camera and sound was fed back to DCN diving team in a nearby rescue vessel, swam through the wreckage, he came across the hand of what he believed to be a corpse. He nearly had a heart-attack as the hand suddenly grabbed his own. He said: “There’s someone alive. He’s alive. I almost had a heart attack now!” The hand belonged to Harrison Okene, a 29-year-old Nigerian who had worked on the boat as a cook. Harrison had been trapped in a small air pocket in the dark at the bow of the boat, which lay upside down on the ocean floor. The traumatised man had survived on just a can of Coke for three days, uncertain if help would ever come. His rescuer attached him to an oxygen mask and freed him from the stricken vessel – but sadly he was the only survivor of the shipwreck. The show also explores incredible wildlife footage as an impala flees a deadly cheetah by jumping into an open car window. And Mark Robert, an experienced climber, captured footage as he lost his footing while climbing the near vertical Parsley Fern Gully in Snowdonia and tumbled down the mountainside.

"A California mother has opened up about the horrific experience of watching her once-vibrant daughter fade away and die from a little understood brain-eating amoeba. Sybil Meister firmly believes her daughter Koral Reef picked up the deadly and mysterious Balamuthia mandrillaris infection during a family trip to Lake Havasu in May 2013. Reef married her high school sweetheart that July and began to show worsening symptoms like headache, fatigue and stiff neck a couple of months later. By October 2014, Reef would be dead. She was 20-years-old. Tragic: Koral Reef, left, was a blushing bride in July 2013 as she wed her high school sweetheart. The 20-year-old Temecula, California woman would be dead just over a year later from a rare, deadly and incurable brain-eating amoeba infection . Now her mother is on a mission to educate the world about the dangers of Balamuthia mandrillaris, for which there is no proven treatment. 'They said, ''Oh, she's having withdrawal from her birth control; It's a migraine.'' They gave her medicine and sent her home and then she progressively got worse,' Meister recalled in an interview with KNTV. That was in 2013 and the family couldn't possibly have foreseen the horrors ahead. After all, Koral had just married her high school sweetheart Corey Pier. In fact, the attractive young couple were barely even out of high school when the trouble began. 'She started with the headaches, the stiff neck, the sensitivity to light and heat was bad,' Meister said. According to the Press Enterprise, the symptoms steadily worsened. Over the course of months, once-healthy Koral began to regularly experience blurred vision, lethargy and mood changes. Terrible decline: Reef's family believes she picked up the rare Balamuthia mandrillaris infection on a May 2013 trip to Lake Havasu . Balamuthia infection is very rare. The Balamuthia amoebas can infect the skin, sinuses, brain and other organs of the body. Therefore, Balamuthia infection can cause a wide range of symptoms. Disease can begin with a skin wound on the face, trunk, or limbs and can then progress to the brain where it cause a disease called Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis. Diagnosis of Balamuthia GAE can be difficult, but some early symptoms may include: . • Headaches . • Stiff neck or head and neck pain with neck movement . • Sensitivity to light . • Nausea . • Vomiting . • Lethargy (tiredness) • Low-grade fever . Other signs of Balamuthia GAE may include: . • Behavioral changes . • Seizures . • Weight loss . • Partial paralysis . • Speech difficulties . • Difficulty walking . Source: CDC . 'Balamuthia's mortality rate is very, very high. Only 13 percent of patients survive without any type of treatment,' Dr. Navaz Karanjia, Director of Neurocritical Care at UC San Diego. Some 200 cases have been identified worldwide since 1993. Most cases are reported among the young, old or otherwise immunocompromised. California saw 12 cases between 1990 and 2011. Nine of those cases were fatal. Deadly: At left, the Balamuthia mandrillaris amoeba is seen in its cystic phase. At right, the deadly brain-eating organism is seen in its active stage . A scan of her brain in September revealed what doctors first thought might be cancer. A test revealed it was Balamuthia mandrillaris. 'They told us there is no real treatment for this,' said Pier. 'I broke down and I was freaking out. I didn't want to tell her. She wouldn't remember anyway. She was there, but she wasn't there. It was just eating away at her brain.' Within weeks, half her body was paralyzed. Then she stopped responding to her family. Doctors tried administering the investigational drug Miltefosine, but it was too late. Reef died October 20. Meister has now embarked on a campaign to teach others about the water- and soil-borne infection. 'We're reaching out to people trying to raise awareness because I don't think people understand how serious it can be. It's deadly,' she told KNTV. She's created Team Koral Reef GoFundMe and Facebook pages to help the cause. Reef would not be the first person to die from an amoebic infection after swimming in Lake Havasu, but she would be the first to die form this particular form of the single-cell organism, which authorities say has not been documented in the Arizona lake. Lake Havasu? Reef's family firmly believes she picked up the amoeba in Lake Havasu (pictured) in May 2013. The Arizona lake is known to harbor a different deadly amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, but not the type found in Reef's brain . Horrific: Reef married her high school sweetheart in July 2013 and began to show worsening symptoms like headache, fatigue and stiff neck a couple of months later. By October 2014, Reef would be dead. She was 20-years-old . 'They told us there is no real treatment for this,' recalled Reef's young widower. 'I broke down and I was freaking out. I didn't want to tell her. She wouldn't remember anyway. She was there, but she wasn't there. It was just eating away at her brain' Fourteen-year-old Aaron Evans died from an infection caused by Naegleria fowleri that his family believed he picked up from the lake. Naegleria fowleri is known to live in the lake and other warm fresh waterways. In 2007, officials at Lake Havasu responded by posting signs around the waterway warning of the potential--albeit rare--danger. Meister says the signs aren't enough. 'That sign makes the amoeba out to be some cute little fish that may cause a rash,' Meister told PE.com. 'That doesn't scream danger. That screams ''Have fun but be careful because there may be some amoeba in the lake that may be dangerous.'' It should read ''Swim at your own risk.''' SPeaking out: Reef's mother Sybil Meister, left, now wants to educate the world on the little-known danger of Balamuthia mandrillaris . Meister says the signs posted around Lake Havasu warning of the dangers of amoebas aren't enough. 'That sign makes the amoeba out to be some cute little fish that may cause a rash,' Meister said .","Koral Reef, 20, died last year after a horrifying and protracted battle against the little-understood parasite Balamuthia mandrillaris .

"Dr Nadeem Azeez, 52, (pictured) is thought to be in Pakistan but was yesterday charged with manslaughter by gross negligence . An international arrest warrant has been issued for an NHS doctor who is believed to have left the country after a teacher died following a caesarean. Dr Nadeem Azeez, 52, is thought to be in Pakistan but was yesterday charged with manslaughter by gross negligence, along with fellow anaesthetist Dr Errol Cornish, 67. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust is also accused of corporate manslaughter – the first time a health trust has been charged with the offence since its introduction in 2008. Frances Cappuccini died within hours of her second son’s birth after suffering major complications that resulted in the loss of half her blood. At an earlier inquest hearing, the family’s lawyer said her death might have been avoided if doctors had not persuaded her to change her birth plan. The 30-year-old – a primary school teacher – had intended to have an elective caesarean at Tunbridge Wells Hospital. But she and her husband Tom, 35, reluctantly abandoned their plans after doctors said they should allow labour to progress naturally overnight. Their son Giacomo was eventually born by emergency caesarean – but Mrs Cappuccini suffered massive bleeding and died soon afterwards on October 9, 2012. Her husband was left to bring up the little boy – who has the middle name Frankie in memory of his mother – and the couple’s other son, Luca, five, by himself. The family’s lawyer Neil Sheldon told Mrs Cappuccini’s inquest that she was left struggling to breathe for 90 minutes without being given sufficient oxygen. He also questioned why the teacher did not receive a blood transfusion earlier and suggested there could be an issue with maternity ward staff overruling women’s wishes for their birth plans. The inquest was halted in February last year so evidence could be referred to prosecutors to allow them to consider bringing criminal charges. Mr Sheldon said at the time: ‘The family has not entered into the process for any other reason than to have questions answered. They are not trying to have anyone convicted, but they do want to find out what happened and why.’ Neighbours said Dr Azeez then moved away in September after splitting up with his wife – who is also a doctor – and selling his house in Tunbridge Wells. He had attended school and completed his medical training in Lahore, Pakistan, before coming to Britain. The father of two is also currently suspended from the General Medical Council’s register of doctors. Tragedy: Frances Cappuccini, 30, died from a haemorrhage hours after giving birth to her second son Giacomo on October 9, 2012. Two doctors have been charged with  manslaughter by gross negligence . Heartbreak: Lawyers said Mrs Cappuccini and her husband Tom, 33, from West Malling, Kent had decided on birth by planned caesarean - but were allegedly persuaded to try a natural birth instead . A spokesman for Kent Police said: ‘An international warrant has been issued for the arrest of Dr Azeez, who is believed to have left the country and returned to Pakistan.’ Dr Cornish, of Bromley in South London, is originally from South Africa where he trained at the University of Cape Town in the 1970s. Delays: An inquest into Mrs Cappuccini's death was due to be heard in February last year but was postponed while Kent police investigated the possibility of criminal charges. Mrs Cappuccini, who was affectionately called ‘Mrs Coffee’ by her pupils, taught five and six-year-olds at Offham Primary School, near West Malling, also in Kent. Her positive attitude has been praised by headteacher Phillip Hunter, who described her as a ‘bubbly and enthusiastic person’ and paid tribute to her as a ‘brilliant teacher’. Lawyers for the family said yesterday that they did not want to comment on the decision to charge the two anaesthetists. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust – which was criticised in 2007 after 90 patients died in an outbreak of superbug C difficile – said it could not make a statement for legal reasons. The first hearing in the case will take place at Sevenoaks magistrates’ court on Friday next week. Mrs Cappuccini managed to spend time with her new son who was born weighing 7lb 15oz and nurse him before she died. She and her husband Tom had a son Luca, who was three at the time of her death. Mrs Cappuccini had taught at Offham Primary School in West Malling for nine years after training there. Colleagues and friends described her as 'bubbly and enthusiastic' and a 'brilliant teacher'. Phillip Hunter, head of the 200 pupil primary school, said at the time of her death: 'Frankie did her teacher training with us nine years ago and stayed on afterwards. 'She was a bubbly, enthusiastic and positive person and on top of all a brilliant teacher. 'She was a friend and a colleague to us. The community is shattered to learn of her death.' The Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust said today it was unable to comment on the case. Workplace: Mrs Cappuccini had taught at Offham Primary School in West Malling for nine years before she dfed . Tribute: The children affectionately called her 'Mrs Coffee' and wrote their own messages after her death .

"Dmitry Kaminskiy is hoping his million dollar gift will trigger a new group of 'supercenternarians' A Moldovan multi-millionaire whose dream it is to live forever has promised to give $1 million to the first person to reach the age of 123. Dmitry Kaminskiy, a senior partner of Hong Kong-based firm, Deep Knowledge Ventures, is hoping his million dollar gift will trigger a new group of 'supercenternarians'. He says research into stem cells, tissue rejuvenation and regenerative medicine will allow people to live beyond 120 - an age that has been quoted as the 'real absolute limit to human lifespan'. 'We live in the most exciting era of human development when technologies become exponential and transformative,' Kaminskiy told DailyMail.com. 'They may not realise it, but some of the supercentenarians alive today may see the dawn of the next century if they live long enough for these transformative technologies to develop. 'I hope that my prize will help some of them desire longer lifespans and make their approaches to living longer a little more competitive.' French born Jeanne Calment currently holds the record, having lived to age 122.5. She died in 1997. Already, a number of supercentenarians are candidates to best Calment's record. The oldest verifiable supercentenarians living now are Jeralean Talley, at 115 years, and Susannah Mushatt Jones, also at 115 years. Both are Americans, and Talley is older by 44 days. In the last few years, major anti-aging companies, such as Google's Calico and J. Craig Venture's new San Diego-based genome sequencing start-up Human Longevity Inc, have launched. Along side this, Billionaires like Larry Ellison, Sergey Brin, Peter Thiel, Paul F. Glenn, and Dmitry Itskov are also funding research into longevity science. One of the oldest supercentenarians living today is Jeralean Talley, at 115 years old. She is pictured here with  a photograph showing her and her late husband Alfred  in her home in Inkster, Michigan . Google has invested in taxi firms, smart thermostats and even artificial intelligence but it is also setting its sights on immortality - or at least increasing our lives five-fold. In an interview with Bloomberg, Google Ventures' president Bill Maris said he thinks it's possible to live to 500 years old. And this will be helped by medical breakthroughs as well as a rise in biomechanics. He has already ploughed money into genetics firms and cancer diagnostic startups and said: 'We have the tools in the life sciences to achieve anything that you have the audacity to envision. I just hope to live long enough not to die.' Mr Maris has advised Aurolab in the development of a hydrophobic acrylic lens for cataract blindness, and helped develop Google’s Calico project. Calico is a research and development company set up in 2013 by Google and Apple to tackle 'ageing and associated diseases.' Google co-founder Larry Page said the project would focus on 'health, wellbeing and longevity' and last September Calico partnered with AbbVie to open a research centre into neurodegeneration and cancer. Although these firms are focused on extending life naturally, there is also a group that believes machines will be the key to extending lives beyond 120 - an age that has been quoted as the 'real absolute limit to human lifespan'. Itskov is the founder of the 2045 Initiative with the goal of helping humans achieve physical immortality within the next three decades. Reuters reported that gerontologist Dr Aubrey de Grey, chief scientist at SENS Research Foundation and Anti-Aging Advisor to the US Transhumanist Party, thinks scientists may be able to control aging in the near future. 'I'd say we have a 50/50 chance of bringing aging under what I'd call a decisive level of medical control within the next 25 years or so,' he said. Kaminskiy is hopeful people will soon start living to 150 years of age with longevity science improving. Studies in stopping and reversing aging in mice have already shown some success, and people around the world are generally living longer all the time. For example, life expectancy hit an all time high of nearly 79 years-old in 2014 in America according to a report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. Additionally, Britain's oldest person, Ethel Lang, just died at the age of 114. She was believed to be the last person living in the UK who was born in the reign of Queen Victoria. Whether Kaminskiy's million dollar prize will encourage people to live longer is still to be seen. But this isn't the first time Kaminskiy has made news with in the longevity field using his resources. At January's JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco, he recently bet Dr Alex  Zhavoronkov, PhD, CEO of anti-aging company Insilico Medicine Inc. for a million dollars in stock who would live beyond 100 years of age. 'We live in the most exciting era of human development when technologies become exponential and transformative,' Kaminskiy told DailyMail.com. 'They may not realise it, but some of the supercentenarians alive today may see the dawn of the next century' 'Longevity competitions may be a great way to combat both psychological and biological aging,' Dr. Zhavoronkov said. 'I hope that we will start a trend.' Zhavorokov thinks longevity science today resembles the computer industry in the 70s or networking in mid-90s. 'Most of the pieces are there,' he said. 'We just need a product or a service to transform the way we live. The revolution in longevity is just around the corner and it is time to seriously engage in the field.' Historically speaking, prizes have made a difference in the way science and culture has evolved, and also in the way people look at the world. The Nobel Prizes, given out in Stockholm, Sweden every year, are perhaps the most famous and coveted of all awards on the planet. At January's JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco, Dmitry Kaminskiy (right) made a bet with Dr Alex Zhavoronkov (left), PhD, CEO of anti-aging company Insilico Medicine Inc. for a million dollars in stock who would live beyond 100 years of age . Scientists and peace activists careers can change overnight by winning the prestigious prize. It's possible the million dollar prize for the longest living person ever on the planet will also evolve into a well-known award. Perhaps other wealthy enthusiasts will step forward to offer new longevity awards after a supercentenarian reaches age 123. Maybe a trend will be set, and new awards for age 135, or even age 150 will be established.","The large prize is being offered by businessman, Dmitry Kaminskiy .

The telemovie will be shown in countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan later in the year, urging asylum seekers not to trust people smugglers . An Immigration Department spokesperson would not clarify whether the government will fully fund the drama. However the spokesperson told Lateline that 'television soap operas and telemovies are proven media to reach the target audience when seeking to deliver complex messages'. 'Each broadcast will be accompanied by a major awareness campaign across television and social media,' the spokesperson said. Producing the show will be Sydney company Put It Out There Pictures. This comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated that only the Coalition would be able to stop asylum seeker boats . Despite the multi-million dollar funding, Phil Glendenning - president of Refugee Council of Australia -  told Lateline that he has doubts the show will discourage people from countries like Afghanistan and Syria. 'A TV show isn't going to stop people who are running from the Taliban,' he said. Mr Glendenning says the government should instead use the funds to help the United Nations High Commission for Refugees give asylum seekers better security. This comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated that only the Coalition would be able to stop asylum seeker boats, the Guardian reports. 'I'm also confident that only this government can keep them stopped because any other government, I suspect, would quickly succumb to the cries of the human rights lawyers and others and what that would mean, very quickly, is that the people smugglers would be back in business,' he said on Thursday.","The Australian government will make a multi-million dollar telemovie .

"Uber driver Emerson Decarvalho allegedly ran down a cyclist after a confrontation in the street . An Uber driver in San Francisco has been charged with assault after ramming into a cyclist who was shouting at him, leaving the biker with several broken bones, police and media reported. The incident occurred in the busy Fisherman's Wharf area of San Francisco when the cyclist rode up to the vehicle, yelled at the driver, banged on his window and pushed in his mirror, police spokesman Carlos Manfredi told AFP. 'During the exchange the cyclist sped up and the vehicle also sped up, striking the back of the bike,' Manfredi said. 'The cyclist sustained a punctured lung, broken ribs and a broken clavicle,' he added. The driver, Emerson Decarvalho, 38, stayed at the scene of the crash and was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after the incident, which took place Sunday afternoon. He was also charged with failing to maintain a three-foot (one meter) space between his car and the cyclist. Uber offered to help in the investigation of the incident. 'Our thoughts are with the victim of this terrible incident. We are gathering more information, have reached out to the San Francisco Police Department and will assist their investigation however we can,' said Uber spokeswoman Kate Downen. Uber said there was no passenger in the vehicle at the time. The San Francisco Chronicle newspaper said the cyclist was knocked unconscious and taken to hospital. Police said it was not clear what provoked the confrontation and said Decarvalho remained in custody. The crash occurred in San Francisco's famous Fishermans Warf area . Manfredi said the altercation took place in one of San Francisco's busiest neighborhoods. 'The location where it occurred is a highly dense area where people go out and a lot of tourists were out and about,' he said. Uber drivers must be 18 years old to join the service must agree to the company's terms and conditions, including agreeing to 'comply with all applicable laws when using the services.' The San Francisco company also requires that drivers do not 'cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage.' About one million Uber trips are carried out daily in 295 cities in 55 countries. The company announced a worldwide code of conduct this year after an Uber driver was charged with rape in India in December. An Uber driver was arrested in Denver this month after he tried to rob the home of a customer he had dropped off at the airport.","Emerson Decarvalho, 38, is charged with assault with a deadly weapon .

"A Mexican cartel boss known as 'The Liquidator' has been detained by the country's authorities, who claim he is 'linked to the bloodiest events ever recorded in Juarez City'. Mexican federal authorities arrested Juarez Cartel boss Jesus Salas Aguayo on Friday, bringing an end to the career of a criminal who was famed for dispatching his enemies with the use of dynamite. Earning the nickname 'The Liquidator' for the brutal and ruthless methods that earned him a place on the DEA's Most Wanted list, Aguayo is charged with multiple felonies including the distribution of narcotics, homicide and arms trafficking. Scroll down for video . Fearsome: Jesus Salas Aguayo, a former gun for hire and Jarez Cartel boss known for his brutal murders of rivals, was arrested on Friday by Mexican police . Mexican authorities link over twenty deaths directly to The Liquidator, including the 2009 murder of a state witness in El Paso, a 2010 car-bombing which claimed the lives of two federal police officers and a 2012 massacre of fifteen people in a Juarez City bar. In 2008 the Sinaloa Cartel declared war on the Juarez Cartel as it sought to take control of Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million people that sits on the border with El Paso, Texas. That year alone saw 1,600 homicides in the city, and Ciudad Juarez City achieved the title of the most dangerous city in the world for three consecutive years. Jesus Aguayo, also known as 'El Chuyín', led the assault on the invading Sinaloa forces, causing the bloodshed of narcos, Mexican authorities and civilians alike. A respected 'sicario' or hired gun, The Liquidator was known to have spoken of his ambitions to one day run his own drug cartel. In 2008 he was hired by the Juarez Cartel bosses, who sent him to Ciudad Juarez to take over command of La Línea (The Line), the cartel's street-level army of assassins, who were notorious for mutilating the bodies of their enemies and civilians alike. The Jaurez Cartel was formerly one of the most feared in Mexico, but is now all but extinct following a war with the Sinoala cartel, and high profile arrests (pictured, boss Ricardo Gracia Urquiza is arrested in 2005) The Juarez Cartel eventually lost the conflict after three murderous years, and today its agents are spread widely across Chihuahua state. Today Juarez City, once a lively and popular border town, shows the scars of a drug war that cost nearly ten thousand lives over the space of four years. Entire districts of the city are deserted, rare are the buildings not marked with bullet holes and there are sections where even the police dare not enter given the narcos' stranglehold on the territory. The arrest of The Liquidator occurred on Friday in his hometown of Villa Ahumada, some 80 miles south of Ciudad Juarez. A gunfight occurred as the task-force moved in to detain Aguayo and his two bodyguards, one of whom was killed in an exchange of fire. Following The Liquidator's detention, federal agents seized a number of items that were in his possession, including 2 SUVs, 4 quad-bikes, a large bag of marijuana, a heavy-duty assault rifle, US$20,000 in cash and some 17 mobile telephones. Danger: Soldiers stand guard atop vehicles along a road where Aguayo was detained last week . Aguayo had been cartel boss for six months before he was captured after taking over from Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, arrested in October last year . Following his arrest, The Liquidators criminal associates fled northwards to the town of Buenaventura and the surrounding region, threatening local people with death if they did not help them in their plight. A number of complaints were made to the police from residents of the town. The Liquidator had only been in the top spot for six months, following the arrest of former Juarez Cartel boss Vicente Carrillo in October of last year. The arrest is expected to put an end to what is an already significantly weakened criminal organisation following its defeat at the hands of Sinaloa. Following a difficult 2014 for the Mexican government – a scandal-filled year topped by the disappearance of 43 students at the hands of local police in Guerrero state - the country's authorities have made a number of drug kingpin arrests. 'This government has neutralised 93 of the total 122 targets that it set out when it came to power', National Security Commissioner Alejandro Rubido told reporters following The Liquidator's arrest. Saturday saw the arrest of another cartel boss, José Tiburcio Hernandez, supposed leader of the Gulf Cartel that operates on the eastern end of the US-Mexico border. His arrest in Reynosa, a town which borders McAllen in Texas saw the sustained attack by over 60 armed criminals in 15 vehicles on the District Attorney's office in the town centre. The criminals laid siege to the building for over three hours without success in an attempt to prevent their leader's extraction to Mexico City, where he and Jesus Aguayo will both be formally charged with drug trafficking, homicide and multiple other felonies this week. The Juarez Cartel, which was founded in 1970, claims to be the first drug cartel to have moved cocaine into the United States by aircraft. The Barrio Azteca gang, which operates in a number of Texas cities including El Paso and Houston is aligned with the Juarez Cartel .","Jesus Salas Aguayo, current leader of the Juarez Cartel, under arrest .

"Since Ellen Degeneres broke the internet with her celebrity selfie at last year's Oscars, taking mobile phone snaps on the red carpet has become a must-do for A list stars. But this year's Cannes Film Festival has been declared a selfie-free zone after organisers asked celebrities to stop taking the 'ridiculous and grotesque' images. While Cannes director Thierry Fremaux admitted that he did not have the powers to ban the pictures altogether, he urged movie starts to resist the temptation. Scroll down for video . Celebrities have been told to stop taking selfies at this year's Cannes Film Festival by director Thierry Fremaux (pictured, models Petra Nemcova, left, and Victoria Bonya and Hofit Golan, right, at last year's event) Mr Fremaux said that the 'ridiculous and grotesque' pictures slowed the entire event down, causing problems for organisers (pictured, Jeremie Renier takes a selfie at the photocall for Saint Laurent last year) The Cannes director blasted celebrities such as Rosario Dawson (left) and Nabilla Benattias (right) who 'stop every two metres to take a picture of themselves, with themselves' Quoted in the Guardian, he said: 'We don't want to prohibit it but it's really a matter of timing. 'We have a certain amount of time to get people across the red carpet and up the steps and it really slows things down if people stop every two metres to take a picture of themselves, with themselves. He added: 'You never look as ugly as you do in a selfie.' Celebrities who will have to watch their selfie-taking at the 68th ceremony include Cate Blanchett, who stars in a film about lesbian love, and Michael Fassbender, who features in a film based on Shakespeare's MacBeth. Matthew McConaughey, Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz and Benicio del Toro will also be welcomed to the French riviera when the event gets underway in a month's time. Mr Fremaux, director of Cannes, said he could not ban the pictures, but said celebrities will be discouraged from taking them . Mr Fremaux today announced 17 films that will be competing for prizes at the May 13-24 festival, chosen from more than 1,800 submissions. Fassbender will star opposite Marion Cotillard star in a film version of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' by Australian director Justin Kurzel. Meanwhile Blanchett stars in Carol, Todd Haynes’s adaptation of a Patricia Highsmith novel about a clandestine lesbian love affair in 1950s New York. Other nominations include Jia Zhangke 'Mountains May Depart,' Paolo Sorrentino's 'Youth' - a film about age starring Michael Caine - and Gus Van Sant's forest feature 'The Sea of Trees'. Returning Cannes veterans include 'Gomorrah' director Matteo Garrone, with 'The Tale of Tales,' starring John C. Reilly and Salma Hayek; South Korea's Kore-eda Hirokazu with sibling saga 'Our Little Sister'; and France's Jacques Audiard with 'Dheepan,' the story of a Tamil refugee in France. Also in the lineup are films by Italy's Nanni Moretti and Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien. Cannes organizers have faced criticism for not selecting more films by female directors, but, or the first time in more than 25 years, this year's festival will be opened by a film by a woman. French director Emmanuelle Bercot's drama 'La Tete Haute' (Head Held High), about a teenager steered away from a life of crime by a judge. Two more female filmmakers are in competition: Valerie Donzelli with 'Marguerite and Julien' and Maiwenn with 'Mon Roi' ('My King'). Both directors are French. Geographically, the entries range from Europe to China, South Korea, the U.S. and Mexico, setting of Denis Villeneuve's narco-crime drama 'Sicario.' Ellen Degeneres set the standard for celebrity selfies at last year's Oscars ceremony when she tweeted this image, which has since be reposted 3.5million times on the social network . Mr Fremaux made the comments at a press conference announcing the films competing in the 68th Cannes festival, which feature stars including Cate Blanchett, Matthew McConaughey and Michael Fassbender . Genres range from drama to martial-arts thriller to science fiction rom-com - in the form of 'The Lobster,' a film by Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos starring Weisz and Colin Farrell. Fremaux said several more films will be added to the competition before the festival opens. Films in the lineup but not competing for prizes include Woody Allen's campus comedy 'Irrational Man,' starring Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix, George Miller's dystopian thriller 'Mad Max: Fury Road' and Asif Kapadia's documentary about the late singer Amy Winehouse, 'Amy.' Pixar, whose buoyant 'Up' opened the festival in 2009, returns with 'Inside Out,' in which an adolescent girl's thoughts and emotions become animated characters. Actress Portman makes her feature-film directorial debut with 'A Tale of Love and Darkness,' based on a memoir by Israeli writer Amos Oz. Winners of the Palme d'Or and other prizes will be chosen by a jury led by directors Joel and Ethan Coen. Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz and Benicio del Toro will be among the other stars welcomed to the French riviera when the festival begins next month .","Thierry Fremaux, director of Cannes, aims to make red carpet selfie-free .

"Johnathan Isaby (pictured), chief executive of the Tax Payers’ Alliance, called the number of communications staff ‘blatant hypocrisy’ Taxpayer money is being used to fund an ‘army’ of spin doctors with more than 3,400 press officers employed by local councils across the UK. The number of communications employees working for local government is more than two times that working across 20 central government departments. London has at least 425 marketing staff and press officers working across its local authorities, four times more than the entire editorial staff at the Evening Standard, the Times reported. Nearly 45 councils employ 20 or more communications staff each, with Manchester City Council the worst offender for its size. It has 77 individuals working for it in PR and similar areas. Leeds city council comes second with 47 staff and Bristol and Sheffield city come joint third. They both employ 43. Glasgow city council and the Kirklees metropolitan borough council in Yorkshire each employed 40 PR officers and individuals in similar fields. The figures were unveiled in a Freedom of Information Act request by Press Gazette to 435 city, district and borough councils to which 405 replied with information about their communications staff.

Johnathan Isaby, the chief executive of the Tax Payers’ Alliance was quoted as saying it was ‘blatant hypocrisy’ for councils to comment so often on the need for necessary saving while keeping on so many staff for communications. He added that the next central government needed to crack down on the ‘army of propagandists’ funded by the taxpayer. He said those footing the bill expected their money to go to front line services not spin doctors.","Taxpayer money used to pay for an 'army' of spin doctors in local areas .

"By her own admission, Michelle O’Clee’s story of heartbreak and deception reads like the plot of a best-selling novel. A devoted wife, she was cruelly duped by her bigamist husband – who explained away his long absences with a web of lies involving secret safe houses, witness protection, police escorts and serious fraud. It was not until pictures of him doing the ice bucket challenge with his new bride were spotted on Facebook that the awful truth emerged. Now, Michelle, 39, has spoken of her shock and anguish at discovering that her husband of six years had been leading a double life. Michelle O'Clee, 39 (pictured), said her bigamist husband's  'extraordinary lies' were like something from a John Grisham thriller.  Andrew O’Clee, 36, secretly moved in  Philippa Campbell, who lived 40 miles away . ‘In my head it was like dominoes – flashbacks of everything and it all made sense,’ she said. 'I went into survival mode. I didn’t know how he was going to act and I thought, “I don’t even know this man”.’ Far from being the loyal husband she believed him to be, Andrew O’Clee, 36, had secretly moved in with finance manager Philippa Campbell, who lived 40 miles away. He went on to marry her in a lavish wedding while Michelle was pregnant with their first child. The bigamist told his first wife he had to leave their home because he was on a witness protection scheme – and even left mid-way through the birth after claiming that police were waiting for him outside. Last week the ex-soldier was jailed for eight months after admitting bigamy. It later emerged he may even have been searching for wife number three after a profile with his name, age, height and location was spotted on a dating website. Michelle told the Sun on Sunday: ‘They were extraordinary lies. It’s like something from a John Grisham book. ‘This was a man I loved and trusted for 14 years. I’d thought he was the perfect husband.’ Andrew O'Clee, 36, (left) was caught out when he was tagged in a video on Facebook with his new spouse Philippa (right).  The video of the ice bucket challenge was captioned ‘uncle Andrew’ and ‘auntie Philippa’ Michelle met O’Clee in 2000 when they were both working at a branch of River Island. They got engaged a year later. Years after, he would present Miss Campbell with an engagement ring identical to the one he gave Michelle. ‘I thought he was a nice, polite, well-mannered guy,’ Michelle said. ‘We were attracted from the start and he was quite flirtatious. Our first date was on Christmas Eve and he proposed a year later. The ring was exactly the same as Philippa’s, platinum with a princess cut diamond and diamonds on each side. He asked me at the same spot where we’d first kissed.’ After years of saving, the couple spent £30,000 on their dream wedding in 2008, including a lavish reception at the Great Conservatory at Syon Park in West London. But starting a family proved a struggle. Michelle finally discovered she was pregnant in June 2013. ‘It was that year he told me about the witness protection programme and he had to move out,’ she said. O’Clee, who worked for business services provider ISS, claimed he was involved in a fraud trial, which meant he had to leave their rented flat in West London to be placed in a ‘safe house’. In reality, he had moved in with Miss Campbell, 40 miles away. O’Clee married second wife Philippa in August 2013 at St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex (pictured). His first wife Michelle was  pregnant at the time, having discovered she was expecting in June 2013 . Michelle opened up about her heartache after finding out that the ex-soldier had presented his new bride with an identical platinum engagement ring. Pictured: The couple's rings posted on Philippa's Facebook page . The pair married in August the same year at St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex. Miss Campbell, 30, who did not know he was already married, is standing by him. O’Clee forged a decree nisi and told friends and family he had divorced Michelle because she had cheated on him. He even abandoned her while she was giving birth to their daughter, Amelia. ‘At the peak of my labour I was holding on to the bed, and he said “I have to go because the police are waiting for me”,’ Michelle added. ‘I said, “Can you not tell them you’re having a baby? You can’t leave me”. But he did. He joked and said, “Hold it in until I get back”.’ Soon afterwards Michelle began to grow suspicious. Her sister Jasmine eventually learned the truth while browsing Facebook last year. She stumbled across the video of the ice bucket challenge – in which people are filmed being drenched in freezing water for charity. It was captioned ‘uncle Andrew’ and ‘auntie Philippa’. Michelle said: ‘My sister saw it on Andrew’s brother’s Facebook page and thought, “Oooh, who is auntie Philippa?”, then it clicked on to her Facebook page and she saw the profile wedding picture. She told my best friend, who told me Andrew was living a double life. I went into a state of shock. Michelle turned to close friend Myleene Klass (right) for support after discovering the truth behind O'Clee's (left) tangled web of deceit. TV presenter Myleene's own marriage to security boss Graham Quinn also failed . ‘He had isolated and cut me off from everybody. I found out he had told his family we had divorced. I didn’t see his family for a year because he told me he had fallen out with his mother and brother.’ Michelle said she felt ‘stupid’ but had no reason to doubt her husband. ‘He is a liar and I had no idea,’ she added. ‘He was always vague. When I look back, I never asked questions, I just carried on.’ After discovering her husband’s lies, Michelle said she immediately turned for help to her friend, the musician and TV presenter Myleene Klass, whose own marriage to security boss Graham Quinn failed. The pair have been friends for 15 years after they performed together in Miss Saigon in the West End. ‘I knew Myleene would be able to help me,’ Michelle added. ‘Not only is she a strong woman but she has had to deal with difficult issues herself. She’s my rock.’","Michelle O'Clee said bigamist husband's lies could be from Grisham thriller .

"Kicked out: Elizabeth Sedway, 51, says Alaska Airlines had her ejected from a flight because she has cancer and lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly . A married mother of two battling cancer has been ejected from an Alaska Airlines flight from Hawaii to California along with her family because she lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly. Elizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane. Mrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been shared nearly 10,000 times as of Tuesday evening. In the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything. Mrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.' Homeward bound: The married mother of three, her husband (right) and their two sons were returning home to California Monday after vacationing in Hawaii when they were kicked off the flight . Caught on camera: Sedway posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane . In Sedway's video, her husband is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats . Brought to tears: As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up . The Sedway family eventually boarded the plane and were awaiting takeoff in their seats when an airline representative came on board and announced that the cancer-stricken passenger could not fly without a note from her doctor. In Sedway's video, her husband dressed in a brightly colored Hawaiian shirt is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats while his wife narrates their removal from the flight. 'All these people are waiting, and I am being removed as if I'm a criminal or contagious because I have cancer,' she says. 'My family is being forcibly removed from an airplane because I have cancer and no note to fly.' As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up. One of the passengers tells the woman, 'God bless you.' In an interview with NBC Bay Area, Elizabeth Sedway said the airline was concerned she might collapse during the eight-hour flight to San Jose, California. After being asked to leave the plane, Mrs Sedway emailed her oncologist in California and he gave her the green light to fly, but she told the local NBC affiliate in a phone interview that the airline was not satisfied and refused to let her re-board. Named and shamed: Sedway shared this photo of Alaska Airline staff at Lihue Airport on her Facebook page, identifying them as the employees whom she had to deal with during the incident . Damage control: Alaska Airlines later apologized to the family for mishandling the situation . The Sedways spent Monday night in a hotel in Maui, for which they were forced to pay out of pocket, and they were scheduled to return home on a Hawaiian Airlines flight Tuesday evening. Elizabeth Sedway lamented on her Facebook page that because of the delay caused by Alaska Airlines, she will miss two chemotherapy sessions, her husband will miss important meetings and her sons will miss school. Earlier today, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told CBS San Francisco that the company apologized to Elizabeth Sedway for the inconvenience and for the way its employees handled the situation. ‘Her family’s tickets have been refunded and we will cover the cost of her family’s overnight accommodations in Lihue,’ Alaska spokeswoman Halley Knigge stated. ‘While our employee had the customer’s well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.’","Elizabeth Sedway, 51, has rare plasma cancer and was returning to California with her husband and two children from Hawaii vacation .

"Richard Williams arriving at Manchester Crown Court ahead of his sentencing earlier today . The self-styled U-boat captain who funded his eccentric and lavish lifestyle with a 'sophisticated' £1million VAT scam was today jailed for more than four years. Fraudster Richard Williams, 54, had spent £50,000 of the cash turning a canal narrowboat into a replica German Second World War submarine with torpedo tubes and a periscope. The Captain Birdseye lookalike was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for a total of four years and eight months after admitting cheating the taxman out of over £1million by reclaiming VAT from three false businesses. His ex-wife Laurel Howarth, 28, was jailed for 20 months for her part in the five-year scam which defrauded Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs of £1,017,505. Judge Michael Murray told Williams: 'This was serious offending. It was carefully thought out, organised and planned over a long period of time. All the indications are that the money was squandered. 'You created three false business and there was no substance to them whatsoever. You submitted false invoice to HMRC with a view to dishonestly reclaiming VAT.' The judge told Howarth that her involvement was 'less culpable' after she had admitted three charges of recklessly filing false VAT returns to HMRC. He said: 'I am satisfied that you might have been coerced into committing some, if not all, of the offences. But you have pleaded guilty and have had the benefit of the payments over several years.' The hearing was yesterday told by Dominic Thomas, defending Williams, that Williams had blown the cash on 'a dissipated and nomadic lifestyle - travelling around marinas, buying boats, drinking champagne and generally behaving stupidly and recklessly'. A previous hearing had been told that  Williams had indulged his passion for boats by building the replica sub on which he had posed in a captain's uniform. He had also paid for a private jet to take him and his wife  to Paris to buy bespoke wallpaper and had converted the lounge of their home in Blackpool, Lancashire into a copy of the Oval Office in the White House. The scam was thwarted by VAT inspectors who raided his 'submarine' when it was moored outside the Royal Armouries in Leeds. Six months earlier he had been spotted on a canal in Liverpool dressed as a German submarine commander. All aboard: Captain Birdseye lookalike Richard Williams on the narrowboat he spent £50,000 on to convert into a German submarine. The 54-year-old, real name Steven Howarth, blew proceeds of a £1million VAT fraud . An unusual sight: Williams became notorious on the canal system around Yorkshire and Lancashire after  kitting out his replica German U-boat with torpedo tubes and periscope, and posing in a captain’s uniform . Prosecutor Richard Orme said Williams and his partner Howarth submitted invoices reclaiming VAT on specialist disability beds in the five-year fraud between 2005 and 2010. He had set up three companies called Sleepability, Ortho-matic and Discount Mobility Store and submitted false invoices to claim back VAT from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. He was paid £343,549 for Sleepability claims, £416,700 for Ortho-matic claims and £257,255 for Discount Mobility Store claims. The total amount came to £1,017,505. Mr Orme told Judge Michael Murray: 'He set up businesses purporting to sell beds to the disabled, such sales being zero rated for VAT, whereas in fact no sales took place. In court: Alongside Williams (right) in the dock yesterday was his former teenage bride, Lauren Howarth (left). Both were jailed today, Williams for more than four years and Howarth for 20 months . 'There were no purchases and no sales and the only business Richard Williams was involved in was the manufacturing of false invoices and careful managing of the credits and debits to and from banks accounts to give an air of legitimacy to the fraud and avoid the scrutiny of VAT inspectors.' Mr Orme said Williams had used the identity of Richard Williams from a fellow boating enthusiast and had used his date of birth and National Insurance number to change his name by deed to Captain Richard Williams from his original name of Steven Howarth. Speaking ahead of an earlier hearing, Williams said: ‘In five years we never sold one bed. We made a fortune but got caught, and I will take the punishment. We went all over the world like a couple who had won the National Lottery. We had a great time – now I’ll do the time.’","Captain Birdseye lookalike Richard Williams spent £50,000 on his U-boat .

"An overweight mother-of-four has become a successful fitness model at the age of 41 after shrinking five dress sizes. Maria Twomey, 42, of Watford, became a bikini competitor after swapping takeaways and fatty snacks for weight-lifting and intense workouts on the exercise bike. She has now left behind her job in nursing and has joined the ranks of professional fitness models, hitting the gym for three hours a day. Scroll down for video . Maria with Sean before she lost weight (l) and winning second place in the Miami Pro modelling comp (r) She discovered she was able to lift weights and complete high-energy sprints on an exercise bike . She said: 'I've had an incredible ""mum makeover"". I want other women to realise that you're never too old to completely change your life around - all it takes is some hard work.' Maria, who is married to Sean Twomey, 49, a dental technician, saw her weight increase while she was raising their children Jake, now 20, Conor, 17, Liam, 14, and Kaine, ten. She said: 'After having children, watching my figure was the very last thing on my mind. I put all my energy into dashing around after my kids instead. 'Sean and I fell into the habit of treating ourselves with takeaways. 'It wasn't that we were dramatically over-eating, but we let ourselves fall into a pattern of inactivity, and eventually I began to notice that my outfits were getting tighter and tighter.' By the time she reached her 40th birthday in the autumn of 2013, Maria was tipping the scales at 12st 7lb and was wearing size 14 clothes. She eventually slimmed to her lowest weight of 8st 7lb, and reduced her body fat percentage from 38 per cent to 15 per cent. Maria before with husband Sean and children (l-r) Jake, now 20, Conor, 17, Liam, 14, and Kaine, 10 . Maria, just before her weight loss, found that fitting seatbelts was getting more and more uncomfortable . She said: 'It was still a massive shock for me - it was the heaviest I'd ever been. 'Fitting seatbelts around me was getting more and more uncomfortable. Before too long all I could think about what how overweight I was. 'I'd pop down the gym every so often, but I'd never really exerted myself. I realised that if I was serious about losing weight and getting back in shape, I would need to have someone spurring me on, so I signed up for a series of personal training sessions. At first, even jogging on the spot left me absolutely breathless.' As the weeks wore on, Maria found her fitness increasing and although the weight loss was not immediately obvious, she discovered she was able to lift weights and complete high-energy sprints on an exercise bike. After she discovered personal training her fitness increased, and although the weight loss was not immediate . Eventually her personal trainer, who had willed her on from the start, said he had bigger plans and suggested she take part in a fitness modelling competition . She says her transformation has completely changed her life . She also completely changed her diet in a bid to trim down. Before her weight loss she typically ate a fried egg on toast for breakfast, followed by cheese and mayonnaise sandwiches for lunch, with a large jacket potato with cheese and beans for her evening meal. She would snack on Twix bars, crisps and fizzy drinks throughout the day. Her new diet saw her eat poached eggs for breakfast, lean chicken with sweet potato for lunch, and lean steak with salad for her evening meal. She snacked on portions of nuts throughout the day, and was careful to drink plenty of water. She said: 'In a year I lost four stone. I was so proud of myself. 'I'd set out to feel happy in my own body again, and I'd definitely achieved that. I was content to continue to maintain my slimmer figure, but my personal trainer, who had willed me on from the start, said he had bigger plans and suggested I take part in a fitness modelling competition.' Competitive fitness modelling challenges participants to tone their bodies and perform in exhibitions where they are judged on their physique and stage presence. After being encouraged by her family and friends, Maria took part in her first amateur competition, the Miami Pro in St Albans, in October 2014.

She said: 'I was 41 and stepping on to a stage to pose for the first time in my life in a size six bikini. 'As confidence boosters go, it was hard to beat, and I was amazed when I was announced as the runner-up.' 'Reaching second place qualified me to compete in a professional category. Athletes train for years to reach that level, so I felt incredibly lucky.' Maria is will take part in her second competition on Sunday April 19 at the Miami Pro World Championships in St Albans. She is using the exposure gained from competing to launch a career as a personal trainer. She said: 'My transformation has completely changed my life. I have hopes for a new career, and my relationship with my family has got even better. 'I'm a calmer, more balanced person. I feel like I'm a better mum to my kids because I have more confidence and energy.

"NHS bosses have today come under fire after it emerged a hospital paid a temporary nurse £2,200 to cover a single 12-hour shift. The figure, which equates to £183 an hour, was paid by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. It represents double the rate for a neurologist and was revealed following a Freedom of Information request. It also emerged there were 47 agency nurses working at the trust in December last year. The trust, which runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, has been criticised for wasting taxpayers' money. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust paid £2,200 to a temporary nurse for one 12-hour shift to help amid a shortage of trained nurses, a Freedom of Information request revealed (file picture) Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be aghast at the cost of just one shift. 'Agency nurses are far more expensive than their regular counterparts and we have to minimise the number used. 'You can't open a newspaper without hearing how tight finances are in the NHS, but the service has to become far more efficient with the money it already has.' Edmund Stubbs, from independent think tank Civitas, added: 'It is evident that a lack of staff is leading to excessive spending on agency staff, locums and overseas recruitment.' A spokesman for the trust said the £2,200 figure includes VAT, adding that the true figure paid to the nurse, including travel expenses, was £1,864. The shift covered was one in specialist Intensive Therapy Unit on a Bank Holiday. Defending their spending, Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She highlighted their situation is one shared by many hospitals across the UK. She added: 'We have said consistently that we want to recruit more nurses to reduce our reliance on agency and temporary staff and this has been widely publicised with a number of recruitment events taking place recently to attract new staff. 'We have recruited, or made offers to, more than 150 staff nurses and health care assistants in recent months as part of our efforts to recruit more nursing staff to support our wards and departments. Defending the spend Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at the trust, said temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She said in recent months the hospitals have recruited more than 150 nurses and healthcare assistants . 'These new recruits have included a number who have been offered positions through a successful nursing recruitment event at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital just last week, which we will repeat again on Thursday. 'We’ll continue our efforts to ensure that over the coming months we will see fewer agency nurses on our wards as our new starters get settled in, which will mean better continuity of care and more support for ward teams.' Figures obtained by the Nursing and Midwifery Council also revealed nearly a third of nursing recruits in the UK had to be sought abroad last year. NHS spending on temporary staff has rocketed to a staggering £2.5 billion a year because of a chronic shortage of British nurses. The number of foreign nurses and midwives registered in the past 12 months grew to 8,200, up from just 6,200 a year earlier. Around 7,500 came from the EU - particularly Spain, Italy and Portugal - with others came from further afield, including the Philippines. It also emerged that 29 per cent of new nurses were recruited from abroad in the past 12 months, compared to 11 per cent five years ago.","Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust paid the huge figure .

"No shame: Child rapist Arman Nejad grinning after his arrest in 2013 - he was free for several years after the attack because of a bungled police investigation and was jailed for five years on Friday . A grinning child rapist able to live streets away from his victim for years afterwards because of a bungled police investigation has finally been jailed for five years. Arman Nejad, 23, dragged the teenager into his house and abused her in October 2009 as she walked to a youth club in Moss Side, Manchester. The girl, now 18, eventually went to police in February 2010 and was interviewed by officers who then mysteriously dropped the case. Three years later police visited her about a different matter and she asked why her rape case was shelved, and detectives then arrested and charged Nejad with rape. Today Greater Manchester Police admitted 'unacceptable delays and failures' allowed the rapist to live as a free man just streets away from the girl he attacked. She has made a formal complaint about the conduct of the officers involved, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission is aware of the case, which will be investigated internally. Superintendent Simon Retford, from GMP's Professional Standards Branch, said: 'There were unacceptable delays in bringing the case to court after the initial complaint was made. 'The victim received a service that I believe fell below the level which we strive to offer to victims of rape and other sexual abuse. 'An investigation is underway to establish the reasons and circumstances around our initial response and apparent lack of action in progressing this case.' In October 2009, the victim was walking along Caythorpe Street, Moss Side with her friends and all were making their way to a nearby youth club. Nejad called the girl over his house on false pretences, separating her from her friends. Crime scene: The victim was walking to her local youth club when Nejad dragged her into his house in Caythorpe Street, Moss Side, pictured, and raped her . Once her friends had walked out of view he dragged her into the house and raped her. Last year it emerged that Greater Manchester Police faced ten investigations into alleged mishandling of sexual assault and rape cases. One included a claim that a vulnerable child was able to enter the home of a suspected paedophile, who was already under surveillance. In 2013, the same year Nejad was finally arrested, GMP chief constable Sir Peter Fahy admitted that six out of every ten crimes were not properly investigated. Greater Manchester's officers only 'actively pursue' criminals in 40 per cent of cases reported to them, he said, with detectives effectively shelving or 'screening out' the rest because there are no witnesses or clues. It meant that more than 106,000 crimes in Greater Manchester were all but given up by the force as lost causes. Today the force said that it takes sexual abuse seriously. Probe: Greater Manchester Police is investigating why the case was initially shelved after a complaint from the victim . Detective Inspector Debbie Oakes, from GMP's Phoenix Protect Team, said: 'Greater Manchester Police's Protect Team was first made aware of Arman Nejad's appalling crimes in 2013. 'As a result, a full and thorough investigation was completed that resulted in this matter being brought to court and which aided in bringing Arman Nejad to justice. 'While the Force absolutely accepts the failures in this case, we should also stress that the work of Protect and the Phoenix partnership over the last few years that has made huge strides towards protecting vulnerable people who are at risk of child sexual exploitation (CSE). 'Working with our partner agencies, we can make use of legislation at our disposal to disrupt premises where we suspect CSE may be taking place, shut those premises down and also arrest and investigate suspects so we can put them before the courts, as we have done with Arman Nejad. 'With the launch of the 'It's not Okay' campaign we are increasing public awareness of how to protect children at risk by increasing people's understanding of child sexual exploitation and how to spot the warning signs of CSE. 'Together, we will continue to tackle CSE and continue to pursue people like Arman Nejad and expose them for the criminals they really are'.","Arman Nejad, 24, dragged girl into his house and raped her in October 2009 .

"The family of a murdered mother have spoken of their fury after it was revealed that she tried to call 999 hours before she was killed but call handlers failed to alert police. Karen Catherall, 45, was viciously beaten and strangled to death by Darren Jeffreys, who she met only weeks earlier on dating site Plenty of Fish. The pair had been drinking at the pub before she returned to her home in Gwernaffield near Mold, Flintshire, North Wales, when Jeffreys, 47, followed and attacked in an alcohol-fuelled rage. Scroll down for video . Karen Catherall, 45, (right) was brutally murdered by Darren Jefferys (left) who she met on a dating site just weeks before her death. He was jailed for a minimum of 17 and a half years in February . He only called paramedics the following morning and claimed he thought Ms Catherall was sleeping, but later admitted murder and was jailed for life in February. Police have since told the family that the mother-of-two made a 999 call from her mobile just after she returned from the pub, which went through to BT to deal with. Operators at the telecommunications company connects both mobile and landline numbers with the requested emergency service and follow strict protocol. But when Ms Catherall called on September 13, last year, the call handler said they could not hear anything and therefore did not connect the call to the police or send help. Her mother, Glenys Keir, 74, and sister Lorraine Humphreys, 49, have slammed BT for not taking action at the time which they claim could have saved their sister. However, BT says its handlers acted appropriately and in line with police guidance not to pass on calls where there is 'nothing to indicate there is any problem'. Mrs Keir said: 'When we found out Karen had been murdered our whole world fell apart. 'But as we were starting to come to terms with it all, to then hear that a 999 call had been made from her mobile the night she died, it stirred up all of those emotions we had felt when we first found out Karen had been killed. Her family (mother, Glenys Keir, left, and sister, Lorraine Humphreys, right) were told by police that she had tried to make a 999 call just hours before her murder but the call was ended when operated got no response . Ms Catherall (left) had been drinking in the pub with Jeffreys (right) when he followed her home on September 13, last year. He didn't call paramedics until the following morning, claiming he thought she was asleep . 'It left us feeling sick to the stomach, devastated and fuming, knowing no one was there for Karen when she needed help. 'If they had got to her in time Karen might still be alive. She could have been here today. Now we'll always wonder if that may have been possible.' Police confirmed a 999 call was made from her mobile phone to BT  at around 7pm but it was disconnected after around 13 seconds and officers were not informed. Glenys Kier and her partner Esmor Evans leaving Mold Crown Court following the trial of their daughter's killer, Darren Jeffreys . The phone call was later enhanced by detectives, who discovered arguing could be heard in the background. Ms Catherall's family are calling on BT to review their procedures, and answer questions about the call. Mrs Keir said: 'Apparently the person who picked up believed there was silence at the end of the line. They must have assumed 999 had been dialled accidentally. 'It doesn't bear thinking about what might have happened if BT had connected the call to the police.' Ms Catherall's sister, Mrs Humphreys, a catering supervisor, added: 'You regularly hear of toddlers playing with their mum's mobile phone and ringing the emergency services by mistake. 'In those instances, the police often seem to trace the call and turn up on the doorstep. 'We want to know why that didn't happen when in this situation Karen so desperately needed their help. 'We know the police aren't to blame as they never received the call, but BT should be looking into this and reviewing their policies. 'The call might have been muffled or quiet at the other end of the line, but surely it's better to put it through to the police so they can send an officer and be safe rather than sorry. 'Who knows what the outcome might have been if they had reached her in time? We don't want any other families to lose a loved one and go through the pain we have.' A BT spokesman said: 'North Wales Police contacted BT on September 24, 2014 about whether we received an emergency call from a mobile phone number and we provided them with full details including a call recording. 'Our records show that we received the call at approximately 19.07 on September 13, 2014. 'There was no response to our operator's questioning and our operator heard nothing to indicate there was any problem before the caller ended the call after about 13 seconds. 'Police forces have requested that we do not connect such calls to them and our operator correctly followed the call handling process requested by the police.' Ms Catherall's family (pictured outside court) are calling on BT to review their procedures following the call . The 999 emergency number was set up in London in June 1937 after five women were killed in a fire. A committee discussed how telephone operators could identify emergency calls and the easy to remember 999 number was born. It was later rolled out in Glasgow and extended to all major towns and cities by 1948. Since then it has expanded massively with an average of 597,000 calls a week across the UK. BT operators answer the initial call from both landlines and mobiles and find out which emergency service is required before connecting the caller. The handler has to quickly establish whether the call is genuine before transferring them. In instances where they are met with silence they ask the caller to respond by either making a noise or coughing. This can narrow down the number of accidental or prank calls made, which account for about half of the 31 million calls made annually. Of the remaining 15.5million, 52 per cent go to police, 41 per cent to ambulance service, six per cent for fire and one per cent to the coastguard and cave and mountain rescue services. The spokesman also explained that in cases where they get no response from the caller, the operator will ask whether they can make a noise or cough. In this instance Ms Catherall apparently made no response and the phone call was terminated. Detective Inspector Mark Hughes, senior investigating officer at North Wales Police, confirmed the call. He said: 'During the early evening of September 13, 2014, a 999 call was made from the mobile phone of Karen Catherall. 'The phone call was received by the telephone company operator and managed in accordance with their policy but not directed onto North Wales Police, nor in fact any police force. 'I understand the circumstances surrounding the management of this phone call are now being reviewed by the Telephone Company following a request by Karen's family.' It was not until the early hours of the following morning, at 2.35am, that Jeffeys called emergency services, claiming that he thought she was sleeping off the alcohol and he was unable to wake her. But paramedics who arrived at the house found she had been dead for some time and there was also evidence he had tried to cover up the killing, Mold Crown Court was told. A post mortem examination revealed that her cause of death had been blunt force trauma to the head and asphyxiation. Jeffreys had denied killing his girlfriend when interviewed by police, but in December last year admitted the murder. Mr Justice Wyn Williams, hearing the case, said Jeffreys subjected Ms Catherall 'to a ferocious, sustained and in the end deadly attack'. He was sentenced to a minimum of 17 and a half years in prison.","Karen Catherall, 45, was beaten and strangled to death by Darren Jefferys .

"Jamelia has today responded to the furious backlash she is facing after saying that obese women 'should feel uncomfortable' about their unhealthy size, and that high street stores should not be catering for them. The Loose Women panellist said she was 'hounded on Twitter' after airing her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers, and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20. 'Of course I don't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops,' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon. 'I was referring to extreme sizing, I was referring to health and how we should all participate in helping our youngsters to live healthier lifestyles.' Scroll down for video . The Loose Women panellist said she was 'hounded on Twitter' after airing her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers, and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20 . Jamelia admitted she had found the anger directed towards her following her comments 'really difficult.' She said: 'Some of the things that have been printed I have actually said but not in that context... It's difficult to say your piece or to speak honestly when it kind of gets misconstrued in that way.' Jamelia's co-panellists were quick to leap to her defence. Ruth Langsford, 55, stated: 'I definitely, categorically said we're not talking about size 14, 16 or even 18.' Janet Street Porter, 68, then said: 'I was completely in agreement with Jamelia and I said you've got to ask yourself if a young girl is already size 20-25, can she run around with her children, can she enjoy life or is she storing up health problems for later? 'So I do feel like Jamelia has been somewhat unfairly picked on.' 'Of course I don't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops,' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon (pictured). 'I was referring to extreme sizing' Jamelia's co-panellists, Ruth Langford (left), Coleen Nolan (center left) and Janet Street Porter (right) were quick to leap to her defence . Earlier today, Jamelia appeared on Good Morning Britain to say that she was sorry for upsetting people. 'I didn’t make it clear on the show that I was talking about extremes, I was talking about above size 20 and below size six, those sizes being available en masse,' she said. 'Knowing that I offended people really upset me. Knowing that I made people question themselves and their choices, it really did upset me. All I can do is apologise for that.' But the star added: 'I do stand by what I said. I’m a real woman with real opinions. I get paid to voice my opinions. Social media users weighed in on Twitter, telling Jamelia to 'keep it shut' and accusing the singer of 'stirring up hatred' on the topic . Appearing on Good Morning Britain earlier today, Jamelia,  pictured with GMB presenters Kate Garraway and Susanna Reid, said she still stood by her remarks . Jamelia said of the reaction: 'It’s been absolutely awful but this is my job. I believe we are all entitled to our opinion. 'I genuinely love people and believe everyone has the right to feel wonderful and feel beautiful and it was never my intention to make people feel any less than what they are.' Speaking on Loose Women yesterday, in the conversation which sparked the controversy, Jamelia said: 'I do not think it's right to facilitate people living an unhealthy lifestyle, in the same way I don't believe that a size zero should be available - it's not a healthy size for an average woman to be.' The star also argued that clothing shouldn't be sold in a size zero either, because that too is 'unhealthy' Jamelia first response to yesterday's Twitter backlash was a quote (pictured) Jamelia, who also claimed she was 'all for celebrating people as they are', added: 'I don't believe they [high street stores] should be providing clothes for below that range or above that range. 'Yes, have specialist shops, but you should feel uncomfortable if you are unhealthy... to be available in every High Street store, I don't think that's right.' Viewers were were enraged by her comments and vented on Twitter, with many declaring she should be 'sacked' from the show, and not a single user taking her side. 'I'm so disappointed with Jamelia's comments on Loose Women today. WE. ARE. NOT. PROMOTING. UNHEALTHY.LIFESTYLES. #PlusSizeDebate,' wrote one. On Monday, Jamelia showed her support for a new Good Morning Britain campaign dubbed #SelfieEsteem, which asks people to snap a first-take selfie and share it unfiltered (pictured) Viewers were quick to criticise the former singer's comments on Twitter . One asked Jamelia directly what 'large girls' are supposed to wear, if not clothes . Other fans said they were 'disappointed' with the singer's comments . 'Ah Jamelia.

"The parents of a terminally ill boy have fulfilled his dying wish by getting married at his bedside in hospital. Corey Edwards, from Teignmouth, Devon more than anything wanted to see his parents Craig, 28, and Jemma, 21, tie the knot. The five-year-old was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart defect at the age of seven months and since then has undergone eight open-heart operations and other treatments. Jemma and Craig Edwards listen to their wedding vows during their marriage at Bristol Children's Hospital . Corey Edwards' job was to hold the rings for his parents during the marriage ceremony . The five-year-old is suffering from a terminal congenital heart defect and had often asked his parents why they were not married . Corey has been on the paediatric intensive care unit at Bristol Children's Hospital since January and when doctors gave his parents the devastating news that he may not live much longer, Mr and Mrs Edwards decided to get married. They had been engaged for three years but plans to tie the knot were put on hold due to the birth of their daughters, two-year-old Isabelle and six-month-old Caitlyn, and Corey's ill health. When they learnt of their son's wish, they felt there was no time like the present and, with the help of staff and friends made at the hospital, they were able to organise the whole service within 48 hours. They made history when they became the first couple to marry at the hospital but had to get special permission from the Archbishop of Canterbury. The law allows couples to marry in hospital if one of them is desperately ill and that did not apply in this case. But a law dating back to Henry VIII gives the Archbishop of Canterbury special dispensation to allow weddings in hospital for 'pastoral reasons'. Mr Edwards, a council worker, said: 'A couple of weeks ago we were told they didn't think he would go home. We keep hoping that he will but it just looks less likely each day. 'When we knew Corey's wishes, everyone on the paediatric intensive care unit and Ward 32, including staff and friends, got together to help us. The Edwards had been engaged for three years but decided to fast track their wedding when they discovered their son Corey may not live much longer . 'We both planned to get married years ago but decided we wouldn't get married without Corey there, so the only way we could do it was in hospital. 'He's asked quite a few times why we are not married, so we thought we would make it a special day and cheer him up a bit. 'The Bishop of Bristol had to write to the Archbishop of Canterbury to get special permission for us to marry in the hospital and we are so grateful he agreed. 'When we got the go-ahead, we only had a matter of days to plan. We rushed into town to buy a dress and suit and made do with our engagement rings as wedding rings. 'We couldn't believe the generosity of all those involved. One nurse helped to do Jemma's hair, whilst another two members of staff made the cake and iced it. 'Chairs were pulled together to form an aisle and decorations were put up to make it feel like a wedding venue. 'We were married by the hospital's chaplain, Rev Stephen Oram, who was very excited to be sharing this occasion with us. 'However, the most important thing for us was having our son Corey at our side, holding the rings and wearing his suit. 'We couldn't have been more proud of him. We were also incredibly lucky to have our daughters there and the support of so many.' Mr Edwards added: 'It turned into a really, really amazing day and Corey was so proud. He looked very handsome. I think he really enjoyed it, which was the main thing. 'Getting married is usually the bride and groom's special day, which it was, but it's more Corey's special day because he is such a special boy. 'It was nice to share our special day with the people who have helped us enjoy Corey's short life. It has got to the point where there isn't more they can do now, which is obviously very hard. 'Instead of being at his bedside crying the whole time at least on that one day we had a real special day. We know he was happy that day. 'When he's home and well you wouldn't know he is a cardiac patient. He's happy, running around and loves to play.' William Booth, the paediatric intensive care unit matron, said: 'It was a privilege to share Craig and Jemma's special day with their children Corey, Isabelle and Caitlyn, family and friends. 'The whole hospital was abuzz with excitement and one of the nurses made and iced a cake, others brought in flowers and gifts for the newlyweds. 'Lots of the nursing and medical teams involved in Corey's care came in over the Easter break to share this special occasion with them all.' Pictured front from left to right on the wedding day is Corey Edwards and his sisters Isabelle and Caitlyn. Across the back is their mother Jemma, Reverend Stephen Oram and their father Craig Edwards . Rev Oram said: 'Henry VIII gave the then Archbishop of Canterbury this special power to by-pass the law. 'It was that ancient law from several hundred years ago that was enacted allowing Mr and Mrs Edwards to get married. It meant a little bit of paperwork to fill out but we were able to get that done in 48 hours. 'It was very emotional and it was emotional for many reasons. The family and the ward knew how special this was for them and it was fulfilling the wish of a dying child. 'It was also emotional because we knew the outcome for poor Corey isn't going to be a good outcome and everyone was just aware of the specialness of the day for Mr and Mrs Edwards and Corey.' The newlyweds spent their wedding night at their son's bedside and later returned to the Ronald McDonald House where they are staying whilst Corey is in hospital. Mr Edwards said: 'It may not have been the day we had initially planned in our heads but it didn't matter to us. 'To have our son there meant more than anything and it will be a day we will never forget. We can't thank the staff enough for what they have done for us and Corey and we would like them to know how much we appreciate their hard work and dedication.'

The bat has been grounded by the debilitating disease and spends his time lying around in hammocks, sipping on tea and eating snacks. Scroll down for video . Walter the bat (pictured) who is suffering from arthritis has found an unusual cure for his pain by sipping on a mug of tea . However, while Walter may prefer a mug of tea instead of a mug of blood, he drinks only purpose-made tea. Since Walter acquired the unusual taste, all of the other 25 bats in his aviary have also began drinking the beverage, which has been nicknamed 'a hug in a cup'. Aviary owner Mandi Griffith said  she makes two cups of tea in the morning, one for her and one for her bats. 'Now I love my bats, but not so much that I left them slobber in my cuppa,' she said. 'To keep everybody happy, I'd make myself a morning tea, and a second one for the bats. Walter the 22-year-old grey-headed flying fox bat, from Sydney, picked up his bizarre taste after sneaking a slurp out of his owner's cup of Tetley's tea . Mandi said Walter lives a life of leisure and likes to flap around in her hand in the sun, pretending he can fly. 'While he can hang as a normal bat would, his arthritic limbs are suited to a soft hammock so he totters around the aviary from one hammock to another, snacking on treats on the way,' Mandi said. 'He also sits on my hand and I walk him around the garden so he can flap his wings in the sun and pretend he's flying.' Walter's owner said he is a 'gentle soul' and was handed to her so he could live out his final years in 'gentle retirement with other bats in a similar circumstance.' Since Walter acquired the unusual taste, all of the other 25 bats in his aviary have also began drinking the beverage, which has been nicknamed 'a hug in a cup' A video of Walter sipping from a cup of tea, posted by fellow bat-loving aviary volunteer Megan Churches, has garnered over 10,000 views after being posted online at the beginning of March. 'Walter doesn't get tea every day but he likes it. He's old. It can't hurt him to have something he loves - so he gets it whenever,' 58-year-old Megan said. Megan said she likes to record the day to day activities of the bats in the aviary and has a lot of fun with the flying creatures. 'Today, one of the bats grabbed my sunglasses, had a munch on them and played with them before fending off another bat who wanted them, then they both dropped them on the floor of the aviary,' she said. The bat has been grounded by the debilitating disease and spends his time lying around in hammocks, sipping on tea and eating snacks . 'That's the stuff I like to record.'

"Few people can fail be wowed by technicolor butterfly wings that 'sparkle' in the sunlight. And now a photographer has captured the finer details of these iridescent insects in stunning clarity, including the rainbow scales of their delicate wings. Some look like exotic bird feathers and colourful ribbon, while others resemble jagged autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges. Scroll down for video . These stunning pictures show the finer details of a butterfly's wing in stunning clarity, including their rainbow scales. As well as the beautiful colours, they show the layout of individual scales, which give the insect its iridescence. This image shows the wing of a sunset moth . The photos were shot by Linden Gledhill from Staffordshire, who combines his love of photography with a PhD in biochemistry. The 51-year-old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects’ scale-covered wings. Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their Greek order name of Lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings. Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye-catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail . The tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the Eastern tiger swallowtail (stock image). It is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern North America and is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern US, where it is common in many different habitats . Each scale of a butterfly is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye-catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence (pictured) are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments. A Papilio blumei fruhstorferi wing is shown . The brighter colours on some butterflies are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales, such as these jagged examples, which are Papilio ulysees butterfly scales. In fact, each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air, so when light hits them it's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly species . The brighter colours are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales, which are layered in different patterns on top of each other. In fact, each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air, so when light hits them it's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly species. Some butterflies even reflect ultraviolet light, which is unable to be seen by humans. The ability of Monarch butterflies to detect ultraviolet light helps them on their annual migration from North America to Mexico, for example. Mr Gledhill said: 'I've always taken macro photographs of insects, moths and butterflies. I have a lifelong interest in exploring the world beyond what the unaided human eye can see. ‘This led me to use research quality microscopes and combining the two skills.’ He uses a trinocular-reflecting light microscope fitted with Neo S-plan objectives, or attachments, and takes the photographs using a Canon EOS 5D mark II, which is fitted to the top of the microscope. The microscope has also been modified by adding a StackShot stepping motor and controller to drive the focusing control, meaning very small steps can be made in the focusing stage. Mr Gledhill said: 'I've always taken macro photographs of insects, moths and butterflies. I have a lifelong interest in exploring the world beyond what the unaided human eye can see.' This close-up image shows scales on the wings of the monarch butterfly . Mr Gledhill imaged the Madagascan sunset moth's wings in minute detail. The moth (pictured left) flies during the day and is considered one of the most impressive and appealing-looking lepidopterans. He also captured the wings of the monarch butterfly (stock image shown right), which is the most familiar North American butterfly species . He uses a trinocular-reflecting light microscope fitted with Neo S-plan objectives, or attachments, and takes the photographs using a Canon EOS 5D mark II. This camera is fitted to the top of the microscope. Overlapping pale blue scales are pictured . The depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image, so Mr Gledhill takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures. These images are then combined into a single imaging using focus stacking software, resulting in pictures that are sharp and in full focus. 'The pictures are stunningly beautiful and they make me realise how lucky I am to be able to capture the intricate structure of butterflies,’ Mr Gledhill continued. 'Often people think they are fabric and appear very surprised when they find out they are the scales which look like dust which they remember experiencing when they touched a butterfly as a child.' The depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image, so Mr Gledhill takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures, before carefully combining the shots. This image shows the wing of Salamis parhassus - known as the 'forest mother of pearl - a butterfly that lives in forests in Africa .","The stunning photos of the butterfly wings were taken by 51-year-old Linden Gledhill from Staffordshire .
He used a trinocular-reflecting light microscope with a Canon EOS 5D mark II camera is fitted to the top .
Images include close-up shots of the peacock swallowtail, a sunset moth and the mother of pearl butterfly ."
"We're all guilty of it but there are some who do it more often than others. Experts say snacking is an important way to control hunger; and while we would like to think we reach for something healthy like carrot sticks, raisins or a handful of almonds, more often than not it's salty crisps, sweet biscuits or cheap chocolate that we tend to munch on. But why exactly do we snack? And if we knew what the triggers were, would we be able to stop ourselves from reaching for unhealthy foods? Scroll down for video . We're all guilty of snacking, but there are some who do it more often than others . Femail has worked with dietitian Lucy Jones from The Almond Board of California to study snacking habits in the UK and identified three tribes of snackers: Snack Amnesiacs, Situational Snackers and Super Snackers. Ms Jones's research has revealed the habits which lead us to nibble needlessly, identifying the behaviours and reasons behind these three distinct snack tribes: . Ms Jones told Femail: 'Snack Amnesiacs are mindless munchers who subconsciously snack, opening something and eating far more than they intended. 'More often than not, these snackers have no concept of what or how much they are eating. According to Ms Jones, those who are stressed out due to environmental or emotional pressures are Situational Snackers. This tribe often have busy schedules which causes them to skip meals. Then there are the Super Snackers. 'They are the snack savvy, who recognise energy lows and tummy grumbles and plan ahead. This tribe only nibble sensibly, as and when their body tells them to,' Ms Jones said. Ms Jones is encouraging women to revamp their snacking habits by trying the 21 Day Snack Happy challenge: a simply snack on a handful of almonds once a day for 21 days. 'Snacking is important to help control hunger and provide essential nutrients. We all lead such busy lives and juggle a variety of tasks and commitments every day, often resulting in long gaps between meals. 'The Snack Happy Challenge works well because 21 days is the length of time it takes to form a habit, or swap a bad habit for a good one. Planning ahead and arming yourself with a handful of almonds will really help to get you through the day.' 'As a high source of fibre and containing 15 essential nutrients, almonds are the perfect snack you can feel good about,' she said. Take our quiz to find out just what sort of snacker you are and how to change your bad habits. 1. Do you ever find yourself picking up food for comfort? If you answered yes go to Question 3. If you answered no go to Question 2. 2. Do you feel like you are aware of your snacking habits? If you answered yes go to Question 5. If you answered no go to Question 4. 3. Do you often find yourself reaching for whatever foods are nearest to hand in order to keep your hunger pangs at bay? If you answered yes go to Question 6. If you answered no go to Question 4. 4. Do you regularly plan out your nutrient intake in advance, even on busy days? If you answered yes go to Question 8. If you answered no go to Question 6. 5. When you’re having a busy day, can you usually stay strong and avoid snacking on things you feel are bad for you? If you answered no go to Question 4. If you answered yes go to Question 8. 6. Does your busy schedule often mean you have no time to prepare and eat a full lunch? If you answered Yes you are a Situational Snacker. If you answered no go Go Question 7. 7. Do you often find yourself opening a packet of biscuits only meaning to eat one, but suddenly find the packet is empty? If you answered yes you are a Snack Amnesiac. If you answered no you are a Super Snacker. 8. If you were asked to remember everything you’d nibbled on throughout the day, would you remember every mouthful? If you answered Yes you are a Super Snacker. If you answered no go to question 7. _____________________________________________________________________________ . If you are a Situational Snacker: . The Situational Snacker is a very busy bee and often doesn't have the time to prepare and eat a full meal during her day. To fill up, the situational snacker will grab snacks throughout the day, whilst she can. Nibbling on the children's packed lunch leftovers for breakfast whilst she chops up the carrots, snacking in the car for lunch after doing the food shop, or quickly scoffing half a sandwich before the company meeting is common for this type of snacker. If you're a 'Situational Snacker' you might find that emotional pressures, stress and a particularly busy day can cause you to snack, even if not hungry, and you may be particularly prone to pick at food as a comfort mechanism. Lucy Jones' advice: 'Almost three quarters (73 per cent) of women in the UK said that stress lead them to overlook their nutrient intake. This is an issue I often see, and it can have a serious impact on health. If women aren't dedicating time to their diet and thinking carefully about their nutrient intake, they could be at risk of over or under eating. 'The key is to snack sensibly and make sure you have something nutritious to nibble on at your desk, in the kitchen, in the car, or wherever the hunger pangs strike. The nutrients in almonds make them a perfect snack to enjoy between meals. Almonds are also a high source of magnesium, which contributes to a reduction of tiredness and fatigue, so they really are the perfect snack to keep you going through a busy day.' If you are a Snack-Amnesiac: . Throughout her day, the Snack-Amnesiac will graze on the foods closest to hand, without even realising she's doing it. Munching through a share-size bag of crisps whilst watching the telly when she only meant to eat a handful, reaching for the plate of biscuits during a lull in the board meeting and even waking up in the middle of the night and sleepwalking to the kitchen to nibble on some leftovers from the fridge are just a few examples of the mindless snacking habit in action. Do you find yourself opening a packet of biscuits only meaning to eat one, but suddenly the packet is empty? If you were asked to remember everything you'd nibbled on throughout the day, would you remember every mouthful? If you find yourself snacking on food without even realising, you could well be a Snack-Amnesiac and you're not alone – research commissioned by the Almond Board of California has shown that 90 per cent of women in the UK admit to snacking mindlessly throughout the day. Lucy Jones' advice: 'Research has shown that women are typically lacking in fibre and often eat higher levels of the daily recommended allowance of saturated fat. 'With 90 per cent of women suspected of suffering from Snack-Amnesia1 and eating anything close to hand without taking the nutrient content into account, it isn't difficult to see how diets become unbalanced. However, if you are a 'Snack Amnesiac,' there are easy ways you can ensure you're still achieving a balanced diet. Almonds are a high source of fibre and just a handful (approximately 30g or 23 almonds) a day can boost your nutrient intake. These great little nuts are also high in unsaturated fat, and in fact, a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition found that a mid-morning snack of almonds helped control appetite and resulted in reduced calorie intake by the participants during the rest of the day. If Snack-Amnesiacs keep a handful of almonds close by, this could help to curb the cravings and the mindless munching later in the day. If you are a Super Snacker: . The Super Snacker is a woman who is well aware of her snacking habits and despite a busy day, or the odd sweet craving, she'll do what she can to stay strong and find the foods she needs to help get her through – no matter what the day might bring. Busy day of meetings and no time for lunch – the super snacker will ensure she's got a steady supply of her favourite nutritional snacks pre-packed and close to hand to see her through. Prone to an afternoon lull – the Super Snacker will have a nutritious pick-me up ready to go. Craving an evening treat after a long day – the Super Snacker will reach for a snack from the well-stocked healthy snack jar. Do you pack a snack in your handbag each day? Are you familiar with the times of day that you need an extra boost? If so, like one in five women in the UK, you could be a Super Snacker. Lucy Jones' advice: 'Well-balanced snacking is a great way to stay on top of your hunger pangs and ensure a daily dose of the nutrients that your body needs. But healthy and happy snacking needn't be difficult or dull. 'As most Super Snackers know, there are some simple tricks to help adopt happy snacking habits. Mixing up different textures and flavours adds variety to your daily food intake. 'Pack a punch with a nutritiously crunchy handful of almonds added to some mango for sweetness, or even dark chocolate for a more indulgent snack.'","Snack amnesiacs are mindless munchers who subconsciously snack .

"A set of stone flakes shaped more than 3.3 million years ago could be the world's oldest tools created by early human ancestors, according to researchers. Archaeologists have revealed that they have discovered 20 stone flakes and anvils - used to help shape the tools - just west of Lake Turkana in Kenya. The discovery could fundamentally change the current view of human evolution as - if correct - the date of the stone tools is 700,000 years older than any others found previously. The stone tools were discovered buried in sediment along the west coast of Lake Turkana (above) in Kenya . It means that ancient human ancestors were creating tools hundreds of thousands of years before the appearance of the first 'man' - the start of our branch of the evolutionary tree known as Homo. Many experts have long believed that it was the use of stone tools by early species of Homo like Homo habilis and Homo erectus that helped set them apart from other human-like species. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.8 million years ago - LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family . 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe . Scientists behind the discovery now believe ancient species known as Australopithecines - typified by the fossilised skeleton called Lucy - or Kenyanthropus made the tools. Professor Sonia Harmand, a palaeolithic archaeologist at Stony Brook University in New York who led the team that discovered the tools, said they stumbled across them by accident. The team had been searching for the site where a controversial human relative called Kenyanthropus platyops had been discovered in 1998. But after taking a wrong turn they came across another area and spotted what looked like stone tools on the sandy surface. Professor Harmand, who was presenting her findings at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society, said: 'The artifacts were clearly knapped [created by intentional flaking] and not the result of accidental fracture of rocks.' The tools were found at a site known as Lomekwi 3, just west of Lake Turkana in Kenya. By excavating down into the sandy soil, the team discovered a series of sharp stone flakes and cores - the rocks the stones are knocked off. They also found anvils that were apparently used to hold the cores as the flakes were struck off. In one case the team were able to fit a flake back to its original core. A further 130 stone tools were discovered on the surface. Each of the stones showed distinctive patterns that suggest they had been struck and shaped by human ancestors. As some tools were locked inside sediment left behind by the receding desert lake, the researchers were able to accurately estimate the time when they were dropped there. By tracking changes in the Earth's magnetic field recorded in the sediment, the researchers were able to pinpoint the date to 3.3 million years ago. This skull of Kenyanthropus platyops was found close to the site of the stone tools in 1999 close to Lake Turkana in Kenya and may be the species responsible for creating the stone flakes that have been discovered . This stone tool - known as an Olduvai chopper - on display at the British Museum is around 1.8 million years old was thought to be one of the earliest examples of stone that had been used by ancient human ancestors . These early stone tools found in Ethiopia are thought to be around 1.7 million years and were used as choppers . This is close to the date of another piece of controversial evidence found in 2010 that suggested stone tools were used long before the appearance of the Homo species on Earth. Researchers working in Dikika in Ethiopia - where an Australopithecine child was discovered- reported they had found cut marks on animal bones dated to 3.4 million years ago. Their claim that these had been made by human ancestors using tools were hugely controversial. Now the latest discovery is the strongest evidence yet that these early humans did have ability to make and use tools rather than being primative creatures. Until the recent discovery, the oldest stone tools to be discovered were in Gona, Ethiopia and were thought to have been made by early Homo species - possibly Homo habilis. The stone tools were discovered buried in sediment at a site called Lomekwi on the coast of Lake Turkana . The stone tools may have been made by relatives of 'Lucy', a female Australopithecus afarensis that lived 3.2 million years ago who is shown above in a reconstruction at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas . Recent discoveries have suggested that the Homo genus first began around 2.8 million years ago, but the tools discovered at Lake Turkana are 500,000 years older than that. As they were found close to the site where Kenyanthropus platyops was discovered - which some say was actually a species of Australopithecine - it suggests they made the tools. Professor Harmand, whose team are preparing a paper on the discovery for publication in the journal Nature, told the Paleoanthropology Society that the Lomekwi 3 tools had been created by 'knappers with a developing understanding of the fracture properties of stone'. She said they were made using simple hammer techniques and combined battering the stones to break of flakes and a technique called core reduction. She said: 'The Lomekwi 3 tools mark a new beginning to the known archaeological record.' According to Alison Brooks, an anthropologist at George Washington University in Washington DC, the finds are 'very exciting. She told the journal Science: 'They could not have been created by natural forces.' that the She added that technology shown in the tools may have actually played a major role in the emergence of our genus - Homo. Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, described the research as 'exciting'. He said: 'It’s important to remember that the first stone tools we can recognise as manufactured . objects are very unlikely to have been the first tools used. 'Organic material like wood or bone rarely preserves in the archaeological record and the first stone tools would have looked very like lumps of broken rock (lacking the detailed patterns we see with later stone tools). 'This new research is incredibly exciting as it pushed back the date for tool making by almost a million years which in turn means tools were being used even earlier than that.' This fossilised jawbone with teeth still in place is thought to belong to the earliest member of the Homo genus 2.8 million years ago but this is still 500,000 years short of the time when stone tools were being used .","Archaeologists have found 20 stones shaped by early humans using 'simple techniques' close to the west shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya .

"It is an all-consuming fear experienced by almost every bride-to-be - will I fit into my wedding dress? But for Shanna McCormick, that particular concern paled into insignificance. Weighing 28st, the 31-year-old, feared she would not live to see her wedding day. For most of her adult life, Miss McCormick's obesity meant had been in and out of hospital, suffering with life-threatening asthma attacks. Doctors warned the strain of being overweight would kill her if she didn't slim down - and fast. Shanna McCormick, 31, whose weight had ballooned to nearly 28st (left) managed to lose 16.5st in two years so she can walk down the aisle with pride . Before her weight loss, Miss McCormick's partner Dan Dimmock had been terrified his partner would die in her sleep. Now, the pair are engaged to be married and have bought a house together . Determined not to be a fat wife to her boyfriend of 14 years, Dan Dimmock, Miss McCormick called off their engagement to embark on a strict two-year weight-loss plan. It was only after she managed to lose 16.5st and dropped 18 dress sizes that she decided she was ready to walk down the aisle. Miss McCormick, 31, from Manchester, said: 'I had been told for years that my life was at risk because of my weight, and so it went in one ear out the other. 'I was immune to hearing it because I'd heard it for so long, but it was different for Dan. BEFORE: . Breakfast: Nothing. Morning snack: Two bags of sweets and fizzy drink. Lunch: Fish and chips. Afternoon snack: Cans of fizzy drink with more sweets, chocolate and crisps. Dinner: Chinese takeaway plus several glasses of wine or cider, and more sweets. AFTER: . Breakfast: Flour-free pancakes with raspberries or a Cambridge shake. Morning snack: Fruit and bottle of water. Lunch: Tuna or chicken salad with water. Dinner: Omelette with green salad and water. Afternoon snack: Bag of hazelnuts with water. 'He was worried sick. Sometimes he couldn't sleep at night because he thought something would happen to me. 'He used to check to see that I was still breathing in the middle of the night. 'The truth is that, at my biggest, I didn't think I had a future. 'Doctors warned me I would die if I didn't lose weight, so what was the point in planning a wedding? 'I might not even be there to see it.' At 5ft 6ins, Miss McCormick's life was in constant danger and she admits she can't remember a time when she was not overweight. At primary school she was the biggest girl in her class and she was already obese by the time she moved to secondary school. Conditions linked to her weight, including asthma, made her a target for bullies, and she turned to food for comfort. By the time she met Dan aged 18, Miss McCormick was living on crisps, bread and pizza. She was a size 20 and weighed 22st. Though he was slim, her weight crept up to its 27.5st peak as their relationship progressed. In 2007 she spent nine days in intensive care when she suffered a severe asthma attack, which doctors blamed on her weight. Miss McCormick said doctors warnings her weight would kill her went 'in one ear out the other'. But they terrified her partner, who couldn't sleep at night worrying something might happen to her . Miss McCormick said: 'I was offered weight-loss surgery but was too scared of dying on the operating table, because my weight made the anaesthetic a risk. 'I knew something had to give but I didn't know how to make the change.' In 2010 the couple became engaged for the first time, but it soon became clear there was no way they could plan their big day with Miss McCormick's health problems. Her frequent visits to hospital meant that it would have been very difficult to set a date and stick to it. 'I wanted nothing more than to marry Dan but I couldn't stand the thought of him becoming my carer as well as my husband,' she said. 'My size was ruining everything. Now it had even ruined my engagement and stopped me marrying the man I loved.' It was seeing Mr Dimmock's fear and uncertainty about their future together that finally forced Miss McCormick into action and she vowed to stop overeating. But because of her unhealthy relationship with food and several failed attempts with conventional diets, she opted for a meal replacement plan in order to avoid even the slightest temptation. Miss McCormick said she cannot remember a time she wasn't overweight, and used to turn to food for comfort. She is pictured, left and right, before her weight loss . She signed up to the Cambridge Weight Plan in August 2011, which allowed her to have four products a day, including a range of milkshakes, nutrition bars and soups. To her surprise she found it easier to stick to than the calorie controlled plans which had failed in the past. She lost 9lbs in the first week. She recalled: 'It was not easy start with and I missed food terribly, but after a few days I got into the zone and never wavered.' After losing 16.5st, Miss McCormick could look at herself in the mirror with pride . In the first year she lost an impressive 8st and saw her health improve dramatically. 'The asthma attacks become less frequent and I wasn't relying on medication all the time,' she said. She lost another 8st the following year and reached her 11st and size 12 target in March 2013. For the first time, she could look in the mirror with pride. Miss McCormick, who has maintained her target weight since, said: 'I loved being able to shop anywhere I wanted but what I really loved was seeing the peace of mind it gave Dan. 'It was worth all the hard slog. 'And looking in the mirror at the new slender me was a joy. 'I never thought that would happen.' So much so that last June, when Dan popped the question again, while the pair were sat on a Los Angeles beach, Miss McCormick did not think twice about accepting and getting on with the planning. She said: 'He went down on one knee with a gorgeous vintage platinum ring. 'I loved it but I had to have it made smaller when we got back home because I had lost even more weight.' But the biggest compliment came when a friend of the couple failed to recognise her. Miss McCormick, who is now a fully trained weight-loss consultant helping other women reach their goals, said: 'I was sitting there chatting away to him when it dawned on me that he didn't know who I was. 'When I told him it was me he just did not believe me. 'It was a huge compliment.' As well as planning their wedding in Las Vegas next year the couple have also bought their dream period home to renovate. 'It will take us years as it needs a lot of work, but it's something I can commit to now I've lost the weight,' Miss McCormick said. Mr Dimmock said he is delighted his partner was able to lose so much weight. He said: 'I used to think the radical before and-after weight-loss images in glossy magazines could never be true until I watched Shanna do it for herself. 'I am very proud and love her to bits.'","Shanna McCormick was 27.5st and had life-threatening asthma attacks .

"A white supremacist gunned down his gay boss for sexually abusing one of his young relatives, he told the court during his first appearance on Tuesday. 'Doing time's the easy part, you know what I'm saying?' Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, said as he was ushered out of the courtroom in Daytona Beach, Florida. He is accused of walking into Wayne County Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina on Monday and killing his former supervisor, Ronald Lane, 44, before fleeing  on a motorbike. He was arrested more than 500 miles away early on Tuesday after officers found him sleeping on a Florida beach. He will be extradited back to North Carolina to face a charge of open murder. Scroll down for video . In court: Kenneth Stancil, pictured in court on Tuesday, said he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth' as he appeared before the judge in Daytona Beach, Florida. He is accused of killing his former boss . Outspoken: Even though he was advised of his right to remain silent, he reportedly admitted to the killing . On Tuesday, he appeared relaxed in the courtroom and, despite the judge advising him he had the right to remain silent, he admitted to the killing, WRAL reported. He confessed to the shooting in an obscenity-laced statement, saying he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth', according to the station. He said Lane, who had been his supervisor at the college's print shop until Stancil was fired last month, had been 'messing with' one of Stancil's family members. Stancil did not file a report about the alleged molestation with local authorities, according to the Wayne County sheriff's office. After Stancil was denied bond, he told the judge he did not blame him for the decision, and he was assigned a public defender. The 20-year-old had been a work-study student who reported to Lane, but he was dismissed from the program in March because of too many absences, according to the college. Arrested: Stancil, left, shot dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane, right. The student, who was close to completing his three-year welding course with top marks, was dismissed from his job last month . By his side: Stancil's mother Debbie, pictured at his graduation, said Lane had made unwanted sexual comments towards her son, but she denied her son's claim that Lane had abused a young relative . Tragedy: Lane is pictured right with his long-term boyfriend, Chuck Tobin, who took his life last year . Police have said they are investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime. Authorities would not elaborate but they confirmed Lane was gay. They are also investigating Stancil's possible links with white supremacist groups. On Facebook, he describes his interests as 'white pride' and calls himself the 'White Knight'. He also has multiple white supremacist tattoos across his body, including 'Brother Hood'across his neck and '88' beneath his eye. The number eight represents the eighth letter in the alphabet - H - and so is 88 understood to stand for 'Heil Hitler'. But his mother has claimed her son's tattoos marked a wannabe rather than someone with neo-Nazi beliefs. Lane had worked at the college for 18 years. His boyfriend of 12 years, Chuck Tobin, took his life last July after leaving their home and his remains were found in November. Stancil's mother, Debbie, has claimed that Lane had fired her son without notice and claimed that he had 'made inappropriate sexual advances toward' him. Remembered: Students gather at a memorial at Wayne Community College for Ron Lane on Tuesday . Memorial: Flowers are seen at a makeshift memorial for Lane, who had worked at the college for 18 years . 'He was verbally inappropriate with [him[ at school. Very much verbally inappropriate,' she said. 'He would tell him to stop and he kept on.' But she said she knows the relative was not sexually abused by Lane, as Stancil claimed in court, because the child and Lane had never met. She said she believes her son made the accusations because he is 'rattled and confused'. She also said that her son never recovered after finding his father in the backyard when he had killed himself in 2009, and said he was angry after being dismissed from his campus job. 'He had a moment of insanity,' she told the Associated Press. 'I don't know. He just snapped. That is not my son. He's probably out of his mind. I think he needs mental help.' Stancil had no criminal record before the shooting. Take over: A military style SWAT vehicle from the Johnston County Sheriff's Office arrived at the college after the 8am shooting on Monday. It is believed that Stancil targeted Lane before fleeing the building . Evacuated: Students were seen congregating in the college parking lot on Monday morning . Swoop: Authorities enter the home Stancil shares with his mother and two younger brothers on Monday . He was on the school's dean's list with a grade point average of 3.6 or better and due to graduate in July with a degree in welding technology, the school said. He was a Boy Scout who wrote in the letter he left explaining his deed that he still hoped to marry his girlfriend, his mother said. After fleeing the scene on Monday, Stancil was arrested at 1.20 am on Tuesday in Daytona Beach, Florida as a massive manhunt continued in North Carolina. He was taken into custody after deputies from the Volusia County Beach Patrol approached him for violating an ordinance that prohibits sleeping on the beach. 'I can say with confidence that Mr. Stancil had a calculated plan, and he carried out that plan,' Goldsboro police Sergeant Jeremy Sutton said during a Tuesday news conference.","Kenneth Morgan Stancil III 'walked into Wayne County Community College in North Carolina on Monday and shot dead print shop director Ron Lane'

"A New York woman running an alleged wife-for-hire immigration scheme pleaded not guilty Friday based on charges that she married 10 men over 11 years and charged a fee for her 'services'. One of the men 38-year-old Lianna Barrientos wed was deported back to Pakistan for making threatening statements against the United States in 2006 after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, it has been revealed. Barrientos, originally from the Dominican Republican, lived with her partner and two children in the Bronx until her arrest in February, however was legally married to at least four people at the time. In court today, prosecutors said Barrientos married men from Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Mali and Georgia - countries that were 'red flags' for immigration, according to The New York Daily News. At one time she was married to eight men simultaneously. Always the bride: Liana Barrientos, 39, of the Bronx, pleaded not guilty on Friday to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences . Sullen: Barrientos, seen here in Bronx Supreme Court on Friday, is accused of marrying 10 men over the course of 11 years in an apparent immigrant scam . Charged: The Bronx district attorney's office says she faces two counts of felony fraud charges . Swindle: Barrientos is accused of accepting money in at least one of the marriages, prosecutors say . All of her marriages took place in New York state, allegedly starting in 1999. Authorities only cottoned on after she said her 2010 marriage to Salle Keita, of Mali, -  the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the New York Post reported. This launched an investigation that unraveled a totaly of ten times Barrientos has allegedly walked down the aisle. Barrientos would spell her name differently on some marriage licenses and would file all over the state, in places including Westchester County, Mamaroneck, White Plains, Ramapo and Long Island, investigators said. Six of the sham marriages occurred in one year, authorities allege. The Daily News reported that it was her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, that was deported to his home country of Pakistan following an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. She has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences. 'This is a huge breach in security,' national security expert Manny Gomez told WABC. 'If someone could remarry 10 times without bringing it to the attention of the authorities, potentially an al-Qaeda plant could come in, marry this woman and be in this country illegally, plotting, recruiting, perhaps even executing a terrorist attack.' Bride: Liana Barrientos, pictured, has been married ten times. Her first marriage took place in 1999, with most recent being in 2010 . Barrientos' marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril . The bride and her grooms: This map shows Barrientos' marriages from 1999 to 2010 . Barrientos' first marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril, followed by a 2001 marriage to Ahmed Allam, then a second 2001 marriage to Habibur Rahman, the Post reported. According to the newspaper, Barrientos married six men in 2002 - namely Davit Koridze, Duran Goktepe, Aliaksandr Paharelau, Vakhtang Dzneladze, Rashid Rajput, and Kakhaber Khorbaladze - and her last marriage was in 2010 to Salle Keita. Authorities reportedly slapped her with offering a false instrument for filing felony charges in November 2014. Quoting court documents, The New York Daily News said '[Barrientos] ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry Mr. Keita and that was her first and only marriage.'

"A 23-year-old mother-of-two is at risk of being banned from seeing her own children - because she refuses to stop drinking and partying. The woman, named only as Gemma, has two children under five by two different fathers and handed both infants over to her 52-year-old mother Debbie when they were four months old. Now Debbie is threatening to ban Gemma from seeing the children at all, after discovering her daughter's penchant for legal high, MKat, and because she suspects her of stealing. Scroll down for video . Feckless: 23-year-old Gemma faces being prevented from seeing her children by her own mother . 'I love them,' says Debbie of the two children. 'She [Gemma] isn't fit enough to have them. She doesn't care.' Debbie, who stepped in to care for the children after social services threatened to take them away, says her daughter's constant drinking and partying is getting out of hand. She also claims that Gemma, who is unemployed, stole an iPad from one of the children and sold it to fund her party lifestyle. Although Gemma says she did not steal the device, she admits to stealing money and other items from her mother in the past. 'From around the age of 13, she went off the rails,' says Debbie. 'She was drinking beer and having underage sex. Upset: Debbie reacts after hearing the results of Gemma's lie detector test - which revealed she did steal . Furious: Debbie, who has looked after Gemma's children all their lives, says she will ban her from the house . 'With the children, she was excited about being pregnant but gave up about four months after having them and then dumped the babies on me.'

"Labour would introduce a new legal right to ‘granny leave’ to allow working grandparents to take time off to help care for their grandchildren. The party’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, in an interview with the Daily Mail, said grandparents would be allowed to take up to four unpaid weeks off per year in order to help with childcare. She said the policy, to be unveiled in Labour’s women’s manifesto, to be launched today, would require a change in the law and would help millions of working families. Scroll down for video . Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman (pictured) said grandparents would be allowed to take up to four unpaid weeks off per year in order to help with childcare . More than half of mothers rely on grandparents for childcare when they first go back to work after maternity leave, and two-thirds of grandparents with grandchildren aged under 16 provide some childcare. Research suggests 1.9 million grandparents have given up a job, reduced their hours, or taken time off work to look after their grandchildren. But the proposed extension of workplace rights to millions more staff is likely to meet with a backlash from some business leaders, who will have to bear the costs of absences. They are already having to implement a new system of shared parental leave, which allows mothers and fathers to swap their time off after a new child. Critics will argue businesses cannot be expected to cope with more rights for employees as the economy recovers from the recession. Miss Harman insisted many businesses would welcome ‘granny leave’, since it would be likely to keep more older women in the workplace – and also enable their children have a better work-life balance. She said she envisaged many grandparents using the new legal right to take time off over school summer holidays, when parents otherwise have to pay for expensive childcare. ‘In many families, grandparents play an integral part of caring for their grandchildren and for many people that’s a financial necessity,’ she said. ‘But many people are working longer and today’s generation of grannies are working until they’re 67. They don’t want to have to choose between carrying on with their job and this role they regard as so important in their lives, which is their role with their grandchildren. ‘More and more daughters and daughters-in-law are in work, childcare is more expensive and grandmothers are now working. ‘Instead of having to choose between retiring early and giving up work, or not being part of the daily care for their grandchildren, we’re saying let’s look at the leave arrangements to recognise what the pattern of family life. ‘This is the next frontier. It’s the first time there has been a policy which recognises this role of grandparents.’ Miss Harman says a Labour government would legislate to allow grandparents as well as parents, or those with legal responsibility, to access the leave . Currently, parents can claim 18 weeks unpaid parental leave - of up to four weeks in any given year - per child up to their fifth birthday, soon to be extended to their eighteenth birthday. Miss Harman says a Labour government would legislate to allow grandparents as well as parents, or those with legal responsibility, to access the leave. Employers would not have the right to turn down the requests for time off. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Grandparents Plus, said: ‘Grandparents are the hidden army of carers in Britain today. 'We know that one in five working parents – two million of them - would give up work without grandparents to rely on. But increasingly grandparents are working too. ‘So this policy is also a win for employers as it helps both parents and grandparents stay in work.’ Other measures in today’s manifesto will include doubling paid paternity leave from two to four weeks, and increasing the amount paid from just under £140 a week to £260 a week. The party also plans a controversial move to introduce ‘compulsory’ sex and relationship education in schools. Labour would change the law if it wins the election to force all state-funded schools, including primaries, to put sex education on the curriculum. Labour sources say ‘age appropriate’ teaching about sex and relationships would begin in Key Stage One, when children are aged five to seven. Parents would retain the existing right to withdraw their children from lessons on the subject until the age of 15. The party will also pledge today to crack down further on domestic violence by appointing a new commissioner to direct policy to tackle abuse.","Deputy leader Harriet Harman said policy would help millions of families .

"From the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's 2011 wedding to the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, no royal event would be complete without them. Now a trickle of royal fans, some familiar faces among them, have begun arriving at the Lindo Wing ahead of the royal birth. But the  group, which includes well-known royal enthusiast Margaret Tyler, 71, could be in for a long wait as the Duchess of Cambridge's due date is more than a week away. Getting ready: Royal superfans Margaret Tyler and John Loughery outside the Lindo Wing . That, however, wasn't enough to dampen spirits with the group, all of whom had come prepared with Union flags, posing happily for the gathering Press pack. Joining Mrs Tyler was another familiar face - that of self-confessed royal 'superfan' John Loughery, 60, who camped out overnight ahead of the 2011 Royal Wedding and was the only member of the public to attend every day of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana in 2008. Mr Loughery, a former chef, said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the BBC that he wouldn't be surprised 'if a portrait of me is hanging inside Kensington Palace in 100 years from now'. Equally serious about the Royal Family is Mrs Tyler, an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than £10,000. Nearly there: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured last month, is due to give birth on the 25th April . Regular: John Loughery, 60, has been present for every major royal event of the last 10 years . Diana fan: His favourite was Princess Diana and he attended every day of the 2008 inquest into her death . Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a £1,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London. Like Mr Loughery, Mrs Tyler was also at the Lindo Wing for the birth of Prince George and ended up spending six days waiting for him to arrive. 'I was there for six days,' she told a recent episode of BBC2 show Collectaholics. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting.I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.' She describes her collecting as a 'labour of love' and says every day is dominated by her royal obsession. Excited: Mr Loughery, from Wandsworth,  with Maria Scott and her daughter Amy Thompson from Newcastle . Pole position: Mrs Tyler surveys the scene outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington . Impressive collection: Mrs Tyler has filled four rooms of her small London home with memorabilia . Valuable: The collection is thought to be worth around £10,000 and is a 'labour of love' 'There's loads of royal magazines that I read, so I get up at about 4.30am to keep up with it all,' she reveals. 'I'm retired but I don't think I've actually ever worked so hard in my life. It takes a lot of work [to maintain] but it's a labour of love.' The Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth to her second child on the 25th April, although experts say royal watchers could be in for a long wait as second babies tend to come late. Nevertheless, preparations for the birth are well past the planning stages, with a media pen designed to hold the expected influx from around the world opening today. The police have also begun patrolling outside the Lindo Wing and have barred photographers from getting too close to the door. Although the Duchess herself is believed to be at Kensington Palace, her husband Prince William is working in Norfolk and is expected to be forced to make a two-hour hospital dash when his 33-year-old wife goes into labour.","Royal superfans have arrived to set up camp outside the Lindo Wing .

"Amanda Knox may have finally cleared her name, but eight years of legal battles have left the Seattle native penniless, exhausted and traumatized from stress, claims her biographer. 'In prison, she was threatened with rape from a male guard, it was a really terrible experience,' says Trial By Jury author, Douglas Preston. 'I think it has really affected her, it's really hard to lead a normal life after that.' Scroll down for video . Strain and relief: Amanda Knox spoke outside her parents' home on March 27 flanked by her fiancé Colin Sutherland after she was exonerated for the murder of Meredith Kercher in November 2007 . Three weeks after an Italian court overturned her conviction for the 2007 murder of British student, Meredith Kercher, Preston told RadarOnline that Knox is living out a bittersweet victory. 'She went to Italy as a normal 20-year-old, West Coast girl, a soccer player, rock climber, very naïve,' says Preston about Knox's ill-fated adventure to Perugia. 'So many terrible things happened to her in Italy, so many lies were said, and the online savagery directed at her, I've never seen anything like it.' So affected has Knox been by her struggle to be exonerated by the Italian courts, that Preston hinted to RadarOnline that she is suffering PTSD and seeking professional help. 'Anyone who has been through what she's been through is going to have issues. It's like a soldier come back from Iraq, having children shot in front of him, you've been through a horrific experience. If it doesn't affect you physically, it affects you emotionally,' he says to Radar. Family struggle: Amanda Knox stands on the front porch with her fiancé, her mother Edda Mellas and stepfather, Chris Mellas. According to her biographer, Knox and her family have spent millions fighting her conviction . On top of her fight to be declared innocent, Preston claims that Knox has been ravaged financially by legal fees. This despite receiving a reported $4 million advance for her 2013 book, Waiting To Be Heard. 'The ordeal has been hugely emotional, but the financial impact has been catastrophic,' says Preston. 'Amanda received a $4 million advance for her book, that money has all gone, immediately out of the door to pay legal fees and there is nothing left,' Preston explains. 'She really wants to establish that she's innocent in Italy, they've paid a lot of fees to Italian lawyers.' Knox, 27, fought the Italian legal system for eight years, spent four years in prison and went through three appeals until she and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito were exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in late March for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Shared experience: This split picture shows Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, arriving with penitentiary police to a court hearing in Perugia September 26, 2008 . Beginning of her nightmare: Amanda Knox leaves with penitentiary police after a court hearing in Perugia in September 2008 after she and her ex-boyfriend were arrested for the murder of Meredith Kercher . Kercher was discovered in a pool of blood in the house she shared with Kercher in November 2007. The British student had been stabbed four times and her throat slit in what the Italian courts claimed was a sex-game gone wrong. Knox and Sollecito was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to 26 years behind bars, but were acquitted in 2011. Knox immediutely returned to the United States protesting her innocence, but in January 2014, the Italian courts overturned that acquittal and reinstated the guilty verdict. However, the case ultimately went to the Supreme Court and their conviction was overturned. Tears: Amanda Knox breaks down after hearing she had been acquitted of the murder of Meredith Kercher in October, 2011 . Return home: Amanda Knox pauses emotionally while speaking during a news conference at Sea-Tac International Airport, Washington after landing there on a flight from Italy, October 4, 2011 after her acquittal . On the announcement of her innocence, Knox appeared on her Seattle doorstep to make a statement. Surrounded by her father, Curt Knox, mother, Edda Mellas, sister, Deanna Knox, and fiancé, Colin Sutherland, the 27-year-old broke down in tears as she told the press: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' Amanda Knox could now receive millions in compensation after being cleared by Italy's top court of murdering Surrey student Meredith Kercher. The 27-year-old and her former lover Raffaele Sollecito both served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder in 2007. It is thought that Knox will return to Italy, despite having vowed never to, and will write about the country's legal and judicial system while she is there. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. Both Knox (above) and Sollecito could now seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison . While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Carlo Dalla Vedova, her Italian lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito’s father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' She added that she was 'full of joy' following Italy's highest court's decision to overturn her murder conviction, saying: 'I'm incredibly grateful for what has happened. For the justice I have received, for the support I have had from everyone, from my family and my friends to strangers.' Shortly after the verdict, Knox, who has said she would never willingly return to Italy, released a statement, saying she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'. She added: 'Throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends, and strangers. To them, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me.'","Amanda Knox, 27, and her family have been left in financial difficulties by the fight to clear her name .

"Horror: Shiva, 11, was reportedly beaten to death for stealing another's boy's pencil and eraser . The head teacher of an Indian school has been arrested after he was accused of beating an 11-year-old pupil to death for stealing another's boy's pencil and eraser. Lalit Verma is said to have launched into a furious assault on a boy named only as Shiva after the stolen items were discovered in the boy's bag at Dwarika Prasad School in Railamau village. The alleged beating was so severe that the child complained of a severe stomach ache and began vomiting blood once he arrived home. An ambulance was called but by the time Shiva got to nearby Fatehpur Hospital his condition deteriorated and he was declared dead on arrival. Verman has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and detained for questioning, the Times of India reported. The child's body has now been taken for post-mortem to establish the cause of death, but police told reporters that it is likely he died of internal bleeding. Police superintendent OP Singh said Shiva's father had filed a report with officers in Biddupur relating to the 'unnatural' death of his son. Further legal action can only take place once an official verdict on the nature of Shiva's death has been established and recorded. For his part the headteacher has reportedly admitting slapping Shiva while questioning him about the stolen stationary. Location: Lalit Verma is said to have launched into a furious assault on a boy named only as Shiva after the stolen items were discovered in the boy's bag at Dwarika Prasad School in Railamau village (pictured) According to First Post, the incident is not the first time the head teacher has been accused of using 'extreme' corporal punishment on his young students. There are also numerous other reports of young Indian boys being beaten to death by teachers. In the city of Burdwan, West Bengal, a nine-year-old  complained of a stomach ache and died just hours after his private tutor reportedly beat him with a stick to failing to answer a question. Elsewhere, in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, a young boy is said to have been beaten and thrown out of a window onto a busy road when his parents failed to pay school fees on time. The child is understood to have died shortly afterwards.","Boy named Shiva was found in possession of stolen stationary items .

"Activated charcoal is thought to act as a 'detox' Are you the first to jump on the latest food fad bandwagon? Do you regularly 'detox' with a green tea or a wheatgrass juice? Or pack your diet full of flax seeds and acai berry - all in the hope of improving your cholesterol, preventing cancer and promoting weight loss? Every day across the world scientists publish countless studies into the health benefits of various foods. For example, acai berries have been linked to weight loss and cancer prevention, flax seeds are thought to help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease, while coconut oil has been hailed as a weight loss aid. More recently charcoal, freekah, spiralizing and bone broth have emerged as the latest craze in healthy eating. Each comes with its own promise, with claims of 'melting away fat cells', 'supercharging the metabolism', and 'regenerating and revitalising'. But what is the truth? I am often asked in clinic about fad diets and products by patients, desperate to find a quick way to shift the pounds. Some of these fads are clearly bonkers, with no scientific evidence to back them up. Others have some basis in common-sense and may be worth including in the healthy, balanced, real-food appproach to eating that is the only way to succeed in the long term. I asked Sophie Claessens, our Vavista dietitian, to pick the 'miracle' foods from the fads... ACTIVATED CHARCOAL . Due to its use by medical professionals in the effective treatment of toxic poisoning, some believe that taking active charcoal, often in the form of a capsule can ‘detox’ the body. However it’s not as easy as that; the charcoal will only remove certain poisons and only if they have recently been ingested and are therefore not yet absorbed. Is it worth trying? No. Firstly, ‘detoxing’ is a word my colleagues and I don’t agree with. We should be aiming for an everything in moderation approach rather than a ‘binge-detox’ cycle. Secondly, activated charcoal has only been shown to be effective for acute poisoning such as certain drug-overdoses, not an accumulation of toxins over time. And what are these accumulated ‘toxins’? Calories? Fat? Carbohydrates? As far as we’re concerned, all of these contribute to a healthy balanced diet - just don’t overdo them. The spiraliser gadget turns various vegetables into spaghetti, helping to boost weight loss . SPIRALIZING . This new gadget is getting everyone in a spin. Take vegetables such as courgettes and carrots and turn them into low-carbohydrate 'spaghetti' in just a few seconds. Great to up your veg intake, increase your fibre intake and reduce your calorie intake, but is it really a healthy addition to the kitchen? Is it a healthy craze? Well, yes and no. We should all be aiming to get as much veg into our diet as possible as it provides us with a low calorie source of fibre, vitamins and minerals. But be careful not to use the spiraliser vegetables as a replacement for complex starchy carbohydrates like pasta, which are required for energy and other important nutrients. If you’re topping your spaghetti dish with spiralised veg or they’re accompanying a meat and potato dish then go for it, have as much as you like. But using the spiraliser to replace carbohydrates in your diet can lead to tiredness, fluctuating weight patterns and poor concentration. FREEKAH . Quinoa is so last year… this new grain on the block is what everyone’s talking about now. Freekeh is a young green wheat which is roasted to remove the husks, giving a smoky, nutty flavour which is popular in the Middle East. Should I give it a go? Yes. It’s easy to cook and can be added to salads, soups and rice dishes easily and deliciously. It’s a low glycaemic index type of carbohydrate with four times the fibre count of quinoa, so will help to keep you fuller for longer and is good for heart health. It also boasts plenty of vitamins such as calcium and iron. The only downside is that it’s pretty expensive. FERMENTED FOODS . How many times have you heard about ‘good bacteria’ and wondered what it’s all about? You may also have heard about pre and probiotics. It’s all based on the principle that our bodies are absolutely filled with bacteria, most of which are good; in fact we wouldn’t be able to survive without them. Fermented foods, including pickled cabbage, act as a probiotic - encouraging the growth of 'good' bacteria . So it seems right that we should treat them right by adding pre-biotics to our diet to encourage growth of the good bacteria and maybe try a daily probiotic which contain cultures of good bacteria to add to our gut population. Fermented foods such as yoghurt, cheese and Asian pickled ingredients such as Kimchi (pickled cabbage) are an example of probiotics. Are they good for me? Yes. There’s more and more evidence to suggest that having a healthy population of bacteria is important for eveything from a smooth digestion process to preventing side-effects of antibiotic medication. Taking a daily probiotic is also fairly easy in the form of a probiotic yoghurt or yoghurt drink. SPROUTED FOODS . It's now being claimed that the intake of sprouted wholegrains can have health benefits over and above those delivered with your plain old standard wholegrains such as rice, wheat and oats. The theory goes that we harvest our grains prematurely, not allowing them to sprout, like an onion would if left. Bone broth has a much lower salt content than shop bought soups, helping lower blood pressure . When sprouted, we are able to digest the grains more readily and absorb more nutrients such as protein, B vitamins and minerals such as iron and calcium. There’s lots of evidence emerging of their impact on health such as decreasing blood pressure and fighting diabetes. Should I invest at the supermarket? Maybe. They may provide you with lots of vitamins and minerals which you wouldn’t naturally yield from the standard grain, but they’re a fairly expensive product. You can also find these vitamins and minerals from a varied diet containing plenty of fruit, veg, calcium-rich dairy products (or alternatives), wholegrains and meat, fish or alternatives. BONE BROTH . This has recently made famous by the health-conscious chefs the Hemsley sisters. In fact, it’s been around for centuries and has always been used as stock, as a base in soups and saucy dishes. It’s also well-known for its health benefits, with the bone-boiling process leaching out amino acids, collagen - for skin and bone health - and other important vitamins and minerals. Adding onions or leeks, carrots and celery, and any other old veg that you have lying around, will add antioxidants along with flavour. Shall I join the club? Yes . Your mother, grandmother and great-grandmothers have probably been using this recipe for hundreds of years. Traditionally it is used to add flavour to dishes but it’s also a great way to add nutrients without much effort. Plus it has a much lower salt content than using shop-bought stocks, so is much better for your blood pressure. ...BUT NOW A WORD OF WARNING . Food fads are named such usually because they’re an unsustainable fashion trend. Some can even be dangerous. Have a think to yourself when you hear of the new craze; are you being advised to ingest something which sounds inedible? Would I find it hard to keep the changes up long-term? If so, they’re probably not a sensible idea. Another point to remember is that just because they’re being sold in a health food or wholefoods shop, it doesn’t mean they’re ‘healthy’. You can still buy chocolate from these shops. Sorry to burst your bubble, but just because you buy it from a health food shop, it doesn’t magically become healthy. We would suggest that you do your research before rushing into anything. To find out more visit www.vavista.com .","Dietitian Sophie Claessens picks the latest 'miracle' foods from fads .

"It was supposed to be a joyous Easter Sunday celebration, but the brunch turned into yet another drama for Tori Spelling, who suffered an accident causing her to be hospitalized. According to eyewitnesses at Benihana's Japanese Restaurant in Encino, California, Tori, hubby Dean McDermott, their kids, Liam, Stella, Hattie and Finn, and a few other guests, had enjoyed their Easter brunch, when Tori tripped and fell onto a hot Japanese style grill used to prepare food in front of customers.

In addition, Spelling, who turns 42 next month, has been embroiled in an on-again-off-again feud with her super rich mother, Candy Spelling, that left her feeling abandoned by the Spelling family matriarch. She's also suffered extreme pain due to a neck injury, but refuses to have surgery to repair the problem. And just last week rumors began circulating that her 48-year-old husband may have cheated on her once again – this time with his 52-year-old ex-wife Mary Jo Eustace. 'Tori could certainly use a bit of good luck in her life for a change,' says the source. 'And we all hope she will pull through this latest incident the way she's managed to pull through the other set - backs in her life.'","A family brunch with Tori Spelling, Dean McDermott and their four kids turned into a disaster .

"Justine Miliband fell in love with her husband Ed after she was attacked by a Doberman while canvassing on his behalf - even though she had been 'furious' with him after a bungled first date. Mrs Miliband, 44, has revealed that she first met the Labour leader at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend and thought he was 'good looking' and 'unattached'. But the Labour leader failed to tell his future wife that he was secretly going out with their 'mutual friend' - understood to be the former BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders. Worse still, the politician persisted in trying to bore his future wife with constant talk of economics, which she can't stand. Scroll down for video . Justine Miliband, right, said she fell in love with her husband Ed, left, after she got bitten by a dog . Mrs Miliband, right, said Ed, left, did not tell her that he was in a relationship when they first met at a party . The mother-of-two was campaigning with her husband in the north west at several events. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Mrs Miliband said: 'Canvassing in the rain always reminds me of falling in love with Ed in 2005. 'I had never been out leafleting before and didn't realise you had to keep your eye out for dogs on the other side of the letterbox. 'I'd been bitten by a Doberman. Ed bandaged me up and I fell in love with him.' The Doberman incident happened while canvassing in Mr Miliband's constituency in Doncaster. However, Mr Miliband almost doomed the couple's relationship on their first encounter after he failed to reveal that he was already in a relationship. She said: 'I thought he was good looking and clever and seemed to be unattached. But we just went down a conversational cul-de-sac. 'Apparently we had nothing in common. He wanted to talk about economics – one of my least favourite subjects. None of our conversations went anywhere.' The unpromising start to their relationship was compounded when she found out he had been going out with the woman who invited them to dinner. She said: 'I found out he was secretly going out with the woman who had invited us for dinner. I was furious. 'I bumped into him a couple of times after that, but we didn’t start seeing each other for at least a year.' Mrs Miliband said she first met the Labour leader at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend - understood to be the former BBC economics editor - who Ed was secretly in a relationship with . Mrs Miliband said neither her or her husband are bothered about the 'kitchengate' controversy when it emerged the couple had two kitchens - or 'bacongate' when Mr Miliband was caught struggling to each a sandwich . The couple have two children, Daniel and Samuel. However, Mrs Miliband, who is a lawyer, said she has no intention of giving up her job in the event her husband is elected prime minister. She said she was 'genuinely taken aback' by the suggestion. Mrs Miliband said she has been surprised by some people's obsession with their domestic arrangements. She added: 'With kitchengate, I was just amazed at the ink being spilled. I can't get upset about things like that when people are having terrible lives in this country and around the world. 'There are things in politics that are really serious and then there's lots of other stuff. It's partly why Ed and I get on so well. Both of us couldn't care less about kitchengate or bacon buttygate.'","Ed Miliband bored his future wife Justine on their first meeting at a party .
