"Tuesday night against Italy could be the most important England game Michael Carrick has ever played. The difference between the first and the second half was like night and day. When Carrick came on, England started to play. Having played in his position, and alongside him, it has been frustrating to see him unappreciated in this country. We have always had a major problem keeping the ball, but Carrick keeps the game simple. That’s exactly what we need. Roy Hodgson’s team against Italy looked like he had one eye on the future, but the only future England need to be focusing on is Euro 2016. If that means going with a 34-year-old Michael Carrick in the heart of midfield, so be it. Tuesday night's friendly clash with Italy  could prove to be Michael Carrick's most important England game . England international Carrick keeps the game simple but has been unappreciated in this country . Carrick congratulates Andros Townsend following the Tottenham wideman's equaliser against Italy in Turin . WAYNE ROONEY . ‘The best player on the pitch by a mile was Michael Carrick. He came on and dictated the game for us.’ PAUL SCHOLES (last week) ‘He is not a flash footballer. He doesn’t hit Hollywood passes. He doesn’t score lots of goals. But I loved playing alongside him.’ SIR ALEX FERGUSON (in December) ‘I still think Michael Carrick is the best central midfield player in English football, I really do. I think he is the best English player in the game.’ Even though he’s 33 now, it’s still not too late to start building the midfield around him. If I were England manager, that’s just what I’d do. Look at Andrea Pirlo — he is 36 next month and has blossomed in his later years. His passing tore England apart at the World Cup and he is worshipped in Italy. Why can’t we love Carrick in the same way? The fact he has been ignored by England for so long is a sad indictment of where we have been going wrong for so many years. In this country we tend to focus a lot on what players can’t do rather than what they can. We love all-action players like Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard but that’s why men like Carrick can be left frustrated. It was not long ago that defensive midfielders had to snap into every tackle. At Manchester United in particular, Carrick has had to deal with ‘Keane Syndrome’ — because he’s not Roy Keane. He’s not as mobile, he doesn’t grab games in the same way and he certainly doesn’t tackle like Keane. But that is not his style. Keane was an amazing player but there will never be another like him and the game has evolved. Carrick and Ryan Mason (left) applaud the travelling England support following Tuesday's 1-1 draw with Italy . Fans love all-action players like former England midfield stars Frank Lampard (left) and Steven Gerrard . Andrea Pirlo, who turns 36 next month, tore England apart with his passing at last summer's World Cup . The best deep-lying midfielders of recent years have been passers, not pit bulls: Pirlo, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, Sergio Busquets. All of them are cultured players who look after the ball. And don’t be fooled by a powerhouse like Nemanja Matic — he can pick out any kind of pass with that left foot. These aren’t just defensive destroyers any more, these are the men starting the attacks. They may not have the best stats for goals or assists, but they are at the heart of it all. It’s the same with Andres Iniesta and Luka Modric — they keep things ticking over, as does Carrick. He makes the passes that lead to the key pass. The midfield that started in Turin was powerful and athletic, but sometimes you need a bit of guile. In a way, it was a good job the first half was so poor as it meant Carrick could come on and really show what he can do. Friendlies might be a good time to experiment but that first half in Italy made for some uncomfortable viewing. Phil Jones has had a decent season at centre back but looked awkward in midfield and England’s passing was too slow and square. Carrick changed that. All of a sudden there was a different tempo to the game. England were fluid and found more room to move against a tough opponent. When he gets possession, Carrick quickly gets the ball out of his feet and tries to slide passes forward. He’s not the toughest of tacklers but he doesn’t need to be. He reads the game brilliantly and intercepts the ball so well that he doesn’t need to go charging after people. He has fantastic vision, which means his team-mates can get into dangerous positions. They know that if anyone can pick out a pass, it’s Carrick. He is so comfortable on the ball and probably England’s most two-footed player since Glenn Hoddle. He’s not in Hoddle’s class, but he is so well balanced with both feet. Carrick takes on midfield rival Roberto Soriano during England's 1-1 draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium . Xavi and Nemanja Matic are two of the world's best deep-lying midfielders and both have an eye for a pass . Carrick's introduction against Italy changed the game, the tempo and saw England become more fluid . I’ve said it before but Carrick has a nasty habit of passing to his own players. It might not look flash but he makes the game look easy. That’s why so many of his team-mates love playing alongside him. He might be a quiet personality but you can see the effect he has on those around him. United have been far better with him than without him this season and Daley Blind, who many thought would replace him, has been shunted out of position. That’s because Carrick is a better player in that role. It’s also important to have experience in that position — I’ve never felt it’s one for a young player. Hodgson has tried Jack Wilshere but Carrick knows the role at club level. Of course Wilshere could play next to him, but at present Carrick is the best man for the job. Considering he won his first cap against Mexico in 2001, it’s amazing he has not featured more for England. He has not always taken his chances, but now is a golden opportunity to build our midfield around him. It’s still not too late to make sure England have a pass master in place for Euro 2016. Carrick, who made his debut in 2001 (right), could become England's third-longest serving player at the Euros .","Michael Carrick changed the game for England against Italy in Turin .

"There’s no doubt that Mesut Ozil is an easy target for ex-pros and pundits. But when he’s at his best he is worth paying to watch. I’d much rather see a quality player do something special than a bunch of grafters with nothing to show for it. Against Liverpool, Ozil was at his brilliant best in a massive game. You don’t become a Real Madrid hero or win the World Cup without being something special. Ozil is just that. Mesut Ozil wheels away to celebrate after his brilliant first half free-kick against Liverpool . Ozil is congratulated by his team-mates during Arsenal's impressive 4-1 victory on Saturday afternoon . 7 - Ozil has been involved in seven goals in his last eight league games, scoring three and setting up four. 241.9 - The German sets up a goal every 241.9 minutes in the PL, the seventh-best tally in the competition’s history. 47 - Ozil only played for 73 minutes against Liverpool, but made 47 passes in the opposition half, more than any other player . When things don’t come off for the German, people are quick to criticise. We do that too much in this country — looking at what people can’t do rather than what they can — and it’s where we go wrong so often. No, Ozil doesn’t charge around like Alexis Sanchez so people say he doesn’t care. Just ask Liverpool if Ozil cared about the game on Saturday. People have been quick to criticise Ozil, but the German star is worth paying to watch when at his best . Hazard so cool when it counts . A few weeks ago I was talking to John Terry and we got round to discussing Eden Hazard. John told me that Hazard was the most relaxed player he had ever played with. He is so chilled out on and off the pitch but that’s exactly what Chelsea needed against Stoke. In a match where some of his team-mates looked overcome with fear, Hazard was playing a different game. He’s only 24 but the Belgian is already the man Chelsea seek out when they need something special. It was his desire and creativity that led to Loic Remy’s winner and that could be a defining result in their bid for the title. It’s premature to speak of him in the same breath as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo — Ronaldo added another five on Sunday to take his tally to 47 goals this season and Messi has 43. Hazard has 17, which is good, but those two are on another level. Hazard, at least, is moving in the right direction. Eden Hazard steps up to stroke home the opener for Chelsea from the penalty spot in the first half . Hazard jumps in the air to celebrate his goal during the hard-fought win over Stoke City in west London . Loic Remy finishes to put Chelsea back in front after another driving run for the little Belgian . It’s tough at Toon, even for the best... It's a good job Newcastle have already earned 35 points this season. If they hadn’t, they would be in serious trouble. But I don’t blame John Carver for one second. Even Jose Mourinho, Arsene Wenger and Louis van Gaal would struggle with this group of players. It just shows you what a good job Alan Pardew was doing. He won 26 of those 35 points at 1.4 per game. Since he left, Newcastle average 0.8 per game. They have declined badly. John Carver looks on as his Newcastle United team suffer a Tyne-Wear derby defeat against Sunderland . Against Sunderland, they were poor and the fans deserve better. They love a hero in the North East, but where is the stardust in that team right now? As for Sunderland, that is such a big result for them and Dick Advocaat at the bottom. Jermain Defoe’s strike was absolutely fantastic and I can’t remember the last time we had such a good weekend for great goals. Jermain Defoe (centre) fires a left-footed volley past Time Krul to give Sunderland a 1-0 lead . Defoe celebrates after his stunning volley put Sunderland into a 1-0 lead against Newcastle . City must be feeling the pressure . Who would have thought at the start of 2015 that Man City would be sitting fourth in the table ahead of their game on Monday night? On January 1, they were level on points at the top with Chelsea and had the same goal difference, too. Now Arsenal and Man United have overtaken them and they face a real fight just to finish second. That is not how the owners, players or manager will have expected things to go after winning the title last season and investing heavily in the summer. They need a result at Crystal Palace, but that is easier said than done these days. Manuel Pellegrini will be feeling the pressure as his Manchester City side sit in fourth place . Sergio Aguero and Co will know they must beat Crystal Palace on Monday night to stay in the title race . With Bony gone, Gomis is the star . At the start of the season, I picked out Bafetimbi Gomis as one to watch. As the weeks went by, I started to wonder if I’d made a mistake. Not anymore. I watched him at Lyon and he’s always had something about him. He’s powerful and is built for the Premier League. He’s strong, you can play off him and he’s technically very good — his two finishes against Hull were outstanding. When Wilfried Bony left, I feared for Swansea, but Gomis has come into his own. It shows how well that club is run. Even when they lose players like Bony or Joe Allen, they have already lined up quality replacements and the same goes for the managers. It’s good to see Gomis finally becoming the player I expected him to be. Bafetimbi Gomis unleashes a thunderous overhead kick shortly before half-time against Hull on Saturday . Gomis roars with celebration after giving Swansea a 2-0 lead against Hull at the Liberty Stadium . Herrera is raring to go . Much like Gomis, Ander Herrera was another in my ‘10 To Watch’ list. He had a difficult start and had to win over the trust of Louis van Gaal, but now he looks like he’s enjoying himself. Herrera is a good technician but he likes a tackle. I like that about him. At Anfield he was not afraid to take on Steven Gerrard after he saw Gerrard go through his pal Juan Mata. He does not fear reputations and stood up to Gerrard. The rest is history. I met him in a London restaurant and he was a bright kid who clearly loves life in England. He’s had to be patient, but now he’s starting to show his class. Manchester United star Ander Herrera (right) scores his side's opening goal against Aston Villa . Herrera, who has played his way back into the United side, celebrates opening the scoring against Villa . 1 - Only once before has a Tony Pulis team conceded four goals at home in the Premier League — when Chelsea beat Stoke 4-0 in January 2013. Hope for Hoops . A few weeks ago in this column I said it was no time for Chris Ramsey to be playing the kids. At West Brom it was his most experienced men who gave him a result to savour. Scoring four goals away at a team managed by Tony Pulis is no mean feat. West Brom’s defence has improved under their new boss but QPR were terrific. It was a result and a performance to give them a glimmer of hope. With Leicester winning and others struggling, it makes things a whole lot more interesting in the battle at the bottom. QPR went 2-0 up thanks to Charlie Austin (right) and finished the first half with a 3-0 lead against West Brom . QPR boss Chris Ramsey will hope to lead his side out of the Premier League relegation zone .","Mesut Ozil was brilliant during Arsenal's 4-1 victory against Liverpool .

"I spoke to Carl Froch for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next. Needless to say, we were disappointed to see Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr lose at the weekend against Andrzej Fonfara. It wasn’t a result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of Froch and Chavez fighting in Las Vegas – a fight Carl wanted. Now we turn to three big fights in the next two months to see what Carl does next. I have held talks with Gennady Golovkin’s manager and there is also the possibility of Bernard Hopkins, but there are three fights coming up where the winner could work for Carl. Carl Froch (left) has not fought since beating George Groves at Wembley last May . Froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring for nearly a year now . Froch had hoped to meet Julio Cesar Chavez Jr, but he lost to Andrzej Fonfara last week . There is the possibility of Paul Smith-Andre Ward in the pipeline, Anthony Dirrell versus Badou Jack for the WBC world title and Andre Dirrell’s IBF world title fight against James DeGale, which is the biggest bout of this trio. Anthony Dirrell’s people have already been in touch with me about a Froch fight in the event that he wins, but I wonder if it is big enough. A fight against DeGale still feels to me like the most probable, if he comes through against Dirrell on May 23. That is a huge fight, a proper 50-50, but I fully believe he can do it. For me, from talking to Carl, I think he needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return. If doesn’t come back this year, I don’t think he will. He has been a year out of the ring so let’s see. I know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights. The possibility of him retiring is very high but he is still training hard. He is walking around at 12st 7lbs and in the gym four to five days a week. The guy has the hunger but it has to be for the right fight and the right money. My belief is still that it might be DeGale. DeGale has looked sensational in camp and is improving at a brilliant rate – if he wins the title over in the US he will be in a great position. I mentioned Golovkin before. When I was on the phone to Carl he spent 20 minutes talking about the guy. He is a fighter that absolutely fascinates him; it’s a fight that would get everyone talking. I am looking at it. It would have to be at 168lbs and it would be special. I wouldn’t want to be the one to find out how Golovkin punches at the weight but Carl has a sick mind like that. I’m not going to rule that one out. James DeGale (right) has now emerged as the most likely next opponent for Froch on his return . Another option for Froch could be a rematch with Ward, should the American beat Paul Smith . After a disappointing couple of weeks it seems that my hopes to stage Carl Frampton-Scott Quigg this summer are dead in the water. We received no offers from their side and made three of our own – we offered a 50-50 split, a 60-40 in favour of the winner and also a £1.5m guarantee to Frampton. I sent that last offer in writing to them and had no response. You ask yourself who is making these decisions? It is life-changing money for Frampton that has been offered. Let’s hope they don’t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves. Scott will move on and fight on July 18. I can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than Frampton will. Scott Quigg (right, in action against Hidenori Othake) will fight on July 18 against an unnamed opponent . Carl Frampton's team failed to make an offer to fight Quigg, according to his promoter Hearn . Hearn went live on Sky Sports to offer Frampton and his team £1.5m to fight Quigg . Anthony Joshua has been added to my May 9 show in Birmingham, where he will fight Rafael Zumbano Love, the South American champion. He is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for Anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against Kevin Johnson on May 30. We are keeping him busy, which is what he wants. I saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome. After the Johnson fight he will be out again on July 18 in Manchester and then in September in a big fight. Watch this space. Anthony Joshua (left) beat Jason Gavern (right) last time out and will now face Rafael Zumbano Love .","If Carl Froch doesn't fight in 2015 I'm not sure he'll be back at all .
A blockbuster with James DeGale is most likely after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr defeat - but Anthony Dirrell has made contact .

"The 'campaign' continues against Chelsea when it comes to penalties – although in a first half with four penalty appeals it was clear that referee, Michael Oliver was only going to award what he felt was a stonewall spot kick and there was only one of those. The Blues had a good shout for an early penalty when Oscar was clipped by Bellerin but I agreed with Oliver that the contact was accidental and minimal - a penalty would have been very harsh. Oliver was more decisive when Cesc Fabregas went to ground after feeling contact from Santi Cazorla. The fall was exaggerated and theatrical and that might have influenced Oliver as he cautioned the Spaniard for simulation. Chelsea should have had a penalty when Brazilian forward Oscar nicked the ball past David Ospina . The Arsenal goalkeeper clattered Oscar, who was left with a possible concussion and replaced at half time . Replays proved that to be incorrect as they showed slight contact on Fabregas' knee - perhaps not enough for a penalty but certainly enough contact to make the caution incorrect. Arsenal had an appeal of their own when the ball span up and caught Gary Cahill on the arm but again I thought Oliver was right as Cahill was very close to the Arsenal player and his arm was not in an unnatural position. There was only one clear penalty for me when Oscar was played clean through on goal and lobbed David Ospina the Arsenal keeper clearly wiped Oscar out and Oliver should have given them a penalty. Oliver may well have been waiting to see if Oscar's lob went in the goal but once it was cleared he should have gone back, awards the penalty and cautioned Ospina. Oscar had gone down earlier in the half under the slightest of contact from Hector Bellerin . Cesc Fabregas was booked after appearing to kick his leg out to find contact from Santi Cazorla . Replays showed that there was some contact on Fabregas, and therefore the booking for diving was harsh . Santi Cazorla's shot hit Gary Cahill's arm, but the Chelsea man was too close to have deliberately handled .","Chelsea had three appeals for penalties turned down in first half .

"Richie Benaud made commentary look easy. Believe me, it isn’t. But he put in the hard work and he rose to the top. There’s a lesson there for a few of the blokes who pick up a mic today. I had the great honour of doing a stint on Channel 9 in Australia during an Ashes Test a few years ago. They’d only recently introduced the concept of using three commentators in one go and, as usual, Richie was keeping his contributions to a minimum. I mean that in a good way — again, another lesson for today’s batch. Anyway, Richie had noticed something out in the middle and flicked what we call the lazy switch, so he could have a quiet word with the producer without the viewers hearing him. He wanted some footage of an incident he’d spotted a couple of overs earlier — Shane Warne had done something in the slips and it had passed the rest of us by. Richie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Benaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBC . Benaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his later years in August 2005 . Benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . Finally, the producer located what he wanted. Warne, who hadn’t bowled yet — but who would go on to skittle England for the umpteenth time — had picked up his bowling marker, a small white disc, and thrown it to where he thought he’d be starting his run-up. Between overs, they broadcast Warne’s gesture. Richie said: ‘Shane Warne’s just put a marker down.’ That was his only contribution in the half-hour we were on together, but it beat anything else we had to offer. One line! It was classic Richie: he had the eagle eye to see what Warne was doing in the first place, the confidence to stay quiet while we rabbited on, and the perfect choice of words. As he might have put it himself: marvellous. I thought of Richie during the World Cup final last month. For some reason Star Sports, the tournament’s global broadcasters, used a team of rookies to commentate on the match. Some of them were among the game’s greatest modern-day players, but it was painfully apparent none of them had done much commentary. It was terrible TV. They just couldn’t pinpoint the moment — no emotion, no elation, no despair. How we missed Richie that evening. He never went overboard but he could have captured all those qualities in that understated way of his. Sometimes he could be very understated indeed. David Gower, Geoffrey Boycott and Benaud assembled a formidable line-up for the BBC in 1995 . A master with the microphone to his lips, Benaud also was well aware of the power of silence . Australia cricket legend Benaud shakes hands with HM Queen Elizabeth II during his playing days . I remember talking to Michael Slater, who teamed up with him in the commentary box in his later years. He spoke about one day when Richie did two half-hour stints as one of three commentators, and did not say a single word. Slats described it as ‘bagging a pair’, the term for a batsman who gets two ducks. But that was Richie. If there was nothing to add to the picture the viewers could see, he wouldn’t add to it. It really pains me now, for example, when commentators start reading out a graphic that has appeared on screen for all to see. It might be the top 10 leading runscorers at a particular ground, or something similar, and they just read out the list! It’s incredibly lazy. Richie would consider the list, and then say something like: ‘And No 4 could soon be moving to No 2.’ He wouldn’t even name names — he respected the intelligence of the viewer. And I know how much viewers responded to that. One of his best qualities was that he never sought the limelight. He wasn’t in it for the ego. He’d turn up in the commentary box and if he was off-air, he’d set up at the back of the box, take out his computer and do his homework on the newest player on the scene, or look up the latest horseracing odds. The chemistry he had with the likes of Tony Greig and Bill Lawry was amazing. It was unmissable. And it was based on a deep mutual respect and love of the game. Benaud (front left) leads Australia off at Old Trafford in 1961 as England collapsed against his leg spin . Benaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and loved . Benaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005 . And, boy, he loved the game. One evening, Richie, Ron Atkinson and I were treated to dinner in Birmingham by the News of the World, who we were all working for at the time. Ron was covered in bling and telling us all how he could get into any nightclub in town and was ready for a lively evening. Richie wasn’t a big drinker, but he’d allowed himself a couple of glasses of red, and he started telling this story about the great Australian leg-spinner Bill O’Reilly. It’s fair to say the story was on the longish side and by the time Ron had disappeared into the night and Richie was being bundled into a waiting taxi, we were still learning all about Bill O’Reilly… . He had this wit that made all other commentators want to be like him. He didn’t really go in for after-dinner speaking, but he might occasionally be asked to say a few words. Once he spotted me in the audience, and quickly remembered the time I was hit in the groin by Jeff Thomson (have I mentioned that before?). Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84 . ‘Ah, there’s David Lloyd,’ Richie said. ‘I remember him telling me in 1974-75 how he could play Thommo with his c***… and then he proceeded to do precisely that.’ The joke was all in the pause and the timing. He was a great leg-spinner, a superb captain, and a lovely bloke. I can just imagine how warmly he’ll be welcomed by some of the other great commentators up in the sky: Brian Johnston, Alan McGilvray, John Arlott, even Freddie Trueman. Fred was often known to splutter: ‘I just don’t know what’s going off out there.’ Richie, it’s safe to say, never suffered from the same affliction. We’ll miss him dearly. And so will cricket.

"UEFA has opened a real can of worms by ordering the final 18 seconds of the European Women's Under 19 Championship qualifier between England and Norway to be replayed following a refereeing error. However, FIFA did something similar during a 2006 World Cup qualifier. Back in 2005 Uzbekistan were playing Bahrain in the Asian zone fourth-round play-off first leg when Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida incorrectly awarded an indirect free-kick to Bahrain after the Uzbeks had encroached at their penalty kick when 1-0 up. This happened in the 38th minute and FIFA ordered that the entire match be replayed which did not please either team.

Bahrain players and staff celebrate after beating Uzbekistan in a 2006 World Cup qualifier on away goals . Have UEFA just triggered a landmark moment for football? Final 18 seconds of England match to be replayed after ref disallowed penalty for encroachment... and gave indirect free-kick instead. Read more HERE. Uzbekistan only managed a 1-1 draw in the replay and a 0-0 scoreline in the second leg in Manama meant that Bahrain qualified. Current FIFA head of refereeing, Massimo Busacca, was in charge for the first-leg rematch and I was appointed to the second leg in Bahrain. It was surprising to receive four or five calls on the day of that game from FIFA stressing how important it was that the game passed without any errors in law which would provoke another appeal. Winding forward to the latest incident which was caused, incredibly, by an identical error by German referee, Marija Kurtes, in the 96th minute of England’s 2-1 'defeat' by Norway in their qualifying group. England thought they had scored an equaliser in the dying seconds of the game from the penalty spot but Kurtes had spotted encroachment by at least one England player and rightly disallowed the goal. Had the penalty been missed she would have been correct to award an indirect free kick but as it had been scored she should have ordered a retake. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Marija Kurtes incorrectly awarded an indirect free kick after disallowing a penalty . Kurtes has been sent home from the European Women's U19 qualifiers after her mistake . Now, UEFA has upheld England’s appeal and ordered that in an evolution of the FIFA decision in 2005, the game should be replayed from the moment the technical error occurred. This bizarre decision was perhaps influenced by the fact that both teams are still present in the host city, Belfast, and are available following their final qualifying matches. However, this sets a dangerous precedent. If the same error is made in the opening minutes of a late group match in next year’s European Championship finals in France, will that match be replayed and the schedule of the whole tournament be thrown into disarray? I almost caused just that at Germany 2006; my error, in not sending Josip Simunic off when showing him his second yellow card, could not be disputed and given FIFA’s decision in the qualifying stages of the same competition they would have struggled not to allow a rematch. The game was 2-2 at the time of the mistake and it stayed that way until the final whistle but had Croatia scored they would have ‘qualified’. I remember being told by the Australians that had Croatia scored a winning goal in the final three or four minutes they would have appealed and expected a rematch at the very least. Precedent set; now let’s wait for the next refereeing error. It will happen – and UEFA must just hope it doesn’t affect one of their premiere tournaments.

"Scott Dann was a fraction offside when he set up Glenn Murray for Palace’s first goal (2), but it would be harsh to put too much blame on assistant John Brooks. He was spot on with two equally tight calls in the same move — before Dann got the ball (1) and for Murray’s finish (3). The speed of it, plus two players blocking his view, made it unbelievably hard for him to get all three right.","Scott Dann was a fraction offside when he set up Glenn Murray .

"Congratulations to Australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas. It leaves England looking old-fashioned and they need to react. Stuart Lancaster must be free to pick his best players, no matter where in the world they ply their trade. If Roy Hodgson’s star names moved to Bayern Munich or Barcelona, would the FA tell him not to pick them? Absolutely not. The same needs to apply to rugby. Matt Giteau's stellar displays for Toulon have put him back on the Wallabies radar ahead of the World Cup . The game is changing and Australia have realised that. Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell, for example, are top-class performers for Toulon and if England lose to Australia with those two playing out of their skins, you know exactly what the headlines will be. The World Cup is simply about the world’s best coming together and ridiculous rules like this demean it. Toulon’s Steffon Armitage came off the bench against Leinster on Sunday and turned the game on its head. His turnover work and ball-carrying are second to none and since he upped sticks to France his game has constantly improved. Toulon's Steffon Armitage takes on the Leinster defence during the Champions Cup semi-final in Marseille . I don’t think Armitage would be playing this well if he was still at London Irish. He took a big risk and it paid off, he shouldn’t be penalised for it. If one or two England back-rowers wouldn’t want to see Armitage in the squad, then that confirms he should be! Nick Abendanon has also become better since he crossed the Channel. It’s simply wrong to say England are best served by players at English clubs. If someone is going to be happier, healthier and a better player overseas, he should be supported. Jonny Wilkinson moved to France and became even better than when he played for England, so that completes the argument for me. Would I have picked Jonny if he was playing in France? Of course I would. Nick Abendanon's game has drastically improved since the former Bath full back made the move to France . As England coach you will be judged on your World Cup performance, even more so as the home team. That’s where you have to deliver the results and selecting your best starting XV is the first thing you have to get right, without exception. When it comes to the big games, the other England players will want to have the best possible squad available. Every player, fan and Englishman wants England to win the World Cup and it starts with picking your best team. When it comes to a home World Cup, you don’t want to be left talking about ‘what ifs’. England head coach Stuart Lancaster has remained steadfast in his policy not to select overseas players . England players deserve to go on to the field knowing they have been given the best chance of winning. Do the squad truly believe this when such talented players are not considered? They shouldn’t be left to doubt they are playing only because of their home address. This isn’t about being disloyal to the clubs. They benefit from a winning England team, especially in a World Cup year. You simply can’t let the RFU or Premier Rugby tie your hands behind your back and dictate who you can or can’t pick. At Toulon, they’ve got Bryan Habana playing for South Africa and Leigh Halfpenny playing for Wales. They’re among the best players in the world. It’s just crazy and misguided not to make any Englishman available for selection. Well done, Australia. Bryan Habana plays for Toulon but the Springboks have continued to select the winger for Test matches .","Australia have seen sense by revamping their overseas selection policy .
It leaves England looking old-fashioned and they need to react .
Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell are top-class performers for Toulon .
Steffon Armitage and Nick Abendanon should come into the selection mix .
England need the best squad possible for the forthcoming World Cup ."
"It's normally Steffon Armitage who triggers it, but this time it is Nick Abendanon’s doing. He played so well for Clermont Auvergne last weekend – again – that England’s policy against picking players based abroad is back in focus. For the umpteenth time, the RFU and Stuart Lancaster are being urged to invoke the ‘exceptional circumstances’ get-out clause. There is an assumption in many quarters that, this being a World Cup year, it is time to abandon all principles and do whatever it takes to ensure that every Englishman, wherever he may be, is available for selection. Well, here’s an alternative suggestion. Scrap the clause. Now. It is proving to be more hassle than it is worth. Lancaster, his assistants and his employers are being stalked by calls for Armitage to be called into the national squad, as befitting his supreme exploits for Toulon. But that is to ignore the coaches’ reservations, and the realisation that the fall-out from a shift in policy would have long-term repercussions. Former Bath full back Nick Abendanon was outstanding for Clermont as they tore Saracens to shreds . Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage has been one of the standout forwards in Europe in recent seasons . Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea believes the 'exceptional' clause could cause major problems . England hooker Tom Youngs also thinks the clause could create tension in the current international set-up . This is not to decry a quality flanker who has excelled among the Galacticos at his club, but this situation cannot go on. England are being held hostage by their own edict, so why not just ditch the ‘exceptional’ clause and end the out-cry? Critics of the union’s stance over-look the consequences for the club game in this country if there is no restriction in place. This column concurs with Conor O’Shea, who said: ‘It is pure populism to say it is World Cup year and we should do anything we can because the minute you break that (policy), you break the dam. There are always exceptional circumstances. Then there will be the next one and the next one and the next one.’ Leicester’s England hooker, Tom Youngs added: ‘I don’t know how well it would go down with the team. Stuart has built a culture with this group of players. Does he want to disrupt it?’ The 'exceptional' clause rule has continued to heap pressure on Stuart Lancaster and his coaching staff . Fair point. Tell players they have to stay to be considered, then at the 11th hour perform a U-turn and select exiles; that is a short-cut to unrest, surely? This is no restraint of trade either – those who wish to go abroad can do so freely, but the knock-on effect is clear. Well, it is reasonably clear. It would be clearer still if the RFU and England really had the courage of their convictions and abolished the clause entirely. Sam Burgess’s heavily-scrutinised conversion to rugby union will take an intriguing twist on Friday night, when he starts at blindside flanker for Bath against Newcastle at Kingston Park. He has been striving to make an impact in midfield for four months, but his club’s head coach, Mike Ford, insisted long ago that back row would be his ultimate home. There are potential implications for Burgess’s quest to earn a place in England’s World Cup squad, as Lancaster sees him as a candidate to play at inside centre. Sam Burgess's rugby evolution continues on Friday as he starts at blindside flanker against Newcastle . However, despite widespread misgivings about the former league icon’s exploits to date in his new code, he will be included in England’s training squad announced next month, providing he is fit. That is a given. In addition, any further doubts about Manu Tuilagi’s health will further enhance Burgess’s prospects of making it to the World Cup – as a powerful ball-carrier who can break tackles and off-load. The England coaches will back themselves to mould him to their vision, given three months to do so. Finally, the back-row experiment makes sense. Burgess needs the ball in his hands more, in order to make his presence felt, so wearing No 6 addresses that. When it comes to matchday atmosphere, the Stade Marcel Michelin is hard to beat . It is well documented that English clubs cannot compete with their French rivals when it comes to transfer-market clout, but they are also being eclipsed in the atmosphere stakes too. Last weekend, the cacophony at Stade Marcel Michelin – for Clermont vs Northampton – was on a different level to anything experienced here. In this observer’s opinion, the noise and colour at Stade Felix Mayol the next day, as Wasps took on holders Toulon, was similar, if not quite as relentlessly raucous. Many Premiership grounds are full, but they lack the constant bedlam to be found in the best Gallic arenas. The Millennium Stadium when a big Test is on takes some beating, while Thomond Park, Limerick, is the spiritual home of supporter fanaticism, closely followed by Ravenhill when Ulster play under lights. Munster's home stadium Thomond Park is another fortress that generates a unique atmosphere . But Clermont lead the atmosphere league table. It’s not necessarily a great place to go in support of doomed visitors, but those who haven’t been should try it as neutrals, for a big French Top 14 clash. The place produces an epic occasion founded on fervent civic pride. CORBISIERO'S STRUGGLES RAISE DOUBTS . When certain players go down in pain and require treatment on the field, there is a particular sense of foreboding. Alex Corbisiero is in that category. The Northampton prop didn’t feature for England during the recent Six Nations and was forced off during the Saints’ thumping defeat at Clermont last weekend, apparently suffering discomfort in his right knee – which has been a problem area before. More recently, the Lions loosehead was laid low with a shoulder injury and he could be seen flexing that joint at Stade Marcel Michelin. Corbisiero hasn’t started a Test for England for 28 months. His club insist this latest setback is ‘only a bruise’, but there will be grave doubts about this world-class player’s ability to scale the heights again, until he plays regularly without mishap. Northampton prop Alex Corbisiero has not started a game for England in nearly two years . Saints and England lock Courtney Lawes is a doubt for his side's clash with Exeter on Sunday . Courtney Lawes has what Northampton are calling a ‘bad shoulder’ and may not feature in Sunday’s clash with Exeter. There was better news for Saracens on Thursday, as Jacques Burger will be available for their Champions Cup semi-final against Clermont, after escaping with a one-match ban for striking Maxime Machenaud of Racing Metro. LAST WORD . Now that he has been duly confirmed as one of the 12 referees appointed for the World Cup, Nigel Owens should just go ahead and book his room in the Twickenham area for the final on October 31. The Welshman is close to being a shoo-in for that showpiece occasion, unless his cause is shattered by Warren Gatland’s national team emerging from the ‘Pool of Death’ and going one step further than they did four years ago. It is no coincidence that Owens has presided over many of the greatest encounters at Test and club level in recent years. Nigel Owens (left) is the frontrunner to referee the World Cup final, unless Wales make it there of course . His empathy, style of communication and desire to let the game flow mean he is respected worldwide. He has acquired a high profile, but it does nothing to detract from his professionalism. Happily, this year’s tournament cannot be tarnished by the attention-seeking antics of Alain Rolland and Steve Walsh, who have both retired. Referees are there to monitor, adjudicate and facilitate, not try to up-stage the teams and players.","Nick Abendanon was sublime in Clermont's 37-5 win against Northampton .

"All eyes will be on AP McCoy as he bids for a dream end to his career but I have a strong feeling that a horse he could have ridden is going to come back to haunt him. The 19-time champion jockey could have ridden Cause of Causes who, like his mount Shutthefrontdoor, is owned by his boss JP McManus. He has ridden him three times before. While it was ultimately no surprise he chose Shutthefrontdoor, a runner with strong credentials, Cause of Causes also has very good reasons why he should be backed. Cause of Causes at Cheltenham last month . He was second at the 2014 Cheltenham Festival and then landed the four-mile National Hunt Chase at last month’s meeting. That marks him down as a quality performer, and he is ridden by a Grand National winning jockey in Paul Carberry (Bobbyjo, 1999) and trained by a race-winning trainer in Gordon Elliott (Silver Birch, 2007). His four mile Cheltenham win indicates reserves of stamina for the four-and-a-half-mile, 30-fence test which I like to see in my Grand National hopes. Shutthefrontdoor, the 2014 Irish National winner, is also strong on that score. I like last year’s runner-up Balthazar King and 2014 Scottish National winner Al Co, as well as Godsmejudge, second in that race having won it in 2013. For those looking for an each-way punt at more speculative odds, Royale Knight is a horse which has caught my eye. I will be cheering on my two sons. Tom rides Soll, another runner with a serious chance of a light weight, while Michael trains Monbeg Dude, last year’s seventh owned by a trio of rugby players including former England captain Mike Tindall. He could easily nick a place.","AP McCoy could have ridden Cause of Causes in the Grand National on Saturday .

"In a week where people have been highlighting the lack of young English talent in the Premier League, it’s good to see three youngsters playing in my old position have really caught the eye this season. Calum Chambers, Eric Dier and John Stones have all enjoyed excellent Premier League campaigns. Defence is not the easiest area for a young player to make an impression — managers can be reluctant to trust youth in a position of responsibility — but these three have done just that. What sets them apart is their self-belief. Chambers and Stones are still 20 and Dier is 21, but there are no signs of fear in their games. Arsenal defender Calum Chambers (left) has impressed in his first season at the club . Everton defender John Stones (right) puts in a challenge against Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge . Tottenham defender Eric Dier (left) has grown in stature as the season has progressed at White Hart Lane . In a way, we shouldn’t really be surprised. Between them they have cost £19million, so they are not exactly surprise packages. What has been surprising is the way they have come on this season. They are by no means the finished article, but their progress is encouraging. It helps that all three have had a taste of playing at full back. I think they are all destined to become top central defenders, but if you are mobile enough, you are often asked to do a job at full back. At this stage it certainly does no harm to your development. I remember playing at right back before moving to the middle. You need pace and stamina to bomb up and down but when it comes to playing at centre half, that agility can be of huge benefit. I first saw Dier playing for the England Under 20s and he still looked raw. He was a powerful, quick right back who charged up and down, but he needed more control. I felt his body type made him ideally suited to centre half and he has made that position his own at Tottenham. Dier (left) stood up strongly against Chelsea striker Diego Costa in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley . Stones has moved across from right back into the centre of defence for Everton and has flourished . His rise has been quite spectacular. He has gone from a promising squad player to a first-team regular alongside Jan Vertonghen. He moves the ball well, is technically very good and he is a fighter — he stood up well to Diego Costa in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley. The next step for him is to become a vocal leader. The best central defenders demand so much from those around them and if that mentality is drilled into him, Dier could improve Tottenham’s rather soft underbelly. Stones has spent time at right back but now finds himself at the heart of the Everton defence. He is very comfortable on the ball, has good speed and reads the game well so is rarely beaten one on one. He can tackle with either foot and his timing is excellent — just when you think he is beaten, he nicks the ball. He is comfortable playing out of defence but he has to be careful not to overplay. He is good in the air but can improve, especially from wide crosses and set-pieces. Experience will help him become more wily. With Chambers, I never doubted he was going to the right club, but I did wonder how many games he would play at Arsenal. With lots of competition for places, he has a real fight on his hands but he has already made 35 appearances this season. Of the three he is the best on the ball and if he makes a mistake, there is no drop in confidence — he still wants to make forward passes. That passing ability means there could be value in trying him in midfield, though that would require careful planning to bed him in. Chambers (right) has played at right back, centre-back and midfield for Arsenal during the season . England manager Roy Hodgson could be tempted to field the trio in a back three for the Three Lions . In one on ones, sometimes he doesn’t look set. He likes to put an arm on the attacker to slow them down and that’s partly why he has picked up eight bookings this season and been sent off. He tries to win the ball in the first few strides and can be prone to gambling. All three have taken huge steps forward this season, and with England using two centre-back partnerships in the last two games, those positions could be up for grabs. And if Roy Hodgson wants to fit more attacking players into his England side in the future, there’s no reason why this trio, with their experiences at full back, couldn’t play together in a back three. It would certainly be a useful option.","Calum Chambers has played 35 times already for Arsenal this season .

"There will be a white-hot atmosphere at White Hart Lane on Saturday afternoon when Aston Villa come to town but Tim Sherwood has got to keep his emotions in check. This is about what happens on the pitch, not the touchline. The Villa boss is a passionate man but he can’t afford to let things get personal. He did a good job at Tottenham — he’s never afraid to talk about having the best Premier League win percentage of any Spurs boss  — but was still not trusted with the job long-term. That will hurt. He was in charge of the youth set-up for years and the club are now reaping the rewards with a team full of academy players, but he is more than just a company man. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood returns to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham this weekend . When he was finally given a shot at the top job his personality came flooding through. Incredibly driven and extremely confident, he did not take long to make a mark but it was an uneasy relationship and did not last long. That was a shame, because he is talented and I like to see as many former players as possible in managerial roles. There is so much knowledge to harness. At Aston Villa, he has set the emotional bar high but it’s working. Villa were lacking confidence all season and it looked like they lacked the ambition to win games. Sherwood’s intensity has sparked them back to life. He has revived Christian Benteke in the same way as he did for Emmanuel Adebayor last season. Sherwood clearly targets players he feels can make the biggest impact and sets to work. Sherwood lets his feelings be known as he celebrates a goal at Villa Park against Queens Park Rangers . Sherwood launches his jacket to the ground in celebration after Aston Villa pulled level against QPR . Sherwood grimaces as the Villa mascot - wearing the famous Tim Sherwood gilet - embraces him . The big Belgian has seven goals in five games and looks a top player again. He was not affecting games but now his team-mates find him early. There’s nothing wrong with being direct and Benteke is a beast when you get him on the ball. Sherwood is still searching for a balance in midfield but he has given Charles N’Zogbia a chance and still has an eye on youth with talent such as Jack Grealish coming through. Sherwood’s emotional style can be great for a player — his antics on the touchline prove how much it means to him — but it has its drawbacks. He is never afraid to tell his players what he thinks of them. That encourages some but footballers can be sensitive souls. The Villa squad won’t like being called ‘icing-on-the-cake players’ and I’m sure a few at Tottenham will remember being told they ‘lack character’ and ‘are too nice’. Sherwood certainly knew how to get the best out of Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor . Big Belgian international Christian Benteke is another striker enjoying working under Sherwood . When I was at Arsenal and George Graham came back to the club as Leeds boss, there was an extra determination to beat him. I expect Spurs to be exactly the same with Sherwood. There’s no doubt he’s talented but he has to be careful not to let his emotions get the better of him. Les Ferdinand told me when they worked together at Spurs, Tim needed a calming influence alongside him, as long as it was a peer he could respect. Les was the perfect foil. Don’t be surprised if Sherwood appoints someone like Ferdinand at Villa. It will be interesting to see what kind of reception Sherwood gets on Saturday. But with Villa staring at a relegation battle this is not about unfinished business or gilet throwing. This is about the result. That’s why Tim has to keep his cool. Sherwood shouts at his players as they look to earn an important victory at home to QPR . Sherwood shares a smile with Les Ferdinand during their time at White Hart Lane together .","Sherwood is a passionate man but he can’t afford to let things get personal .

"Tony McCoy thanked the racing public for making the last two months of his career the most memorable of all as their appreciation helped him cope with the thought of retirement. Since announcing his intention to retire in February, McCoy has enjoyed a farewell tour up and down the country as well as travelling over to Ireland, with the attendance at usually mundane midweek meetings boosted by his presence. The adulation shown to him has made the 20-times champion jockey realise just how much he affected the lives of the racing fraternity but while the decision to quit seemed to some to come out of the blue, McCoy feels he owes it to his family to go out at the top. Tony McCoy holds the jockeys championship trophy he won for the 20th  time on the day he retires . Northern Irishman McCoy shows his emotion at Sandown Park after the final race of his career . McCoy says the response to his retirement announcement has made his final months in the saddle easier . Speaking to At The Races on the first morning he could no longer call himself a jockey he said: 'We had a very good night but I've just got up and haven't got round to eating breakfast yet. I can smell it, though, and someone has done the right thing and cooked me a nice breakfast. 'It was very difficult to take it all in yesterday, the crowd, the people round the parade ring, the great racing public came out in force and I was very flattered and honoured by it all. 'To get a reception like that for doing something I've loved to do for pretty much all my life, I'm really going to miss it. 'I told all the lads yesterday to enjoy it while you're doing it because the end comes quickly. 'It's very nice to feel that I have the respect of people up and down the country. For the last 21 years I've ridden up and down the country pretty much full on but over the last two and a half months people have come out to give me a wonderful welcome and I'm very grateful of that. 'It would be very difficult not to notice how that has developed and I'd like to thank all those people for coming out and making the last few months of my career so special and making it a little bit easier.

McCoy stands with his wife Chanelle and children Eve and Archie with the trophy he's won 20 times in a row . McCoy waves goodbye to the fans who line the fence and pack the racecourse to see his final ride . McCoy said he had initially thought he could go quietly on his final day at Sandown but his agent Dave Roberts helped him come to the decision of making the announcement early and giving racing fans a chance to say their farewells. 'When I decided to retire I always thought I'd go to Sandown on the last day and say 'thanks very much' but having spoken to Dave, he said I was very privileged to be champion jockey for the 20th time and we kind of felt, for my own piece of mind, to do it like we did would help me come to terms with actually retiring,' he said. 'We also felt it might be a good thing for racing, people probably deserved to know. 'I thought it would die down but it never really did and those are things I'll remember for ever. When I looked around yesterday, as difficult as it was it helped me realise I'd made the right decision.' 'If I'd carried on and maybe not been as good as I was a lot of these people might not have come out. It's hard to say it but it is probably the right decision. 'I feel satisfied through what has happened with my life but I've also said I'd love another go because I feel I could still do it better than anybody! 'I never felt like I did a day's work in my life, I've felt a lot of satisfaction and fulfilment and I'm very proud of what I've been lucky enough to achieve but so many people have helped that happen, I was just the lucky one who got on the best horse most of the time. 'The owners, the trainers, the lads, the horses, I could go on all day thanking people. McCoy said he thought he could retire quietly but is glad he's had the chance to farewell racing properly . Sandown Park was packed out for the champion jockey's finale on Saturday in Esher . McCoy said there were 'a lot' of things he would miss about racing but also some aspects of the tough sport that he will be happy to see the back of. 'Like spending a lot of time in a hospital and ringing doctors begging for help to make me better,' he said. 'Obviously my wife Chanelle wanted me to retire but at the same time I knew myself it was the right time for my family, my mum and dad are in their 70s now and don't enjoy watching me as much any more because of the dangers involved so it certainly makes their life easier. 'I never thought of the dangers and when I got injured I felt I was unlucky and it wouldn't happen again but I know the dangers and they first became apparent to me when I was at Toby Balding's and Richard Davies died and just lately you only need to see what happened to John Thomas (McNamara) and Robbie McNamara.'","AP McCoy rode in his last races on Saturday at Sandown Park .

"The title race might be all but over but the fight for survival is only just beginning. At the end of March, Leicester were bottom of the table with 19 points, seven off safety. Win on Saturday and they will be out of the relegation zone. For Nigel Pearson and his men, their season starts now. When you’re facing relegation you are supposed to be dispirited and lacking in confidence. So how on earth have Leicester won three on the bounce? Only Arsenal (8) and Chelsea (4) can better that as a winning streak. Leicester players are full of confidence after three successive victories in the Premier League . It has been a superhuman effort and they have fought to get themselves in a position where they have something to play for. Leicester were bottom on Christmas Day but win at Burnley and they will give themselves a real chance of staying up — something only two sides have managed after being bottom at Christmas. It’s not just Leicester, though. The other promoted clubs — QPR and Burnley — have shown fantastic spirit. I have been in relegation battles and seen teams with less fight in them than these three. QPR earned a fantastic win at West Brom, were unlucky to draw at Aston Villa and battled manfully against Chelsea. Burnley might be on a poor run but you know Sean Dyche’s side will battle until the bitter end. So how does a manager create a positive attitude when things look so bad? What you can’t afford to do is let players sit and study the fixtures and start looking at how many points they need. If they are too busy working out the permutations, they’re not concentrating on their game. Leicester face a crunch clash with fellow relegation battlers Burnley on Saturday . If a player is not being pushed it’s easy for them to shift responsibility and hope somebody else gets them over the line. The best thing to do is keep them busy. If you’re working hard on the training ground looking at team shape, developing players and preparing for games, you are making much better use of your time. I’ve been in that situation as a player and the worst thing you can do is to wrap them in cotton wool. There is a tendency to try to protect people in case things go wrong. Training eases up because of injury fears and managers try to keep their players fresh. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has managed to create a positive attitude in his squad . But that leaves you sitting around with your thoughts and that can be dangerous. There needs to be mental stimulation — you can’t sit around and wallow in self-pity. At this stage of the season a week can be a long time between games. Pearson and his players will be absolutely buzzing in training and it’s important to take that energy and intensity into games. It annoys me when managers say it’s all about results. The only way to win is to make sure that your performance is right and that comes from hard work during the week. Pearson has worked hard to make sure Leicester’s destiny is in their own hands. Their form has struck fear into other teams. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring in the 2-0 victory against Swansea . The three promoted sides look brave enough to go out and play, but Sunderland and Hull look paralysed by fear. Steve Bruce thinks Hull’s home form will keep them up but a look at the fixtures shows it won’t be that easy. Leicester, QPR and Burnley have all given their home fans reason to cheer with their efforts and the thrill of the chase means everything is applauded. Contrast that with the toxic feeling at the Stadium of Light. Leicester have taken a long time to wake up but they have rekindled the atmosphere they had when they beat Manchester United. And with four of their last six games at home, they need to keep that up. If they can, and the level of their performance continues to harness the positivity of that home crowd, don’t bet against them making the great escape. Fans still believe that Leicester can still avoid the drop from the Premier League .","Leicester can move out of the drop zone by beating Burnley on Saturday .

"When Ulster confirmed the audacious signing of All Black wing Charles Piutau this week, the scale of their transfer coup was illustrated by the complaints emanating from New Zealand. ‘I’m extremely disappointed he’s going,’ said Steve Hansen, coach of the world champions, having learned that the 23-year-old had rejected a new deal with the Blues and NZRU in favour of a season in Belfast, in 2016-17. His views were echoed, more robustly, by commentators and fans alike. That might not be the end of the short-term Kiwi exodus, despite Jerome Kaino’s decision to stick around in favour of a shot at the Lions in 2017. Charles Piutau rejected a new deal with the Blues and NZRU in favour of a season in Belfast . Fly-half Colin Slade is thought to be deciding between a move to Toulon or Pau in France – while the latter club have already landed Conrad Smith. The prospect of piles of Euros and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the Top 14 league the destination du jour, for southern stars seeking a stint abroad. What makes the Piutau deal so eye-catching is that it is a bold endorsement of Ulster’s ambition and also a boost to the wider Celtic game, below Test level. That boost is much-needed, because there are simmering problems – as exposed and bemoaned by Leinster’s head coach Matt O’Connor last weekend. The Australian was infuriated by the softly-softly stance of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose final say on release of Test players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the Pro 12 clash with leaders Glasgow. Alun Wyn Jones can put his body on the line for Ospreys and Wales . ‘It hurts the league,’ said the Australian, which is absolutely true. The Pro 12 has a credibility issue, due to the continuing absence of so many Irish stars from so many matches. While player welfare is quite rightly prioritised, there is a feeling that the national management go too far on occasions. No wonder the Welsh regions were so keen to align themselves with the Aviva Premiership clubs during the European rebellion last year. A leading figure such as Alun Wyn Jones gives body and soul to the Ospreys week after week, but still found the energy to face down the more rested Irish in Cardiff during the Six Nations. He and so many others in Wales would enhance the Premiership. If the Irish cannot fully commit to a league – making it a fitting stage for Piutau’s class – they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for European combat with their provinces. Scrap the LV Cup and bring the regions into an expanded Premiership. Job done. Wasps forward Hughes was clumsy, not reckless . Wasps players were incensed by the three-game ban handed to their No 8, Nathan Hughes, for the collision which left George North unconscious last Friday night, and their angst is understandable. The big Fijian was clumsy, but no more, by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the Lions wing, as he scored a try. Nathan Hughes was clumsy rather than reckless and didn't deserve a three-game ban . The disciplinary panel called the offence ‘reckless’ and the reaction of Wasps captain James Haskell was priceless. ‘Rugby is reckless,’ he said. ‘The whole game is reckless. If you’re going to worry about that… maybe we should all be wearing foam suits and playing touch.’ The England flanker had a point. The sport is founded on physicality and danger. A player who has scored a try deserves to be protected from belated, damaging contact, however accidental, but the suspicion lingers that Hughes is serving a ban because North was knocked out. If the scorer had jumped up and walked off, it’s fair to guess that the red card might have sufficed. Fill World Cup seats or face fan fury . Is anyone really surprised that trying to buy World Cup tickets is such a drawn-out ordeal? For those without the benefit of a corporate invite (or a media pass, before anyone pipes up), securing entry to a modern sporting showpiece is as appealing as a morning of root-canal treatment and as likely to deliver the desired outcome as a lottery ticket. The Webb Ellis Cup visits a school in Toronto as part of the Rugby World Cup Trophy Tour . We are in the cost-cutting age of do-it-all-online, so thousands of wannabe spectators were forced to endure endless hours of staring at a seemingly frozen screen on Monday. At least the old-fashioned system of queuing in person could foster a certain collective spirit, as so wonderfully evident at Wimbledon tennis down the years. Ultimately, the World Cup will be a sell-out, but organisers better be right when they say there won’t be the empty seats which blighted the Olympics. As if being stuck on the outside with noses pressed against the glass is not bad enough, those denied tickets will be apoplectic if hordes of well-heeled ‘guests’ can’t be bothered to leave their plush marquee and venture into the arena, or even turn up at all. Signing Sinfield is an inspired move . It’s been dismissed in some quarters as a mere publicity stunt, which is harsh on all concerned. Kevin Sinfield is a colossus of rugby league who is switching codes in Leeds later this year, from the Rhinos to Yorkshire Carnegie. Yorkshire Carnegie's signing of rugby league legend Kevin Sinfield is a statement of intent . He wants to play fly-half and while the prospect of him igniting the Championship at the age of 34 is far-fetched, he is a proven leader and winner, and his mentality is what the union side at Headingley are keen to tap into. No doubt, he’ll bring a few more through the turnstiles, too, but coach Bryan Redpath will want him to provide inspiration to the rookies around him. It is a worthwhile roll of the dice and amid talk of an end to promotion and relegation, Leeds are another second-tier club demonstrating a desire to be upwardly mobile. Last Word . Team GB, under the auspices of England, face the growing threat of having to come through a qualifying competition this summer in order to reach the Olympic Sevens tournament in Rio. In Hong Kong last weekend, Simon Amor’s side – nominated as the best prospect to qualify on behalf of Great Britain, ahead of Wales and Scotland – lost further ground to Australia and remain stuck in fifth place in the world rankings, one below the final qualification slot. This weekend in Tokyo, they must try to catch their rivals from Down Under, but they have been drawn in a pool with Fiji, who won in Hong Kong and are second in the rankings behind South Africa. Realistically, one Olympic place is up for grabs, behind those nations and New Zealand, and England’s advantage is that the series culminates at Twickenham next month. Sadly, Team GB’s preparations – complicated by the presence of separate home nations in rugby – have been marred by a chronic lack of clarity and foresight, and being forced to enter what amounts to a repechage event would be somehow fitting.","Capture of Charles Piutau is a bold endorsement of Ulster's ambition .

"AP McCoy stood with the trainer, Jonjo O’Neill, in the parade ring. He tried to talk but his mind was elsewhere. He was waiting for the end to come. At 4.15pm a bell rang out. McCoy did not need to be reminded for whom it tolled. He knew it tolled for him. He obeyed the signal for the jockeys to mount. He walked alongside Box Office, the final ride of his astonishing career, and then clambered into the saddle. The tears streamed down his face but he pulled down his goggles so that nobody would see. He rode out on to the course. McCoy was presented the Champion Jockey trophy by Ian Wright - McCoy is an Arsenal fanatic . The 40-year-old received a guard of honour before receiving the Champion Jockey trophy . He knew this would be a strange day. He was aware it was being styled as a joyous celebration of the career of the greatest jump jockey there has ever been. ‘The Champ, The Finale’ it said on the front of Sandown Park’s raceday programme. But McCoy knew, too, that, for him, the day of his retirement would be a day filled with sadness and dread. Earlier in the afternoon, he had ridden Mr Mole into third place in the bet365 AP McCoy Celebration Chase. Now, he had one last shot at giving Sandown’s biggest crowd for a decade what they wanted by riding a winner. So one last time, he rode a mount around the Surrey track, racing the rest of the field and one of the red-and-blue trains that hurry along behind the tree line on the far side of the course, towards Waterloo. A film script would have delivered his 4,358th winner but sport is more capricious than celluloid. And so it delivered an irony. The last race of McCoy’s career, the bet365 Handicap Hurdle, was won by Richard Johnson, 15 times a runner-up to McCoy in the jockeys’ championship. The two men are great friends but this was one small act of revenge for 20 years of being a bridesmaid. McCoy, 40, finished third. He pushed Box Office all the way to the line and took the congratulations of his fellow jockeys as they and their horses milled around him. He was about to head towards the winner’s enclosure when he was ushered back along the track. Now the emotion really bit. McCoy and Box Office trotted back in front of the stands packed with 18,000 cheering fans. One man and his horse. There was something wonderfully moving about the tribute. Maybe it was just its simplicity. An old gunslinger was riding off into the sunset. The champion jockey was joined by his wife Channelle, daughter Eve and son Archie on his last day of racing . In the winner’s enclosure, he dismounted amid scarcely controlled chaos. A couple of photographers had climbed the little horse chestnut tree that stands outside the weighing room and perched in its lower branches to get a better shot. A television reporter put his microphone under McCoy’s nose and paid fulsome tribute to him, telling him he wanted to thank him not just for today but the last 20 years. McCoy could only nod. He could not speak any more. All day, it was impossible to get away from those themes of joy and despair. Everyone wanted McCoy to be happy, to depart gladly from his glory game, but everywhere he went, he looked as if he were being led to the gallows. The Irish jockey (left) was unable to leave on a winning note as he raced on the aptly named Box Office . It was like that when the rest of the jockeys who have trailed in his wake for so long formed an honour guard as he walked into the parade ring to be presented with the Champion Jockey Trophy for the 20th consecutive time, by Ian Wright, one of McCoy’s Arsenal heroes. Some of the jockeys were in tears. McCoy looked grim. Forget all the talk of new beginnings and how this would be a brave new phase of his life. McCoy was having none of it. He did not try to put a brave face on what was happening. He did not even pretend he was thinking about new beginnings. His mind told him just one thing – this is the end, beautiful friend. It has been beautiful, too. It has broken bones in almost every part of his body and it has demanded continuous sacrifice but it has brought him unparalleled success and universal respect. He stands alongside men like Andy Murray, Sir Steve Redgrave, Sir Chris Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins as the greatest modern British sportsmen. It is difficult to set the parameters for greatness, particularly when trying to measure a jockey against heroes of other sports. But whatever criteria you use, it is hard to outstrip McCoy for the relentlessness of his domination. The racing legend was swamped by photographers and punters following his last professional race . Michael Jordan is probably the greatest star basketball ever and he won six NBA championships in two bursts of three consecutive titles. Wayne Gretzky was the best player in ice hockey for many years and still holds 60 NHL records but he won the Stanley Cup just four times. Of the greats of individual modern sport, Tiger Woods stayed at the top of his sport for 545 consecutive weeks and Roger Federer for 237 weeks. McCoy stayed at the top for 1,040 consecutive weeks. It is hard to call an end to a career like that — and in the 11 weeks since he announced this would be his last season, he has never tried to disguise the pain. Time and again in interviews on Saturday, he said the thing uppermost in his mind. ‘If I could say one thing to all the guys in the weighing room,’ he said, ‘it would be to enjoy it as much as they can because the end doesn’t half come around very quick.’ Sandown Park was packed with punters and the media who were eager to give him a memorable send off . McCoy, who was named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2010 after he finally won the Grand National, was given plenty of opportunities to talk about the benefits a life without racing might bring. He did not take any of them. After his final race, he was ushered into a white marquee, flanked by O’Neill and the owner, JP McManus, for a final press conference. He looked blank. He looked stunned. His voice was flat. He tried humour. Someone ventured his record of 20 championships in a row and 4,348 winners over jumps would never be broken. ‘All records are broken,’ McCoy said. ‘I hope I’m dead when it happens. It’ll take someone at least 20 years so I’ll probably be in a home by then, or doting.’ But most of the time, he did not attempt levity. He said he wished he could start his racing career all over again — ‘I have got nothing to look forward to now.’ O’Neill nudged him. ‘Apart from my wife and kids,’ McCoy added, hurriedly. ‘Jonjo got in just in time then.’ Crowds wee packed into Sandown to wish McCoy well in his final two rides . A few years ago, McCoy talked about the realities that his wife had had to live with as the partner of a man so utterly dedicated to a dangerous sport. He recalled the moment they had been for a fertility check and were told that McCoy’s habit of taking hot baths every day to sweat weight off had made his sperm count abnormally low. ‘Chanelle was busy putting things into perspective,’ McCoy remembered. ‘“Anthony is a jockey, he rides horses at 30 miles per hour over fences every day of the week, two ambulances follow him around while he works, he could come home in a wheelchair one day. That would be an issue. This is not an issue”.’ Soon after that, they started IVF treatment and in 2007, Chanelle gave birth to a daughter, Eve. On Saturday, as McCoy carried the Champion Jockey Trophy around the parade ring at Sandown, Eve ran after him in her little white dress, outside the cluster of photographers who tracked his every move. ‘Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,’ she kept shouting, treating it as a game. Her daddy did not hear her above the din. Now, though, the din has gone. McCoy is pictured in third during his last ever ride in his career at Sandown on Saturday .

"Former Real Madrid ace Kaka and Canadian international Cyle Larin proved the difference as Orlando City earned all three points against Portland Timbers at a sold-out Providence Park. Canadian international Larin reacted quickest to chest home the delivery of Kevin Molino in the first-half before Kaka sealed the win with a penalty in the closing stages of the match. Darlington Nagbe proved the Timbers biggest threat, but Aurelien Collin and co stood strong in defence to earn Orlando their second away win of the season. Former Real Madrid ace Kaka runs at the Portland Timbers defence at Providence Park in Oregon . Like so often in the early stages of this season, all eyes were on former Real Madrid ace Kaka as traveling Orlando looked to continue their unbeaten away run. Creating chances for fun has been the Brazilians job since arriving in America, but it was English representative Ridgewell who had the biggest influence of the first-half. Ridgewell, who enjoyed spells with Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion, failed to deal with a clearance as Orlando threatened the Timbers defence. His week header fell kindly to Molino who flashed the ball across goal before the ball struck Larin and evaded goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey. On first glance the goal seemed fortunate, but video replays showed Larin turn and chest the ball into the goal smartly to give Orlando the lead. Kaka's second-half penatly helped Orlando City win their second away game of the season . Nagbe tried and failed to rally the lacklustre Timbers in the second-half, but his teammates struggled to get on the same wavelength as the Liberian attacker. The hosts were lucky to end the game with all 11-men when goalkeeper Kwarasey took down substitute Carlos Rivas in the closing stages. Kwarasey avoided dismissal but was unable to stop Kaka from doubling Orlando’s lead from the spot to send Adrian Heath’s side third in the table.

"I see Usain Bolt on the circuit and he’s always good fun. He likes to make jokes of me! I remember in Moscow, at the last World Championships, when I was competing in the 200m when most people saw me as a 100m runner, he killed me in the warmup. ‘What are you doing?’ he asked me. ‘This is for the 200m runners – the 100m was a few days ago. You missed it.’ I told him I was doing the 200m. ‘Why? he asked again. I said I wanted to try it. He was winding me up. It was helping me relax, actually. It was very nice. Adam Gemili says Usain Bolt is a joker on the circuit and gives him great advice . The young British athlete says he is nowhere near Bolt's standard at the moment but it could be his time soon . Gemili has announced his participation in the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games this summer . It obviously worked, as I then ran sub-20 and he was praising me a lot and saying great things about me. Bolt gave me some great advice to really enjoy athletics and have fun with it. He told me to have patience with it, make sure you keep enjoying it and you will get serious when you get a bit older and start to take it more seriously but don’t put pressure on yourself to perform. No matter whatever anyone says or writes, make sure you’re always having a good time. He’s good like that. I can take that into this year. I like to think I always have a great time when I go to compete. I always give a big smile before races because you never get bored of that feeling; people cheering for you and making you feel like ‘wow’ all this training you’ve done in the winter and throwing up on the track, all the hard slog is worth it. It’s a brilliant feeling. Hopefully I can get a bit more serious, now that I’ve just finished uni and I will start to get a bit more competitive with those guys. I don’t think Bolt will be too worried about me at the moment, he’s something special when he gets himself into shape and competing. I’m very lucky to be around at this time when he’s at his peak and running. To be in the mix and be a part of these guys is nice. Bolt has been beaten before, which shows he is only human. After those guys have retired — sprinters like Tyson Gay and Justin Gatlin — it’ s quite open for people to step in and take the mantle. Obviously the American and Jamaican sprinters have always been the top dogs, they are very powerful nations and hard guys to beat. In Britain and Europe we have some great young names coming through that can go on and push the performances up. I’d like to think there is a chance for British sprinters to step into the void. We don’t do the sport to come second or third. You do the sport to try to be the best. There will be a nice little gap opening and it will encourage a lot of people to step up their performance .

"I’ve been out injured for a whole year now, but I’m finally on the verge of a return to regular training. It’ll be such a relief after such a long time out. I’m actually in my last week of rehab at the moment, then I’ll transfer to normal training and introduce more cycling into my routine. The year has been so mentally and physically tough, but now I can finally look forward. Sportsmail's Road to Rio cyclist Becky James is desperate to get back on to the track after her recent injuries . James, pictured during a fashion shoot in Manchester, has been sidelined for a whole year . British cyclist James supported boyfriend George North during Wales'  Six Nations campaign . The most frustrating thing was that one moment I’d be completely fine on the bike, then the next I would be in a lot of pain. This happened a lot during my training up in Manchester, so in October we all sat down and decided the best thing was to send me to Bisham Abbey rehabilitation centre. They had everything I needed there – physios, masseurs, coaches – and they did such a great job getting me better up until I left there three weeks ago. Of course, if I didn’t have my National Lottery funding I wouldn’t be able to go through all this. It’s so great that, despite my injury, they carried on supporting me the whole time. You’d think that, with 12 months away from the bike, I’d have plenty of time to myself. But in reality, I never thought I’d be out for that long – I kept having setbacks after thinking I was about to return so I couldn’t stop and enjoy myself. Obviously, there was the stress of being injured as well – but my puppy Lola helped me with that! I did, however, see plenty of the Six Nations, which I don’t usually get to do because it clashes with my season. Though being at the Millennium Stadium for the opening loss to England wasn’t great – you can imagine how my boyfriend George North took it. All in all, this injury could have made or broken me. There were many times I thought I was losing the battle, but I worked through any doubts I had. I have learnt a lot about myself in the last year – both as an athlete and a person – and I believe the whole experience will benefit me in the long run. Right now, with Rio 2016 on the horizon, I’m more motivated than ever.

"The jockey they all struggle to beat but also a rider no sane jockey would attempt to emulate. That is the verdict of colleague Andrew Thornton when trying to explain what has made AP McCoy such a dominant force in his sport. Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Thornton has been one of the few weighing room colleagues to witness McCoy's entire career, from shy newcomer to national sporting superstar. AP McCoy will race at Sandown on Saturday for the last time before he retires following a successful career . McCoy has two rides at Sandown on Saturday before he retires from professional racing for good . 'It is a bit like watching Lionel Messi on a horse,' said Thornton. 'He had so much time but he has a technique you wouldn't teach to anybody. 'It might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20-time champion but it is unique. He keeps the bit high up in the horse's mouth though the general rule is to drop your hands on the back of your mount's neck. But AP loves to be in 100 per cent control. Whatever his mount does, it is his decision. 'He judges pace so well. He leaves his runs later now and he adapted his style since he started riding for Jonjo O'Neill. 'When he was with Martin Pipe, it was often a case of make sure you put everyone to the sword a mile from home. He would probably even admit he got some horses beaten around Cheltenham in the early days that would not get beaten now. 'He is very aware of what is going on around him. If you look at this year's Grand National, and when he won it in 2010 on Don't Push It, he had so much room. He finds room in a race and uses it. 'You also never know how much he has left in the tank. You very rarely see him sitting still. It is a bit like a coiled spring.' McCoy (left) and wife Chanelle will host a party at home on Sunday for family and friends . Thornton, who needs fewer than 20 winners to reach 1,000 in his career, says age has mellowed McCoy, who is an unassuming figure among his colleagues. Former jockey Luke Harvey, now a TV presenter for At The Races, agrees. 'He has never been the big 'I am'. 'I used to run The Blowing Stone pub in Lambourn and he would come along even though he doesn't drink. 'He would stand in and play for the pool team and what p***ed you off was that he was good at that as well. McCoy and Mr Mole will have six rivals in the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday . 'Before he was married, his home was like a doss house, full of jockeys who got back late from racing and could not be bothered to go home. 'Seamus Durack (now a Lambourn trainer) bought a house but liked living at AP's so much he rented it out and stayed at AP's.' Richard Hughes, champion Flat jockey, is impressed by McCoy's legendary focus. 'I was on holiday with him in Portugal. AP played two days' golf, flew home to ride at Sedgefield and then back out to play the final day. We told him he was mad.'","AP McCoy has his final two rides at Sandown in Surrey on Saturday .

"For the first time since in 100 years, Arsenal will not start the season at the summit of England's top-flight, following the effective promotion of Bournemouth on Monday. The Cherries official name is AFC Bournemouth, meaning their name would start ahead of Arsenal's by virtue of the alphabet when the embryonic table is compiled upon the announcement of next season's fixtures. The Goldsands Stadium, home of AFC Bournemouth, will host Premier League football next season . Bournemouth's promotion means Arsenal will start season in second place for the first time in 100 years . Arsenal have theoretically started each season since 1915/16 at the summit of England's top tier, although the advent of the First World War meant it was only in 1919 that the club officially began their century-old record. The Gunners only finished fifth in the last pre-war competitive season, but they were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division after the First World War in 1919–20, at the expense of local rivals Tottenham. After Eddie Howe guided Bournemouth to within touching distance of the Promised Land on Monday with victory over Bolton, only a highly improbable goal-swing would deny them automatic promotion. As a result, Arsenal will begin next season second in the Premier League before a ball is kicked, behind the south coast club by a full 12 letters.

"Peerless champion jockey AP McCoy described the final day of his record-breaking career as ‘the hardest day’ of his life as he left Sandown on Saturday night and headed into retirement. And he also predicted someone will ultimately break his multitude of records. McCoy said: ‘Someone will break my records. All records are broken. I just hope I am dead when they do.’ McCoy, the iron-man of jump racing, shed tears as he paraded in front of the grandstand after finishing third on Box Office in the Bet365 Handicap Hurdle, his last-ever ride.

The retiring jocket was overcome with emotion after coming third on Box Office . McCoy had much to celebrate on Saturday despite his third-place finish in the bet365 Handicap Hurdle . Princess Anne, a renown horseman herself, told the Racing Post newspaper: 'I can only add my admiration to the epitome of a professional sportsman. Admiration that is heightened by my own, all too brief, experience of National Hunt Racing. 'To win 20 championships is an exceptional achievement, perhaps unmatched in any other sporting discipline, and he has done it in a tough, exhilarating and often dangerous sport. He has been a credit to horseracing and he goes out still at the top of his profession.' Arsene Wenger, manager of McCoy's beloved Arsenal, told Channel Four's The Morning Line: 'I would like to congratulate you for your outstanding career. It's absolutely exceptional what you have done. At Arsenal, we are inspired by that kind of dedication and quality and consistency you have shown in your career.' Sebastian Coe, double Olympic champion and organiser of the 2012 Olympics, said: 'Great is an overused word in sport - get a couple of England caps and you're suddenly a great player. Genius is probably a word less used but I think A.P McCoy is both. 'The guy is a genius in the saddle. It's just an extraordinary period of time that he has spanned - John Major still had two more years to run as Prime Minister! Put it in that context, you tell me anybody or anything that has maintained that level of market dominance. I think he's unique.' Steve Redgrave, Britain's greatest Olympian, summed it up. 'A.P has touched all our hearts. Truly a great to be remembered.' The race was ironically won by Brother Tedd, ridden by McCoy’s great rival and 15-time runner-up in the jockeys’ championship, Richard Johnson. McCoy had earlier also finished third on Mr Mole in the Celebration Chase named in his honour and won by Irish-trained favourite Special Tiara. The 20-time champion jockey said: ‘When I went back in front of the stands and heard all the people clapping, there was a lot of emotion. I was trying my hardest but there were tears coming back on Box Office. There were nearly tears going out on Box Office. I pulled my goggles down so no one would notice. ‘It was a very emotional day, something I will never forget and never expected. ‘The people have come out and supported me and I feel very honoured and very privileged. ‘In a lot of ways it had to be this way because if it wasn’t difficult it meant I wasn’t as good as I was and wasn’t enjoying my riding as much as I was. There was always a huge fear that I would not get out while I was as good as I was. As a sports person that is a very difficult thing to do before the dip comes.’ A sell-out crowd of 18,300 flocked to see McCoy’s career as a professional jump jockey in Britain end after 21 years. He was presented with his final champion’s trophy by Arsenal legend Ian Wright before riding Mr Mole and McCoy’s weighing room colleagues had formed a guard of honour as he entered the paddock for the presentation. McCoy’s final winner — the 4,348th of his career — will go down as Capard King at Ayr on April 17. Great rival Johnson completed a double by also winning the Oaksey Chase on Menorah.

And, as if to emphasise McCoy’s assertion that his records would be beaten, there was also a double for the new star of jump racing, 17-year-old Sean Bowen. The wins enabled the Welsh teenager to become the youngest winner of the conditional jockeys’ title. McCoy, who will attend part of next week’s Punchestown Festival as well as a wedding next weekend, was 19 when he won the same title. Bowen’s success on 14-1 shot Just A Par was the culmination of a fantastic first season which has yielded 49 wins. He has the same agent as McCoy in Dave Roberts, who said: ‘What he is doing is freaky. There is no other word for it. We want to keep his feet on the ground but he has some talent.’ McCoy, 40, who announced his intention to retire in February, had turned down the opportunity to take more rides on his final day as well as not riding the week before. It was his way of easing himself out of the sport he loves. The jockey also received a special award from Sandown presented by former Arsenal and Ireland star Liam Brady, who was McCoy’s childhood hero. ‘Race riding has been an addiction,’ added McCoy. ‘The reason I have not been riding as much was because I wanted to get myself prepared.

"They are proud words but ones spoken with relief coursing through them. They are a mother’s innately, protective words. AP McCoy’s mum. ‘We are all going to Sandown on Saturday,’ says Claire McCoy. ‘It will be emotional in one way and relief in another. I’ll be glad and I will be sorry too. He has had a great career. ‘Twenty five years. It is the end of an era. I would not say I enjoyed every day of it and it is great he is hopefully coming out in one piece. Tony McCoy poses with his mother Claire McCoy at Punchestown racecourse back in 2010 . ‘But in the last few weeks, since he announced his retirement, I have been more nervous. You are thinking please God get out of this without getting hurt.’ If you think Claire McCoy has got her maths wrong - twenty five years? – think again. There may seem a perfect symmetry in the way McCoy has decided to end his peerless career this weekend when he crowned champion after two decades at the top of his sport. But the timing is even better than it seems. Exactly 25 years ago, the 15-year-old AP left his home in Moneyglass, County Antrim, to head to the respected but strict regime of an apprentice jockey’s life at the stable of Jim Bolger in County Kilkenny. Claire says seeing ‘Anthony’ leave left her ‘heartbroken’. McCoy poses with his father Peader and two sisters Rosin and Jane at Limerick racecourse . She admits she still can’t believe her boy stuck it out at Bolger’s academy for four and a half years. But the steely, dogged determination that enabled her son to not just re-write racing’s history books but tear them up and start again was already in evidence. Claire said: ‘It was 25 years ago this week that he left to go to Jim Bolger’s. He wasn’t even 16. It was a beautiful day, like today, and I was heartbroken. McCoy grits his teeth as the going gets tough during his final visit to Aintree racecourse . A young McCoy dons his silks and saddle as he poses with his father Peader in 1990 . ‘I can assure you there were many tears that day. Kilkenny seemed so far away and it was. The roads weren’t as good as they are now. ‘Him and his father went with the late (trainer) Billy Rock in his horsebox. They were meeting Jim Bolger’s horsebox. I could hardly wait until his father came home and part of me thought Anthony would maybe not go and come back. ‘You couldn't do that now – can you imagine a 15 year-old going away? ‘We had been down there before and left Anthony for a couple of weeks. I thought, God he will never stay here but he was very determined. A young McCoy leads in Wood Louse following victory at Downpatrick racecourse . Arsenal legend Ian Wright will present AP McCoy with his 20th and final champion jockey’s trophy at Sandown on Saturday. Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club that the retiring rider supports. Thierry Henry had been lined up but his Sky employers vetoed an appearance. Another Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy’s heroes from his childhood. ‘Jim Bolger’s gallops were 1,500ft above sea level – it was the wilds of Ireland and the most beautiful setting for animals you ever saw in your life but I would not have said that for the apprentices. ‘They weren’t living in luxury. The horses were living in more luxury than them. ‘There was one public phone box and maybe 30 of them. It was a tough time. He was there for four and a half years and believe it or not, when he went to England he was was much closer to home.’ Derby winning trainer Bolger is a mellower model these days. In his autobiography McCoy wrote of ‘bollockings which made grown men cry’ while he was there. Mass every Sunday was compulsory and smoking and drinking banned. McCoy receives a kiss from wife Chanelle McCoy after winning the Ryanair Chase on Uxizandre . McCoy poses with his father at Leopardstown racecourse after he rode Colbert Station to victory . But it was Bolger who gave McCoy his first ride – seventh-placed Nordic Touch on the Flat at now defunct Dublin track of Phoenix Park on September 1, 1990. It was a moment captured by Irish photographer Pat Healy. He said: ‘I knew AP’s father Peadar. He had bred Thumbs Up (winner of the County Hurdle at the 1993 Cheltenham Festival) and I knew him from point-to-points. He asked me would I take a picture because it was his son’s first ride and he might not have many more.’ The prediction turned out to be wrong but only by about 16,500 rides! McCoy pushes Parlour Games into second during his final trip to Aintree racecourse as a jockey . It had been at Rock’s local stable that the McCoy jockey bug had really been born. The young AP spent every hour he could at the stable 11 miles from his home, at one point hitching a lift in a butcher’s van and ultimately cycling to the stable. Much as she tried Claire could not get her son to concentrate on school. She says: ‘I might as well have tried to persuade a cat – he was never, ever going to stay at school . He would huff and puff because he didn’t want to go with me fighting with him. McCoy and his mother Claire pose after he announced his impending retirement at Leopardstown . ‘Him and I fell out and we argued. I threatened to no avail. Mind you, his father didn't help me much. It was two and against one. I wouldn't say Peadar was happy but he wanted to give him the opportunity to be a jockey. ‘Anthony was very determined. But he stuck it out. He is a very focused man. We speak a lot on the phone – not about racing, just every day normal things. We certainly don’t talk about his falls because I don’t believe a word he tells me!’ McCoy celebrates after winning on Don't Push It following The Grand National steeplechase . With Claire and Peadar at Sandown will be their other son Colm and daughters Anne Marie, Jane, Kelly and Roisin. Claire admits it has taken her son’s retirement to make her appreciate how high he is regarded. ‘I don’t go racing that much but I went to Leopardstown (the day after he announced his retirement in February). It was that day I realised what people think about him and I think it has been the same in Britain. ‘I think he will cope fine with retirement. He is very strong-minded.’ Twenty five years on and nothing has changed.

"Retiring 20-time jump jockey AP McCoy has fired a borrowed phrase from great Olympian Sir Steve Redgrave back at those who think he might perform a U-turn and reverse his plans to walk away from the sport. The 40-year-old rider, who has two final rides at Sandown on Saturday, said: 'To be fair to Steve Redgrave, you have to put your body through physical torture to try and win a fifth gold medal in boat. 'I can ride for pleasure and hopefully it will be less dangerous than it was when I was competing. 'No, that won't be happening (riding). I'm much too stubborn for that. I'll be watching like everyone else. 'Feel free to shoot me. I'd rather you shoot me than me give in to the fact that I have to ride again, from a mental perspective.'

"Atten-shun! The three leaders’ wives were on parade yesterday, marching across the country in support of their men, in support of the political party into which they married, in support of desperately important employment issues – keeping their idiot husbands in a job. In the corridors of power, Samantha Cameron, Justine Miliband and Miriam Clegg proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers, in more ways than one. Indeed, Samantha and Justine marched out in almost identical uniforms; dark slacks and blazers, paired with crisp shirts and sensible shoes. They looked like a pair of lady pilots from the budget Deficit airline, ready for their long haul flight to or from the land of Austerity, depending on whose husband wins. The only accessory missing were their welfare caps, which they must have left at home. Scroll down for video . In the corridors of power, Samantha Cameron, Justine Miliband  (left) and Miriam Clegg (right) proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers, in more ways than one . Sam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wife. That was until she visited a Sikh family for a cup of tea. Mrs Cameron respectfully took her shoes off before entering the home of local businessman Baljinder Hansraas and before anyone could scream: ‘Holy footcream!’ she unleashed them. Out popped a pair of startling tootsies, displaying what might just have been a hint of a bunion. All across the Home Counties, fragrant Tory women fell into a dead faint. For Sam Cam’s seldom seen feet seemed ever so slightly unkempt, unusual from a woman noted for her effortless elegance. They didn’t even seem very Tory toenails. Shriek – not even a drop of nail polish! I don’t know what the grooming squad will have to say about that, but I doubt it will be very flattering. Sam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wife . Perhaps we should not be too harsh. Not many women would come out smelling of roses and peppermint foot lotion if they unexpectedly had to reveal their workaday feet, still slightly steaming from punishing the pavements, to the nation. Yesterday’s shock unveiling of Crinkletoes Cameron was reminiscent of a moment during the last election, when Sarah Brown’s mangled trotters were revealed on a visit to a Hindu temple. The same furore greeted Brown’s podiatric horror story. And the message was the same. Woman goes out in public without painted toenails? The end of civilisation is nigh. Poor Sam Cam. If she had unveiled the perfect trimmed pedicure and three glistening coats of Rouge Noir, she would be accused of being self-indulgent. Wasting money on luxuries or wandering around with battered trotters. She can’t win. But in this election, who can? Justine resolutely wore the exact same outfit she wore last week, sending out a Take Me Serious message that Clothes Don’t Matter. Campaigning in Bradford, she looked like a grim pixie determined to prove to the Milifans that her man was the man. Or something like that. It was left to Miriam to show a bit of wackitude, pulling on a huge smile, a pair of Lib Dem yellow chinos and a nautical Breton top; she looked like Tweety Pie reporting for duty on the good ship Doomed. Miriam dragged her husband Nick along to a cookery lesson at a Wiltshire primary school. Aprons on, they exchanged loving looks as they and the pupils were shown how to make a variety of desserts using apples and blackberries. Soft fruit, fool, pudding and crumble? That is the history of the Lib Dems right there. Just a week to go and the wifely bandwagon rolls on. Their role is to be there, be visible, be bland and say nothing of import. In this carefully manicured – if not pedicured – election, the days of loudmouth Cherie wading in like a docker with gout have long gone. I almost miss them. Today’s wives must smile nicely. Today’s wives must not rock the boat. Today’s wives must wear ordinary high street clothes and nothing that hints at their secret, massive wealth – although Samantha’s two hundred quid spotty blouse must have slipped under Tory central office radar. Above all, however, today’s wives must remember that pulling your socks up is not as important as keeping them on.","All the party leader's wives have been spotted looking stylish in trousers .

"Royal Bank of Scotland has racked up £50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers and warned last night that it faces another ‘tough year’. The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a £446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside £856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra £334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a £446million loss in the first three months of the year . In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a £453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the £46billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis. Disgraced former RBS boss  Fred Goodwin (pictured) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Goodwin was knighted for ‘services to banking’ in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 . Chief executive Ross McEwan said: ‘This is going to be another tough year. There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon. We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues.’ The latest news wiped more than £700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p. The Tories have blamed the last Labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power. The disgraced former boss of RBS, Fred Goodwin, was among those courted by former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Mr Goodwin – nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless cost-cutting – was even knighted for ‘services to banking’ in 2004. He was stripped of his title in 2012. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘These losses are enormous and will unnerve taxpayers desperate to get rid of the liabilities for the troubled bank. ‘It’s clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens, so it remains crucial that RBS gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible.’","RBS has racked up £50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers .

"Theo Walcott understands just how difficult it is now to hold down a place in the Arsenal side, who he says have been the 'best team in Europe' this year and could lift the title next season if everyone stays fit. The Gunners' slim hopes of overhauling Chelsea's 10-point lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League were all but extinguished following a goalless draw at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Walcott watched on from the bench again before a late substitute appearance, with the forward's last club start having been back in March. Theo Walcott believes Arsenal have been the 'best team in Europe' in the second half of the season . Arsenal had earned eight successive Premier League victories before the 0-0 draw against Chelsea . The 26-year-old - who recovered from a serious knee injury last season, but has yet to agree a new long-term deal - feels such strength in depth can only be positive for the squad, if sometimes frustrating for individuals. Fellow England internationals Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs also did not make the first XI against Chelsea. 'There is a lot of competition for places so everyone seems to lift a gear and play extremely well. It makes it a bit more difficult for people to get into the team,' Walcott said, quoted on the club's official website, www.arsenal.com. 'I think, especially this season, not many people thought we would be challenging for the Premier League. 'In this calendar year, we have been the best team in Europe. 'It is the strongest the squad has been and everyone is staying fit as well. The English midfielder (left) has struggled to maintain a first team place under Arsene Wenger this season . 'There aren't many injuries in the squad, which is important. If we had an injury-free season, I think we could lift the title.' Arsenal head to Hull on Bank Holiday Monday looking to keep pressure on Manchester City in the race for second place, and with it automatic qualification for next season's Champions League. Captain Mikel Arteta is set to step up his training this week after an ankle problem hampered recovery from a calf injury, while midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another continuing rehabilitation from an inflamed groin which has seen him out since the FA Cup win at Manchester United last month.","Theo Walcott insists Arsenal have shown the best form in Europe this year .

"Francis Coquelin has jumped to the defence of team-mate Olivier Giroud following Thierry Henry's claim that Arsenal need a 'top quality striker' to win the Premier League next season. Despite Giroud scoring 14 Premier League goals for Arsene Wenger's side this campaign, Henry believes he must sign a new striker as well as three more players if they are to compete for the title. Speaking after the 0-0 draw with Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday, Henry told Sky Sports: 'They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again.' Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin has defended Olivier Giroud (above) after criticism from Thierry Henry . Sky Sports pundit Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Giroud in attack . Coquelin, who has played a vital role in Arsenal's late-season resurgence, has since hit back at the Gunners legend and insists Giroud is worthy of his place in the first team. The French midfielder told RMC: 'Thierry Henry is wrong. Giroud shows his potential every week. 'He showed that he has the level to be the Arsenal striker and we can win titles with him. 'We are disappointed with the result against Chelsea because we were on a good run.

"Mario Gomez's predatory instincts and a late goal by substitute Juan Vargas ensured Fiorentina qualified for the Europa League semi-finals. Fiorentina had one foot in the next stage of Europe's second tier cup competition thanks to Khouma Babacar's all-important away goal during the closing stages of last Thursday's first leg encounter in Kiev. The Ukrainian outfit knew they were in for a hard task at the Stadio Artemio Franchi as they faced the likes of Mohamed Salah, Joaquin and Gomez. Fiorentina ace Mario Gomez scored the opening goal of the game in the 43rd minute to help his side qualify .

Booked: Lens . Sent off: Lens 40 . Referee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden) And their mission to seal a spot in the next round was made near enough impossible due to an incredibly rash decision by Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson. The Scandinavian official ruined Dynamo Kiev's hopes of upsetting the Viola by brandishing a red card in the direction of Holland international Jeremain Lens. Eriksson showed Lens a second yellow card as he decided to penalise the former PSV forward for diving inside the penalty area. The wrong call was made as replays showed Lens was slightly clipped when he made his way towards goal. It was one of those occasions where the referee should have simply let play continue. Dynamo Kiev manager and former Tottenham striker Sergei Rebrov was forced into taking off striker Lukasz Teodorczyk moments before the interval, which subsequently minimised the away side's goal threat during the second half. Salah, who has proven his doubters wrong since swapping Chelsea for Fiorentina in February, almost doubled his side's lead when he managed to jiggle his way past several defenders before shooting at goal. The Egyptian international's shot appeared to be heading into the back of Oleksandr Shovkovskiy's net until Danilo used his hand to intercept. Dynamo Kiev, despite their best efforts, failed to really threaten Fiorentina after being reduced to 10 men as Vincenzo Montella's side elected to play the passing game. Late substitute Vargas put the result beyond doubt when he ran down the left wing before smashing the ball past Shovkovskiy.

"Doctors have called for under-fours to be given free vitamins after a rise in the number of cases of rickets due to a lack of exposure to sunlight. The country's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies is said to be concerned at the number of children suffering from the condition, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D. The disease, a scourge of Victorian Britain, was virtually eradicated after the Second World War but is returning as more and more youngsters are used to staying indoors playing video games than going outside. Scroll down for video . Dame Sally Davies, the country's chief medical officer, who has ordered a cost review into giving all under-fours free vitamin D supplements . Now, it has been reported that Professor Davies has ordered the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) to review the cost of providing vitamin supplements to all children under the age of four, in a bid to reverse the trend. The move is being supported by one of Britain's leading experts on vitamin D deficiency at University College Hospital London Alastair Sutcliffe, who has spoken about an 'epidemic' of cases due to a lack of sun exposure and overuse of sunscreen. He told the Sunday Times: 'Nothing is free but the cost of the ill-effects of deficiency, such as rickets and anaemia from families not providing children with these supplements is greater for the NHS. 'Sunblock is so powerful it does work but you end up with no exposure to the sun. 'The outcome is that you are blocking out sunshine and you have a secondary effect of reduced exposure to sunshine which the human race needs.' Rickets is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D and causes bone deformities such as bowed legs, pictured, and a curvature of the spine . Rickets, which is also known as soft bones, can cause deformities such as bowed legs and a curvature of the spine. During the war children were given food supplements such as cod liver oil, but this practice stopped in the 1950s. An estimated 40 per cent of children are estimated to have vitamin D levels below the recommended amount. Figures from the NHS show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from the condition  in the financial year 2012-13. Professor Davies has previously spoken out about the advantages of giving free vitamins to young children. A scheme has already been set up in deprived areas of Birmingham handing out supplements, which has halved the number of cases of rickets and other deficiency problems. She said: 'We are offering these vitamins to vulnerable children and the take-up is low, but many children not in these communities need them too.' The NHS already recommends all youngsters aged six months to five years take the vitamins, but parents must pay for them unless they are part of the NHS’s means-tested Healthy Start scheme. Professor Davies said the UK’s record on children’s health used to be ‘one of the best but we are now the worst’. Possible causes include lifestyle behaviours in pregnancy such as smoking, and poor care in infancy. Rickets, or soft and deformed bones, was first noted by physicians in ancient Rome but was not linked with lack of vitamin D until the start of the 20th century. It was common in Victorian times because of lack of access to sunlight – which the body needs to make vitamin D – and poor diets. It mostly disappeared in the West during the 1940s thanks to the fortification of foods such as margarine, and children were also routinely given cod liver oil. Rickets is still a major problem in third-world countries. However, UK cases have been rising in the past 15 years, from 183 in 1996 to 762 in 2011. Experts believe this is partly because children are eating less fish and eggs than in the past. They also blame extensive use of sunscreen, and children spending more time indoors.","Dame Sally Davies has ordered review into cost of giving out free vitamins .

"Arsene Wenger has told Manchester City not to waste their time in trying to sign Jack Wilshere. The Etihad Stadium club are interested in Wilshere as they look to increase their homegrown quota ahead of next season. But Wenger insisted Wilshere will not be be leaving the Gunners. 'You can imagine my answer, we are not in a position where we have to sell our best players,' said Wenger. Jack Wilshere, pictured in action for Arsenal's Under 21s this week, is being courted by Manchester City . The England international was in the stands for Arsenal's Premier League win against Liverpool . Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta and injury-prone Abou Diaby are in line to feature against Burnley on Saturday . Wenger has been handed a quadruple fitness boost ahead of Saturday's clash at Burnley with Wilshere, Mathieu Debuchy, Mikel Arteta and Abou Diaby all available for selection after long-term injuries. But Laurent Koscielny will face a late fitness test on a groin injury sustained in Arsenal's 4-1 demolition of Liverpool. Wilshere has been out of action since November following two operations on an ankle injury he suffered in his side's defeat against Manchester United. The 23-year-old faces a raft on in-form players blocking his path back into the first team, and when asked on when he would return to the starting XI, Wenger said: 'That depends on the game, on fitness, on availability and the need of the team. Mathieu Debuchy, who has been out since January, is available for selection for the trip to Turf Moor . Olivier Giroud is pictured scoring in Arsenal's 4-1 victory against Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium . The France international is in fine form; he has scored in six consecutive Premier League matches . 'Everybody is rated exactly the same and you respect everybody and want everybody to just contribute to the team. 'Everybody can have a big impact until the end of the season, Jack included. 'Every player who doesn't play is very frustrated when he can not perform - (Abou) Diaby has been out for a year, (Theo) Walcott has been out for a year. 'Wilshere has played many games this year, he was out, but not for as long as Walcott or Diaby.' Arsenal have moved into second in the Premier League following a run seven straight wins. They are seven points adrift of leaders Chelsea and host Jose Mourinho's men at the Emirates later this month. 'They have a difficult schedule,' said Wenger of the league leaders. 'What we can only do is master our own schedule. 'What we want is to go as high as we can until the end of the season, give our best and we are also in the semi-final of the FA Cup. We are at an important moment of the Premier League season and it is a period where you show your quality by focusing on the next game and maintain the quality.'","Manchester City are interested in Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere .

"Landslides have exposed trails of dinosaur footprints running along a near-vertical rock face in Bolivia. And although the angle of the prints could suggest the lumbering reptiles were avid mountaineers, Bolivia’s Cal Orcko paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity that forced the earth upwards. The attraction, at Fancesa limestone quarry in Sucre, comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints - and frequent landslides reveal new ones, some of which belong to  unknown species. Boliva’s Cal Orcko paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity, forcing earth upwards and preserving the precious trackways so that dinosaur tracks are seen on a vertical 'wall' (pictured) The wall, which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world, is approximately 390 feet (120 metres) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs,The Daily Beast reported. Some of them are more than a metre in length, indicating the size of some of the vast beasts that roamed the area in the upper cretaceous period - a time in which the majority of dinosaurs lived. At first glance, it appears that large dinosaurs such as the Titanosaurs and armoured Ankylosauruses hauled their considerable bulks up the incredibly steep slope, which measures one mile (1.5km). But the imprinted rock was once horizontal before being pushed upwards by tectonic activity. The attraction, at Fancesa limestone quarry in Sucre, Bolivia (left), comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints (right) – and frequent landslides reveal new ones, some of which belong to unknown species . The wall, which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world, is approximately 390 feet (120 metres) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs. Some, like the one pictured, are large . In 2009, fossil hunters came across what are thought to be among the world's largest dinosaur prints. Measuring 5ft (1.5 metres) wide, they were made by long-necked sauropods 150 million years ago and were found in chalky sediment in the Jura plateau of eastern France. It's thought the Late Jurassic dinosaurs were more than 75 ft (23 metres) long and weighed up to 40 tonnes. Palaeontologist Jean-Michel Mazin of France’s National Centre of Scientific Research, said at the time, from the prints, ‘we can calculate their size and speed, find out about their behaviour and learn how they got around.' ‘They were very hard to see because there were a lot of little stones (on the ground), there was grass growing there, and you really had to have a trained eye to notice something,’ Dr Mazin said. The area was not mountainous when the dinosaurs were alive and the region had lots of water and islands, meaning the tracks were preserved by the sea and sediment. This activity thrust a huge slab of earth upwards, which dried into limestone and now resembles a cliff face. However, the site looked very different millions of years ago, when the region was muddy and flat. The dinosaurs left their mark while walking along the shoreline of a large lake. There are layers of prints preserved in the limestone because the marks hardened in dry periods, before being covered in preservative mud, enabling the process to start again. Paleontologist Klaus Schutt also suggested that a huge volcanic eruption threw millions of cubic metres of ash into space 68 million years ago, which gradually covered the prints to protect them, Unesco reported. A decade after the discovery, which was made by miners in the mid 1980s, palaeontologists began to document the prints. Due to the spacing of these prints, experts can use them to reveal clues about the dinosaurs’ gait, build and lifestyle. One set of tracks, for example, revealed two lines of prints with a smaller pair, suggesting a baby walked alongside its parents, while another set, now known as Johnny Walker, was made by a baby T.Rex. When some are removed, or crumble away, more are revealed underneath. While there may be more precious footprints yet to be found, some experts say Cal Orcko, which means ‘lime hill’ in the Quechua tongue, is under threat from human activity. The imprinted rock was pushed upwards by tectonic activity, thrusting a huge slab of earth upwards, which dried into limestone and now resembles a cliff face (pictured) At first glance, it appears that large dinosaurs (such as the one pictured) as well as Titanosaurs and armoured Ankylosauruses, hauled their considerable bulks up the incredibly steep slope . The site, at Fancesa limestone quarry in Sucre (shown on the map) attracts 120,000 tourists every year, which some believe is a threat to the site, as well as a nearby cement works that uses limestone . The dinosaurs left their mark (pictured) while walking along the shoreline of a large lake. Their tracks dried in the hot season and were preserved before more mud and possibly volcanic ash covered and preserved them . The site attracts 120,000 tourists every year, while a nearby cement factory pulls limestone from a local quarry. ‘The cliff has been quite affected by the many years of extracting the raw material,’ Elizabeth Baldivieso, administrator of Cretaceous Park which protects the fossil filed, told AFP.

"Getting the best price for your unwanted wares online can seem like a fine art, but researchers have found a simple trick that could see your bids soar. Economists plotted how much goods listed on eBay sold for and discovered that items with precise prices attract higher offers than those with round numbers, such as $1,000. In fact, sellers who end their price with ‘00’ typically receive offers that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices. US researchers claim that exact prices of goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers. This chart shows that when the posted initial price is of a round number (the red dots), like $1,000, the average counteroffer is much lower than if it is a non-round number (the blue circles), like $1,079 . In terms of the study, the word 'odd' is used to represent an unusual number, and not the opposite of even. Competitive options for buyers and sellers can define a limit beyond which they will not go, but there is still a range of prices that fall within those limits, Professor of Strategic Management at University of Toronto, Joshua Gans, writes for The Conversation. Within that range, sellers are looking for a higher price while buyers would like a lower one, so each has an incentive to signal to the other their willingness to be a tough negotiator. Sometimes, however, sellers may want to send a signal they are willing to be less tough, such as when they are keen to sell an item quickly. One method is to lower their starting price, but this isn’t always desirable. Sellers on eBay who end their price with ‘00’ typically receive offers for their goods that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices, such as this watch example . While eBay is used for auctions, the bulk of its business comes from 'Buy it now' sales, such as this iPhone. The study found that prices that end in '00' as above are more likely to sell quickly, but may not attract the most lucrative counter offers from sellers . Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California, Berkeley, have addressed the problem in a new paper. Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California looked at pricing strategies within the confines of eBay’s so-called 'negotiation platform'. Most trades on the site are listed for a  ‘Buy it now’ price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer. For example, a seller of an iPhone may list a price of $1,000 (£660), and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $800 (£530). This could go on for about three rounds, in line with eBay rules, and could last up to a week. The study found that when the initial price is a round number, such as $1,000, the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number, like $1,079. In fact, the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $997 rather than $1,000. But sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner, and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all. Matt Backus, Thomas Blake and Steve Tadelis looked at this issue within the confines of eBay’s so-called 'negotiation platform'. While some people associate eBay with auctions rather than straightforward sales, this hasn’t been eBay’s main business for about a decade. Instead, most trades are listed for a  ‘Buy it now’ price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer. For example, a seller of an iPhone may list a price of $1,000 (£660), and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $800 (£530), to which the seller could then accept or make a new offer. This could go on for about three rounds, in line with eBay rules, and could last up to a week. But the study shows that when the initial price is a round number, such as $1,000, the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number, like $1,079. In fact, the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $997 rather than $1,000. ‘In other words, you are better off initially asking for a lower price if price was all you cared about,’ Professor Gans writes. The researchers believe that what is going on here is ‘cheap talk’ - an easy-to-make statement that may be true or untrue with no consequences for dishonesty - and not an otherwise reliable signal. There are some sellers who don’t just care about price and, absent any other way of signalling that to buyers, they set their price at a round number. The researchers applied their findings to house sales and discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number, but if they're willing to wait, an odd one is more likely to get a good price . While the study is new, Professor Gans said the technique to sell houses (a stock image is shown) as quickly as possible, or for as much money as possible, is already used by estate agents . Alternatively more patient sellers may be using non-round numbers to signal their toughness. Either way, the last two digits of the price is 'cheap talk'. But sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner, and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all. This is interesting because the last two digits of a price make little difference to the price, Professor Gans notes. The authors wanted to see if their analysis would work in other markets and whether they could guess what the cheap talk prices would be. They found was that while the effect they observed didn’t happen for all other prices, it did arise for prices that ended in 99 cents. Prices ending in 99 cents, or 99 pence, are very common in shops and send out the same type of signal as the ‘00’ prices, they said. The researchers also discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number, but if they are willing to wait, an odd one is more likely to get a good price – a trick estate agents already use.","Researchers claim using exact prices when selling goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers .
Sellers who end prices with ‘00’ typically receive offers up to 8% lower .
However, goods with round numbers typically sell faster, the study claims ."
"It may have taken 170 minutes to come but super sub Yevhen Shakhov earned Dnipro a place in the Europa League semi-finals after breaking Brugge hearts with a late winner on Thursday night. The midfielder latched on to a Ruslan Rotan pass as the Ukrainian's hit on the counter attack to settle a tie that looked to be heading for extra-time after last week's goalless draw in Belgium. The Belgian league leaders set the record for most Europa League games unbeaten after the stalemate took them to 11 without loss since the opening game of the group stage earlier this season.

Shakhov leads the celebrations after netting the winner for Dnipro to book a Europa League semi-final place . But their European dream came crashing down at the at the Dnipro-Arena during an evening that offered little in the way of quality. The visitors started the game brightly as Davy De fauw and Nikola Storm combined to good effect down the right but, after carving the Brugge defence open, could only win a corner. But the Ukraine outfit soon settled into the game and took control of proceedings. Yheven Konoplyanka, perennially linked with a move to the Premier League was a constant threat down the Dnipro left.

The home side pressed for an opener as Konoplyanka continued to cause the Brugge backline problems as the winger tormented the right-hand side of the Brugge defence. And Dnipro could have been in front on the half-hour mark but Yevhen Seleznyov fired off target after being picked out in the area by Roman Bezus. The Ukrainians were almost gifted an opening goal moments before half-time after a miscommunication between Ryan and defender Brandon Mechele that had manager Michel Preud’homme shaking his head in disbelief. Just minutes after the restart Dnipro again came close to breaking the deadlock. This time it was Konoplyanka who, after collecting Rotan's brilliant ball over the top, fired an effort agonisingly wide of the far post.

Brugge began to take more opportunities as the game neared the final 15 minutes, and it proved their undoing. Dnipro broke swiftly and Rotan released Shakhov, a half-time substitute, who cut in on his left foot and beat Ryan courtesy of a slight deflection.

"Homicide conviction: Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, arrives for verdicts at Gwangju High Court in Gwangju, South Korea . The South Korean ferry captain responsible for a sinking that killed more than 300 people has had his sentence increased to life in prison. Lee Joon-seok had been ordered to serve 36 years in prison for negligence and abandoning passengers aboard the Sewol, by a district court following last year's disaster. But this was increased to life in prison today by an appellate court that convicted him of homicide by account of his 'willful negligence'. The 6,825-tonne passenger ship sank off the southwest coast on April 16 last year, killing 304 people. Most of the victims were teenagers who were en route to a southern island for a school trip. Victims' relatives criticised the original verdict which had acquitted him of homicide, saying it was too lenient. But his sentence was increased because the Gwangju High Court additionally convicted him on the homicide charges while upholding most of other charges that led to his November conviction, according to a court statement. The appellate court sentenced 14 other navigation crew members to 18 months to 12 years in prison, the statement said. In November they had received sentences of five to 30 years in prison. The court said it decided on Lee's homicide conviction because he fled the ship without making any evacuation order though he, as a captain, is required by law to take some measures to rescue his passengers. Lee's behavior was 'homicide by willful negligence,' the court judged. 'For whatever excuses, it's difficult to forgive Lee Joon-seok's action that caused a big tragedy,' the court statement cited the verdict as saying. Lee and the 14 crew members have been the subject of fierce public anger because they were among the first people rescued from the ship when it began badly listing on the day of the sinking in April last year. Scroll down for video . Disaster: Helicopters try to help passengers stranged on the South Korean ferry which sank on its way to Jeju island from Incheon, some 20 kilometres off the island of Byungpoong in Jindo, South Korea . Devastating: A girl is rescued from the stricken vessel while relatives grieve for the victims of the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster, whose captain has today been jailed for life . Lee has said he issued an evacuation order, but the court statement said two of the 14 crew members acknowledged that there was no evacuation order. Many student survivors have said they were repeatedly ordered over a loudspeaker to stay on the sinking ship and that they didn't remember there any evacuation orders made by crew members before they helped each other to flee the ship. Judges sit to preside over verdicts for the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol's crew members who are charged with negligence and abandonment of passengers in the disaster at Gwangju High Court in Gwangju . Court spokesman Jeon Ilho said both prosecutors and the crew members have one week to appeal the verdicts. Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, was sentenced to life in prison . A year after sinking, 295 bodies have been retrieved but nine others are missing. There is still lingering public criticism against the government over its handling of the sinking, the country's deadliest maritime disaster in decades. Violence occurred during a Seoul rally led by relatives and their supporters earlier this month, leaving dozens of people injured. Last week, South Korea formally announced it would salvage the ship from the ocean floor off the country's southwest coast. Relatives of the victims hope that might locate the missing, including four students, and help reveal more details about the sinking. Some experts are skeptical about those wishes and remain opposed to spending taxpayer's money to lift the civilian vessel. Officials say the salvage job is estimated to cost £68 million and take 12 to 18 months. Authorities blame excessive cargo, improper storage, botched negligence and other negligence for the sinking, and have arrested about 140 people. Critics say higher-level officials haven't been accountable.","Lee Joon-seok had sentence extended from 36 years to life in jail .

'We don't snack in Bali either - we don't have chips and lollies and things, so I find it a lot easier to eat over there. 'When I'm in Australia I love to go out to restaurants, drink red wine, and i do that a lot during Fashion Week as well as its so social.'

'I was told fitness influencers were involved, so that was exciting, then I realised it was different from ‘normal modelling’. '[We Are Handsome] have picked up on the fact social media has such a power for advertising. 'We’re all just regular girls, I think that we’re helping to promote a healthy body image.

We Are Handsome design duo Jeremy and Katinka Somers are known for pushing boundaries but believe there will be only positive reaction to their unusual model choice. 'There’s a big thing about ""who should be on the runway"" so we know we’re breaking rules by having girls that have never been on a catwalk before (and who are nervous about it),' Katinka told Daily Mail Australia. 'But the rules are there to be broken, times have changed and girls who are active are the new shape. Strong really is the new sexy.' 'A lot of the girls are very big on Instagram and encourage people to follow in their active foot steps, so we have chosen experienced yogis, a ballerina, a sprinter and pole vaulter and people who embody healthy eating too,' said Jeremy.","We Are Handsome designers Jeremy and Katinka Somers chose real-life fitness influencers above models .

"Kevin Gameiro saved his goalkeeper's blushes with a late equaliser which put defending champions Sevilla into the last four of the Europa League. Beto had looked to have cost his side their progress, with the game heading towards extra time, before substitute Gameiro arrived to slot home with five minutes remaining. It had been a risk to start the Portuguese keeper, but Sevilla boss Unai Emery decided it one he was prepared to take, despite Beto's absence since a game against Real Madrid in the first week of February. Carlos Bacca slams home the early penalty after Vitolo had been brought down by Neto after five minute . Hulk celebrates his goal with Axel Witsel but Zenit couldn't hold on for extra time in the end . It was a gamble that spectacularly back-fired, with the keeper gifting Zenit two of the softest goals imaginable, to see the holders surrender a two-goal lead in the tie. First, just a matter of seconds after the half-time break, with Sevilla two goals up on aggregate a cruising, Beto dropped the ball, under no pressure, at the feet of Salomon Rondon, allowing the Venezuelan to rekindle the tie from a matter of yards. Then, when Brazilian forward Hulk hit a speculative, but not overly threatening shot from 40 yards, Beto could only flap it over his own line, turning the tie on its head and sending it towards extra time. But as Zenit looked to apply the pressure, and Beto attempted to atone himself with two stunning saves, one from each of the two goalscorers, the champions struck on the break. Bacca is mobbed by his Sevilla team-mates after putting them in complete control of the tie early on . Zenit: Lodygin, Criscito, Neto, Lombaerts, Smolnikov; Garcia, Witsel; Danny, Shatov, Hulk, Rondon (Kerzhakov 83 mins) Subs not used: Malafeev, Rodic, Anyukov, Tymoshchuk, Sheydaev, Arshavin . Goal: Rondon 48, Hulk 72 . Booked: Neto, Witsel, Lodygin . Sevilla: Beto, Tremoulinas, Pareja (Iborra 22), Coke, Carrico, Vidal, Vitolo (Suarez 92), Banega, Mbia, Krychowiak, Bacca (Gameiro 72) Subs not used: Rico, Figueiras, Navarro, Reyes . Goal: Bacca 6, Gameiro 85 . Booked: Iborra . It was a pulsating finish to a game that had started promisingly, but looked to have faded away somewhat in the first half. The Spanish side carried a slim lead, given them by a stunning Denis Suarez volley at the end of the first leg, into the second game, but Zenit were optimistic after scoring an away goal in Seville, which gave them a perceived edge. That advantage lasted little more than five minutes however, as defender Neto stupidly dived in on Sevilla winger Vitolo, to concede an early penalty. It was a bizarre challenge to make, with Vitolo running towards the byline, and the ball not even close to within winning distance. The contact may have been minimal, but the fact that it was there at all was as much down to Neto's stupidity as anything else, and it was hard to feel sympathy for the Portuguese defender. Carlos Bacca was not in the mood to show any mercy, dispatching the spot-kick beautifully, high into the top corner, and the visitors were in complete control. From then the pattern of play was set, with Sevilla inviting pressure, absorbing it, and hitting Zenit on the break. Indeed, the visitors, two goals ahead on aggregate and with the majority of the game in their own half, had much the better chances in the first period. Coke tries to get a shot away as Sevilla threatened on the break, before Zenit hit back in the second half . Zenit midfielder Axel Witsel challenges Sevilla's Benoit Tremoulinas during a tense first half . Aleix Vidal should have put them further in front, after out-pacing former Manchester City midfielder Javi Garcia, but he seemed to forget that running is not enough, failing to either pass or shoot and simply running into Yuri Lodygin. Soon after Bacca sprang the offside trap and rounded the Zenit keeper, only to see his shot cleared off the line by Igor Smolnikov. Andre Villas-Boas' team barely registered a shot before first-half stoppage time, the one exception coming in the 18th minute, when captain Danny exchanged passes with Hulk before seeing his near-post shot saved by Beto. But, as the first 45 approached its conclusion, the hosts suddenly produced a succession of chances, and could easily have got themselves back into the tie. Salomon Rondon, whose goal got Zenit back in the tie, was starved of service for long periods of the game . First Salomon Rondon, almost entirely ineffectual up front in the opening period, was gifted the ball three yards from goal following some dubious defending at a set piece, but the Venezuelan striker couldn't sort his feet out, and stumbled the ball away from target. Moments later Danny struck the base of the post with a vicious effort that suggested Zenit might have more to offer in the final quarter of the tie. Not that they could have expected the sort of favours that Beto handed them in the second period, and which looked to have at least earned them an extra 30 minutes. In the end though, it was the home side's defending that let them down, failing to keep the back door shut as they pushed for a winner, allowing Gameiro to do the damage.","Carlos Bacca puts Sevilla ahead from the spot after Vitolo was fouled .

"A bizarre new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered by a farmer in China and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight. Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat’s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning ‘strange wing’, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world’s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning ""strange wing"" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don’t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how  the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: ‘As for gliding, if Yi qi’s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. ‘But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body — if the bulk of the animal’s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. ‘That is clearly the case in the authors’ reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. ‘Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. ‘And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.’","Yi qi is thought to have lived 160 million years ago during the late Jurassic .

"Owning a passport opens up a world of possibility and freedom for travellers - or so you would think. In some countries around the world, even if you are lucky enough to have access to the government-issued documents, you are still restricted and barred from several countries. Henley and Partners created a Visa Restrictions Index, which ranks countries globally in accordance to the travel freedom their inhabitants enjoy - with some surprising results. Scroll down for video . The Visa Restrictions Index analyses countries ability to travel visa-free. The latest results were based on results from May 20, 2014 . 1) Finland . = Germany . = Sweden . = USA . = United Kingdom (174 points) 2) Canada . = Denmark (173 points) 3) Belgium . = France . = Italy . = Japan . = Korea (Republic of South) = Luxembourg . = Netherlands . = Portugal . = Spain (172 points) Where it might be expected that countries such as North Korea and possibly Cuba could take the bottom spots for the most restricted travel freedom, they actually place at 86 and 69 respectively, from a ranking of a total of 94. Each country was given a score by global consulting firm Henley and Partners, who specialise in residence and citizenship planning. The score was calculated based on visa regulations of all countries and territories in the world, and the number of other countries that their citizens can travel to without having to obtain a visa. Taking the lowest spots were Afghanistan (ranked at 94 and able to visit 28 countries visa-free), Iraq, (able to visit 31 countries), Pakistan and Somalia (able to visit 32 countries) and the Palestinian Territory (able to visit 35). This was juxtaposed by Finland, Germany, Sweden, the UK and the US, in first position, who are able to access 174 countries visa-free. Henley and Partners said: 'In today's globalised world, visa restrictions play an important role in controlling the movement of foreign nationals across borders. 'Almost all countries now require visas from certain non-nationals who wish to enter their territory. 'Visa requirements are also an expression of the relationships between individual nations, and generally reflect the relations and status of a country within the international community of nations.

Despite this freedom, stepping over the Pakistani border into India and Iran does requires a visa. At the bottom of the list are the citizens of Afghanistan who are banned from entering Kuwait entirely. They can, however, travel to Micronesia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Haiti without a visa entirely though. The index reflected the decision in 2014 to allow citizens of the UAE to be allowed short stays in the EU Schengen countries without a visa, moving them up the rankings in the travel freedom index. A UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) report stated that three-quarters of people in the world travelling to Europe need a visa . According to the latest Visa Openness Report by the UNWTO, 62 per cent of the world’s population was required a traditional visa prior to departure in 2014, down from 77 per cent in 2008. A total of 19 per cent of the world’s population was able to enter a destination without a visa, while 16 per cent could receive a visa on arrival (compared to 17 per cent and 6 per cent in 2008). Somalia, (left), was ranked 92nd, allowing visa-free access to 32 countries. Iraq passports, (right), enable citizens to visit 31 countries visa-free .

"A militant group which opposes both ISIS and the Syrian regime has released a striking video showing off 1,700 troops, fleet of armoured tanks and special forces soldiers in an impressive military parade. These men form a small part of Jaysh Al-Islam - or Army of Islam - who reportedly  command as many as 25,000 loyal fighters following the merger of up to 60 rebel factions inside Syria. Dozens of masked special units show off a range of skills including close-range combat in what the group claims is the 'largest military parade witnessed' since the dawn of the Syrian revolution in 2011. Strength: Four armoured tanks and thousands of soldiers formed part of a graduation ceremony (pictured) held by Jaysh Al-Islam, a militant group that opposes ISIS and the Syrian regime . Aggressive: The soldiers of the Army of Islam perform a series of military drills (pictured) in what the group describes as the 'largest military parade witnessed' since the start of the Syrian revolution . Powerful: The group, who are allegedly being funded by Saudi Arabia, show of a fleet of armoured tanks (pictured) during the graduation ceremony for its recruits . Elite: Its special forces units (pictured) showed off  an array of acrobatic kicks and close-combat skills in front of their leaders . Discipline: As many as 1,700 soldiers stood to attention as their commander referred to them as the 'leaders of the Mujahidin', which roughly translates as 'those who fight in a Jihad' The group operates in the embattled Syrian city of Damascus and their ongoing battle against President Bashar Al-Assad is reportedly funded by the wealthy nation of Saudi Arabia. The Arab kingdom has sent millions of dollars to arm and train their fighters so they can defeat the Syrian regime and 'increasingly powerful Jihadi organisations', according to the Guardian. Known as the Army of Islam, the insurgent group was created in 2011 when Saudi Arabia allegedly engineered the merger of over 50 rebel factions after growing alarmed at the rise if Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria. It is a fierce enemy of both those Islamist groups as well as Jabhat Al-Nusra, but embraces independent rebel forces and 'non-Jihadi' units. Their graduation ceremony for  trainee soldiers in the Ghouta suburb of Damascus was attended by the militants' leadership who watch proudly as their troops march in perfect unison across the expanse. Jaysh Al-Islam is led by Sheikh Zahran Aloush who addresses the thousands of armed soldiers and tanks once they have assembled on the vast concrete ground below. Joining forces: Jaysh Al-Islam was formed when up to 60 rebel factions in Syria merged to fight the Syrian regime . Armed: Soldiers rested on the Army of Islam's many tanks (pictured) as their leaders commanded them to 'continue to wage Jihad' Commander: The group is led by Sheikh Zahran Aloush (pictured), who is considered one of the most powerful leaders in rebel-held Syria . Fierce: His fighters, who marched in perfect unison in Damascus, are waging a battle against ISIS in Syria and have reportedly attacked their headquarters in the Lebanese city of Arsal . The Salafist leader is considered one of the most power military chiefs in rebel-held Syria and called for the 'cleansing' of all Alawite and Shiites in Damascus. He says to his soldiers: 'Today, legions of Mujahadin, stand in readiness to raise the banner of Allah, uphold his words, move forward to fight and defend his religion. 'Know paradise is waiting for us since we either achieve victory or die in honour... So take your strength from Allah and wage Jihad in the cause of your Lord. 'We will leave these fields in which we finished our course and preparation and we will continue waging Jihad.' He refers to their enemies, which include Islamic State and Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's troops, as the 'dirtiest and most despicable enemies of Allah'. In February, Aloush tweeted that his insurgents had ambushed Islamic State's fighters at their headquarters in the Lebanese city of Arsal, according to reports by AL Monitor. Might: Their incredible show of strength in their Damascus stronghold of Ghouta included a fleet of armoured tanks . Deadly: That was followed by a series of choreographed drills from its masked special forces units who - unlike their comrades - dressed entirely in black . Force: The graduation ceremony was held for Jaysh Al-Islam's trainee soldiers who stood to attention as fleets of armoured vehicles drove past . They allegedly 'killed and wounded three and took out the eye of a fourth person' in what was reportedly their first act of aggression outside of Syrian territory. His tweets also indicated the group - which is widely known for its links to Saudi Arabia - was prepared to carry out military attacks outside Syria. AL Monitor claimed his tweets referenced ISIS's expansion in the Ghouta and Qalamoun suburbs of Damascus which it controls. He said the attack in Arsal was retaliation for the bombing Islamic State carried out on its headquarters in the Ghouta suburb.","Jaysh Al-Islam fights against government soldiers in Syrian city of Damascus .

"Social media experts say they have found a shocking connection between online traffic in downtown Baltimore on Monday and activity recorded during last year's violent protests in Ferguson, Missouri. A leading data mining firm, which has asked to remain anonymous because of its government work, claims that between 20 and 50 social media accounts active in Baltimore on Monday were also used some 825 miles away in Ferguson during the peak of last summer's violence following the death of Michael Brown. The firm said the link suggests the presence of 'professional protesters' or anarchists who are in Baltimore and are looking to take advantage of Freddie Gray's death to incite more violence. Scroll down for video . A leading data mining firm claims that between 20 and 50 social media accounts active in Baltimore on Monday, above, were also used some 825 miles away in Ferguson during last summer's violence. Not all the accounts called for outright violence, but at the very least, the tweets were menacing and ominous, reports Fox News. One account - also linked to the recent union protests in New York City and other disturbances - tweeted photos of Gray's funeral and used language anticipating Monday's violent clashes. The data mining specialist described the discovery of so many of the same social media accounts in the two cities as 'surprising.' The company has also identified a recent social media spike in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City of protesters looking for rides to Baltimore, suggesting that the situation may not be over just yet. Baltimore's mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, announced a 10 p.m.- 5 a.m. curfew would be imposed beginning on Tuesday. The use of social media to fuel violence in Baltimore has already been highlighted by law enforcement. Missouri State Highway Patrol officers listen to taunts from demonstrators during a protest over the death of Michael Williams last August  in Ferguson: Social media experts have linked the presence of 'professional protesters' or anarchists to both events . In the hours before Baltimore erupted into riots on Monday, an online flier swept across social media inciting high school students in the area to 'Purge' - a reference to a movie, starring Ethan Hawke, where all crime is made legal. Police said on Tuesday that 202 people were arrested, 15 buildings set on fire along with 115 vehicles. Gray, 25, was arrested for possession of a knife on April 12 on Baltimore's west side. According to his attorney, Gray died a week later in hospital from a spinal cord injury he received in police custody. As Gray's grieving family held his funeral on Monday morning, an online flier circulated among school students, reading: '@3 We Going To Purge', beginning at Mondawmin Mall in the northwest of the city and moving downtown. 'The Purge': A flier (pictured) circulated online on Monday calling for a 'purge' prior to the rioting and looting which took place on the day that Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old who died in police custody, was laid to rest . Young people pelted police with rocks on Monday in Baltimore following an online flier which circulated calling for a 'purge' - an apparent reference to a 2013 movie where all crime is legalized . On the flier was an image of young men jumping on top of a police car on Saturday during protests, The Baltimore Sun reported. The word 'purge' appeared to reference a 2013 sci-fi horror movie, The Purge, which depicted a futuristic world where for a 12-hour period, all crime is legalized. The film, starring Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey, and directed by James DeMonaco, had a sequel last year - The Purge: Anarchy. It is unclear whether police were investigating the origins of the social media flier. As the message spread across social media, law enforcement mobilized troops while businesses rolled down their shutters and the University of Maryland canceled classes. Around 3pm on Tuesday, news cameras caught live scenes as dozens of students descended on Mondawmin Mall where they were greeted by lines of police officers, wearing riot gear, carrying shields and armed with pepper spray. Police were pelted with rocks, water bottles and anything that came to hand. As the sun rose on Baltimore's Eastside on Tuesday, the remains of a Baptist Church's senior center were still smoldering after being set ablaze during night riots . Fifteen police officers were injured, many suffering broken bones, and at least one appeared 'unresponsive'.  Two of the 15 cops were hospitalized in a serious condition. A $16 million nursing home built by a Baptist church, which was due to open in December after eight years of construction,was burned to the ground on the city's east side as violence from corner to corner of Baltimore. Just two blocks away from the nursing home, a housing development was also ablaze. According to Baltimore Police, cinder blocks were being thrown at fire trucks as they raced to extinguish the blazes and one protester was caught on camera sticking a knife into a hose. Officials feared the fires were sparked to pull emergency services from the west side of the city, where rioters continued to loot gun stores, check-cashing stores, liquor stores and supermarkets into the early hours of Tuesday. Balaclava-clad mobs were seen ripping the doors off one rifle shop and passing weapons to people on the streets. A senior center and a CVS pharmacy burned to the ground in Baltimore on Monday night as the family of Freddie Gray called for calm on the day of his funeral . One of the buildings set on fire amid riots which broke out on Monday in Baltimore leading to widespread rioting and looting which left 15 police officers injured . When a CVS pharmacy was set ablaze, rioters slashed fire fighters' hoses as they tried to battle the flames. Small stores including a 'mom-and-pop' grocery store and a local hair salon were also looted, The Baltimore Sun reported. The Gray family has publicly denounced the riots and called again for peace on Monday. Bill Murphy, the family's attorney, branded the situation 'devastating', adding: 'This won't solve the police problem. This is dangerous to the movement.' 'I think the violence is wrong,' Gray's twin sister, Fredericka Gray, said late on Monday. 'I don't like it at all.' On Tuesday, social media rumors of another 'purge' led Security Square Mall - five miles from where yesterday's riots took place - to close its doors, The Baltimore Sun reported. Medicaid and Medicare facilities were also shut in Baltimore County and some federal staff were going home early. April 12: 8:39am: Four officers stop and arrest Freddie Gray (pictured right) who ran away from the police in northwest Baltimore after 'making eye contact'. 8:40am: Gray is arrested after voluntarily stopping. No police reported using their Taser. 8.42am: Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. 9am: Gray was not buckled in by a seat belt, a violation of the police department's policy. 9.26am: He asked for medical help several times, and after a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. At some point - either during his arrest or inside the van - he suffered a mysterious spinal injury. Authorities have not explained how or when it occurred. April 19: Freddie Gray died from a double broken vertebrae after being arrested near Gilmor Homes in Sandtown-Winchester. It is reported his spine is 80 percent separated from his neck. Deputy police commissioner Kevin Davis said Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot of his arrest. April 27: Freddie Gray's family and 2,500 mourners attended his funeral at the New Shiloh Baptist Church. 3pm: Riots break out on the Westside of Baltimore and mushroom across the city after a flier is circulated online calling for a 'purge'. Gray's grieving family call again for peace saying violence was not what their son would have wanted.","Data mining firm has found between 20 and 50 social media accounts active in Baltimore on Monday were also used in Ferguson last summer .

"Killing a spider is one thing but seeing hundreds of babies explode from its body afterwards would freak out anyone. This was the case in Hallett Cove, South Australia, when a man smacked a huge wolf spider as it scuttled across his kitchen floor. He got the shock of his life when he squashed the hairy beast with a broom, only to see hundreds of baby spiders came crawling out of the mother and spreading out in all directions on the floor. A female wolf spider scuttles across a kitchen floor in Hallett Cove, South Australia . The house owner is not too happy and promptly gets out a broom to get rid of the hairy beast . ‘Ohhh look at the babies come out of it,’ the man says in surprise. The scene was greeted by the voice of a woman in the background saying: ‘Ahhhhh, kill it!!’ A few more whacks later, and the tiny babies were running everywhere on the floor. But to his surprise after smashing the female spider a few times with the broom hundreds of babies appear . After giving the spider some more whacks for good measure, the man was heard saying: ‘It’s dead.’ Finally the broom was used for what it was made for - sweeping up what was left on the floor. The Australian Repile Park website explains that after mating, the female wolf spider produces a silk mat into which she deposits around 100 eggs. Soon the tiny baby spiders are trying to make a run for it all over the kitchen floor . The silk is then rolled into a protective ball which she attaches to her abdomen and proceeds to carry it around with her until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the babies crawl onto the mother's back and remain there until their fat reserves have been used up and they need to start finding their own food, which may take several months. That is unless the female spider is cracked a few times over the head with a broom. With the spider now dead the man sweeps it up as well as the babies that are spread all around .","A wolf spider races across a kitchen floor in Hallett Cove, South Australia .

"A canal bank beneath a busy flyover might not rank as paradise. But for this puzzled puffin – apparently suffering a navigation malfunction and pining for the Atlantic – it was welcome sanctuary. The confused bird was seen swimming in the Grand Union canal earlier this month after apparently flying into London along the Thames. This puzzled puffin was spotted flying into London along the Thames, close to the A4 flyover at Brentford . The distinctive bird with an orange beak was spotted by an eagle-eyed canal boat resident. The puffin was given some fish and wrapped in a blanket, before being handed to a specialist centre  in Dorset to recuperate . More commonly seen in Iceland and the North Atlantic, it was spotted near the A4 flyover at Brentford. Its holiday came to an end when a canal-boat resident caught sight of its distinctive beak and alerted the appropriate authorities. Steve Knight, of the Swan Sanctuary in nearby Shepperton, caught the bird, which has now been handed over to a specialist centre in Dorset, where he is being nursed back to full health. ‘I’ve never rescued a puffin before but these birds dive very quickly so you’ve got to be quick about it,’ he said.‘ . 'All he knew about it was a big net coming over him and that was it. He looked pretty exhausted and hungry, and he seemed to have lost weight. The puffin was spotted swimming in the Grand Union Canal (left) while the species normally reside in Iceland . 'I gather they normally eat sand eels but there aren’t too many of them in the Grand Union, so we gave him some whitebait.’ Sanctuary founder Dot Beeson added she believes the puffin got lost or was blown off course by recent winds.","Bird was spotted near the A4 flyover at Brentford after flying along Thames .

"All well and good having Brazilians in your team but they have to be the right ones – Barcelona reached the Champions League semi-finals at the Nou Camp at Paris Saint Germain’s expense and Neymar tied David Luiz in knots in the process. There were no Luis Suarez nutmegs this time but the former Chelsea defender found himself backpedaling hopelessly on the quarter hour as Neymar scooted past him for Barcelona’s opener. Neymar (top) celebrates with Brazilian compatriot Dani Alves after scoring his and Barcelona's second goal of the night . Neymar accelerates past another Brazil teammate, David Luiz, before opening the scoring for Barcelona on Tuesday night . Barcelona: Ter Stegen 6.5; Dani Alves 7.5, Pique 5, Mascherano 6, Jordi Alba 6; Rakitic 7.5, Busquets 7 (Sergi Roberto 55, 6), Iniesta 9 (Xavi 45, 6.5); Messi 6.5, Suarez 6.5 (Pedro 75, 6), Neymar 9. Subs not used: Bravo, Bartra, Adriano, Rafinha. Goals: Neymar 14, 34. PSG: Sirigu 6; Van der Wiel 3.5, Marquinhos 4.5, Luiz 5, Maxwell 6; Verratti 6, Cabaye 4 (Lucas Moura 66, 6.5), Matuidi 6 (Rabiot 80, 6); Cavani 4 (Lavezzi 80, 6.5), Ibrahimovic 4.5, Pastore 3. Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Digne,  Bahebeck. Booked: Luiz. Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) He was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team-mate got the second climbing unmarked to head Dani Alves’ cross past Salvatore Sirigu to make it 5-1 on aggregate. PSG’s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again. Luiz was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on Andres Iniesta, who ran the first half. The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca’s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar’s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant – to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered. Barcelona star Lionel Messi is reunited with his former Nou Camp teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic before kick-off on Tuesday night .

Great Britain's tennis No 1 Andy Murray (left) was at the Nou Camp alongside his friend and former tennis player Ross Hutchins . PSG did force a save from Marc-Andre Ter Stegen 10 minutes into the second half when Ibrahimovic tried his luck from distance but the German keeper who has watched Claudio Bravo not put a foot wrong in the league all season gave another faultless display. Missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in Berlin would be some consolation. Luis Enrique’s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn’t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts. Barcelona still have a league to win and play the Catalan derby against Espanyol this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over Real Madrid. Iniesta had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time. His performance and at times Barca’s was a throwback to some of their best football under Pep Guardiola when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011. Iniesta was in sensational form for Barcelona before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder Xavi . Barcelona's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best . Guardiola was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that Bayern were mauling Porto and were also heading for the semi-finals. The prospect of Barcelona and Bayern being drawn together on Thursday is mouth-watering. Although perhaps on current form, and in view of his side’s injuries, Guardiola might prefer to leave the reunions for Berlin on June 6.

"A 13-year-old boy who was allegedly locked in a basement for 11 days has testified against his father and stepmother in court, saying his home was a 'very terrible' place where he was often beaten with a plastic pipe, forced to rise before dawn for workouts and isolated from other children. He revealed his treatment was so horrific, he attempted suicide in a bid to escape his parents' torture. Taking the stand against Charlie Bothuell IV and Monique Dillard-Bothuell on Tuesday, Charlie Bothuell, who was 12 when he was found in the basement, described the horrors of his home life. 'It was a very terrible place to be,' he told the court of his family's Detroit townhouse. 'I was expected to do everything perfectly. I was never given any leeway, to make a mistake and learn from it.' Charlie, who wore glasses, a white shirt, a tie and black pants for his hour-long testimony, was speaking publicly for the first time since he was found in his family's cluttered and dirty basement. Scroll down for video . Testimony: Charlie Bothuell (pictured), now 13, was found in the basement of his family's Detroit townhouse last June following an 11-day search. On Tuesday, he testified in court against his father and stepmother . Basement: Taking the stand against Charlie Bothuell IV and Monique Dillard-Bothuell on Tuesday, Charlie, who was 12 when he was found in the tiny, dirty basement (pictured), described the horrors of his home life . 'Weapon': He said his home was a 'very terrible' place where he was beaten with this plastic pipe (pictured being presented as evidence in court), forced to rise before dawn for workouts and isolated from other kids . Police officers who dramatically rescued the youngster on the eleventh day of a wide-scale search for him also found a blanket, cereal box, drinks bottles and a bowl of chicken bones in the tiny room. The hearing is meant to determine if there is enough evidence to send Bothuell IV and his partner to trial on charges of torture and child abuse. A 36th District Court judge will make the decision. During Tuesday's testimony, Charlie did not look at the prosecutor as he described how he was educated at home from 2012. His daily routine involved waking up at 5am for a protein shake. He was then forced to endure vigorous workouts that lasted up to two hours, followed by a shower, math and science lessons with old books, chores and another workout, he told the court. 'What would happen if you didn't do this routine?' asked the prosecutor. Charlie replied: 'I would get in trouble, a whipping.' The youngster said he tried to run away aged 11, but police found him. After he was returned home, 'I was told to basically lay across the dining room table and was spanked on the butt with a wooden stick and then a plastic PVC pipe,' Charlie told the court. Accused: 'It was a very terrible place to be,' Charlie said. 'I was expected to do everything perfectly. I was never given any leeway, to make a mistake and learn from it.'

Charlie's face was not pictured by the press as he gave his testimony; only his hands were shown (above) He recalled other 'whoopings' with sticks and pipes, which would cause the skin on his buttocks to bleed and 'split open'. 'Why did you lay over the dining room table,' the prosecutor asked him. According to Fox 2, Charlie replied: 'Because I was told to. (I) laid over the dining room table and I would be basically smacked on the butt.' The prosecutor then inquired: 'With what?' 'A wooden stick,' Charlie said. 'Then a plastic PVC pipe.' He added that his stepmother would sometimes punch him - and once even choked him. He was left feeling depressed and upset. The expectations about life at home were ""absolutely ridiculous', said Charlie, detailing how was made to stand in the corner with his arms held above his head if he did not complete assignments. 'They decided when they wanted me to stop. It was so painful,' he said. He added that he even attempted suicide in a bid to escape the abusive conditions at his home, WXYZ reported. Home: A neighbor near the Bothuells' home showed Daily Mail Online the bathroom that Charlie likely used . Tunnel: The bathroom was accessible via this tunnel (right), according to the neighbor, The tunnel's outside door (left) is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men, but crucially, it was left open during the time Charlie was missing so that residents could get rid of a build-up of trash in a dumpster left outside . Discovery: Police officers who dramatically rescued the youngster from the house (pictured) on the eleventh day of a wide-scale search also found a blanket, cereal box and a bowl of chicken bones in the basement . Earlier in the hearing, detective Sgt. Ken Ducker testified about finding Charlie in the roughly 600-square-foot space when he went downstairs looking for evidence that might help the search. 'I was not expecting to find him,' Ducker said. A doctor said the boy was thin with several bruises. Defense attorneys claim Charlie is a liar who left and returned to the house on his own. Bothuell IV insists he didn't know his son was in the basement, which has no door at the top of the stairs. Attorney Shawn Smith asked Ducker if he believed the boy - who is now living with his mother - was in the basement for all 11 days, but a prosecutor objected. The question went unanswered. Judge Shannon Holmes ended the hearing before Charlie was asked about what happened last June. The youngster, who had lived with his father for two years, will return to court on May 6. Reaction: Bothuell IV, who insists he didn't know his son was in the basement, was giving a live TV interview when he was told his son had been found by police. He appeared to be shocked by the news (pictured) 'Abusive'L Dillard-Bothuell, who allegedly once choked her stepson, is seen in court at an earlier hearing .","Charlie Bothuell, now 13, was discovered in Detroit basement last June .

"Top-ranked Serena Williams had to fight back from a set down and figure out how to deal with strong winds before overcoming Italy's Sara Errani 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-3 in a Fed Cup play-off Sunday, giving the United States a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series. While Williams held a massive 70-7 lead in winners, she committed nearly three times as many unforced errors as the 15th-ranked Errani. Until the very end, Williams struggled to dictate play against an opponent who had never before presented her with serious problems. Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday . Still, Williams improved to 20-0 this year and 16-0 in Fed Cup for her career. Next up, Brindisi-born Flavia Pennetta was facing 65th-ranked Christina McHale, followed by a potentially decisive doubles match. The doubles teams named were McHale and Alison Riske against Karin Knapp and Pennetta. But U.S. captain Mary Joe Fernandez has said that Williams will play doubles if the series is tied, in which case Errani would likely pair with Pennetta. Williams entered with a 7-0 career edge over Errani and had lost a total of four games in their previous two meetings. She usually dominates Errani by taking advantage of the Italian's weak serve but the wind prevented her from stepping too far into the court. Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves . The Circolo Tennis Brindisi is located next to the southern city's port and a sharp breeze was blowing off the bay. Williams and Errani often had to catch their tosses and start their service motions over again, or delay play when the wind whipped clay into their eyes between points. 'The wind helped me,' Errani said. 'Against a player like her it favored me.' Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world no 1's power proved to be too much . Already in the first three games of the match, Williams committed nine unforced errors as Errani played her usual defensive game and just tried to keep the rallies going. With the soldout crowd of 4,000 chanting her first name, Errani served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but Williams played solidly and then the American surged to a 6-1 lead in the tiebreaker and pushed it to a third. There were four consecutive breaks of serve to open the third set and it was tied 3-3 before Williams finally surged ahead and won the final three games, closing it out at love in the last game on her first match point. 'It's a shame. I was so close. It was just a matter of a few points,' Errani said. 'But in the end, she created the difference.'","Serena Williams defeated Sara Errani for the United States in the Fed Cup .

"Mirko 'Cro Cop' Filipovic delivered on his promise to exact revenge as he stopped Gabriel Gonzaga in the third round of their long-awaited heavyweight rematch in Krakow.

"A newborn baby girl who was found dead inside a garbage can outside an Ohio sorority house last week was born alive and then suffocated, according to the coroner. A preliminary ruling from the Muskingum County coroner on Monday said the baby found at Muskingum University campus was nearly full term when she was born, NBC4 reported. The child's mother is a student at the small school in New Concord, authorities said last week, but they have refused to release her name. Scroll down for video . Found: A newborn girl was found inside the trash outside the Delta Gamma Theta sorority house, pictured, at Muskingum University last Wednesday. It has now emerged the baby was alive when she was born . They interviewed her after the child's body was found on Wednesday night outside the Delta Gamma Theta sorority house on Lakeside Drive. No charges have been filed. A University police officer called the sheriff’s office at around 9pm on Wednesday after he reported seeing a dead newborn outside the building. The body was inside a plastic bag in the garbage can, according to reports. It's the second time a baby has died of asphyxiation at the school, The Times Reporter noted. Jennifer Bryant, then 22, was arrested on involuntary manslaughter and other charges in 2002 after she gave birth to a baby boy in her campus apartment and then put him in the trash. He later died. Bryant, who was a student at the school, pleaded guilty and was sentenced in to three years in prison in 2003, but she was released after seven months. Tragic: It is the second time an abandoned baby has died at the university campus in eastern Ohio. In 2002, the body of a baby boy was found in a dumpster and his mother served seven months in prison . Ohio has a Safe Haven Law that's been in place since 2001 allowing mothers of newborns to anonymously leave their child at a hospital or fire station. The newborn is then placed with child services and hopefully then put in a loving home. As long as the newborn shows no sign of abuse or neglect then the mother does not face any legal charges. Muskingum University, which is about 70 miles east of Columbus, has 3,000 students. See below for video .","The body of a baby girl was found inside a plastic bag in a trash can outside the Delta Gamma Theta at Muskingum University last week .
An autopsy has now revealed that the baby was born alive and was nearly full term but died from asphyxiation .
The child's mother, whose name has not been released, has spoken with police but has not been charged ."
"Chad Geyen (above) of Ramsey, Minnesota was found dead on Sunday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound . A man charged with multiple counts of sexual abuse against young boys killed himself the day before his trial. Chad Geyen, a married father of two from Ramsey, Minnesota, was found dead on Sunday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a park near his home. He had been accused of assaulting at least six boys hundreds of times, including his own foster son, between 1990 and 2013. The Star Tribune reports that Geyen, 45, was first reported missing on Saturday night, having been out on bail since he was first charged in November 2013. He was set to stand trial on five counts of first-degree and two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. Of the six individuals who have come forward, four are now adults, with the oldest saying the abuse began between him and Geyen when he was part of the Big Brothers organization. Another boy claims Geyen once paid him $20 to perform a sexual act, while a third actually lived with the man as his foster child. That individual says he was 5-years-old when the abuse began, and that it occurred hundreds of times. All the boys were under the age of 13 when the alleged abuse began. While investigating, authorities found a fake Facebook account created by Geyen in which he claimed to be a 13-year-old girl to communicate with young boys. There was also visits to a 'boy-love' site in his web history. 'It’s pretty unusual [for abuse cases] to go undetected after having this much contact with victims over such a long period of time,' said Anoka County Sheriff’s Cmdr. Paul Sommer when the charges were first filed. 'There were hundreds of alleged incidents.' The Hennepin County medical examiner’s office is set to release further details about Geyen's death later this week. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Chad Geyen of Ramsey, Minnesota was found dead on Sunday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound .

"Serena Williams will be 34 at the end of a summer that she looks all set to enter without having been beaten on tour in 2015. She heads into Saturday's final of the Miami Open with a 17-0 record, and will surely extend that winning sequence against the admirable but somewhat limited Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro. The somewhat scary thing about Williams is that, by her own admission, she is not even playing her best, and yet she is still ahead of the rest of the field by a country mile. Serena Williams celebrates after reaching the Miami Open final to continue her unbeaten run in 2015 . Williams was taken the distance by world No 2 Simona Halep in the semi finals in Florida . The world No 1 has a win record of 17-0 since the start of the year and looks unbeatable . The younger of the two famous siblings currently has sore knees that are restricting her practice, and she was forced into a mighty struggle in the semi-final by world No 3 Simona Halep before coming through 6-2 4-6 7-5. At least the Romanian, the WTA Tour's second best player this season, was able to lay a glove on the world No 1. Every other challenger seems to be struggling in their own way and, while there is no questioning the phenomenal and enduring quality of Williams, it also says something about the rest of the field that she will probably head into the clay court season unbeaten. 1 If she wins on Saturday she will have earned £4.33m in prize-money already this season. 2 She has actually lost this season, to Agnieszka Radwanska in January' s Hopman Cup, but the event's status means it does not count in the official records. 3 Straight after the Australian Open, Serena flew all the way to Argentina to play one match for the USA in the Fed Cup — which she needed to do to be eligible for next year's Olympic Games in Rio (she beat Maria Irigoyen 7-5, 6-0). 4 Serena has lost only five sets on tour this season, two at the Australian Open, one in Indian Wells, and two in Miami. 5 The player who has won most matches this season is Simona Halep on 26, but she has also lost twice. 'Somehow I've improvised my way to the final,' said Williams, who could have finished Halep off in straight sets. 'I'm just not at my best level right now and it's a little frustrating. I am not serving well, I'm serving at 40%, so it hasn't been my best of times.' And yet still she keeps winning, with no sign of the implosions that cost her at the Grand Slams last year apart from the US Open. Last year was an unusual one for women's tennis in that eight different players reached the finals of the Majors, but those who shared the biggest stages with Williams have, with the exception of Halep, failed to train on that much. In some cases it has been a trying season that has shown again how emotionally and physically taxing it is right at the top of the women's game. The youngest of tennis' most successful siblings drops to her knees after winning the Australian Open . Williams has won the last two grand slams at the US Open (left) and in Melbourne (right) Wiliams was forced to withdraw ahead of the semi finals at Indian Wells, the only blemish to her 2015 showings . The 33-year-old was presented with a celebratory cake in Miami after winning her 700th career match . The exceptionally talented Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova has actually sat out the last two significant events, here and at Indian Wells, with exhaustion. Happily it appears likely that she will be returning for the clay court season. Eugenie Bouchard faces the intimidating task of backing up her remarkable breakthrough year of 2014 that few expected, and made a good start at the Australian Open by making the quarter final. Yet she was in tears at Indian Wells as she lost to world No 85 Lesia Tsurenko and afterwards admitted she needed to relax more. In Miami she lost her opening match to Germany's Tatjana Maria, the world No 113 who is the highest ranked mother on the tour. America's Madison Keys, universally tipped as a future Grand Slam champion, was another one who struggled to contain her emotions here when she went out to Sloane Stephens. Of last year's other Grand Slam champions Li Na has retired while Maria Sharapova has yet to build on the strong start that she had in Australia. The world No 2 lost her opening match in Miami to Russian wildcard Daria Gavrilova and it is, in any event, difficult to build up any rivalry between her and Williams as she has lost against her the last sixteen times they have played. Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro is unlikely to provide much resistance against Williams in Saturday's final . Halep is closest to challenging Williams' dominance while Maria Sharapova needs to push on after a good start . Golden girl Eugenie Bouchard is a possible contender to challenge Williams after breaking through last year . America's Madison Keys, universally tipped as a future Grand Slam champion, was another one who struggled to contain her emotions here when she went out to Sloane Stephens. Of last year's other Grand Slam champions, Li Na has retired while Maria Sharapova has yet to build on the strong start that she had in Australia. Romania's Halep, a relatively late developer whose game is based on her supremely athletic movement, right now looks the biggest threat to Williams, and she might well be the best long-term bet for the French Open.","World No 1 has not been beaten since the start of the year with 17-0 record .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have savagely executed 10 doctors who refused to treat wounded members of the terrorist organisation. ISIS jihadis are understood to have been fighting local groups in the Hammam al-Alil area when several of them sustained injuries requiring medical treatment. When the doctors refused on the grounds they do not support the terror group's activities, the men were brutally murdered. Scroll down for video . Details of the doctors' brutal murders in the northern Iraqi desert were reported by the country's Al-Sumaria satellite television network. Local official Mowaffaq Hamid al-Azawi described the city of Mosul as a big open-air prison, where residents are subjected to barbaric torture at the hands of the ISIS terrorists. The news comes as the jihadis reportedly executed 60 Sunni tribal fighters in Iraq's Anbar province. Members of the Al-Karableh, Albu Ubaid, Albu Mahal and Albu Salman tribes were brutally executed after paranoid ISIS militants accused them of collaborating with the Iraqi security forces. Iraqi Army soldiers and the Iran-backed volunteer Shiite militias allied with the Iraqi regime have had great success in pushing ISIS out of key towns and villages recently. Just last week the security forces liberated the city of Tikrit - the birthplace of Saddam Hussein and a strategically important area from which the Iraqi Army will look to recapture Mosul and eventually force ISIS out of the country altogether. Militants: ISIS jihadis (pictured) are understood to have been fighting local groups in the Hammam al-Alil area when several of them sustained injuries requiring medical treatment . This morning U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the U.S. has made progress against ISIS in Iraq but cannot predict how long the fight will take. Speaking at a joint news conference with his South Korean counterpart, Carter said he would not go so far as to say this is the beginning of the end for ISIS in Iraq. ISIS' onslaught plunged Iraq into its worst crisis since the 2011 U.S. troop withdrawal from the country. The militants have also targeted Iraq's indigenous religious minorities, including Christians and followers of the ancient Yazidi faith, forcing tens of thousands from their homes. Since then, ISIS has carved out a self-styled caliphate in the large area straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border that it now controls. In early August, the United States launched airstrikes on the militant group in Iraq, in an effort to help Iraqi forces fight back against the growing threat by the IS militants, who still hold the northern Iraqi province of Ninevah and most of the western province of Anbar, in addition to small areas north of Baghdad in their hands, along with a large swath of land in neighboring Syria. More than 200 Yazidi prisoners have been set free in northern Iraq after nearly a year in Islamic State captivity, Kurdish military has said today. The freed prisoners said that they had been led to believe they were being led to their execution, but instead, were piled onto a minibus that drove them to peshmerga positions. The Yazidis, made up of women, children and the elderly, are said to be in poor health and bearing signs of abuse and neglect. Fear: The 216 prisoners, including 40 children, believed they were being led to their execution, but instead, were piled onto minibuses that drove them to a handover southwest of Kirkuk . Free at last: A mother hugs here young child in celebration at being released. The freed Yazidis were taken away by ambulances and buses to receive treatment and care . The 216 prisoners have been held captive in the Islamic State since last summer when militants attacked their villages in the area around Sinjar in northwestern Iraq. General Hiwa Abdullah, a peshmerga commander in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, said that about 40 children are among those released, while the rest were elderly, some of whom were too exhausted and disoriented to speak. No reason was given for the release of the prisoners, which took place in Himera just southwest of Kirkuk, 180 miles north of Baghdad. The freed Yazidis were taken away by ambulances and buses to receive treatment and care. One elderly woman said she had been captured by the . insurgents last August when they overpowered Kurdish forces in . the Sinjar area and proceeded to purge its Yazidi population, . killing hundreds and taking thousands captive.","Jihadis were fighting in Hammam al-Alil, south of their Mosul stronghold .

"As a childhood friend of pop star Ed Sheeran it would be understandable if Jonny May felt like singing the blues with the memory of being dropped by England still painfully fresh in his mind. Just a couple of months after scoring a sensational first international try against New Zealand, May was axed for striking the wrong note by ignoring an overlap in England’s Six Nations win over Italy. He was told to go away and learn his lessons back at Gloucester. With a mother who taught Sheeran to play the guitar as a youngster, learning lessons has never been a problem for the 25-year-old May, who insists the best years of his rugby life are ahead of him. Jonny May will start on the wing for Gloucester at the Stoop on Friday but has lost his England starting place . He starts on the wing for Gloucester on Friday night, as David Humphreys’ men take on Edinburgh in the final of the European Challenge Cup in a bid to claim a first significant piece of silverware since winning the same competition in 2006. ‘Obviously when you get dropped it is not a nice thing but I’m trying to learn from it and turn it into a positive by becoming a better player,’ May said. ‘It’s part of what being a professional rugby player is. I’m not an old player but I’ve experienced it here, I’ve experienced bad games and made mistakes here and there. ‘There are times I’ve had bad games at Gloucester or injuries or setbacks or come across weaknesses in my game. I’ve reflected on it and come back a better player. ‘I’m 25 years old and feel like I’m still improving and progressing.’ May is comfortable in the limelight, unfazed by the big stage and even claims some responsibility for setting Sheeran on the way to global superstardom; his mum, Hazel, taught the teenager his first chords on a guitar. ‘Ed was in our network of friends, and he was into his classical music but my mum used to play guitar along with others in that circle,’ May said. ‘He saw my mum playing and wanted to learn so she taught him some chords and off he went.’ Gloucester wing Jonny May leaves the pitch injured during the first-half against Newcastle on Saturday . Gloucester's Billy Twelvetrees (centre) trains ahead of the European Challenge Cup final in London . The Hartpury College graduate admitted after his wonder try in the defeat to the All Blacks last November that he’d listened to Sheeran and Taylor Swift on his iPod in the build-up to the game. Hardly the conventional choice to get in the mood to play the world champions but convention is not something that unduly concerns May on or off the field. And despite the disappointment of losing his England place to Exeter’s Jack Nowell, May has no intention of becoming a conformist any time soon. ‘You can’t really be worried about messing up because that’s the last place you want to be as a player,’ he said. ‘You’ve just got to go out there and believe in what you see and do it straight away with no hesitation. It’s sport, you have bad games, get injuries and get dropped.’ Edinburgh trained at Murrayfield in Scotland ahead of facing Gloucester at the Stoop on Friday . Edinburgh will arrive at the Stoop confident of upsetting Gloucester but the Cherry and Whites are expected to have a vastly superior support with upwards of 6,000 fans expected to travel to west London on Friday night. The English side will have the added advantage of scrum-half Greig Laidlaw in their ranks — who signed from Edinburgh last season — while the addition of Wales hooker Richard Hibbard and former All Black prop John Afoa has added much-needed ballast to Gloucester’s pack. ‘To win this competition would provide the foundations to show we are up and coming and we want to improve and get better,’ May added. ‘It would give us a stepping board to progress. If we do want to be a team that is competitive in the Premiership and competitive in the upper tier of Europe I think we have the players, the fanbase and the club to be very competitive at the top of all leagues.’ Gloucester scrum-half Greig Laidlaw, in action for his current side, signed from Edinburgh last season .","Gloucester take on Edinburgh in European Challenge Cup final on Friday .

"Top-ranked Serena Williams overcame a stiff challenge in the opening set for a 7-6 (5), 6-2 win over Camila Giorgi on Saturday to give the United States a 1-0 lead over Italy in a Fed Cup World Group playoff. Neither player broke serve in a highly competitive first set, which was only decided when Giorgi's forehand clipped the top of the net on Williams' first set point. Williams improved to 19-0 this year and 15-0 for her career in Fed Cup. The only blemish on Williams' record this year came when she withdrew before the Indian Wells semifinals last month with a knee injury. Serena Williams handed USA the lead against Italy with a first victory in the Fed Cup . The world No 1 shakes hands with US captain Mary Joe Fernandez after putting USA ahead . The second match in the best-of-five series featured 57th-ranked American Lauren Davis playing No. 15 Sara Errani. The winner returns to the World Group and can compete for the Fed Cup trophy next year while the loser will be relegated to the World Group II. Giorgi was a surprise choice by captain Corrado Barazzutti for Italy's second singles spot over Brindisi-born Flavia Pennetta but the 23-year-old showed surprising poise and was even able to match Williams' power in the opening set. Williams defeated Camila Giorgi 7-6, 6-2 on the clay in Brindisi, Italy . Williams was matched shot for shot by Giorgi in the first set before breaking away in the second . Giorgi matched Williams with 17 winners apiece in the first set - which lasted more than an hour - while Williams committed 18 unforced errors to Giorgi's 15. Unable to impose her game, Williams appeared frustrated and kept shouting ""Come on!"" to herself in angrier and angrier tones as the first set wore on. And she consistently applauded, using one hand and her racket, when Giorgi blasted winners by her. But Williams played solidly in the tiebreaker and then surged ahead early in the second set.","USA face Italy in a Fed Cup World play off in Brindisi .

"The Finnish military says it has dropped depth charges onto a suspected submarine in the sea outside Helsinki after twice detecting the presence of a foreign object. The navy said it noticed an underwater target yesterday and again this morning and fired some warning charges the size of grenades. Finland, which shares an 833-mile  border with Russia, has been increasingly worried about its powerful neighbour after a year of Russian air force sorties and military border exercises. A Finnish coastguard ship tracks the underwater object - believed to have been a Russian submarine - in the waters near the capital Helsinki . Border patrol boats first identified an underwater target yesterday, before detecting it again early this morning and dropping 'warning' depth charges . Finland defence minister Carl Haglund did not say whether Russia was involved but told local media that it was extremely rare for the military to use such warning charges. Pictured is a Finnish navy boat . The Finland incident comes just months after Sweden's armed forces hunted unsuccessfully for what they believed to have been a foreign submarine close to Stockholm . It comes just months after Sweden suspected Russia of sending a vessel into waters close to the capital Stockholm. In what was Sweden's biggest mobilisation since the Cold War, its navy hunted unsuccessfully for a week for what they believed to be a foreign submarine after several observations were made. Swedish officials never blamed any country, though most defense analysts said Russia was a likely culprit. Today Finland defence minister Carl Haglund did not say whether Russia was involved but told local media that the target could have been a submarine, and that it has likely left the area, adding that Finland has rarely used such warning charges. He said: 'We strongly suspect that there has been underwater activity that does not belong there. Finland first alerted its navy to a 'possible underwater target' about midday yesterday . 'Of course it is always serious if our territorial waters have been violated,' he told Finnish news agency STT. Moscow retorted immediately, saying moves by Finland and Sweden towards closer ties with NATO were of 'special concern'. In a statement, the Finland Ministry of Defence said its surveillance system first alerted its navy to a 'possible underwater target' within territorial waters about midday yesterday. A second detection was then made early this morning after the navy began searching for the object, and underwater depth charges were fired at 3am. Commodore Olavi Jantunen told Helsingin Sanomat newspaper: 'The bombs are not intended to damage the target, the purpose is to let the target know that it has been noticed.' Reports of a submarine spotted off Stockholm last year led to Sweden's biggest mobilization since the Cold War. Regional tensions were reflected earlier in April after an unprecedented hawkish joint statement by Nordic countries - Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Iceland - that directly cited the Russian 'challenge' as grounds to increase defense cooperation.","The Finnish military has dropped depth charges on a possible submarine .

"A shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya has been released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the west of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. This follows another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film. It raises fears that ISIS is consolidating its presence on the 'doorstep of Europe', as Libya is just a few hundred miles from the coast of Italy. Scroll down for video . Thirty Ethiopian Christians appear to have been beheaded and shot by ISIS in a sickening new propaganda video. Above, at least 16 men are marched down a beach in Libya by militants before they are killed . Ethiopia was unable to confirm its citizens were killed in the footage but condemned the 'atrocious act', a government official said. The video shows the men at the coast wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits and being held at the neck by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces. The victims inland are forced to kneel as militants dressed in combats and green masks stand behind them holding rifles. It starts with what it called a 'history of Christian-Muslim relations', which includes scenes of militants destroying churches, graves and icons. A masked fighter in black then brandishes a pistol as he vows to kill Christians if they do not convert. In an apparent reference to Ethiopia's attacks on neighbouring Somalia, whose population is almost entirely Muslim, he says: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again.' The footage, which was released on websites and social media accounts officially linked to ISIS, also cuts to Christians in Syria explaining how they were given the choice of converting to Islam or paying a 'special tax'. At the end it switches between the two sets of captives - thought to be mainly migrant workers - with one group shot dead at point-blank range and the others beheaded on the beach. The video has not yet been verified. The men - wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits - are held at the neck and forced to kneel by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces . The men, thought to be migrant works, are described by Islamic State in the video as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church' The footage also shows around 12 men being shot in a desert area, believed to be in the south of the country, by militants wearing green balaclavas and combats . A masked fighter in black (right) brandishing a pistol vows to kill Christians if they do not convert, saying: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again' The victims are forced to kneel in front of the militants (above) before being shot at point-blank range simultaneously. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group . The militant in black - who is completely covered apart from his eyes - remains flanked by two people holding guns throughout the clip . Ethiopia is a predominantly Christian country with the religion being introduced in the country the 4th century, making it one of the oldest Christian states in the world. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is one of the oldest organized Christian bodies in the world, and more than 40 per cent of the population are members of the church. Around 20 per cent of the population follow other branches of Christianity, a majority being Protestant. Islam was not introduced in the country for another 300 years, and now about one third of Ethiopians identify as Muslim. Initial reports did not make clear who the captives were or when they were captured. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group. Redwan Hussein, an Ethiopian government spokesman, said officials were in contact with its embassy in Cairo to verify the video's authenticity. He said he believed those killed were likely to have been Ethiopian migrants hoping to reach Europe. Libya has become a hub for migrants across Africa hoping to cross the Mediterranean to enter Europe for work and better lives. 'If this is confirmed, it will be a warning to people who wish to risk and travel to Europe though the dangerous route,' Mr Hussein said. He added that Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Libya, would help repatriate Ethiopians if they wanted to leave. Libyan officials were not immediately available for comment. Abba Kaletsidk Mulugeta, an official with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church's Patriarchate Office, said he also believed the victims  were likely to have been migrants. 'I believe this is just another case of the IS group killing Christians in the name of Islam. Our fellow citizens have just been killed on a faith-based violence that is totally unacceptable. This is outrageous,' he said. 'No religion orders the killing of other people, even people from another religion.' Ethiopia's options to retaliate remain slim, given its distance from Libya. However, Ethiopian Ambassador to Egypt Mohammed Edrees said his country could partner with Cairo to strike the militants. 'That could be an option,' Mr Edrees said. 'We will see and explore what is possible to deal with group.' It comes just two months after the extremist group in Libya beheaded 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a beach (above) The latest video mirrored a film released in February showing militants beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach (pictured above), which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya . Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate for the Middle East Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: 'The Islamic State in Libya is still focused on this consolidation phase of announcing its presence through these very high-profile executions. But they face some structural limits in terms of how much local support they can get because they haven't captured real revenue streams.' It comes just two months after IS militants  filmed themselves beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a similar beach, which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya. ISIS has been able to gain a foothold amid chaos in Libya, where two governments backed by rival alliances of militias are battling each other as well as extremist groups. The group is also advancing in Iraq, where it has captured three villages near the city of Ramadi. Islamic State fighters, pictured carrying flags and dressed in black, have been able to gain a foothold amid the chaos in Libya . More than 90,000 people have fled the ISIS's advance in Anbar, a United Nations humanitarian agency said earlier this morning. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement that civilians are fleeing Ramadi as well as the three nearby villages captured by the IS group a few days ago. Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, said: 'Our top priority is delivering life-saving assistance to people who are fleeing - food, water and shelter are highest on the list of priorities.' Iraqi officials in Anbar have described Ramadi as a ghost town, with empty streets and closed shops. Iraqi troops backed by Shiite militias and U.S.-led airstrikes managed to dislodge ISIS, which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria and wants to redraw the map of the Middle East, from the northern city of Tikrit earlier this month. But the troops have struggled against the militants in Anbar, which saw some of the heaviest fighting of the eight-year U.S. military intervention that ended in 2011. Elsewhere today, the US-led coalition said Kurdish forces recaptured 11 villages in Iraq's Kirkuk province from ISIS following days of intense clashes. The coalition said the area of about 25 square miles (65 square kilometers) was south of the city of Kirkuk.","Video seems to show militants in Libya holding one group of at least 16 captive on a beach and 12 others in a desert .

"A Russian nuclear submarine that caught fire in a shipyard was submerged to extinguish the blaze yesterday. The emergency move came after premature reports that the flames had been put out. Defence sources said the submarine's weapons and critical elements of its nuclear reactor had been removed before the fire broke out. Scroll down for video . Smoke: The submarine that caught fire in a shipyard was submerged to extinguish the blaze yesterday . Defence sources said the submarine's weapons and critical elements of its nuclear reactor had been removed before the fire broke out . The 500ft-long Oryol was in dock at Zvezdochka shipyard in Severodvinsk, 620 miles north of Moscow, on the White Sea. The submarine's dry dock was filled with water to put out the fire - a move taken after news agencies carried reports saying the emergency was already over. 'Preparation for filling the dry dock with water is underway,' said spokesman Ilya Zhitomirsky. 'The operation is necessary to extinguish the fire completely.' Filling the hull with foam to stop the flames spreading was 'not yielding results,' said a source. 'No workers or members of the crew were harmed during the fire,' said Zhitomirsky. A source told TASS news agency the submarine's nuclear reactor had been shut down prior to the blaze. 'The active zone of the reactor was unloaded at the start of repairs a few years ago,' the source said. Emergency: A submarine undergoes repairs at Zvezdochka shipyard in Severodvinsk in 2012.

"Bolton look to have secured their Sky Bet Championship status after shocking Cardiff to claim a 3-0 triumph in the Welsh capital. Craig Davies bagged a brace after Eidur Gudjohnsen hammered the Trotters in front, with 62-time England international Emile Heskey proving his worth by laying on two assists. Cardiff dominated possession, but were undone far too easily by Neil Lennon's clinical side, who now have a 13-point buffer on those in the relegation zone. Eidur Gudjohnsen, pictured with fellow goalscorer Craig Davies, celebrates after scoring against Cardiff . Craig Davies fired a double to ensure his side claimed all three points at the Cardiff City Stadium . CARDIFF (4-4-2): Marshall; Fabio, Ecuele Manga, Morrison; Malone; Noone, Whittingham, Gunnarsson (Kennedy 66mins), Ralls; Revell (Mason 38), Doyle (Harris 78) Subs not used: Peltier, Adeyemi, O'Keefe, Moore . BOLTON (5-3-2): Bogdan; Janko (Feeney 66), Mills, Dervite, Ream, Walker (Moxey 55); Vela, Gudjohnsen (Danns 74), Bannan; Davies, Heskey . Subs not used: Trotter, Rochinha, Lonergan, McCarthy . Goals: Gudjohnsen 55, Davies 59, 73 . Booked: Vela . Referee: Keith Stroud . Attendance: 20,219 . An early Heskey chance sparked a spell of Bluebirds dominance that saw Josh Vela booked for a late swipe at Peter Whittingham. The City playmaker soon had a chance of his own after sparking a move that saw Craig Noone find him on the edge of the box, but his low drive flew just wide. Noone cut in from his left flank and fired just wide before the Bluebirds had their best chance to open the scoring. A Whittingham corner landed at the feet of striker Eoin Doyle, who spun and shot, but he was denied by Barry Bannan on the Bolton line amid cries of handball. Just when the Trotters seemed to be pegged back, they had a chance of their own when Dorian Dervite rose highest to meet Bannan's corner, but Alex Revell was on hand to head away the goalbound effort. Cardiff midfielder Aron Gunnarsson looks dejected during his side's 3-0 home defeat . Dorian Dervitte is challenged by Joe Ralls during the Championship encounter at the Cardiff City Stadium . Joe Mason replaced the injured Revell before Gudjohnsen slipped in Davies who curled a clear-cut chance just wide. And they were almost made to pay after Gudjohnsen fouled his Iceland team-mate Aaron Gunnarson on the edge of the box, but Whittingham bent the free-kick inches past the post. The Cardiff City Stadium was shocked into silence in the 55th minute when Gudjohnsen put the below-par Wanderers ahead. Heskey took the sting out of a strong pass with his chest to set up the former Chelsea and Barcelona man inside the 18-yard box, and he lashed a left-footed strike into the top corner. And it was 2-0 less than five minutes later, with Heskey providing the scoring pass once more. His assist found Davies charging down the left wing, and the striker powered into the box and cracked a low shot through the legs of Marshall and into the bottom corner. Cardiff fans streamed out of the stands when Davies put the contest well and truly to bed in the 73rd minute. He bagged his brace by once again darting off his left flank and past Fabio before he bent the ball around the Marshall into the same corner he had scored in 14 minutes earlier. And Davies could have got a hat-trick soon after when he broke clear of the Cardiff defence, but Marshall denied him with his legs.

"James Hook claims it will be 'a bonus' if Wales come calling for his services ahead of this year's World Cup. The Gloucester fly-half has a golden opportunity to showcase his undisputed ability in Friday night's European Challenge Cup final against Edinburgh. But although 29-year-old Hook has won 77 Test caps, he can reflect on just two starts for Wales - against the Barbarians and Tonga - since the last World Cup in 2011. James Hook will hope to showcase his ability in the European Challenge Cup final against Edinburgh on Friday . The Gloucester fly-half hasn't given up on earning a Wales recall ahead of this summer's World Cup . Given Hook's quality at fly-half, centre and full-back, it is baffling to the layman that Wales head coach Warren Gatland cannot find room for him in his matchday 23 or wider squads. Gareth Anscombe is being widely touted as Wales' likely World Cup utility back, suggesting that even if Hook makes a 45-man training squad to be announced in early June, Gatland's final 31-man cut could prove beyond him. Asked about his Wales ambitions, Hook said: 'I always hope, but it is out of my hands. I have not had any contact or anything. 'It has probably helped me because I have focused on Gloucester and not thought about Wales. 'I do hope I get a shout from Wales at some point, but it has not happened for a while and I am not expecting it. If it does happen, great, if not ....' Hook, who made his Wales debut almost nine years ago and has featured in two World Cup campaigns, is philosophical about the current state of play. 'Rob Howley (Wales assistant coach) spoke to me last autumn about straightening up and things like that, so I am trying to bring that into my game,' Hook added. 'But other than that, I am trying to focus on what I have got to do here (at Gloucester), rather than what they want me to do. Hook says first and foremost he is focusing on what he needs to do with club side Gloucester . 'Wales play direct, and I would like to think I could fit into that if needed. I am more of a heads-up player, but I can stick to a structure if needed. 'In the past, you think a lot about the World Cup as it comes up, but not being in the squad has helped me take my focus off it and I am just enjoying my time with Gloucester and not thinking about Wales, in a way. 'I have taken the pressure off myself. I am not expecting anything to happen, and if it did, it would be a bonus. 'It is the first time in my career that has happened, which is frustrating because you want to be in there, but you get over it and focus on what you have to do. At 29, I should be in my prime, but that is the way it goes.' Top of Hook's immediate agenda will be to help Gloucester in their quest for European silverware, and that prospect is in stark contrast to his emotions 12 months ago with French club Perpignan. It is almost a year to the day since Perpignan were relegated from the Top 14 - the first time in their 103-year history they had suffered such an ignominy - and Hook was to sign for Gloucester just a month later. The 29-year-old says it was tough at Perpignan when the French side were relegated from the Top 14 last year . 'It was difficult then for Perpignan, and it is nice to be here with the chance to win something,' he said. 'It is a chance to go from relegation to a European final. 'It was disappointing how it ended in France, but this is a new challenge and we have been building throughout the season. 'I am improving game on game. Maybe I am a bit wiser now, and the more games I get at 10, the better I will become. 'David Humphreys (Gloucester rugby director) has given me that opportunity at fly-half, even when it was not going so well at the beginning of the season. 'He stuck with me, where other coaches may have shuffled me around a bit. I appreciate that, and I am trying to repay him with my performances. 'He has given me licence to bring my qualities into play, whether it is making a break or playing what I see. You have to play within the structure, and it is making the right decisions at the right time.'","Gloucester fly-half James Hook has won 77 Test caps for Wales .

"Islamic state militants have released photographs which appear to show the beheading of an 'alleged blasphemer.' A series of gruesome photographs show a man being led out of a van handcuffed and blindfolded before he is executed by a masked man, wielding a meat cleaver. His beheading is believed to have taken place in Hama in Syria. Scroll down for video . A man was apparently beheaded by ISIS in Hama, Syria, for being an alleged 'blasphemer' The series of photos are the latest images released by the militant group which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters and spread fear among those working against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In one of the images the victims is seen blindfolded and kneeling on the floor, surrounded by men with guns. An executioner, with his face covered, stands behind him with what appears to be a meat cleaver raised over his head. The next photo, which is too disturbing to publish, shows the man after he has been murdered with his severed head placed on his body. Each of the images are similar to videos released of British and American hostages who have also beheaded by the militants. A series of gruesome images show the man being led from a van in handcuffs and blindfolded . The man was forced to kneel down while blindfolded before he is apparently brutally executed . It follows a video released by ISIS which week that warns 'America will burn' and threatens a repeat of the 9/11 atrocity that saw the twin towers destroyed. The 11-minute video features some of the group's most brutal killings - such as the beheading of American journalist James Foley and the brutal burning of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh as he stood in a cage. The twin towers and still images of Osama bin Laden are also shown during the short video. Militants armed with rifles surround the man, while his executioner stands behind holding a meat cleaver . Propaganda is increasingly being used by ISIS as a way of attracting new recruits and gaining notoriety. The latest photographs follow a video released last month which show eight suspected informers, all dressed in red jumpsuits, being executed. In January, ISIS militants threatened to behead Barack Obama and turn the US into a Muslim province in another gruesome video that emerged from their self-styled caliphate.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Controversial wellness blogger Belle Gibson is still being investigated  over claims she faked her cancer battles, despite reports police had dropped the investigation. Victoria Police had explored the option of criminal charges being levelled against Ms Gibson after people began to question her cancer claims and charity work last month. One of the charges being considered was obtaining financial advantage by deception, but it had been dropped, according to the Herald Sun. Scroll down for video . Belle Gibson: Doubt has been cast on the Whole Pantry founder's stories as people demand answers from the health guru . However, Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia that its position in regards to the ongoing investigation, spearheaded by Consumer Affairs Victoria, had not changed. 'I know other things have been said this morning, but our approach is the same as it was yesterday and the day before that,' a Victoria Police spokeswoman said. Consumer Affairs Victoria said the investigation is continuing. 'As far as we're aware, nothing has changed,' a spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. The decision comes after Ms Gibson has expressed concern over her family's safety in her first comments to media since she admitted her terminal cancer may have been 'misdiagnosed'. Doting young mum: Ms Gibson has expressed concern about her family's safety after her son's childcare details were allegedly placed online . In an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Ms Gibson claimed her son's childcare details, her home address and floor plan had been posted online amidst the fierce  backlash against her. She said that was the reason 'police came to our home checking in on my safety' last week. Ms Gibson also hit out at some of her critics, saying that while she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion', some people had responded 'maliciously'. Ms Gibson's remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival . 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. The Instagram star did not address questions concerning her cancer diagnosis, saying she would 'have a statement live this week' where she would address medical questions. 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. 'I do think it's important for myself and the company to recognise everyone's anger and confusion surrounding this last week, though this doesn't justify how others have perpetuated this or responded so maliciously.' She has not provided evidence of her childcare or floor plan claims at time of publication. Her remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The book had been written in conjunction with her hugely successful app of the same name, which is set to feature on the Apple Watch. The app gained popularity after Ms Gibson claimed she warded off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis through diet and a holistic approach to life. But after close friends last week cast doubt on these claims, Ms Gibson herself admitted in an interview with The Australian that an announcement last year that her cancer had spread to her liver, spleen, blood and uterus was a 'misdiagnosis'. Ms Gibson explained why she today wiped all her remaining photos from her Instagram account - some had already been removed - and had the Whole Pantry Facebook page deleted. 'At the end of the day, I am a human being on the receiving end of comments, questions and emails and even if the public are used to a digital interaction with me, it does not warrant some of the recent responses,' she said. The Whole Pantry was voted Apple's Best Food and Drink App of 2013 and will feature on the Apple Watch. The technology giant did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's requests for comment on Tuesday . She said the social media accounts were 'further encouraging interactions between those who were angry and encouraging personal data, information or other security-sensitive content to be shared or made light of. 'My son's childcare details were posted online in the midst of this, so I'm sure you can understand how unnecessary, concerning and threatening that is.' Ms Gibson said the statement she was writing was taking 'longer than anticipated' because of media requests and 'constantly arising issues', 'with the paramount focus being protecting the safety of myself and my son'. Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they visited an Elwood home last Tuesday evening 'as part of a welfare check. They left shortly after with nil concerns.' Some of Ms Gibson's former followers have taken to social media to try to 'expose' her - posting images of her drinking alcohol before she became a clean-living star and old claims about her battle with cancer. The  Belle Gibson Uncovered Facebook page has been sharing images of her sipping beer . Clean-living Belle Gibson, seen here with a pint in her hand, told the friends who have spoken out about her to 'make yourself invisible to me, and my life' The administrators of the Belle Gibson Uncovered Facebook page, which has been sharing images of her sipping beer and champagne and eating vegan doughnuts, said they are doing so because Ms Gibson 'fiercely censors The Whole Pantry Facebook page'. 'The reason is simple, to educate and inform the many people who have already commented on this page feeling betrayed, deceived and let down by someone who they trusted,' they wrote. 'Many people followed this person, they believed in her and some even abandoned conventional medicine in favour of embracing her lifestyle in desperate hope they could cure their illnesses. On Monday afternoon, Australian publisher Penguin said it had been left with 'no other option' but to stop supplying her book in Australia. 'Despite our best endeavours, Penguin Books has not received sufficient explanation from Ms Gibson, author of The Whole Pantry recipe book, in response to recent allegations,' the comapny said in a statement. 'We remain hopeful that we will receive the formal assurances we have requested in the coming days. Ms Gibson has deleted thousands of photos and social media posts which directly reference her multiple cancer diagnoses, but an example of them - seen by Daily Mail Australia - can be found below: . Back in July 2013, Ms Gibson posted on The Whole Pantry Facebook page: 'It's unfortunate that there is someone on my Instagram trying to discredit the natural healing path I am on.' She went on to say: 'As always, with everything, this is my journey and I encourage you to do what is best for your body and situation with love and an open mind. 'I have been healing a severe and malignant brain cancer for the past few years with natural medicine, gerson therapy and foods. 'It's working for me and I am grateful to be here sharing this journey with over 70,000 people worldwide. Thank you for being here - xx Belle.' In a reference to her liver cancer, she posted on Instagram under her account @healing_belle, a photo of a pink smoothie enriched with 'extra support'. 'This one is for my rash (thanks, liver cancer), inflammation (thanks flying) and for general immunity.' In another Instagram post she wrote: 'Going from 6 weeks to live, to celebrating my fourth year with brain cancer, I know now that respecting your own journey and intuitively healing, listening and living as YOUR body, mind and path intended is staple.' In July 2014, she broke the news of further illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal Instagram page. It read in part: 'With frustration and ache in my heart // my beautiful, gamechanging community, it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that I've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer. 'One is secondary and the other is primary. I have cancer in my blood, spleen, brain, uterus, and liver. I am hurting,' Ms Gibson wrote. About 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up, revealing she was undergoing 'German integrative oncology protocol'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) is also a popular app, which costs $3.79 to download. The app is slated to appear on the new Apple Watch .","Reports police dropped investigation into Belle Gibson's Whole Pantry .

"What started out as a harmless April Fools Day prank  turned out to be anything but funny when the joke resulted in a fire at an apartment near a college campus Wednesday. Units from multiple fire departments were called to a fire  just west of Grand Valley State University in Michigan after an April Fools prank involving fireworks sent one apartment unit up in smoke, the Holland Sentinel reports. Four girls live in Apartment 4 of Building B of the Campus West Apartments. Fire officials said one of the girls threw a lit firework at a roommate; the firework landed in a laundry hamper, setting the contents on fire. April Fools: An April Fools Day prank went horribly wrong when a joke involving fireworks led to an apartment fire (photographed) near Grand Valley State University in Michigan . Fireworks: Fire officials said one of the apartment building's residents threw a lit firework at a roommate; the firework landed in a laundry hamper, setting the contents on fire . No one was hurt, Fox reports, and the girl is not expected to face charges. One of the girls' neighbors, Addison Walstra, 19, told the Sentinel that her neighbors came to her apartment and she had given them a fire extinguisher -- the units are not required to have fire extinguishers because they are townhomes. 'The fire was too big for [the extinguisher] so they told us to get out and then we knocked on everybody else's doors to get them out as well,' Walstra said, describing the moment her neighbors returned to her apartment to tell her they could not put out the fire. Firefighters arrived at around 9.30am and the building was evacuated. The fire was contained to the upper-level of the building, the Sentinel reports. Contained: Firefighters arrived at around 9.30am and the building was evacuated; he fire was contained to the upper-level of the building . Damage: Allison Mitchell (photographed), who lives in a neighboring apartment, said her room had smoke damage . Capt. Dave Pelton with the Allendale Fire Rescue said firewalls prevented the fire from spreading to neighboring apartments and Fox reports that the fire was extinguished at around 9.45am. '[The residents] were lucky, we had a great response and everyone was able to make it out safely,' Pelton told MLive. Sarah Long, who lives in a neighboring apartment told MLive that she heard the smoke alarm and someone crying before residents told her and her roommates to leave the building. 'It's just an April Fools gone wrong..' Long said. 'It was supposed to be funny, and, now it's not.' The apartment residents are allowed to return to two of the six apartments in the building, WOOD-TV reports. The remaining students, except for Apartment 4's residents, are expected to be able to return later Wednesday.

"Concerns are growing over Russian ships that have docked in a once-secret  naval base in the Arctic. Military leaders in Norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour's presence on its 'strategically important' coastline following a spike in tensions between Russia and NATO nations. Some experts have criticised the shutting down of Olavsvern Naval Base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of Tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009. But fears have once again peaked after three Russian ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility. Show of strength: Norway's military leaders are growing concerned after three Russian warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base (file photo) deep inside the country's mountainous terrain . Aggression: In February, RAF planes intercepted two Russian bombers (file photo) which had flown into Irish territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course . Force: And late last year, the Russian navy anti-submarine ship Severomorsk (file photo) and three other Russian ships had to be escorted out of the British channel . It was originally shut because the country's leaders thought the threat from Moscow was reduced, despite its massive Northern Fleet which is base in the nearby Kola Peninsula. Norway's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was 'pure madness' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region. This is far from the first time Russia has flexed its military muscles in other countries' territory. In February, a passenger plane had to be diverted to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled airspace without warning. The disruption on February 18 was thought to have occurred during the same incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort the Russian vessels. That move was perceived as a show of strength by Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict after Prime Minister David Cameron accused him of challenging the 'territorial integrity' of Kiev. It followed a separate incident when the Royal Navy had to intercept a Russian warship which strayed to close to the UK while passing through the English channel the same month. The Neustrashimy-class warship – equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes – was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. Cat and mouse: Heavily-armed HMS Argyll follows the Russian warship (back left) as it passes through the English Channel in February . Intercepted: Footage released on Russian TV showed the moment two RAF jets escorted the Russian bomber in February . Concerned: They are worried by this perceived show of strength from Moscow (Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured) and its presence on its 'strategically important' coastline . And late last year, the HMS Tyne had to escort another Russian destroyer and three other boats from the Channel as they passed through the Strait of Dover after carrying out military exercises in the North Sea. Since January 2014, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. Elinar Skorgen added: 'We are the only country along with Russia to have a permanent presence in the Barents Sea, where we share a common border. Obviously our navy should be stationed there, including our submarines. If the ships aren't there where they are needed, they might as well be scrapped altogether.' The Armed forces put the base - which cost over £390million to construct - up for sale on Norway's version of eBay. It was eventually bought for just £3.5million by a Norwegian businessmen and was rented out to Russian research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country's state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Its landlord Gunnar Wilhelmsen said: 'There are no longer any secrets surrounding this base... Not since the military and NATO agreed to put it on sale over the Internet, along with photographs of every nook and cranny.' Many military experts are now worried by the the potential for Russian military activity aboard the research vessels. A former second in command for the Norwegian military said: 'Russia is a country where the state has a say over all commercial or semi-state business. It's clear, very few people know what happens on these vessels.' Jan Reksten believes the sale of Olavsvern was 'a double loss' as 'Norway's armed forces lost an important base and now there are Russian vessels docked there'.","Three Russian ships that docked in Olavsvern Naval Base for the entire winter .

"German aviation regulators say they were never made aware of Andreas Lubitz's mental health issues . Killer pilot Andreas Lubitz searched the internet for information on suicide and depression using the name 'Skydevil', it has emerged. The chilling username was discovered after analysis of a tablet computer found at his home, according to German newspaper Bild. Investigators also found search terms for disorders such as 'bipolar' and 'manic depressive'. In a separate development, it has emerged that European regulators warned Germany's aviation authority of inadequacies with its health check-ups in a regular review of air safety enforcement, the European Commission said. Its statement did not say when the review was carried out. But the Wall Street Journal said the Commission told Berlin in November 'to remedy the long-standing problems' - months before the Germanwings crash that killed all 150 people aboard. Meanwhile, the aviation authority, the Luftfahrtbundesamt (LBA), also said it did not know about Lubitz's medical background prior to the crash. Parent company Lufthansa said Lubitz told officials at an airline training school he had gone through a period of severe depression in the past, raising questions over whether medical checks of crew members by the safety regulators and airlines are rigorous enough. EU officials found that the LBA had a lack of staff, which could have limited its ability to carry out checks on planes and crew, such as medical checks, the Journal reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. It said it was unclear whether the deficiencies identified at LBA were factors in the crash, however. Vetting of airline crew is in the spotlight after the budget airline flight was crashed deliberately into by Lubitz. 'On the basis of EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) recommendations, the Commission has addressed the issues to Germany to require compliance. 'Germany's replies are currently being assessed,' the Commission spokesman said in the statement, emailed out on Saturday. 'All EU member states have findings and this is a normal and regular occurrence. It is part of a continuous system of oversight: findings are followed by corrective action, similar to an audit process,' the Commission spokesman said, without specifying EASA's findings in Germany. The spokesman was not immediately available for further comment. The Germanwings Airbus A320 (above) crashed into a mountain at 430mph, killing all 150 people on board . A spokeswoman for the LBA said EASA's audits of national aviation authorities such as the LBA took place several times a year. She said the LBA had answered a single-figure number of criticisms levelled at it during the audits and those responses were now being assessed by EASA. Meanwhile, it has been claimed that Lufthansa did not inform  aviation regulators that Lubitz had struggled with depression. Sources at the Federal Aviation Office (LBA) said they were never made aware of the 27-year-old's mental health issues and only learned about them following the disaster. Lubitz perished in the crash alongside all those on board after locking his co-pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately accelerating into the French mountainside, prosecutors claim. His lengthy battle with depression was revealed afterwards when investigators carried out extensive checks on his record. However the LBA says it was never told of the observations made by doctors who had examined the 27-year-old in his 'earlier phase of serious depression'. The first black box voice recorder from the Germanwings flight that was recovered last week and revealed Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane. The second has now also been retrieved from the wreckage . German newspaper Welt am Sonntag quoted sources as having discovered his mental health issues three days after the crash by accessing his medical file at Lufthansa's Aeromedical Center. Records revealed he had been tested by doctors six times, the report claimed. Lufthansa declined to comment on its claims citing the ongoing investigation into the crash. Earlier the airline's chief Carsten Spohr said it was entirely unaware Lubitz had suffered any health issues that would have compromised his ability to fly. Last week it however conceded he had told his flight school of a previous bout of 'severe depression' in 2009. He was later given a medical certificate confirming he was fit to fly. Prosecutors claimed the pilot was diagnosed as suicidal several years before receiving his licence and that doctors had only recently concluded there was no evidence he wanted to harm himself. French emergency rescue services work at the crash site of the Germanwings plane where 150 people died . Lubitz had been signed off sick repeatedly in the days before the crash, with doctors notes found crumpled in his apartment following the disaster. Forensics teams are still working at the crash site, painstakingly recovering debris which they hope will aid investigations. It is not yet known whether the pilot was taking medication at the time of the crash, though data recovered from the scene revealed he had deliberately accelerated into the side of a mountain. He had previously been prescribed an anti-anxiety drug so strong that users are warned not to drive while under its influence. In the days before hand he had researched suicide methods and cockpit security online, all the while telling doctors he was not flying but on sick leave.

"Who doesn’t love a hot cross bun at Easter? In Britain we so enjoy the spiced, sweet rolls with a cross on top, that they used to be eaten all year round. That was until Queen Elizabeth I tried to ban them, possibly finding the cross a little too Catholic. The move was greeted with uproar, so she compromised, saying they could only be sold on Good Friday, at Christmas and for burials — and they have been prime Easter fare ever since. Nowadays supermarkets bring out ever more permutations to tempt customers, from miniature sizes to new flavours like toffee fudge chunk and apple and cinnamon. Here is best of the batch this Easter.

"Young women can still get cheaper car insurance than young men despite sex equality laws, an economist warned yesterday. Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels: The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including ‘female-focused’ insurers Sheilas’ Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers – ‘where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest’, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don’t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do. The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including ‘female-focused’ insurers Sheilas’ Wheels. Dr McDonald said: ‘The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. ‘However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.’ His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was ‘not the case for the older ages’, Dr McDonald said. ‘It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.’","Young women can get cheaper car insurance than men, economist warns .

"A nurse, 52, who was driving by herself on a dark country road faces felony charges after she didn't immediately pull over for a cop because she didn't think it was a safe place to stop. DelRea Good of Portage, Indiana says that on March 23 she was charged with resisting arrest because she hit the brakes for Porter County Sheriff's Department Patrolman William Marshall about a half a mile down the road from where he asked her to halt her vehicle. Good was speeding and was driving at 54 mph in a 35 mph zone at 11:21 p.m. Charged with resisting arrest: Portage resident DelRea Good said she did not immediately pull over for the flashing lights behind her because, as a 52-year-old woman traveling alone at night on a dark county road . 'I felt I didn't do anything wrong,' Good told NWI.com. 'I got to a safe place and I told him that.' Good says that when she was ordered to pull over, she put on her emergency flashers, and waved her hand out the window to let the cop know that she was aware of his presence and that she planned to stop. She finally turned off the gas at a well-lit Kohls parking lot. Good said Marshall was enraged with her when she pulled over and said, 'What in the hell are you doing? I could arrest you for this.' Good has no previous criminal record and says that if she is convicted of a felony then she will lose her job. Marshall claims that Good was 'highly agitated and uncooperative' and said she told him, 'I don't care who you are I don't have to stop on a county road, I'm a single female.' No criminal history: DelRea Good is a nurse with no criminal history and says that is she is convicted that her job will be in jeopardy . Marshall arrested Good after she 'failed to listen to how speeding endangers other drivers.' 'I follow rules every day or people could get hurt,' Good said in reference to her nursing career. 'This could be your mom, your sister, your daughter next time.' Good even accuses the cop of bullying her on the way to the station and says he accused her of having a controlled substance, which turned out be be Advil. Good's attorney Bob Harper has argued that his client's concerns are absolutely warranted. Harper brought up a 1991 case in which a woman pulled over for a man pretending to be a cop who later attacked her. New motto: Good has decided to promote female safety by painting this on the back of her car and by assigning herself the hashtag #femalesafetymatters . Rough arrest: Good posted this photo on her Facebook showing the alleged bruises she got during the arrest . Harper then said that two years prior, Portage police issued a warning say that a man impersonating a police officer by flashing red and blue lights tried to get a woman to pull over. Portage Police Sgt. Keith Hughes said that the woman who refused to stop a few years ago exercised good judgement. He recommended that drivers call 911 if they expect someone is impersonating a cop and said if they are unable to get through to anyone they should wave to the officer them stop at a well lit area. Porter County Sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Larry LaFlower said after the current incident that 'The sheriff's office supports our officer's decision in this matter.' Good has been posting to her Facebook following the incident and decided to assign herself the hashtag  #femalesafetymatters. She wrote that her lawyer is representing her free of charge because 'he feels this is a travesty of justice.' Good also posted a picture of bruises on her arm from the arrest and claimed that the officer was too rough with her.

"Fully charged: The new scheme will let EE customers pick up free portable chargers . The UK’s biggest mobile network has announced details of a scheme to help customers keep their mobile phones charged. EE shops are planning to give away free portable chargers so that people can revive their phones wherever they are. Once the EE ‘power bar’ runs down, customers will be able to swap it for a new one at any EE shop, or spend four hours charging it up themselves at home. The chargers will be free to EE customers, and other smartphone owners can also sign up to the service if they pay a £20 fee. EE said that battery-draining video streaming and social media site browsing now accounted for more than 50 per cent of all data use on their network. Its research found that almost 60 per cent of smartphone users found their battery would not last a full day. And over half said they wish there were more ways to charge their phone in public places – rising to over 70 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds. The firm’s marketing officer, Pippa Dunn, said: ‘Almost everyone’s experienced the frustration associated with running out of battery, it seems to happen when you need your phone the most. ‘We’re giving customers a power bar that can be swapped for a fully charged one at any of our stores, at any time, for free.’ Powered up: EE customers will able to pick up free portable chargers from shops to stop their phones from running out of battery .","EE shops will stock free chargers so people can revive phones while out .

"The light in these extraordinary images has travelled so far that it has taken 4,200 years to get here. But, despite the distance, scientists say the photographs reveal, like no others before them, the immense forces unleashed when a star is born. The two images were taken 18 years apart, the first with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico in 1996 and the second by an international team of astronomers led by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) last year. Scroll down for video . Astronomers have used a telescope in New Mexico to watch a star take shape over eight years. This simulation shows how the outflow of material from the star has dramatically expanded as it takes shape. A simulated image from 1996 is on the left, and another from 2014 is on the right . The star – known as W75N(B)-VLA2 – is 300 times brighter and eight times bigger than our sun, although it is masked by a black cloud of space dust. But what has most excited astronomers is the change in shape of the violet area of super-hot electrified winds that are being ejected by the young star. The dramatic changes, in a cosmic blink of an eye relative to the age of the universe, is giving an unprecedented look at how young ‘protostars’ develop into fully-fledged stars. The pictures, created by data from 27 radio telescope antennae in the New Mexico desert in the U.S., show the electrified wind expanding away from the star until it is slowed by the black and yellow cloud of dust surrounding it. These images of the star were taken by the��Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico. On the left is the star as seen in 1996, with its dust wrapped tightly around it, while by 2014 in the image on the right, this outflow has been pushed out into an elongated shape . This artist's illustration shows the development of W75N(B)-VLA-2. On the left, a hot wind from the young star expands nearly spherically, as seen in 1996. On the right right, as seen in 2014, the hot wind has been shaped by encountering a dusty, doughnut-shaped torus around the star and appears elongated . In the 1996 picture there is a relatively small region of space wind surrounding the star. But 18 years later that has expanded into a rugby-ball shape – because the dust has formed a doughnut shape around the star and offers less resistance to the space winds at its poles. Astronomer Carlos Carrasco-Gonzalez of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said: ‘The comparison is remarkable. ‘We're seeing this dramatic change in real time, so this object is providing us an exciting opportunity to watch over the next few years as a very young star goes through the early stages of its formation.’ The team will now continue to observe the star and see how it develops over the next few years. ‘Our understanding of how massive young stars develop is much less complete than our understanding of how sun-like stars develop,’ Dr Carrasco-Gonzalez said. ‘It's going to be really great to be able to watch one as it changes. We expect to learn a lot from this object.' Take a look at the amount of fuel for star formation in the universe, compared to the number of stars, and you'll notice something strange - there should be 10 times as many stars as there are. It's a problem that has perplexed scientists, but a study in early March claimed to have an answer, saying that the heat in star-forming clouds may be hindering stellar formation. They say that the temperatures are likely too hot to allow reasonable amounts of star formation, which leads to the lower number of stars we observe in the cosmos today. 'The amount of fuel for star formation outpaces the amount of stars 10 times, so these clusters should be really star-rich,' said Dr Michael McDonald, a Hubble Fellow in Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. 'You really need some mechanism to prevent gas from cooling, otherwise the universe would have 10 times as many stars.' The theory proposed by the researchers from MIT and Michigan State University suggests a number of reasons for why this is so. Researchers say that for some galaxy clusters the intracluster gas may simply be too hot - on the order of hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius. Even if one region experiences some cooling, the intensity of the surrounding heat would keep that region from cooling further - an effect known as conduction.","Astronomers have used a telescope in New Mexico to watch a star form .

"Binge drinking as a teenager can cause long-lasting damage to the brain well into adulthood, a new study has warned. This is because drinking excessive amounts of alcohol when young can damage the brain and cause permanent changes to DNA. This, in turn, can put teenagers at risk of anxiety disorders and alcoholism, researchers found. Alcohol changes genes in brain cells, which stop the cells developing connections between them, altering behaviour, they said. However, they discovered a cancer drug may reverse the damage. Binge drinking as a teenager can cause long-lasting damage into adulthood, putting young people at risk of anxiety disorders and alcoholism . Professor Subhash Pandey, of the University of Illinois College of Medicine, explained that binge drinking during the teenage years disrupts the brain's normal development. He said: 'Our study provides a mechanism for how binge-drinking during adolescence may lead to lasting changes that result in increased anxiety and alcoholism in adults.' Intermittent alcohol exposure 'degrades the ability of the brain to form the connections it needs to during adolescence, he explained. 'The brain doesn't develop as it should, and there are lasting behavioural changes associated with this,' he added. As part of the study, Professor Pandey and his team carried out lab experiments on 28-day-old rats to investigate how alcohol would affect their brain development. They were given alcohol for two days on, then two days off, which was repeated over 13 days. Rats exposed to alcohol showed changes in behaviour that lasted into adulthood, long after the exposure to alcohol ended. Alcohol causes changes in the DNA in brain cells. However, researchers discovered a cancer drug may be able to reverse the changes . They showed increased anxiety-like behaviours and drank more alcohol in adulthood. When brain tissue from the area of the brain called the amygdala was examined, rats given alcohol showed changes to their DNA, known as epigenetic changes. Professor Pandey explained that epigenetic changes are chemical modifications of DNA, or of the proteins around which DNA is wound, like thread on a spool. Modification of these proteins, which are called histones, can change how loosely or tightly the DNA is wound. Many of us enjoy a chilled glass of wine or a cold beer after a hard day at work. But while the majority of people believe their drinking habits are under control, one in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a problem with alcohol, a survey found. A new poll laying bare the public's attitudes to drinking found nearly half of young workers think it is acceptable to regularly get drunk on a night out, compared to a fifth of the general population. It also revealed the risky effects of drinking, as young people admitted to forgetting how they got home, driving themselves home drunk or getting in a car with someone they knew was intoxicated. Genes that lie within DNA that is tightly wrapped around the histones are less active than if the DNA is loosely wrapped. The looser the DNA is coiled, the more accessible the genes are to the cellular machinery that 'expresses' them. The rats exposed to alcohol had more tightly coiled DNA. They also had increased levels of a protein called HDAC2, which modifies histones, causing DNA to be wound tighter around them. These epigenetic changes were linked to lowered expression of a gene that nerve cells need in order to form new connections between cells, known as synaptic connections. Professor Pandey argued the lowered activity of this gene may be due to the tighter winding of its DNA. The lower activity of the gene persisted in adulthood, even if alcohol exposure was stopped weeks before. The researchers also observed diminished connectivity between nerves in the amygdalae of these affected adult rats. But a cancer drug known to block the activity of HDAC2 could be used to treat them, he said. In his experiments, the drug restored expression of the gene needed for synapse formation and the rats' DNA was observed to be less tightly coiled. The effect of this was that the rats exhibited less anxiety and reduced alcohol intake. Professor Pandey added: 'We aren't sure if the drug needs to be given long term during adulthood in order to completely reverse the harmful effects of adolescent alcohol exposure.' The findings were reported online in the journal Neurobiology of Disease.","Binge drinking when young can cause changes in DNA in brain cells .

"Bill and Hillary Clinton spent $104,000 in taxpayer money on hotel rooms for Secret Service agents when they vacationed in the Dominican Republic over the New Year's holiday. A Dominican news report says the power couple spent part of their trip staying with sugar barons Alfy and Pepe Fanjul at Casa de Campo, a private Dominican resort they own. The news outlet Listin Diario reported on January 2 that Fanjul and the Clintons discussed Hillary's presidential ambitions during the visit. Casa de Campo, a luxurious retreat for the world's super wealthy elites, is also at the center of criminal allegations now dogging a Democratic U.S. senator. LAP OF LUXURY: The Casa de Campo resort services the upper crust of America's '1 per cent' super-rich, and both Sen. Bob Menendez and Bill and Hillary Clinton have holidayed there . SAME OLD BILL: This Instagram pic, deleted from a user's account on Thursday, shows former President Clinton cavorting among yougn socialites at Casa de Campo . INDICTED: NEw Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez (left) and his wealthy donor Dr. Salomon Melgen (right) are both accused of multiple federal crimes including bribery and honest services fraud . Federal prosecutors charged New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez with corruption on Wednesday in a 14-count indictment. He is accused of accepting money and trips from wealthy donor Dr Salomon Melgen in exchange for the influence of his office. Melgen flew Menendez and his guests on a private jet to stay at his Casa de Campo villa multiple times, free of charge, prosecutors say. The doctor is also now under federal indictment, accused of bribing Menendez with gifts and approximately $700,000 in political contributions. In exchange, the government says, Menendez helped Melgen's three girlfriends get travel visas to enter the U.S., interceded with Medicare authorities when he was accused of billing fraud, and helped lay the groundwork for a Melgen-controlled company to win a lucrative port security contract in the Dominican Republic. PRIVATE VILLAS: Melgen owns a house at Casa de Campo where he entertained Menendez on several occasions at his own expense . SUGAR BARONS: Pepe Fanjul (left) and Alfy Fanjul (right) own a congromerate that includes Domino Sugar and Florida Crystals, and they also own Casa de Campo. The brothers entertained the Clintons there in early January . Melgen's 70-year-old former secretary told The Miami Herald in 2013 that Melgen had also hosted Bill Clinton at his resort home in the past. And Melgen has contributed $8,600 to Hillary Clinton's campaigns for the U.S. Senate and the White House, according to public records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. The Weekly Standard reported on Thursday that the Clintons spent the first part of their Dominican holiday three months ago at Punta Cana, a different resort area. They 'chose to spend their end-of-year vacation in the Dominican Republic's tourist hub Punta Cana,' according to Listin Diario, but on January 2 'shifted to the tourist center Casa de Campo' where they stayed with the Fanjuls. A federal government spending report describes $104,093 in payments for Secret Service lodging, but doesn't specify whether it covered rooms in one or two resort areas. FACING THE MUSIC: Dr. Melgen was in Newark, New Jersey on Thursday to face a judge for his criminal arraignment in the Senator Bob Menendez corruption case . ONE-PERCENTERS: Melgen and Fanjul have houses like this one at Casa de Campo; Bill Clinton has stayed with both of them . Bill and Hillary Clinton were photographed at both resorts. The former president attended 'private dinners with friends at their Casa de Campo villas' and played golf, according to Casa de Campo Living. Alfy Fanjul also played a small part in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that dogged Clinton's 1990s presidency and resulted in his impeachment. Lewinsky told Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr that on Presidents' Day in 1996, as Clinton was trying to break off their covert romance, Fanjul called the Oval Office. Confirmation of that phone call in White House records was one important detail that lent credibility to Lewinsky's claims that she had engaged in a series of intimate moments in the White House with the leader of the free world.

"Starbucks is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little-known British company to avoid paying taxes across Europe. The U.S. coffee giant is being probed by the European Commission over some of the methods it used to lower its tax bills. It could face millions of pounds in back taxes if they are found to be illegal. For the first time yesterday, details emerged about the UK company at the heart of the probe, which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between Starbucks and the Dutch government. Probe: Starbucks ran its European division - including the UK - through the Netherlands, but it paid just £1.9million in tax to the Dutch government, from a reported £300million profit . Starbucks ran its European business, including its booming UK division, through the Netherlands where it paid almost no tax on its profits. But it has now emerged that the coffee chain used a defunct British entity to hide potentially millions of pounds from the Dutch taxman. By registering its Intellectual Property – such as its brand and logo – in a UK company called Alki LP, it was able to pay hefty sums from its Netherlands division into Britain. Its Dutch division paid just £1.9million of tax, despite reporting profits of £300million – a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered previously unknown details about the UK entity, including a claim that it had not a single registered employee. Starbucks has already been called ‘immoral’ by MPs for its labyrinthine structure that effectively funnelled money out of the UK. Schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in Switzerland and selling them at a 20per cent mark-up to the Netherlands, where they are then roasted before being sold on again to Britain. This means that much of the money it makes from UK sales flows into jurisdictions that have lower or less stringent tax regimes. Revealed: It is now claimed the company, which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices, may have used a British company to put hefty sums from its Netherlands branch into the UK . Between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in Britain, despite racking up combined sales of more than £3billion here. But after its tactics were exposed, the company offered to pay a voluntary £20million in tax to avoid a public boycott. Now details of a little-known tax division have emerged. A UK-registered holding business called Alki LP was set up to house the branding of the business. In a bizarre move, Alki appeared to have no employees – and was registered at the offices of Starbuck’s tax lawyers Baker & McKenzie. Compliance: A Starbucks spokesman said the company complies 'with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines' But because of the very limited details available, it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received – or whether it paid any tax in the UK. Accounts for Starbucks’ Dutch businesses show that they paid several million pounds a year into the division. But without access to full corporate documents it is impossible to tell whether this remained in the UK division or was funnelled straight into another tax haven. The business, which was closed down last year, has never filed proper accounts at Companies House. When it was dissolved, Alki was folded into a new company, Starbucks EMEA Holdings – though this business has also yet to file any accounts. This is an aspect that EU investigators believe is key to their probe. Earlier this year the British boss of Starbucks provoked outrage after suggesting the company would not pay ‘normal’ levels of tax for years. UK managing director Mark Fox said the company needed to get ‘its mojo back’ before it would begin to turn a profit. But he was confounded only weeks later when Starbucks reported its first ever UK profit of £1.1million – despite sales being a bumper £300million. On this it paid taxes of just £232,363, as well as the sum of £11.2million as part of its voluntary £20million tax payment. A Starbucks spokesman said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we continue to cooperate with the European Commission’s state aid investigation in the Netherlands.’","Starbucks ran its European business - including UK - through Holland .

"A book of songs used by the U.S. Air Force contains horrifying lyrics about rape, pedophilia and homosexuality. The unofficial 2012 paperback book was revealed by a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by four sexual-assault victims who want to stop the practice of sexual assault allegations within the military being handled by commanding officers. Former Tech. Sgt. Jennifer Smith, who said she was sexually assaulted by a fellow airman in Iraq, brought forward the songbook and she had filed an administrative complaint over the book in 2012. A book of songs used by the U.S. Air Force contains horrifying lyrics about rape, pedophilia and homosexuality . The complaint alleges some of the most disturbing content is found in the songbooks of the 55th, 77th, and 79th fighter squadrons of the Air Force . But Smith said the general assigned to address her complaint also sang the sexist songs with the airmen regularly and she did not hear back from him. Set to the tune of  Bye Bye Blackbird: . Back your a** against the wall, here I come b**** and all, bye, bye cherry. I know I ain't got a lot, but what I got will fill your t***, bye bye cherry. I took her to my cottage in the wild woods, . And there I took advantage of her childhood. Oh my God, it was nice, cherry bye bye. The complaint alleges some of the most disturbing content is found in the songbooks of the 55th, 77th, and 79th fighter squadrons of the Air Force, reports ABC News. The 130-page songbook contains 70 songs with titles including Pubic Hair, The Kotex Song and Bestiality. One of them, The S&M Man, is set to the tune of The Candy Man and describes sexually mutilating women and dragging AIDS victims behind a bus. Another one of them comes with the warning: 'THIS SONG IS ONLY FOR A VERY FEW SICK PEOPLE!!!!' A section of the book reads: 'This book is our thoughts, our songs and our games. 'Lesser individuals who have never strapped their a**** to a piece of flaming metal will considers these of little or no redeeming value. Because of this, the songs contained in this book are held as sacred by those of us that have.' The 130-page songbook contains 70 songs with titles including Pubic Hair, The Kotex Song and Bestiality . One of the songs comes with the warning: 'THIS SONG IS ONLY FOR A VERY FEW SICK PEOPLE!!!!' It is stamped with the playing-cards logo of the 77th Fighter Squadron, which is based at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina. The Daily Beast reports the papers also show jailbait posters. In a press conference Tuesday on the lawsuit, Smith said co-workers mocked and harassed her after she complained. 'I filed a formal complaint,' Smith said, reports USA Today. 'Six officers were punished in my case. All the officers received nothing more than a piece of paper reprimanding them for their behavior. All will still lead. All will oversee airmen and sexual assault claims.' In her original complaint, Smith also said she was sexually assaulted by her master sergeant in Germany. Smith escaped that assault when several other airmen intervened. Retired Air Force Col. Don Christensen, president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group for military sex assault victims told Stars and Stripes: 'This is something that is used by Air Force officers today. 'These are the commanders who sing songs about raping women as fun.' The book is bound to look like an official Air Force publication - the bottom of its pages are labeled 'For Unofficial Use Only. Former Tech. Sgt. Jennifer Smith,  (pictured) who said she was sexually assaulted by a fellow airman in Iraq, brought forward the songbook and she had filed an administrative complaint over the book in 2012 . Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Brooke Brzozowske didn't comment on the lawsuit itself to ABC News, but said the book was from 2012, before the Air Force initiating a health and welfare inspections program where such materials would have been confiscated. She said the Air Force had contacted the Inspectors General to make sure the books were not still in use. She told Stars and Stripes that as a result of a 2012 six-month investigation there were 16 allegations against eight officers at Shaw Air Force Base who failed to prevent or investigate sexual harassment, condoned or refused to remove sexually offensive material and tolerated on-duty alcohol consumption. In 2014 there were nearly 6,000 victims of sexual assault in the U.S. military this year, up eight per cent from last year, according to a study. The Pentagon report, based on an anonymous survey and shared with the Associated Press, also found that retaliation remains an ongoing problem in stern military culture that emphasizes rank, loyalty and strength. Indeed, 60per cent of the women who reported some type of unwanted sexual contact complained about social backlash from co-workers or other service members. Under fire from Congress, Pentagon leaders and the White House, the military services have launched programs to encourage reporting, provide better care for victims, step up prosecutions and urge troops to intervene when they see others in threatening situations. Congress continues to press for an overhaul of the military justice system to change the way that sexual assault cases are handled.","The 130-page songbook contains 70 songs with titles including Pubic Hair and The Kotex Song as well as Bestiality .

"This is the terrifying moment an SUV hurtled head-on into a school bus full of students on Monday morning. Footage taken from the bus's windscreen dash-cam captures the screams of 36 7th graders on board as a Dodge Durango swerves erratically in their direction at 60 mph. It crashes into an SUV on the right side of the road then ricochets across the center median. The clip, obtained by News On 6, ends abruptly as the two vehicles collide.

Five of the 36 pupils were hospitalized with minor injuries and 11 were treated at the scene at 8.20am in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Monday. The 44-year-old driver of the SUV, who allegedly has a history of seizures, was driving approximately 20 mph over the speed limit. He was trapped inside his car for 20 minutes after the crash until firefighters were able to cut him from the wreckage, News On 6 reported. The driver of the SUV, a 44-year-old man with a history of seizures, had to be cut out of the wreckage . Police commended the bus driver for doing what she could.

Tulsa Public Schools spokesman Chris Payne said parents of the pupils, from McClain Junior High School and McClain's 7th Grade Academy, were notified immediately. Police have refused local media requests to release a second video which shows the pupils reacting to the crash, on the grounds that it is traumatic and the passengers are all minors.","Dash-cam footage captures 36 screaming 7th graders on board .

"A sex offender who tried to evade justice by fleeing to Australia has been caught after police tracked him down through his boastful Facebook posts. Steven Allison, 37, formerly of Idle near Bradford, West Yorkshire, had been uploading pictures of himself looking tanned and happy as he enjoyed his freedom in his new life Down Under. But he was unaware the net was closing in as British police teamed up with colleagues in Australia and Interpol to locate Allison, who was living in the country's capital, Canberra. Steven Allison (left) was uploading pictures of himself in Australia to Facebook and writing posts about his former life in Yorkshire (right) despite being on the running from the law . Allison had already been on the run for a year when he was given a 30 month jail sentence for sexually assaulting two women after failing to turn up at Bradford Crown Court in February last year. He was supposed to be lying low in Sydney, where he found work as a labourer and handyman, but couldn't resist showing off his new life to his 739 Facebook friends. The sex attacker, who goes by 'Stig' on Facebook, posted pictures of his former life in Yorkshire and boasted about his carefree bachelor lifestyle, saying he wanted to meet women. Allison even joked about days being drunk in his hometown, including posts such as 'fooocking leathered that day,, for a change haha [sic]'. He also posted pictures of himself in his t-shirt on a building site with his arms raised in a mocking salute to Facebook friends, many of whom had no idea about his criminal past. The assaults happened in June 2013 when Allison had been out drinking with a friend in Yeadon, Leeds, where he approached two women who rejected his advances. Allison would not take no for an answer and indecently assaulted one of his victims as she left the pub in disgust. He had been laying low in Sydney (pictured) before moving to Canberra, where authorities closed in on him . When her friend threw a drink over him the rugby fan snapped and punched both girls to the ground. A West Yorkshire force spokesman said Allison had been charged with two sexual assaults but failed to appear in court. He added: 'Enquiries made by Bradford District's Public Protection Unit and Interpol traced him to Australia, where he had been working on construction sites. 'He was located in January this year and subsequently held in a detention centre, while arrangements were made for him to be returned to the UK.' While being held, Allison made one last bid for freedom by feigning an arm injury so he could attempt to escape while being taken for medical treatment. But his plan failed and he was brought back to the UK yesterday in handcuffs and flanked by three security guards from Australia. Det Insp Ben McDonald, of the Bradford District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'It was clear that Allison felt he could cheat justice by fleeing the country and escaping to Australia. 'He fled to the other side of the world to escape justice. However, the police will always pursue those wanted for serious crimes such as this, regardless of where they are in the world.' He is expected to appear in court before being transferred to prison.","Steven Allison, 37, uploaded pictures of himself looking happy and tanned .

"Though many consider it to be yesterday's problem, some 5,000 people still die from asbestos-related diseases each year, making it a bigger killer than road traffic accidents. With around 20 tradespeople dying each week as a result from past exposure to asbestos too, it's far from the rapidly dwindling issue many presume it to be. That's why award-winning artist Joe Joiner, from East London, whose great-grandmother died after being exposed to the substance, has created a moving new art installation in tribute. Over 5000 people die from asbestos-related diseases each year, making it a bigger killer than road accidents . Over 50 families, all grieving for a loved one lost to asbestos exposure, have contributed heartfelt messages to a new moving artwork to help raise awareness, unveiled this week in Covent Garden, London . Currently on display in Covent Garden, London, the installation is made up of heartfelt messages from people who have lost loved ones to asbestos-related diseases. Many are widows whose husbands were exposed during trade work, children who have lost fathers, and others mourning wives, mothers and grandparents. Over 50 families have contributed to the art project, with personal messages to their departed. Created as part of HSE’s Beware Asbestos campaign, the artwork is made up of two huge glass boxes, inside which the messages float around representing a breathing pair of lungs. Award-winning artist Joe Joiner, from East London, has created the art installation as part of HSE’s Beware Asbestos campaign. Joe, whose great-grandmother died after being exposed to asbestos while working at a factory, revealed he initially thought it was a last-century phenomenon. However, while talking about his project with friends and family, more and more cases made themselves known . The messages, written on pieces of paper, are symbolic of the microscopic asbestos fibres inhaled by those exposed. Causing deadly diseases including mesothelioma, an aggressive form of lung cancer, asbestos can be a deadly killer to those unaware of its presence. Among the contributors is Lauren Ross, 56, from Didsbury, Manchester, who lost her husband Frank in 2007. Lauren Ross, 56, from Didsbury, Manchester, lost her husband Frank, a shop fitter and joiner, in 2007 to mesothelioma, an aggressive form of lung cancer caused by exposure to microscopic asbestos fibres . Mrs Ross joined other widows and families who have lost loved ones to asbestos-related diseases at the unveiling of the art installation in Covent Garden, London. She has vowed to continue raising awareness . A  shop fitter and joiner for most of his life, Frank died of mesothelioma aged 60, just a year after he was diagnosed with the condition. 'He first felt a pain in his side on holiday at the end of August 2005 and was treated at first for a pulled muscle,' recalls Mrs Ross. 'In January, he was sent for a chest X-ray due to the pain and some shortage of breath. Poignant: The messages in the installation are symbolic of the microscopic asbestos fibres inhaled by those exposed . 'He was told on 13 January what they thought he had and had further tests from there. He died a year later in February. 'What really upset Frank was the fact that he must have been bringing asbestos into our house for years, potentially affecting me and our four children,' she added. 'This was something he had absolutely no idea about.' Created as part of HSE’s Beware Asbestos campaign, the artwork is made up of two huge glass boxes, inside which the messages float around representing a breathing pair of lungs . Despite experiencing a great deal of pain, Frank continued to raise awareness about the risks of asbestos, and necessary measures to protect workers. 'Since his death I am determined to continue his work in raising awareness, and also to make it clear to tradespeople that - unless you follow all the necessary safety procedures - there is a chance you are taking asbestos home to the ones you love,' says Mrs Ross. 'I want people to be aware that deaths from exposure to asbestos are not a historic issue, but something that can happen to anyone today if the appropriate measures aren’t taken.'

"Nigel Farage's controversial claim that foreign nationals with HIV should not be treated on the NHS was part of what insiders called a ‘shock and awful’ strategy. A Ukip source revealed the party had initially planned for Mr Farage to mention the number of foreign patients suffering from tuberculosis, in the leaders debates last night. But when it was discovered that the antiretroviral drugs to treat people with HIV were more expensive, a decision was taken to use that example instead. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage's controversial claim that foreign nationals with HIV should not be treated on the NHS was part of what insiders called a ‘shock and awful’ strategy . Mr Farage was greeted with silence in the hall when he said during the debate about the NHs that of the 7,000 diagnosed with HIV, 60 per cent were born abroad. After saying this was something the other leaders would be ‘mortified that I dare to even talk about it’, he said: ‘You can come to Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient. ‘I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need is to put the National Health Service there for the British people and families who have paid into this system for decades.’ Despite criticism from other parties and viewers, Ukip revealed it had been part of a deliberate strategy to appeal to their ‘core voter’ – not to try and attract floating voters to the party. A Ukip insider said Mr Farage’s remark was ‘a bit spicy’. They added: ‘We were going to go for TB but we found out that the HIV drugs were more expensive’. The strategy, it was claimed, was ‘shock and awe, or as some would call it shock and awful.’ Mr Farage was greeted with silence in the hall when he said during the debate about the NHs that of the 7,000 diagnosed with HIV, 60 per cent were born abroad . It comes after Ukip’s share of the vote in recent polls has dropped significantly from highs of 19pc late last year, to just 10pc in several polls over the past month, as supporters appear to have returned to the Conservatives and Labour. Mr Farage has claimed he would stand down if he does not win the seat he is contesting in Thanet South, and last night all of his answers focused on the need to curb immigration. Ukip first MP Douglas Carswell refused to endorse Mr Farage’s remark. Asked several times whether he agreed with it, he said Mr Farage had given ‘credible’ answers in the debate. Douglas Carswell has refused to endorse Mr Farage's remarks . Mr Carswell, the MP for Clacton in Essex, added: ‘It is sensible and reasonable to say we want a national health service, not an international health service, and that’s all I’m going to say.’ George Osborne, the Chancellor, said the remarks were intended to provoke a reaction from ministers and said ‘I’m not going to dignify them with a response’. A half-time poll from ComRes/ITV News poll showed 24 per cent of voters giving Mr Farage the lead in the debate, but almost as many thought he was also the worst of the seven leaders. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat business minister, said the remarks were ‘breathtakingly appalling’. Mr Carswell’s father, Wilson, was a respected physician and fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons who diagnosed the first confirmed cases of HIV in Uganda in the 1970s. He was the inspiration for the character of Dr Nicholas Garrigan in The Last King of Scotland. Mr Carswell yesterday insisted the party was not split. He said: ‘I see what you’re trying to do in asking me this slanted question. I thought Nigel was superb in the debates. His answers were credible.’ Mr Farage appeared to embarrass Mr Carswell when he won his seat in a by-election in October by calling for a ban on people with HIV entering the UK. Mr Carswell said at the time: ‘I think this row has been slightly confected. Noone is seriously suggesting we should screen people for HIV coming in.’","Ukip leader said foreigners with HIV should not be treated on the NHS .

"A father of four has been shot dead after he was involved in a road rage incident and the man he brawled with returned to his property with a gun, police say. Thomas Brock, 30, died when he was fatally shot at his home in Pasadena, California, after being involved in an argument with another motorist. Police have now arrested brothers Steven Rodriguez, 24, and Jacob Rodriguez, 29, and charged them with capital murder following the alleged road rage killing. Police say Thomas Brock (left) had become involved in a traffic altercation in the lead up to his death. His widow Julie (right) said she and her husband had no idea who the men were . The violent standoff began about 9pm on Monday, when Mr Brock and one of the suspects got into an argument, the Houston Chronicle reported. Mr Brock was then followed to his home where the two had a fist fight, after which the alleged killer left the property but warned he would return. It is unclear which brother was involved from the start of the incident. Pasadena Police said he then returned with the second suspect. The two kicked down Mr Brock's front door, entered the house and shot him dead. Mr Brock's widow Julie Brock told KHOU: 'This is just unbelievable. 'We didn't even know these guys. They came and killed a man that was a wonderful husband and wonderful father.'

"Known for his life of fast cars, supermodels, and heavy-duty firearms, Dan Bilzerian is perhaps the last man you would expect to be fronting a video about responsible gun use. But the so-called 'King of Instagram' has been forced into making a public safety announcement in order to avoid jail after being arrested for placing homemade explosives into a tractor before shooting them. The film shows a stony-faced Bilzerian speaking from behind a desk in his lavish home, complete with gun-shaped candle holder, an action figurine of himself, and a bizarre painting, while lecturing people on 'responsible' gun ownership. Dead pan: Speaking from a desk in his home, complete with gun candle holder (rear left), an action model of himself (front left), Dan Bilzerian has been forced into making this film about responsible gun ownership . Not amused: The playboy gun-obsessive was forced into making the short film in order to avoid jail after being accused of placing homemade explosives in a tractor and shooting them . He says: 'As an avid shooter remember to shoot responsibly and follow the rules. 'Public lands are for everyone's use. Be responsible when shooting and clean up the area you were shooting in so others can enjoy the land.' Referencing the charges against him, Bilzerian says: 'When shooting exploding rifle targets check with local and state law laws. 'Just because you can buy an exploding target, does not mean that it is legal to mix and explode. 'If shooting exploding targets use only in intended use containers.' The tape then cuts away to footage, believed to be of Bilzerian, shooting a target which promptly explodes into a plume of flame. He adds: 'As this is not intend use.' Bilzerian published this photo after he was released from custody following his arrest last year with the caption 'jail... let's not do that again', a phrase he is forced to repeat in the film . Arsenal: Trust-fund child and professional gambler Bilzerian amassed 7.4million Instagram followers by posting a constant stream of images featuring guns, young women, and wild parties . Bilzerian goes on to warn viewers that they can kill themselves or others when shooting exploding targets, before urging people to 'be responsible'. He then ends the film by saying 'jail... let's not do that again', the same phrase he sent to his followers after he was initially released from custody, along with a picture of himself on his private jet with two young women. Bilzerian has a following of 7million people on Instagram where he has become known for posting images of scantily clad women, wild parties, and his extension gun collection. His outlandish lifestyle has led to legions of fans and critics following his every move, which is all funded by his vast inherited wealth. And it was that following the Bureau of Land Management decided to tap into when they agreed not to jail Bilzerian following his arrest last year. Instead of locking him away, they gave him a rather nominal $10,000 fine, but also strong-armed him into making the film, which has since been widely viewed. Lethal force: Bilzerian once served in the Navy and took part in SEAL training, but was dismissed two days before passing after being disrespectful to an officer . Heavy artillery: Bilzerain has used his socail media following to turn himself into a celebrity by bragging about his lifestyle, including firing this 20mm cannon . Explosive temperament: On Thanksgiving Day, Blizerian shared this video of him blowing targets to smithereens with a large-caliber gun . This is not the first time Bilzerian's crazy antics have got him into trouble with the law. At the end of last year he found himself on the end of a lawsuit after model Vanessa Castano claimed he kicked her in the face in a nightclub. Footage from the scene appears to show Bilzerian dancing on a stage in a club in South Beach, Miami, with the crowd below him, before he lashes out with his foot. However, last month police said they were no longer investigating the model's claims. Bilzerian has been in trouble with the law before after  pornstar Janice Griffith, 19, attempted to sue him for $85,000 when he threw her off his roof and into a pool, breaking her foot . Model Vanessa Castano (pictured) also threatened to take Bilzerian to court after alleging than he kicked her in the face while dancing in a club in South Beach, Miami . He was also facing a lawsuit for $85,000 in lost earnings after he threw pornstar Janice Griffith, 19, off the roof of his home and into the pool below. However she landed short, breaking her foot. She had tried to claim money for shoots she could not attend following the accident. Bilzerian fought back, claiming the model grabbed at his t-shirt at the last second, nearly dragging him off the roof with her. The charges were eventually dropped. Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100 million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler after developing his skills as a student at the University of South Florida. Bilzerian's life usually consists of partying with young, attractive women and firing high-calibre weapons - so it is no surprise he was less than enthused about the safety video . Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler . He has won multiple tournaments, his most successful being the 2009 World Series of Poker. He is also co-founder of online poker room, Victory Poker. Before gambling, he served with the Navy before eventually getting kicked out of SEAL training two days before graduating for offending an officer. He was ultimately given an honorable discharge. He lives extravagantly with homes in Las Vegas, San Diego and Los Angeles, .","Dan Bilzerian, 34, arrested on explosives charges in December last year .

"Teachers are having to use Google Translate to plan lessons as they struggle to cater for migrant children. A union conference heard today that schools are struggling to cope with an influx of children arriving in classes unable to speak English. Teachers have warned that schools are now having to deal with  pupils across the UK speaking up to 300 languages. A union conference heard today that schools are struggling to cope with an influx of children arriving unable to speak English - forcing some teachers to use Google translate to make lesson plans in other languages . They also said English-speaking children are not getting their ‘fair share’ of attention from teachers because of the additional needs of those from abroad. In a speech to delegates from the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Oxfordshire teacher Joy Wilson said many staff had little or no training in how to deal with pupils with English as an additional language (EAL). She said: ‘UK schools are educating a rising number of EAL pupils. This continues day by day. ‘There are now 300 different languages and this is a challenge as we are experiencing growing numbers, and areas of previously no [bilingual] students now have them for the first time.’ She pointed out that it takes some pupils up to seven years to gain adequate language proficiency for academic work - which means their lack of English holds them back. Teachers have warned that schools are now having to deal with pupils across the UK speaking up to 300 different languages - but hardly any English . She said that it was even harder to deal with those who had ‘complex needs’ such as communication disorders, autism and moderate learning difficulties if they also had poor English skills. Around one in six primary school pupils do not have English as their first language, while in secondary schools the figure is one in seven. Official statistics released in 2014 showed the proportion of non-native speakers in primary schools increased from 18.1 per cent to 18.7 per cent in a year. In secondary schools, the proportion increased from 13.6 to 14.3 per cent. Some schools in multicultural areas have pupils with more than 20 different native languages. Earlier this year, it was revealed that only 10 per cent of pupils at Gascoigne Primary School in Barking, East London, were native English speakers. Diane Wilson, who also teaches in Oxfordshire, told the conference in Liverpool she had Hungarian, Russian and Portuguese children in her class. She said: ‘I was up until midnight writing individual lesson plans for the three EAL students and two other differentiated ones for the rest of the class. All the materials handled were self made and individual instructions using Google Translate were put into Hungarian and Portuguese. ‘Without the appropriate funding, the EAL students do not get the specialist support staff they need. ‘The non-EAL students do not get a fair share of the teacher’s time. The stress levels of the teacher go through the roof.’ Heather Emerson, a teacher from Salford, told the delegates: ‘It’s hard, not just for the teachers but for the children as well, and we need to be able to support them. 'I’ve learnt how to speak a little bit of Urdu, a little bit of Persian, a little bit of Spanish, and I’m currently learning Arabic.’ Malcolm St John-Smith, from Wakefield, said pupils were arriving in schools with English which was ‘rudimentary to say the least’ and not developing their skills at home. Statistics show non-native speakers in primary schools increased from 18.1 per cent to 18.7 per cent in 2014 . He added: ‘Unless we do something to actively encourage parents to be a part and recognise that they are a part of this problem, it is still going to go on. ‘I know of schools where there are over 30 different languages being spoken. How do we expect to be able to cope with that unless we have support from everywhere?’ The teachers’ concerns come amid a growing crisis over places in primary and secondary schools, fuelled partly by migration and a baby boom. In parts of London, almost half of families did not get their first choice of secondary school this year. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw warned last year that schools needed more help to deal with growing numbers of children who cannot speak English. He said: ‘When they’re faced with an influx of children from other countries, they need the resources and capacity to deal with it.’","Schools are struggling to cope with children who cannot speak English .

"Depraved Islamic State militants have deliberately destroyed hundreds of boxes of American-produced Halal chicken despite hundreds of thousands facing starvation in war-torn Syria. The barbaric terror group released photos show crates of chicken being set alight in a field near the city of Aleppo even though the meat being was slaughtered according to Islamic law and was perfectly fit for consumption. The food was burned after the jihadis noticed labels on the boxes that suggested the birds had been reared and slaughtered in the United States - something ISIS considers so beyond the pale that hungry refugees on the brink of starving to death are banned from eating the meat. Waste: The barbaric terror group released photos show crates of chicken being set alight in a field near the city of Aleppo despite the meat being slaughtered according to Islamic law and perfectly fit for eat . Sick: One of the images released by ISIS shows a group of jihadis removing the boxes of chicken from the lorry and hurling them down the steep side of a road . The images of the chicken burning were released by the Islamic State's official propaganda wing in Aleppo province, which the militants refer to by its ancient name, Halab. The photo shows a close up shot of the apparent label, which states the meat had been produced by an Illinois-based company and inspected by the U.S. food standard agency. Certified as Halal, meaning it has been slaughtered in accordance with Islamic Law, it is believed the meat was destined for the thousands of starving refugees in the city of Aleppo. Instead, the two lorries were stopped by ISIS' religious police force - known as Al-Hesbah - at a checkpoint in Aleppo province, where the cargo was deemed unlawful. Product of the USA: This photo shows a close up shot of the apparent label, which states the meat had been produced by an Illinois-based company and inspected by the U.S. food standard agency .

"Cycling anywhere with a toddler in tow means having to leave the buggy at home. And any parent who has tried this will know how tiring it can be when you then have to carry your child around once you arrive at your destination. A Swedish firm is hoping to make getting around with a young child easier - and save your aching arms - by introducing the bike seat that doubles up as a stroller. Påhoj (pictured) was designed by Swedish designer Lycke von Schantz. It has a 'lightweight chassis' and is 3.2ft (1 metre) tall. The product will launch on Kickstarter next week but prices are not yet known . Called Påhoj, it clips onto the back of a standard bike using a specially-designed attachment. A child, up to a height of 3.2ft (1 metres), is then strapped into the seat in an almost vertical position. The parent cycles to their destination, and once they arrive, can unclip the seat and push it like a regular buggy. The concept was created by Swedish designer Lycke von Schantz and a prototype has been safety tested. It clips onto the back of a standard bike using a specially-designed attachment.

"Searches are underway for Kyle Knox, 23, from London, who was last seen at 10am on Monday at the start of the route for the 4409-ft high Ben Nevis . Searches are ongoing today for a missing 23-year-old walker who disappeared as he tried to climb Britain's highest mountain in -7C blizzards and 70mph winds. Kyle Knox, from London, was last seen at about 10am on Monday at the start of the route for the 4409-ft high Ben Nevis in the Scottish Highlands. He failed to return to his accommodation in the Fort William area yesterday, prompting staff to alert police to his disappearance. Police Scotland said the force had no information to suggest he was an experienced walker and believe he attempted to climb the mountain alone. Searches of Ben Nevis and the Glen Nevis area of Lochaber were carried out last night, with Lochaber Mountain Rescue and a RAF search and rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth being scrambled to the scene. However, the hunt had to be called off in darkness last night. Police Scotland confirmed this morning that the search had now resumed with rescuers describing the weather conditions as 'awful'. The Met Office said 72mph winds were recorded in the area on Monday and 61mph gusts on Tuesday. Wind speeds have dropped to 51mph today but are still significant. Forecasters added that temperatures have been below freezing in the area every day this week, with the coldest temperature recorded at about -7C. There is also likely to be heavy snowfall on the peak, with 32mm of snow and rain falling over the last 32 hours. The RAF Sea King continues  to search for Mr Knox today, despite yesterday being its last day before handing over to a new civilian helicopter operator. The crew were due to hand over to a Coastguard-co-ordinated Bristow helicopter crew based at Inverness Airport today but it was decided to let the military team continue with this search - which will be the RAF's last rescue callout in Scotland. Search and rescue dogs as well as Glencoe and Lochaber mountain rescue teams are also scouring the mountain. Mr Knox is described as 5ft 10, slim build with dark hair. He was last seen wearing dark waterproof trousers, walking boots and a jacket with red flashes on it. People are being urged not to go to Scotland's mountains unless they have the proper equipment and experience due to the severe weather conditions which have blighted the UK in recent days. The Mountaineering Council of Scotland (MCofS) said wind, snow and freezing temperatures have made walking and climbing conditions extremely difficult. The warning comes ahead of the Easter weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times in Scotland's hills, and MCofS said mountain rescuers have 'serious safety concerns' about the weekend. Heather Morning, the council's safety adviser, said only people with adequate gear and knowledge of winter conditions should venture out. Mr Knox failed to return to his accommodation in the Fort William area yesterday, prompting staff to alert police to his disappearance.

'And rigid-soled boots must be worn to kick steps across old, hard snow patches. 'Don't be fooled into thinking that a pair of lightweight slip-on snow-spikes will do the job. They won't. 'Crampons that are not securely clipped and strapped to your boots will roll off as soon as you leave flat ground.' Simon Steer, chairman of Scottish Mountain Rescue, added: 'It's a sad fact that the beautiful, yet deceptive conditions on the hills at Easter means that this is often a busy time for the volunteers in the mountain rescue teams.

"Kansas has become the first state to ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure that critics describe as dismembering a fetus. Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, a strong abortion opponent, signed the 'Kansas unborn child protection from dismemberment abortion act on Tuesday. It takes effect July 1. The law bans the so-called 'dilation and evacuation' procedure and redefines it as 'dismemberment abortion.' Sam Brownback, the governor of Kansas, tweeted a photo on Tuesday showing him signing the abortion-ban bill into law . Kansas abortion opponents have spent years pushing their state to the right on the contentious issue, including this 2013 rally at the steps of the Kansas Statehouse in Topeka . Drafted by the National Right to Life Committee, the measure also has been introduced in Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina, though only Kansas lawmakers have passed it. 'The Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act is the first of what we hope will be many state laws banning dismemberment abortions,' National Right to Life president Carol Tobias told The New York Times. 'This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,' she said. Julie Burkhart, the chief executive of the Trust Women Foundation, predicted that her group would challenge the law in court. 'We call it the ""physician intimidation and criminalization act"",' Burkhart told the Times. 'This is unconstitutional.' Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri is also considering a lawsuit. But the governor is holding firm. Brownback has presided over one of the nation's most aggressive pushes to limit abortions, resulting in at least 20 laws restricting the practice of medically terminating pregnancies. 'This is a horrific procedure,' Brownback spokesman Eileen Hawley said. 'He hopes the nation follows suit.' Brownback, a popular conservative governor, won a second term in November despite a bruising campaign largely centered on the state's economy – not social issues . Kansas state Rep. John Wilson, a Democratic lawmaker from Lawrence, Kansas, is an abortion-right proponent; he asked during a March debate why pro-life groups don't spend more time trying to prevent unwanted pregnancies . The procedure is banned except when necessary to save a woman's life or prevent irreversible damage to her physical health. There is no exception in the law for incest or victims of rape. The new Kansas law specifically explains in graphic language the procedure it bans: . Doctors cannot use forceps, clamps, scissors or similar instruments on a fetus to remove it from the womb in pieces. Abortion rights supporters said the procedure is often the safest for women seeking to terminate pregnancies during the second trimester. The procedure accounted for about 9 percent of abortions last year in Kansas, where most pregnancies are terminated in the first trimester and the state already bans most abortions at or after the 22nd week. 'This dangerous law dictates to qualified physicians how they can practice medicine and treat their patients,' Julie Burkhart, founder and CEO of Trust Women, said in a statement. Brownback signed the bill in a private ceremony at his official residence. His office said he would re-enact it at multiple public events later this month. A photo from Tuesday's ceremony tweeted by the governor's office showed Brownback flanked by anti-abortion leaders and two large photos of fetuses.","WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE .

"Boris Johnson was accused of ‘breath-taking cheek’ after he set out his vision of ‘moral purpose’ in business and politics. The London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment and not returning to the dole queues of 1980s Britain. He said the fact that more jobs were being created was ‘one of the absolute moral triumphs’ of the government. Boris Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, has set out his vision of ‘moral purpose’ in business and politics . The comments by Mr Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, will be seen as an attempt to position himself as a future party leader. Labour’s Stephen Pound accused the London Mayor of 'breath-taking cheek' Last night Labour’s Stephen Pound, who is fighting to defend a nearby seat, said: ‘I’m thinking of a sentence with the words pot, kettle and black in it.’ ‘It seems that Boris’s motto is “do as I say, not as I do”. It really is breath-taking cheek. He obviously has a different definition of “moral” to most of my constituents.’ In 2004, Mr Johnson admitted a four-year affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt while he was married to his second wife Marina, with whom he has four children. Five years later he fathered a child by Helen Macintyre, an unpaid adviser in the London Assembly. Mr Johnson spoke about morality in an interview with the London Evening Standard, saying he believed wealth creation was there to fund public services such as schools and hospitals. He said: ‘I think this country was harrowed by the experience of mass unemployment in the early Eighties. ‘One of the absolute moral triumphs of this Coalition government has been to get us through the worst recession for 50 years without seeing a return to those levels of unemployment.’","London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment .

"A giant lamb born weighing the same as a toddler is thought to be the biggest ever birthed in the UK. The animal, aptly named Hagrid after the fictional giant in Harry Potter, was born on Tuesday at three times the size of its peers. Dwarfing other newborns on the farm in Gelston near Grantham in Lincolnshire where he was born, Hagrid's owners believe he may be the biggest ever lamb born in the UK at 25lbs. Scroll down for video . Hagrid the lamb (right) is thought to be the biggest ever born in the UK, measuring 14inches tall and weighing 25lbs . The animal towers over his peers at the farm in Gelston near Grantham in Lincolnshire where he was born . The creature was born naturally on Tuesday and his mother is in remarkably good condition following the birth . Standing proudly at 14inches tall, the Suffolk Cross towers over his peers some five inches below. Despite his remarkable size the lamb was born naturally and his mother is making a good recovery. 'I couldn't believe my eyes - he was enormous. 'It presented all correctly with two feet and his head and I just needed to help him out. For such a massive lamb, a natural birth like that is pretty remarkable.' Despite Hagrid's shocking size, his mother has recovered from the birth and both are healthy. 'He is doing well. He is up on his feet and suckling and doing good, as is his mum. Thankfully she didn't suffer,' added Mr Elkington. Hagrid's owners said his mother had always birthed large lambs but that they had never seen one of his size . Chris Elkington and his wife Louise, who have 130 breeding Ewes on their farm, believe Hagrid is the largest lamb ever born in the UK . While normal lambs are born at around 10inches tall, Hagrid stands almost five inches taller and weighs significantly more . 'She had been a rather big ewe all year and when I got her in the shed I said to my wife we were going to have a massive lamb - but not quite that big. 'It was like lifting a small child out of her. We are very pleased. 'I have been farming for a long time - about 15 years - and never seen anything like this at all. It's incredible.' The previous record for the largest lamb in the UK was held by one called Joan born at 24lbs. In March this year another, called The Big One, was born at 2oz heavier in Wales. Delivered five days early on a farm in Denbigh, the animal was three times heavier than the average newborn lamb.","Hagrid the Suffolk Cross was born weighing 25lbs and is 14inches tall .

"Lorraine Bracco has revealed that The Sopranos creator David Chase wanted her to play the role of Tony's wife Carmela and not Dr. Jennifer Melfi, his psychiatrist. The Oscar nominated actress, 60, revealed she turned down the starring role alongside James Gandolfini in the landmark HBO drama because she had already played a mobster's wife in Goodfellas, nine years previously. Accusing Chase of lazy casting, Bracco chose instead the complicated role of Dr. Melfi, who provided the therapy that allowed New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano to justify many of his monstrous acts. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Lorraine Bracco said that she was first approached to play the role of Carmela in The Sopranos and not Dr. Jennifer Melfi . Speaking to Huffington Post Live, Bracco explained how she convinced Chase to change his mind. 'I fell in love with David (Chase) the minute I met him, when I walked into the room. 'I said, 'I like this guy. And I said, 'Look, I don't think I should play Carmela because I did it, I did it in a Scorsese movie, I got an Oscar nomination. 'I really don't think I'm going to bring so much to this for you that I haven't done already,' she told HuffPost Live on Monday. What could have been: Lorraine Bracco wanted to play Dr. Jennifer Melfi (left) but was originally asked by show creator David Chase to play Carmela Soprano. He cast Edie Falco (right) instead . Oscar nominated: Lorraine Bracco starred opposite Ray Liotta in Goodfellas in 1990. The Martin Scorsese mob drama is recognized as one of the greatest movies in that genre . Obviously not wanting to count herself out of what became arguably the best television drama ever made, Bracco asked to play the character of Dr. Melfi instead. 'I said, 'But I really love this script, and I want to play Mefli.' ... And he agreed with me that I'd done it already and it wasn't really incredible creative casting for him. He said, 'You want to play Melfi?' And I said, 'Yeah, I want to play Mefli'' So I left on that, and he gave it to me.' Speaking about the untimely death of James Gandolfini in 2013, Bracco said his passing was devastating and a wake up call. 'Well yea. My parents died nine days apart and then later Jimmy passed and Jimmy is a decade younger than me,' said Bracco to HuffPost Live. Soprano's stars: Edie Falco, James Gandolfini and Lorraine Bracco at the launch of the show's fifth season in New York City in 2005 . 'I always teased him, 'You gotta get rid of that belly' and he would say, 'Oh, it's pure muscle!' said Bracco. 'But yea, it (his death) was devastating.

"The creator of the best-selling Alex Rider spy novels has accused fellow children’s author David Walliams of dumbing-down fiction and failing to ‘challenge’ young readers. Anthony Horowitz said books by the comedian – who was the UK’s top-selling children’s author last year – are ‘witty and entertaining’ but nowhere near ambitious enough. The 59-year-old novelist and screenwriter singled out Walliams’ Gangsta Granny for criticism, as well as the Diary Of A Wimpy Kid books by author Jeff Kinney. Scroll down for video . Author Anthony Horowitz (pictured right) said books by comedian David Walliams (left) – who was the UK’s top-selling children’s author last year – are ‘witty and entertaining’ but nowhere near ambitious enough . He insisted that such writers should challenge their young readers and not be ‘afraid of powerful stories or serious ideas’. He suggested they should follow the example of authors such as John Green and ‘write up for children, not down to them’. Green’s book, The Fault In Our Stars, tells the story of two teenagers who fall in love while they are both dying of cancer, and was the top-selling title of 2014, with more than 870,000 copies sold. Horowitz, who is also the principal writer on the ITV period detective drama Foyle’s War, singled out Gangsta Granny, with its breaking-wind jokes and a character who perpetuates the myth that children ‘automatically dislike reading’. Writing in the Times Educational Supplement, he said he was troubled that children’s books ‘seem to have come full circle’. Walliams made over £7million in 2014 from book sales including The Boy in the Dress and Demon Dentist . He added: ‘To some extent, narrative fiction was reinvented by JK Rowling – it’s hard to believe that children weren’t challenged by books that stretched to 760 pages – and a phalanx of writers crested on her success: Michael Morpurgo, Philip Pullman, Jacqueline Wilson, Malorie Blackman, Eoin Colfer, Darren Shan... and me. 'Today it is Jeff Kinney and David Walliams who top the bestseller lists, with books that are witty and entertaining but nowhere near as ambitious.’ He added: ‘Speaking personally, I was a little sad when, in Walliams’ Gangsta Granny, we were told that among the old woman’s vices, which included dribbling and farting: “Her house was stuffed full of books and she was always trying to get Ben to read them, even though he loathed reading”.’ Horowitz said ‘the idea that children automatically dislike reading or that books belong to a more fusty, ancient generation is patently absurd’. His Alex Rider books, the first of which was published in 2000, have been ‘brightly re-jacketed’, and are ‘as popular as ever’. They have sold 19million copies in 30 different languages, he pointed out. Horowitz said: ‘Quite recently, I addressed an audience of largely unpublished writers in New York and I stand by the advice that I gave them. ‘Write up for children, not down to them. We don’t need to be afraid of powerful stories or serious ideas. The audience is there.’ Walliams last year made more than £7million from book sales. The 43-year-old Britain’s Got Talent judge had four books in last year’s top 50 bestsellers list. His latest book, Awful Auntie, sold more than 500,000 copies last year. The success of his books, which also include Ratburger and Billionaire Boy, has also been boosted by television adaptations, such as The Boy in the Dress, which starred Walliams, Meera Syal and Jennifer Saunders, and was shown on the BBC at Christmas.","Author Anthony Horowitz has accused David Walliams of dumbing down .

"The NYPD  detective caught on video screaming at an Uber driver has lost his shield and gun and will be placed on administrative duty, police officials said Wednesday. The New York Post reported in addition to being stripped of his badge, Detective Patrick Cherry will be placed on modified duty before being transferred out of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. 'No good cop should watch that video without a wince,' NYPD Police Chief Bill Bratton said at a press conference announcing Cherry was being placed on modified duty. Scroll down for video . Screaming and raging: Detective Patrick Cherry, pictured in the blue shirt, launched his tirade after the Uber driver hooted at him . 'Because all good cops know that officer just made their jobs a little bit harder,' Bratton added. 'In that kind of encounter, anger like that is unacceptable. In any encounter, discourtesy and obscene language like that is unacceptable.' The New York Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau launched an investigation into the incident, which occurred in the West Village, after footage captured by a passenger was posted online. The officer was named by the New York Daily News as Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD's Joint Terrorism Task Force. Shell shocked: The driver, named only as Humayun, pictured, tried to repeatedly apologise to Detective Cherry . Detective Cherry was in plainclothes and trying to park his unmarked Hyundai without signalling when the Uber driver known only as Humayun honked his horn. The angered detective pulled over the Uber cab and launched a tirade, questioning the diver's command of the English language as well as his driving ability. Cherry's case was transferred to the Civilian Complaint Review Board following a complaint of 'discourtesy'. Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said Cherry was returning from a visit with his colleague Detective Harry Hill. Hill had recently had a heart attack while undergoing surgery and Cherry was reportedly very stressed. 'The past five days have been emotionally draining for the members of the JTTF dealing with their fellow detective's health,' Palladino said. 'Despite what some people think, cops have feelings, too.' During the three-minute video, Detective Cherry shouts at the driver, screaming, 'I don't know where you're coming from, where you think you're appropriate in doing that.' 'That's not the way it works,' he continued. 'How long have you been in this country?' The two passengers in the backseat of the car can be heard assuring the driver that he has done nothing wrong, with one of them saying; 'It's not your fault; this guy's just a d***.' Moments later the cop returns with a ticket, this after he has pounded on the car and, according to one of the passengers, thrown things in the vehicle. As the driver agrees with everything the cop says, he manages to cut off the man, which sends him into another tirade as he screams; 'I don't know what f****** planet you're on right now!' The officer also mocks the driver's accent throughout and his pronunciation of certain words. Passengers in the cab claimed that Detective Cherry failed to indicate before attempting to park his Hyundai . 'Our Uber driver, Humayun, was abused by a police officer today in New York,' Sanjay Seth, who took the video, wrote on his Facebook page on Monday. 'The unending rage, door slamming, throwing items into the car, threatening arrest without cause was bad enough - but the officer's remarks at the end really took it to another level.' 'The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident,' Uber said in a statement. 'We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs.'","Patrick Cherry will be placed on desk duty before being transferred out of the NYPD's Joint Terrorism Task Force division .

"Victims of a man who operated a 'revenge porn' website and then charged victims to remove nude images and their personal information spoke out after the man was sentenced on Friday. Kevin Bollaert, 28, was sentenced to 18 years in state prison after he was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion in San Diego Superior Court for running a pair of websites that capitalized on the internet as a forum for public shaming. A group of Bollaert's victims were flown in from around the country to be involved in the prosecution and some have now said that they no longer feel ashamed for sending nude pictures. Victims revealed that they had received a slew of hurtful comments after their nudes were posted and one woman even said she nearly killed herself. Scroll down for video . Shameful: In a first-of-its-kind ruling, Bollaert was sentenced t 18 years for running a 'revenge porn' site, publishing nude and embarassing photos of women sent in anonymously by people wanting to hurt them . Standing up: Three victims, Emily (left), Natlie Coco (center) and Megan Borash (right) spoke out on how having their pictures and information posted on the website affected them . Jilted lovers and hackers could anonymously post nude photos of people without their consent, along with personal information about them, at a website Bollaert created and moderated, called ugotposted.com. More than 10,000 images, mainly of women, were posted between December 2012 and September 2013. People who sought to have the explicit images taken down were directed to changemyreputation.com and charged $250 to $350 to remove the racy content. Victims included teachers, wives and professionals. Nicole Coco was one of the victims who testified in court. She told NBC that after receiving vulgar messages from strangers she went to the police but they were not much help. 'I got the photos removed once. The second time they were like, 'We'll try and try again.' They thought it was my fault, and it was a lot of victim shaming,' said Coco, who had previously tried to commit suicide because of the situation. She said that a California Department of Justice official who contacted her with regards to criminal charges against Bollaert was the first time she was told and felt that having the pictures posted was not her fault. Crying in court: Kevin Bollaert, 28, broke down in tears at his sentencing hearing in San Diego on Friday. He was facing a maximum of 20 years but was given 18, with the judge saying the sentence accurately reflected the amount of victims he hurt . Shaming: Victim Natalie Coco said she had been through a lot of victim shaming before being contacted by a California Department of Justice official who had reached out in regards to criminal charges against Bollaert . 'It was amazing because I blamed myself for a long time before that,' she said. Another victim of Bollaert's website, Megan Borash, said that when the guilty verdict came in she knew was she did 'was not wrong' and that she was 'not ashamed of what' she did. Borash said that the sentencing 'means a lot'. 'Huge weight off my shoulder. I'm out here talking to you, gave you my information. Ask me yesterday, you wouldn't have gotten it. It's time for me to take my life back and start living.' The landmark case was the first time a person had been tried for a running revenge porn ring in the United States. The compromising photos cost people jobs, damaged relationships and led to one attempted suicide. Bollaert earned about $900 a month in website ad revenue and collected about $30,000 from victims. Relief: Victim Megan Borash said that after the guilty verdict came in she realized that what she did was not wrong and that she was 'not ashamed of what' she did . Trauma: One victim, who identified herself as Emily, said that she had received 'crude comments' about her body after pictures of her were posted on the site . Bollaert's lawyer had claimed at trial that the business was gross and offensive, but he didn't break the law by allowing others to post the explicit material. 'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' Emily Rose-Weber said. But the prosecution said Bollaert terrorized women and enjoyed doing it. Not only would he the photos, but the names, addresses and social media details of the people in them. Many victims were inundated with harassing messages from strangers. Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.' The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her. 'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.' Some of the women read victim impact statements in court, according to NBC San Diego. Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators it was his life that had been ruined by the site . One victim, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's just broken me on a level that's not describable. The only thing I have left is shame and anger.' Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just, like, ruining my life.' 'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.' 'I mean I know a lot of people are getting screwed over like on the site. Like their lives are getting ruined,' he said. Criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor Tony Solare told NBC that 'revenge porn' cases are hard to prosecute. 'It's hard to prove someone did the act if they did it through a computer. Unless you can prove someone did it with that IP address they can say I didn't do this. I can sit here and think of a million ways people can commit this crime without getting caught,' he said. Terrorized: Some of the victims appeared in court, anonymously, to read victim impact statements. Many said their lives had been irrevocably ruined by Bollaert and his site . Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, was facing 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a despicable scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site . He added: 'As far as the volume of [cyber-exploitation crimes] I'm sure [investigators] are woefully understaffed as far as what's out there.' Solare also said that people who think they're victims of cyber exploitation should take a series of important steps. He said: 'If you have a situation like that, you want to sit down and write a detailed account of what occurred, who did it, why you think they did it, what information you can have to specifically tie the bad act to the person you think did it and how you found out about it. 'Because the more information someone has, the more law enforcement has, the more they have to look into it. 'The other thing to do is to not delay in reporting something like this because any delay in reporting of any crime creates any problem for prosecution,' Bollaert is expected to serve at least half his prison sentence and must pay $10,000 in restitution. The trial of Hunter Moore, called 'the most hated man on the Internet' for running isanyoneup.com, is yet to go before court.","Kevin Bollaert was found guilty of 27 counts of identity theft and extortion .

"Octavia Spencer shocked and angered hundreds of fans at a recent book signing,  acting like an 'ungrateful b****,' say eyewitnesses who were so incensed with the actress's behavior they stormed out and demanded refunds. The 44-year-old Academy Award winner, who won Best Supporting Actress for her role as Minnie Jackson, a maid, in 'The Help,' and is currently starring in the film 'Insurgent,' was at Barnes & Noble bookstore at The Grove in Los Angeles last week to autograph copies of her children's book 'Randi Rhodes Ninja Detective — The Sweetest Heist in History.' But before the night was over people were dragging their kids out of line, demanding refunds on the books and stormed out of the store in disgust. 'Octavia was mean, rude and horrible to everyone,' former Octavia fan, Angel Guzman explained to the Daily Mail in an exclusive interview. Scroll down for video . Behind the smile: Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer was at the Barnes & Noble bookstore at The Grove in Los Angeles last week to autograph copies of her children's book 'Randi Rhodes Ninja Detective — The Sweetest Heist in History.' But there was nothing sweet about Spencer, who complained constantly, refused to engage with fans or pose with them for a photo . Before the night was over people were dragging their kids out of line, demanding refunds on the books and stormed out of the store in disgust . 'Initially, there was a Q & A but Octavia acted like she was forced to be there and she took her anger out on all of us, including the kids. 'Octavia's answers were short and blunt and there were times she rolled her eyes to the back of her head like she couldn't believe someone could ask such a stupid question. It quickly became a very uncomfortable situation for all of us,' says Guzman. 'It was clear they just needed to proceed to the autographs because Octavia was not responding well at all to the questions.' Octavia was scheduled to autograph her books from 7-9 p.m. but she was complaining the moment she arrived about the space they put her in, the 'tiny glass of water' she was given, that her feet were hurting so she took a long bathroom break, leaving everyone to wonder if she left or not. 'Octavia was acting like a diva. She was mad because the event coordinator gave her a small glass of water but she wanted a large liter of 'good water' and demanded to know why she was being treated this way,' Guzman continued. 'All of this happened in front of everyone who has been standing there for at least an hour, with their restless kids, waiting for her to show up. Octavia didn't acknowledge the crowd in any way; she just showed up and started to complain. 'But when the she finally started to sign the books is when things went from bad to worse.' Ordinarily, celebrities allow their fans to take a picture with them at these book signings, but Octavia said no touching, no coming around the table to take a pic with her and she also refused to have small talk with anyone — just give her the book to sign and keep it moving. Talent: Spencer won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance in The Help . And she didn't even want to ask the customer what was their name, they had to tell the assistant standing nearby their name, she wrote it on a sticky pad and handed it to Octavia, who then signed the book and slid it over to the edge of the table for pickup, like it was a fast food window. After watching Octavia being abrupt and rude to several people one woman grabbed her 8-year-old and stormed off yelling, 'This woman is an ungrateful, nasty b****! I'm getting a refund on this stupid book. If she talked to me or my child like that it would get really ugly in here so it's best we get our money back and go home before something jumps off.' 'I'm probably the most militant person you'll ever meet and I speak my mind without provocation sometimes,' Octavia was once quoted, and she admits she is a nasty sleepwalker. But clearly, according the eyewitnesses at this book signing, she doesn't have to be asleep to be nasty. 'After several more encounters with her audience, a man approached with an 8X10 photo of Octavia for her to sign but she was clearly furious and said, 'I'm NOT doing that. 'The guy was devastated, saying he bought it specifically for that day, that he was a big fan and he promised he would not post it on any social media outlets but she didn't care — she said 'absolutely, not.' But she did sign the book he just bought and slid it across the table to the guy — who was absolutely dumbfounded,' Guzman explained. 'And boy, that was it. The crowd started to leave in droves and went directly to the counter to get refunds for the books.' Attitude: 'When someone approached the table, Octavia demanded to see the receipt to prove they purchased the book before she would sign an autograph, ' says a former fan about the event. ' It was outrageous' Another eyewitness told the Daily Mail they agreed that Octavia was horrible and didn't care that she was being a **** in front of children. 'I just left, who does she think she is anyway — Elizabeth Taylor?' the eyewitness exclaimed. 'I could not believe how rude she was to all of those people who were there to support her. 'When someone approached the table, Octavia demanded to see the receipt to prove they purchased the book before she would sign an autograph. It was outrageous — and insulting. A call by Daily Mail Online to Spencer's representative for comment was not returned.","Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer was at the Barnes & Noble bookstore at The Grove in Los Angeles to autograph copies of her new children's book .

"Retired news legend Barbara Walters still has some clout - and a strong opinion about how ABC can turn things around at the ratings-challenged show she created, The View. Barbara's magic bullet: Monica Lewinsky. Walters says that the former White House intern would be a 'run away success' on The View, a network source tells Daily Mail Online. She would attract great guests - even if casting her as a regular co-host would make it unlikely that potential 2016 Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton or President Bill Clinton would ever appear on the show again. Scroll down for video . Ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal Barbara Walters has always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years . Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern talked about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. 'Barbara believes that Monica, 41, could make The View competitive and compelling and while a lot of Washington's elite may scratch the show off its must-visit press list, the younger demographic of online users would tune in daily to see what she had to say,' added the source. Last year when discussing Lewinsky with David Letterman, he asked her about Monica joining The View. It looked as though the late night host was reading her mind and she stuttered, 'I think it would be great if she were on The View. I wouldn't expect it tomorrow.' 'Tomorrow is now,' says the insider. The multi-host show was created by Walters in 1997 with an original panel of women including Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos. It defied the odds previous shows faced in the 11am time slot. Exit Rosie: She had enough of The View and vice versa . Despite numerous cast changes – Lisa Ling, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Rosie O'Donnell, Sherri Shepherd, and Jenny McCarthy have had stints as co-hosts on the show – The View became a force to be reckoned with in daytime TV. But after the exit of Behar and Hasselbeck and the addition of McCarthy, The View took a ratings dive. ABC decided to overhaul the show following the end of that season, and replaced Shepherd and McCarthy with Republican analyst Nicolle Wallace and actress Rosie Perez. The network also brought back O'Donnell to join the show's long-running moderator, Whoopi Goldberg. In-fighting between Goldberg and O'Donnell and endless backstage turmoil caused ABC to move the show from its Entertainment division to its News division. Despite numerous set changes and multiple updates to the show opening, the new ensemble never seemed to attract viewers and ratings continued to fall. ABC then had a failed attempt at firing Perez while she was rehearing for her Broadway show Fish in the Dark in January. In February, after the return of Goldberg who had been sidelined with a back injury, ABC let O'Donnell go but allowed her to use her recent divorce as her excuse for departing the show for a second time. (She had a failed one-year stint as moderator in 2007 that abruptly ended after she walked off set following an on-air blow-up with co-host Hasselbeck.) Down to three co-hosts and two chairs vacant, ABC has been closely looking at Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams, fashion host Stacy London, former child star Raven Symone and comedienne Michelle Collins as potential replacements. President Bill Clinton appeared on The View in 2011 talking about his book Back to Work and the current economic troubles occurring in America. It is doubtful he would be a guest if Monica was co-host . The View celebratesd 4000 shows with guest co-hosts Barbara Walters and Joy Behar . The network is also seriously considering convincing former co-host Behar to return as a full-time panelist. She has made a half-dozen co-host appearances since January and was on-hand for the show's 4,000-episode celebration show. Walters, who sold all rights to The View back to ABC a year before her retirement in May 2014, has been contacting James Goldston, President of ABC News, and Ben Sherwood, President, Disney-ABC Television Group, trying to convince them to hire Lewinsky, insiders tell Daily Mail Online. Walters believes that Lewinsky could reignite interest in the show and after a decade-long silence; she has a lot to say. 'Barbara has been like a godmother to Monica ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal. She's always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years,' a source close to the show says. Barbara told Letterman, 'I like Monica. She never had a chance to move on,' the way Bill and Hillary did. 'She's an intelligent, nice woman.' Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern spoke about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. Barbara Walters, arrives for the Oscar De La Renta fashion show last February. She remains spry and opinionated too. She's convinced Monica would help save the show . Not only that, but since re-emerging out of the shadows to address her affair with Clinton in a compelling Vanity Fair essay last May, she has taken on an extremely attractive new look to match her new persona. According to a representative of the show, Lewinsky has been asked to come on the show as a guest to discuss her anti-bullying campaign but is not on the list of potential co-hosts at this time. While current co-host Wallace would love to have Lewinsky as a regular on the show, staunch Democratic supporters and Clinton friends Goldberg and Perez aren't feeling the idea at all, the source revealed. A few weeks ago The Talk managed to edge out The View in the Nielsen ratings, but The View has come back to beat out the relative newcomer ever since. 'Whatever ABC News plans to do to salvage the show, they better do it fast,' the source concluded!","The grand dame of broadcasters believes that Monica Lewinsky has the right stuff to bring The View back from the brink .

"David Cameron has a 'secret plan' to cut taxes for millionaires after the General Election, Ed Balls claimed today as Labour ramped up its attack on the eighth day of campaigning. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'. But the Prime Minister hailed today as 'money-back Monday' - with a raft of tax changes coming into force putting more cash in voters' wallets. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls, speaking in Leeds this morning, ramped up his attack on the Tories today - claiming that David Cameron was planning a VAT increase and cuts to the top rate of tax . Mr Cameron has claimed that Labour are planning to increase taxes by £3,028 on 'every working family'. But, speaking in Leeds this morning, Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke hit back with an accusation that Labour has a secret plan to boost revenues by dragging more workers into the 40p higher rate of income tax and increasing national insurance contributions. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his 2012 Budget, each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on Sunday. They are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the South West. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less' Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p . Mr Balls said: 'We know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires. 'How can it be fair when families here in Leeds and across the country are struggling and £1,100 a year worse-off? 'How can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our NHS is in crisis and going backwards? 'How can this be fair when we need to get the deficit down and the Tories are now planning deeper cuts in the next three years than the last five?' Mr Balls said a cut in the top rate to 40p would save someone earning £1 million a year £340,000 over the course of the next Parliament, while someone with income of £5 million would get a total tax cut of £1.94 million over the five-year period. Meanwhile, he said that unfunded Conservative plans to cut £10 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two-point rise in VAT, costing an average couple with children £1,440 over four years. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg meets supporters at the Grove Pub while out campaigning in Surbiton, London . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' Voters would not believe Mr Cameron's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax, because Conservatives had 'a track record of breaking their promises on VAT', he said. However, Conservatives claimed secret Labour plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than £3,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies a week ago. Mr Gauke said: 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband must set out the details of their secret plan for GBP3,028 of tax rises on every working family - the British people have a right to know what these tax hikes are. The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.' Mr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over £150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes. Mr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost £400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to £12,500. By contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just £37 to taxpayers. 'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West. 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate. Labour has already failed to commit the £8 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.' Mr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in Surbiton . Mr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ... 'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament. 'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.' Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal. On a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition. Conservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News. 'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.' Mr Clegg's comments came after Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told The Independent that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts, a Conservative minister told him: 'You take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses.'","Labour  unveils poster claiming voters lost £1,100 each due to tax changes .

"Rand Paul's timing couldn't be better, and it couldn't be worse. Kentucky's junior senator is poised to enter the 2016 presidential contest on Tuesday, at a moment when only Sen. Ted Cruz, the tea party darling, is already in the race and consuming precious news-cycle oxygen. But the issue that made him a national figure two years ago – domestic snooping by the National Security Agency – is no longer on America's front-burner. Paul will launch his campaign Tuesday morning in Louisville, Kentucky with the populist slogan 'Defeat the Washington machine. Unleash the American dream.' An aide to a member of the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives laughed that line off on Monday. Scroll down for video . READY TO RUN: Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul will announce his candidacy for president on April 7 in Louisville . CHIP OF THE BLOCK? Paul's uber-libertarian father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul (left), earned an image party-wide as a cantankerous and prickly contrarian with little chance of winning over centrist Republicans . NEW AUDIENCES: Paul the younger has made a name for himself meeting with minority groups – and speaking to all-black audiences – in an attempt to win them over with a message of criminal justice reform . 'That's hilarious,' the Capitol Hill staffer said in a phone interview. 'Rand Paul is as much a part of the Washington machine as Joe Biden or Harry Reid.' 'It's like Hillary Clinton running on a platform of email transparency in government.' 'If he's an outsider, I'm a Democrat,' he said. An Iowa Republican Party official who said he hasn't chosen a horse in the 2016 primary told Daily Mail Online that 'Rand Paul is going to have problems if he thinks he can position himself as an outsider.' 'That can work for a governor,' he explained, 'and maybe for his father, who was outside the mainstream in just about every way. But it won't sell in Iowa, especially since he's walking his views back toward the center.' Both men spoke on condition of anonymity. Paul has taken heat in recent days from libertarians for softening some of the principled stands thad have defined his brand since Kentuckians sent him to Washington. He described himself as 'a judicial activist' in January, for instance, telling a conservative audience that federal judged shouldn't hesitate to toss out majority-rule decisions by Congress if they infringe on constituional rights. In an interview Sunday with the blog The Federalist, however, he said Americans 'should leave more power in the hands of the states and local governments.' 'More often than not, the longer a federal judge or elected official is in office, the more out of touch they become,' he said. SMALL POND: The only other big fish to announce his candidacy so far is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, an evangelical Christian whose views couldn't be much more different from Paul's . Paul has found himself occasionally in the policy weeds as the news cycle shifts away from his natural area of strength and into territory where he has yet to define himself. Bashar al-Assad, Ayatollah Khamenei and Bowe Bergdahl now occupy the space once dominated by NSA leaker Edward Snowden. And as other Republican presidential hopefuls strategize about how to approach the Middle East foreign policy mess on Barack Obama's desk, Paul has to contend with his past isolationist statements that make the president's approach seem bold and Reaganesque by comparison. In February he warned a Heritage Foundation gathering that 'until we understand at least a modicum of what animates our enemies, we cannot defend ourselves and we cannot contain our enemies.' That word – 'contain' – put him on the path to what conservatives have griped most about in the Obama administration's foreign policy: a tendency toward acceptance of global threats instead of a willingness to wipe them out. In the Federalist interview, he sauntered back toward the middle of the road from its tenuous shoulder. 'I support military action against ISIS,' he said of the Islamist terror army, adding that 'if we are to go to war, we should make it brief, succinct and we must fight to win.' He did allow, however, that 'there must be a vote by Congress and a formal declaration of war.' Paul would be the first major-party candidate with roots in Kentucky to run for president since Abraham Lincoln, who was born in a one-room log cabin in the Bluegrass State. He teased his Tuesday announcement over the weekend with a 3-minute YouTube video reprising portions of his February speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C. 'To fix Washington, we can't have business as usual,' Paul says in one clip. 'It's time for a new way. A new set of ideas. A new leader, one you can trust. One who works for you and, above all, it's time for a new president,' OUT OF THE GATE ALREADY: Paul has been making campaign-style stops in the eary primary state of New Hampshire, like this March 21 appearance in the Granite State town of Rochester . WINNER: Paul has won three straight straw polls at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, buoyed by throngs of young libertarians whose views are often at odds with mainline conservatism . The video ends as his CPAC speech did, with boisterous shouts of 'President Paul! President Paul!' from a largely young and libertarian-leaning audience. Sandwiched in the middle, is his problematic slogan: 'On April 7, one leader will stand up to defeat the Washington machine and unleash the American dream.' Paul won a straw-poll of CPAC attendees for the third year in a row. His next big test will be winning support from high-dollar donors. He is expected to focus some of his rhetorical firepower on reforming the IRS with a 'flat' tax system that would eliminate much of America's labyrinthine income tax code in favor of a 5-minute math exercise. The senator also advocates for limiting the length of time members of Congress can serve in Washington, and for criminal justice reform – especially in cases where drug users and low-level traffickers have been sentenced to lengthy mandatory-minimum prison terms. But he has been silent on the two most discussed news stories of the last few weeks. Unlike Cruz, Paul hasn't weighed in on the Indiana and Arkansas religious-freedom laws that caused a gay-rights furor. And his campaign-in-waiting has held its fire on Obama's triumphant proclamations that a nuclear deal with Tehran is all but in the bag.","Paul slogan will underscore a Tuesday presidential campaign launch .

"Two horses have been rescued after one was found being kept in an alleyway so narrow it could not turn around, while the other was chained to the ground. RSPCA inspectors were called to the house after they received numerous calls from residents living nearby in Lawrence Weston, Bristol, who were worried about the animals. Photos taken when they visited show a small horse standing on muddy ground in a passage just over a metre wide, which is blocked at one end with a gate. RSPCA inspectors were called after a horse was seen living in an alleyway so narrow it could not turn round . Another picture shows a horse chained to the ground, with little room to move. The animals are thought to have been kept at the site by the side of a house for around a month and are understood to have been moved on by their owners following warnings from the RSPCA. Andrew Hiles, 65, who lives nearby, said: 'The situation has got worse and worse. 'This has been the case for the last month. It was certainly a cause for much concern. The horses had no way of turning around, and the horse box was just left by the road side. 'Those were some terrible conditions to live in, and it is not like they have a stable or somewhere nice. It has been going on for a while. I would like to know how they even came to own these horses. 'As far as I know, a lot of us had been calling the RSPCA and asking them to do something, but I don't know if that's the case.' They found another horse, which was larger, and was living at the site chained to the muddy ground . The alleyway where the horse was kept is at the bottom of a muddy slope, and the other horse was kept chained to the ground on a grassy area nearby. Both horses were removed on Wednesday after complaints from neighbours and a warning from the RSPCA. But Margaret Hiles, 61, is still worried and added: 'We don't know what has happened to the pair of them, or where they have gone. I don't think the RSPCA has taken them, they have just been moved. The smaller horse was stuck at the base of a muddy garden, trapped in an incredibly narrow alleyway . A spokesman from the RSPCA said: 'We have received calls from concerned members of the public about two horses being kept in a garden in the Lawrence Weston area of Bristol. 'Our inspectors have made several visits to the property to issue advice to the owner to improve the environment in which the horses are being kept. 'We understand the current situation is that the horses have now been moved.'","RSPCA inspectors  called numerous times by worried Bristol residents .

"A house used by five generations of the same family has been put on the market for the first time in 100 years.

A house used by five generations of the same family has been put on the market for the first time in 100 years. It was originally rented by Len and Beatrice Barnes (above) in November 1915 .

But Freda died last December, aged 99, and the younger family members have now moved away. Howard Knott, 70, son of Hilda,  is in charge of selling the house, which is on the market for £164,500. Mr Knott, a retired engineer who now lives with his family in Maldon, Essex, said the house means so much to the family but the decision to sell it was 'inevitable'. He said: 'Freda lived there all of her life. 'I lived there at some point when I was a baby but then we moved nearby to Queens Avenue in Snodland. 'My grandfather's brother Roger lived in it for some years between the First and Second World Wars, so there were three adults and four children living in one property with no bathroom and no electricity.'

"Andreas Lubitz appears to have researched suicide methods, cockpit door security and medical treatment before crashing the Germanwings plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board . Killer pilot Andreas Lubitz researched suicide methods and cockpit door security before crashing his Germanwings plane into the French Alps, it emerged last night. German prosecutors said an examination of a tablet computer found at his apartment revealed he had recently used internet search terms such as cockpit doors and their security, and suicide methods. The revelations came hours after it was reported that Lubitz told doctors he was on sick leave rather than flying. It also emerged that the 27-year-old was prescribed an anti-anxiety drug so strong doctors have to warn patients of the increased risk of suicide. People who use Lorazapam are advised not to drive a car, let alone fly a commercial jetliner. Medical experts say it can also increase the risk of self-harm at the start of treatment. Prosecutors yesterday announced that the second black box from the flight had been found. It was said to be in a good condition and was likely to yield more information. Investigators believe Lubitz locked his captain out of the A320’s cockpit on March 24 and deliberately crashed the plane, killing all 150 people on board – possibly because of suicidal tendencies or fears he may lose his pilot’s licence. Citing sources from the investigation, German newspaper Bild reported that he sometimes lied to doctors that he was off work and wanted to get better so he could fly again. It said he gave them information about his job as a pilot and his employer, Germanwings, but concealed that he was still working. He was apparently more stable in recent years, but in the past few weeks had reportedly seen doctors three times for depression and an eye doctor over fears he was losing his sight. Bild said it discovered that he was prescribed drugs, including the sedative Lorazepam, to combat to range of disorders. Evidence: Police carry a computer out of the house Lubitz shared with his parents in Montabaur, Germany, two days after the disaster. Investigators have also found a tablet computer which revealed a search history from March 16 to March 23 that included medical treatment, suicide methods and cockpit door security .

The first black box voice recorder from the Germanwings flight that was recovered last week and revealed Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane. The second has now also been retrieved from the wreckage . Families of those killed in the Alps crash  are likely to receive vastly different payouts depending on their nationality, where they bought the ticket and how much they earned, lawyers said today. Claims can be made either where the ticket was purchased, in the home country of the airline, at courts in the passenger's destination or in the passenger's home country. But in air crashes, the amounts awarded for pain and suffering vary by country even though they may all have shared the same fate. Victims from the U.S. tend to receive higher payouts, followed by Europeans and Asians. Lawyer James Healy-Pratt at Stewarts Law LLP, which is advising families of those killed in the Malaysian Air disasters last year, said British parents who lose an adult child can expect compensation of around £20,000, while American parents could expect £1.5million. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said on Wednesday that the airline would provide assistance to the families of those killed 'for as long as help is needed'. Investigators have found mobile phones amid the wreckage but they are yet to be thoroughly examined . Lorazepam belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines which  treat a variety of conditions including anxiety, sleeping problems and other mental health disorders. Patients with psychiatric issues are warned it could lead to changes in behaviour. Worryingly, this can include an increased risk of suicide, particularly in the early stages of treatment. Users are also advised to get at least seven hours continuous sleep or it can cause memory loss  from the time you wake up to the time the effects of the drug have worn off. Due to its strong soporific effect, it can hamper your ability to drive or operate machinery. Source: NHS Choices . A pharmacologist said: ‘It is prescribed to combat anxiety, tension and sleep disorders. Whether you should fly a plane or even drive is questionable.’ Doctors had recently found no sign that Lubitz intended to hurt himself or others. But he was receiving treatment from neurologists and psychiatrists who had signed him off sick from work a number of times, including on the day of the crash. German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt yesterday announced the setting up of the task force that would look at, among other things, whether extra checks on the mental health of pilots should be introduced. Investigators continue to deny reports that mobile phone footage from on board the jet had emerged. They say they have found phones amid the wreckage but the devices have yet to be thoroughly examined. Special mountain troops are continuing to search for personal belongings. French forensics experts confirmed yesterday they had identified DNA strands from all 150 victims of the crash. Rescue workers examine wreckage at the site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 crash in the French Alps . Andreas Lubitz exploited post-9/11 safety mechanisms to carry out his murderous plan. He waited for his captain, Patrick Sondenheimer, to leave the flight deck and go to the toilet before commanding the Airbus A320 to descend. Once out of the cockpit, the door locked automatically. Ironically, this auto-lock feature, which led to Lubitz having sole control of the plane, was introduced as a way of improving flight safety in the wake of 9/11. Scroll down for video . The Airbus A-320 is fitted with a safety system, pictured, to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck . Lubitz was sitting in this cockpit, pictured, when he commanded the jet to crash into the Alps at 400mph . The Airbus A320 is fitted with a locking mechanism to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck while the aircraft is in flight. The door was also specially strengthened, to prevent someone from being able to barge their way through. The safety systems were improved in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks where hijackers were able to gain access to the cockpit and take over the aircraft. Access to the cockpit door on the Germanwings Airbus A320 (like the one above) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking . In normal flight, the door to the flight is closed and locked. Cabin crew can use a code and gain access to the flight deck. Entry is controlled by the flight crew, in case of a possible hijack attempt. The Cockpit Door Locking System (CDLS) according to the flight manual 'provides a means of electrically locking and unlocking the cockpit door'. The CDLS is located in the central pedestal between both pilots and has a toggle switch which controls the door. They also have a CCTV camera so they can see who is seeking access, and if they are under any form of duress. Pilots can restrict access to the flight deck although cabin crew can gain entry in an emergency. However, this emergency access can be over-ridden by the pilot for between five to 20 minutes. The limited time to keep the door closed is itself a safety feature, in case the flight crew become incapacitated. After the predetermined time, the keypad on the outside of the cockpit door will become operational again, unless the pilot actively restricts access again. Also the cockpit door has several other safety features in case of a sudden decompression which will cause the door to open. The pilot has to flick one simple switch, pictured,  to lock the cabin door for between five and 20 minutes .","Cyber experts reconstructed searches on pilot's tablet from March 16 to 23 .

"The 15-year-old son of a Canadian diplomat plans to plead not guilty if charges are brought against him after an alleged drug deal in Miami turned into a gun battle that left his older brother dead and landed him in custody, where the teenager allegedly threatened to kill a police officer. Curt Obront, the lawyer for Miami Consul general Roxanne Dube’s surviving son, Marc Wabafiyebazu, called it a tragic case. Dube's ex-husband and the boy's father, Germano Wabafiyebazu, has said his 17-year-old son, Jean Wabafiyebazu , was killed when he went into a house to buy marijuana Monday, and that police arrested Marc. Scroll down for video . Jean Wabafiyebazu (left), 17, was killed and his brother Marc (right), 15, has been arrested after a gunfight erupted during a drug deal on Monday . High-ranking official: Their mother is Roxanne Dubé (above), the recently appointed Canadian Consul General in Miami . Germano Wabafiyebazu said his sons borrowed their mother's personal car, which has diplomatic license plates, to drive to the house but told their mother they were just going for a drive. He said he was told that Marc rushed into the house after hearing a gunshot. It was not clear whether Marc Wabafiyebazu would be charged as a juvenile or an adult but he is due in juvenile court on April 8. Authorities say he would not be protected by diplomatic immunity. Dube and her family, meanwhile, expressed condolences to the family of Joshua Wright, the other deceased victim, and said they just want to be there for the younger son. ‘Your grief is our grief,’ she said. ‘We can only hope that, in time, we will find common purpose towards diminishing the causes of such violent crimes. For now, we just want to be there for Marc, our incredibly caring son who loved his brother very much, and to say goodbye, ever so tenderly and quietly to Jean, our love.’ The Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office confirmed that another man, 19-year-old Anthony Rodriguez, was charged with second-degree murder and marijuana possession with intent to sell for his alleged role. Crime scene: In this photo taken on Monday, March 30, 2015, Miami-Dade police detectives work at a crime scene in Miami, involving the two teenage sons of Roxanne Dube, Canada's counsel general in Maimi . Troubled youth: The siblings' father said 17-year-old Jean (left and right) struggled with substance abuse . The Rodriguez arrest report says a second man, identified as 17-year-old Joshua Wright, was shot to death inside the house. Prosecutors also said Rodriguez was wounded in the arm in the shootout. The police report also quotes unidentified witnesses as saying Rodriguez brought two pounds of marijuana to the house and began to negotiate. ‘During the negotiations, both deceased victims became involved in an exchange of gunfire,’ the report says. Anthony Rodriguez (above) was arrested on charges of felony murder and drug possession . According to the Miami Herald, police believe the Wabafiyebazu siblings were armed with guns as they tried to rob a group of men during a drug deal at a home in the Coral Way area. The boys had reportedly agreed to purchase two pounds of marijuana at a cost of $5,000, and driven to the house under the guise of making said purchase in their mother's BMW with diplomatic plates. Police claim that their plan was to then rob the drug dealers. Gunfire broke out soon after they entered, and Jean and Joshua Wright were killed, while Anthony Rodriguez was wounded. Both Marc and Rodriguez were arrested under a Florida law that says anyone who participates in a violent felony that results in death can be charged with murder. In addition, Marc Wabafiyebazu faces charges of threatening a police officer while in custody, according to a separate police report. The boy is alleged to have said ‘he was going to kill (a detective) and that he would shoot him in the head.’ A second man was reportedly with Jean when he went to rob the drug dealers, though his identity is not known at this time. Dubé, a one-time Fulbright scholar, was appointed to her new position in November, but only arrived in Miami in February. She was previously Canada's ambassador to Zimbabwe from 2005 to 2008 and also served as a staff member for a Canadian Liberal cabinet minister for more than a decade. Bloody aftermath: The boys and a friend had driven to a house, pictured here with blood on the floor, to reportedly purchase two pounds of marijuana for $5,000 . Gunfire erupted soon after they entered, though Marc was in the car at the time . John Babcock, a spokesman for Canada's foreign department, said Louise Leger has been named acting Head of Mission on an interim basis. The boys’ father, Germano Wabafiyebazu, said he and Dube were divorced a few years ago and that their son Jean struggled with substance abuse. He previously told Global News that he does not think Marc had anything to do with this tragedy, and that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also said the boys kept to themselves, and did not have much of a social life. 'My wife told me they didn’t go out,' he said. 'They went to school, went home, went to school.'","Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, plans to plead not guilty if charged with felony in connection to Monday's deadly shooting .

"The Tories today launched an extraordinary attack on Ed Miliband, claiming that after stabbing his brother in the back he now wants to do the same to Britain. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon claimed the Labour leader was willing to trade away Britain's nuclear deterrent in order to secure power in a backroom deal with the Scottish Nationalists. Mr Miliband said the Conservative campaign had 'descended into the gutter' and claimed David Cameron 'should be ashamed'. Deeply personal: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon  claimed Ed Miliband is 'so desperate' for power he is willing to weaken UK defences to win support from SNP . He confirmed that a Conservative government would go ahead with four new Trident nuclear missile submarines to replace the existing fleet, at a cost of £100billion. Labour rushed to say it was also backing four submarines, despite Ed Balls last month saying he was examining the idea of cutting it to three. Doubt has been cast on Labour's commitment to the deterrent because Mr Miliband could be forced to rely on the SNP support to form a government. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that scrapping the Trident missile system, which is based in Scotland, would be a red line for her propping up a Labour government in Westminster. Mr Fallon launched a highly personal attack on Mr Miliband, saying it was an issue of trust and leadership. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We need to be absolutely clear when we come to this decision in the next parliament. 'We saw in that leadership election just what he would do to get into power. We saw what he did to his own brother. We need to know what he would do. 'We can't be sure what kind of backstairs deal he is likely to do with the SNP ... that is the uncertainty. We have seen what he is prepared to do to get into power.' In a speech today, he said: 'Ed Miliband stabbed his own brother in the back to become Labour leader. Now he is willing to stab the United Kingdom in the back to become prime minister.' Mr Fallon will insist the Tories would 'never' do a deal on the future of Trident in another coalition – and that a man prepared to stab his brother in the back to win the Labour leadership cannot be trusted not to risk the nation's security. 'Nicola Sturgeon could not be clearer. She has told Ed Miliband that scrapping Trident – our country's vital nuclear deterrent – is a red line she will not cross,' the Defence Secretary will say. 'If he wants the keys to No 10, he must abandon any plans to renew our current Vanguard ballistic missile submarines. 'The SNP's childlike world view would sacrifice the long-term security of the UK. The nuclear deterrent protects all of Britain, and the SNP represents a separatist threat that would dangerously weaken our collective defence. Britain doesn't pay ransoms and the Conservatives would never bow to demands from Scottish separatists. Vow: The attack comes as the Tories pledge to build a £100billion fleet of four new Trident submarines . Mr Miliband brushed off the criticism, insisting he had 'got use to' Conservative attacks. Speaking at an event in London, the Labour leader added: 'The Conservative Party can throw what they like at me, they can make all the personal attacks on me that they want to, but I've got use to it. 'And you know what? I'm resilient. And I'm resilient for one reason alone - because I'm fighting for the British people in this campaign. 'I'm fighting for the kind of country the British people want.' Mr Miliband said that over the first two weeks of the Conservative campaign, it was clear 'they have nothing positive to say about the country'. The Labour leader said: 'I think David Cameron should be ashamed. He's got nothing positive to say about the future of the country, he's got no forward vision for the country. And he sends out his minions, like Michael Fallon, to engage in desperate smears. 'I think decent Conservatives right across our country, decent Conservative MPs, decent Conservative party members, decent people right across Britain, will say `Come on, we're better than this kind of politics'. There is mounting Labour panic at polls suggesting the rampant SNP is on course for a landslide north of the border. Such a political earthquake would be likely to leave the SNP holding the balance of power at Westminster and determining who is in government for the first time in the 300-year history of the Union. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander told the same programme that the Labour Party had made it 'crystal clear' it supports the renewal of Trident. He said: 'This is desperate stuff from a rattled campaign that spent yesterday defending tax avoidance and is now descending into politics of the gutter. 'This is not up for negotiation with the SNP or with any other party. I don't know how I can say it plainer than that. 'We are absolutely committed to a continuous at-sea deterrent. The Tories are like a wounded, cornered animal at the moment.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that scrapping the Trident missile system, which is based in Scotland, would be a red line for her propping up a Labour government in Westminster . Diane Abbott, who used Twitter to question the £100billion cost of the weapons system . Labour leader Ed Miliband faces a challenge from dozens of Labour candidates calling for Trident to be scrapped. Among them is Diane Abbott, who used Twitter to question the £100billion cost of the weapons system. 'How exactly does submarine system designed for Cold War era combat new threats from international terrorism?' she asked. 'Renewing Trident could cost £100 billion. Would pay for: 150,000 new nurses; 1.5 million affordable homes; 2 million jobs & much more.' Labour CND lists 52 candidates standing for election on May 7 calling for Trident to be scrapped. They call for 'a Labour Government that delivers on disarmament of the UK's nuclear weapons, as we are bound to under the Non-Proliferation Treaty'. Both Labour and the SNP have ruled out a formal coalition, but left the door open to a looser deal that would see Mr Miliband in power even if he wins fewer seats than the Tories. Earlier this year, Mr Miliband suggested he might back a cheaper Trident replacement than the current plan, estimated at £100billion for four submarines at about £5billion each, and annual running costs of £3billion over the subs' lifetime of about 30 years. Today's Tory pledge puts Labour in a difficult position, since ruling out any compromise on Trident would infuriate the SNP and many voters in Scotland, where support for the system's renewal is lower than in the rest of the UK. Mr Fallon will add today: 'It is a sign of his weakness he has failed to rule out a deal. Voters can only conclude he would be prepared to trade Britain's security just to get his hands on the keys to Downing Street. 'The future of our country's security will be on the ballot paper too. There will be a clear choice between a Conservative government that will put our national security first. Or Ed Miliband, a man so desperate for power he is ready to barter away our nuclear deterrent in a backroom deal with the SNP.' Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Sir Nick Harvey said he did not see any need for Trident to be patrolling the seas 24/7 while the UK has 'no known nuclear adversary'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the nuclear deterrent was 'worth retaining', but said two submarines would provide a 'perfectly meaningful deterrent', although not on a 'continuous basis'. Retaining three submarines would enable the UK to have a 'continuous at-sea deterrence', he added. Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party, said: 'This latest round of Tory speculation doesn't conceal the fact that the Labour Party is committed to renewing our multibillion pound nuclear weapons system. 'The truth is that the Labour leadership has made it clear that they will prioritise spending £100billion on a cold war relic - rather than investing in the schools and hospitals that this country so desperately needs. 'Only one party is standing up to Trident across the UK. Green MPs will put pressure on the Government to ensure that a proper debate is had over Trident.'","Defence Secretary Michael Fallon launches personal attack on Miliband .

"After two months and more than 100 witnesses, the prosecution has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez. The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.","Prosecutors have called more than 100 witnesses to testify .

"Taxes on earnings went up by nearly £1,900 under 13 years of Labour, figures have revealed – as George Osborne warned ‘they’ll do it all again’. The Chancellor said Labour had ‘form’ on jacking up income tax and National Insurance and insisted Ed Balls and Ed Miliband would do the same if given the chance after May 7. ‘Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have done it all before – and they would do it all over again,’ he said. Scroll down for video . Chancellor  George Osborne (left) has warned that taxes will rise under Labour and said the party had 'form' on rising taxes. He said: ‘Ed Miliband and Ed Balls (right) have done it all before – and they would do it all again' Today, as he begins a tour of all four nations of the UK, David Cameron will say there is just one month to save Britain from the ‘disaster’ of a Miliband government. Yesterday the Prime Minister stepped up his attack on tax by insisting Labour was planning to drag nearly one million more people into the 40p tax rate. And in a pointed attack on his coalition partners, he dismissed the Lib Dems as being among the ‘minor parties’ making ‘more and more strange claims’. Mr Cameron said voters would pay a ‘heavy price’ for a Labour government which would be ‘looking in your payslip’ for tax. He also condemned Labour’s plans to abolish the married couples tax allowance, which came into effect yesterday. Speaking in Leeds, Ed Balls said the tax break – worth £200 a year to couples who have tied the knot – was ‘perverse’. Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls also repeated his claim – denied outright by the Tories – that they would raise VAT. He said a Tory government would mean ‘millions paying more while millionaires pay less’ as he accused the party of planning to cut the top rate of income tax for those earning over £150,000. Meanwhile a major spat erupted between the Tories and Lib Dems, as Danny Alexander was accused of inventing an extraordinary claim about a senior Tory. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury claimed that during negotiations for the 2012 Budget, a Tory minister told him: ‘You take care of the workers and we’ll take care of the bosses’. Today, as he begins a tour of all four nations of the UK, David Cameron (left) will say there is just one month to save Britain from the ‘disaster’ of a Miliband (right) government, which would see voters 'pay a heavy price' He refused to say who it was. Mr Alexander made the comments, in the Independent newspaper, as his party attempted to claw back credit for cutting the personal rate of income tax from the Tories. But Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC’s World at One the claim was ‘complete rubbish’. He added: ‘The reason why he wouldn’t actually tell you who he thinks said it is he knows that no one said it.’ Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused Mr Osborne of being a ‘very dangerous man’ because of his cuts plans. Mr Cameron dismissed the remarks, saying: ‘You are going to hear minor parties just making more and more strange claims to say “look at me, look at what I’m saying”.’ Mr Osborne released figures, by the independent House of Commons Library, showing the extent of tax and National Insurance rises under Labour from 1997 to 2010. Combined taxes on income went up by an average of £1,895 across all households, he said. They rose among every income group, with those earning £15,500 hit the hardest. He repeated his claim Labour is planning a £3,000 tax bombshell, saying: ‘We’re publishing figures that show Labour’s got form on tax.’ Mr Cameron, who will visit England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in a single day today, will say there is ‘one month to save our economy from the disaster of an Ed Miliband government’.","George Osborne has warned that taxes will rise under Labour Government .

"An Indian man rescued from Wellington Harbour by two brave girls teenage girls has died in New Zealand. Boobesh Palani, 26, passed away at Wellington Hospital with his friends by his side, police told the New Zealand Herald. Mr Palani’s identity was unknown at the time he was dragged from the harbour by two brave teenagers so police decided to post a picture of the him on news websites in the hopes the public could help identify him. Police released images of Mr Palani lying in his hospital bed in the hopes an appeal to the public would help identify the man . Mr Palani, a 26-year-old student from India, was known to a New Zealander travelling in Sri Lanka who saw his photo online and told the police of his name. His family and friends said they were grateful the police were able to identify Mr Palani so they had the chance to be with him in his last moments. ‘This is a tragedy but thanks to the public's help we were able to establish Mr Palani's identity which meant his friends were at his side for his final few days,’ police said. Mr Palani, who was studying in New Zealand, was rescued from shark infested waters at Burdan's Gate, Eastbourne, about 10.30pm on Monday by two teenage girls after they heard his screams for help. Without thinking, Cousins Kelly McKay, 15, and Payge Olds, 16 rushed 300m down the beach to the scene where Payge managed to undress the fastest and swim 70 metres out to sea to rescue the  man. Cousins Kelly McKay, 15 (left), and Payge Olds, 16 (right) risked their own lives on Monday night when they attempted to save a drowning man in Wellington Harbour . Mr Palani was surrounded by his family and friends during his last days after a successful appeal to the public to help name him . 'We all thought it was a prank at first because this kind of thing doesn't really happen,' Payge, from Lower Hutt in Wellington told Daily Mail Australia. The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek,  who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it. He saw the man floating face down in the water unconscious. Mr Derek, who was unable to swim, alerted the group to the man in the water, with the hope that one of them would be a capable swimmer. 'I was the last one there and everyone else was undressed and ready to jump in the water but no one had jumped in yet because none of them are comfortable swimmers so I ended up just stripping off to my underwear and then jumping in,' Payge said. The two teenagers were helping their friend tow his car after it got stuck on the beach . The incident happened near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne, Wellington Harbour, at 10:30pm on Monday night . Payge said she is not a confident swimmer and didn't think about the shark-infested waters when she leaped into the harbour but she knew that the man's life depended on her. 'I wasn't expecting to get that far,' she said of the distance she swam out to sea. 'At the time I didn't really think about it. I just thought you know what there's a man out there suffering, I need to get to him and help him. 'Now I'm really proud of myself and I'm happy that I was there.' Police said the man was dressed but had no identificatoin on him, The Dominion Post reported. 'Unfortunately, due to his condition, police has been unable to speak with him and he was not carrying any identification that could help us find out who he is,' Detective Sergeant Grant Corroll said, appealing for anyone who recognises him to contact police. 'Given his critical stauts, time is of the essence,' he said. Even the murky water and it's inhabitants didn't stop the courageous teenager from jumping head-first into the harbour. Payge (right) said she is not a confident swimmer and didn't think about the shark-infested waters when she leaped into the harbour but she knew that the man's life depended on her . 'There's eels and multiple other things in there,' she said. 'Sometimes we do get sharks and whales  and stingrays but I didn't really think about that. Well I did but I tried to avoid that thought.' Two men, who were sitting on the rocks on the harbours edge, shone torches on the water so Payge would be able to see where she was going. The teenager said she was terrified she would be too late and that she would lose the man in the dark. 'My worst fear was that he wasn't there any more and that I was just too late,' she said. The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek, who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it . 'Eventually I came across him and he was kind of floating. He was sinking but he was just on the surface. 'If I has been any longer I would have completely lost him and I would not have been able to find him.' 'I got there and I couldn't lift him, he was so much bigger than me,' Payge said. Payge  began to panic and started screaming for someone to help her. After eight minutes, the group got the man back to shore and 15-year-old Kelly McKay(right) began performing CPR until paramedics arrived and took over . 17-year-old Logan Mason and a 25-year-old man swam out to Payge and assisted her in bringing the man back to shore. 'I got his feet out of the water but then I had to yell and get all the manly men to come and help me because I couldn't do it myself,' she said. After eight minutes, the group got the man back to shore and 15-year-old Kelly McKay began performing CPR until paramedics arrived and took over. 'My cousin Kelly did CPR she did so good. We're really proud of each other,' Payge said. 'I don't consider myself a hero, I just consider myself human because it's pretty much what anyone would do I thought.' Senior Sergeant Andre Kowalczyk of New Zealand Police said that the actions of the two girls is to be applauded . Senior Sergeant Andre Kowalczyk of New Zealand Police said that the actions of the two girls is to be applauded.

"The Red Cross hopes to bring vital medical supplies and aid workers into Yemen  after receiving approval from the Saudi-led military coalition, an ICRC spokeswoman said. The aid agency has been negotiating for a week to deliver life-saving supplies and equipment to Yemen, where the coalition has conducted 11 days of air strikes against Iran-backed Shi'ite Houthis. The coalition now controls the country's ports and air space. The UN last week said that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen. On Saturday it called for a 24-hour humanitarian pause in the conflict to allow aid to reach people cut off by air strikes and to save the lives of 'streams of wounded'. But hopes of getting aid into the country by tomorrow are fading, as they seek clearance from Arab states waging the air strikes and hunt for planes prepared to fly to Yemen.

'Dialogue for peace': Members of Pakistan's civil society chant slogans against the Saudi-led coalition targeting Shiite rebels in Yemen, during a demonstration, in Lahore . 'We are still working on getting the plane to [the Yemeni capital] Sanaa. It's a bit difficult with the logistics because there are not that many companies or cargo planes willing to fly into a conflict zone,' said Marie Claire Feghali, a Red Cross spokesperson. The ICRC is aiming to get 48 tonnes of medical supplies into Yemen by plane. It is also trying to get staff by boat from Djibouti to Aden, but fighting has complicated efforts. Earlier today in Riyadh, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said arrangements had been made for at least one Red Cross aid delivery yesterday morning, but the ICRC - which deploys 300 aid workers to the Arab peninsula's poorest country - had pulled out of the arrangement. 'There was a trip fixed for them at nine this morning ... They informed us, after the time was set, of a request to delay the flight,' Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri told reporters yesterday, adding that this was because the company from which they had chartered the plane could not fly to Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition says it has set up a special coordination body for aid deliveries and asked NGOs and governments to work with it to ensure humanitarian aid can be brought into Yemen and foreign nationals can be evacuated safely. The news comes on the same day as war-weary Pakistan began talks to enter the conflict after its staunch Saudi allies issued an urgent request the country join the expanding coalition of Sunni Muslim nations fighting Shiite rebels in the country. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced the special session of parliament last week, saying any decision on intervention could only come after proper debate. However, Pakistan's political leaders - including former cricketer Imran Khan, the head of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) party - are calling for diplomacy and a negotiated settlement, saying it does not want to get involved in any conflict that would inflame sectarian tensions.

Since Saudi Arabia, the Gulf's main Sunni Muslim power, . asked Sunni-majority Pakistan to join a Saudi-led military . coalition that began conducting air strikes last month against . largely Shi'ite Houthi forces in Yemen, Sharif has hedged his . bets. He has said repeatedly he will defend any threat to Saudi . Arabia's 'territorial integrity' without defining what action . such a threat might provoke. 'They're looking to satisfy Saudi expectations at a minimal . level,' said Arif Rafiq, a Washington-based adjunct scholar with . the Middle East Institute. 'They're unlikely to be part of any . meaningful action inside Yemen. Maybe they will reinforce the . (Saudi) border.' Twelve days of fighting has not only killed hundreds of people, but cut off water and electricity and led UNICEF to warn Yemen is heading towards a humanitarian disaster. For the people trapped between the warring sides, the arrival of the ICRC could not come soon enough. Street fighting and heavy shelling have torn through the streets of In Aden - the last bastion of support for the Saudi-backed Hadi - for days. Sixty people were killed in heavy fighting on Sunday alone, according to reports. Residents claim a foreign warship had shelled Houthi positions on the outskirts, but a spokesman for the coalition in Riyadh said its vessels were helping civilian evacuations, not shelling the Houthis. Nevertheless, food, water and electricity shortages have mounted across the city, where combat has shut ports and cut land routes from the city. 'How are we supposed to live without water and electricity?' pleaded Fatima, a housewife walking through the city streets with her young children. She clutched a yellow plastic jerry can, like dozens of other residents on the streets and in queues seeking water from public wells or mosque faucets after supplies at home dried up. In Dahlea, just north of the city, air strikes hit a local government compound and a military base on its outskirts, which were both taken over by Houthis. Residents said buildings were on fire and reported loud explosions. But militia fighters said coalition planes also dropped supplies - the first time they had done so outside Aden - including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, rifles, ammunition, telecommunications equipment and night goggles. Residents near al-Anad air base, once home to U.S. military personnel fighting a covert drone war with al Qaeda in Yemen, said dozens of Houthi and allied fighters were withdrawing north after the site was bombed by coalition jets. Meanwhile, at least eight people were killed in an air strike before dawn in the suburbs of the northern city of Saadah, home of the Houthi movement which spread from its mountain stronghold to take over the capital Sanaa six months ago. A Houthi spokesman said the dead included women and children. Local officials said strikes also hit air defence and coastal military units near the Red Sea port of Hodaida, and targets on the outskirts of Aden. They also hit a bridge on the road south to Aden, apparently trying to block the Houthis from sending reinforcements to their fighters in the city.

But joining the Saudi-led coalition could inflame a . sectarian conflict at home where around a fifth of the . population is Shi'ite and attacks on Shi'ites are increasing, . further destabilising the nuclear-armed nation of 180 million . people.

The Iranian foreign minister will visit Pakistan this week. A US citizen has been killed in a mortar attack in Yemen after he traveled to the country in an attempt to extricate his pregnant wife and daughter from the civil war there and fly them  to California, family say. Jamal al-Labani was an Oakland gas station owner, his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told KPIX-TV. According to Alazzani, al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Alazzani told KPIX al-Labani was trying to get his family out of the war-torn Middle Eastern nation and take them to Oakland - but he couldn't because the US has withdrawn its diplomatic staff and the country has shut down most airports.

Rebels from the Houthi Islamist group have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. They have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition of mainly Gulf air forces. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia launched the air strikes on March 26 in an attempt to turn back the Iran-allied Shi'ite Houthis, who already control Yemen's capital Sanaa, and restore some of Hadi's crumbling authority. The air and sea campaign has targeted Houthi convoys, missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the Houthis deny Saudi accusations that they are armed by Tehran.","Aid agency received approval from Saudi-led coalition to enter Yemen .

"An elderly widow has been left distraught after her pet dog suffered third degree burns following a routine operation. Marina Lyons, 80, took her beloved dog Rosie to the PDSA PetAid Hospital in Hull for an operation to remove her spleen after a scan detected a tumour. The operation, carried out three weeks ago, was successful but when Marina returned home with the ten-year-old Lhasa Apso dog, she noticed lots of bruising on the its back. Marina Lyons, 80, discovered third degree burns on her dog Rosie's back after taking the Lhasa Apso for surgery to remove her spleen due to a suspected tumour . When Ms Lyons discovered bruising on the dog's back she asked the vet about it, who told her it was from the operation. Not satisfied, she took the dog for a second opinion, when the burns were discovered . Marina said: 'After we discovered the bruising we rang the PDSA and they advised us to bring Rosie in for them to have a look at her. 'The vet told us they had put her on a heat pad to aid her recovery, which had led to a burn on her side. They said the bruising was from the operation. 'They then told us they didn't need to see Rosie for another four weeks.' Not satisfied with the first vet's explanation, Mrs Lyons took Rosie to Vets4Pets in Anlaby for a second opinion. Marina said: 'The vet there was shocked. He wanted to see the extent of her bruising and decided to shave Rosie's hair on her back. 'It was when he shaved her hair he discovered third degree burns on her back. We were horrified.' Rosie had to have treatment to remove dead skin from the burn, and is expected to have a skin graft. It is thought the injuries were caused by a heat blanket used during her recovery from spleen surgery . Rosie had a further operation on Tuesday to remove the dead skin tissue from the burn. A skin graft is also planned for next week. Marina said: 'When you take a sick dog to the vets you do expect the operation to be a success, which it has, but you do not expect the dog to end up like this.' A PDSA spokeswoman confirmed they had received a complaint regarding Rosie's treatment. She said: 'We take all complaints of this nature very seriously and have launched a full investigation. 'While we cannot discuss individual cases due to client confidentiality, we will be in direct contact with Mrs Lyons during the investigation.'","Marina Lyons, 80, took pet dog Rosie for operation to remove her spleen .

"The biggest pension reforms in a century have been met with confusion as customers as young as 23 try to cash in their retirement savings. Pension firms said Britons remained baffled about how the radical changes worked, with many unaware of age restrictions or tax implications. Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity. And yesterday, the first people to cash in their pots began to receive their money. Scroll down for video . Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity . The Government had said that everyone over the age of 55 who wanted to take part in the new pension freedoms would be given a free half-hour session of guidance but just 300 advisers are available (file picture) But one major provider reported that customers in their 20s had been calling up to withdraw their retirement savings – unaware they were three decades too young. Others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once. The confusion was not helped by a decision to pull the plug on television adverts promoting the Government's pensions helpline. The Treasury said that, ahead of the election, it had switched to a 'low level' advertising campaign for its Pension Wise guidance service and dropped its television adverts for almost two months. 'Purdah' rules bar Government advertising campaigns before a general election so that it does not promote the cause of a certain political party. But experts said barring TV adverts which raise awareness of the pension changes would punish consumers, some of whom were already confused by the changes. Experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable  if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over-55s can cash in their pensions and spend them  instead of being forced to buy an annuity (file image) David Trenner, of Intelligent Pensions, said it was 'crazy to stop advertising Pension Wise under Purdah rules', while Catriona Standingford, who runs a financial training firm, asked on Twitter: Shouldn't the consumer/taxpayer come first?.' The Treasury said the service will only be advertised through print and digital advertising for April and most of May. Pensions firm Fidelity Worldwide Investment said it had taken 1,300 calls about the pension freedoms in the last week alone. But several calls a day have been from people under-55 trying to access their cash, including a 23-year-old who mistakenly believed they could 'get hold of their pot now'. Richard Parkin, of Fidelity, said: 'Misunderstandings exist around when you can access your funds. 'Since the new freedoms were announced, we've received a steady number of calls from people under the age of 55 who think they can access their funds under the new rules.'","Pension firms said Britons remain baffled about how radical changes work .

"Investigators are trying to determine why a man shot his wife and two young sons before killing himself at the family's home in a quiet Oklahoma suburb this week. Sudheer Khamitkar, 42, shot his 38-year-old wife, Smita Haval Khamitkar, and their sons Arnav Khamitkar, 10 and Arush Khamitkar, 6, in separate rooms at their Tulsa home, police said. The bodies were found on Wednesday as officers conducted a welfare check requested by the mother's employer after she failed to show up for work or call in sick for two days. 'Right now we still don't know the motive behind the murder-suicide,' said Sergeant Shane Tuell. Gunned down: Smita Haval Khamitkar, pictured with one of her sons, was shot by her husband along with their two boys - aged six and 10 - before he turned the gun on himself. Their bodies were found on Wednesday . On Thursday, Tuell said the father had recently changed jobs and that detectives would interview his current and former employers in an effort to learn if he was having personal troubles. There was no indication of forced entry and no suspects are being sought, authorities said. A backdoor was unlocked and a handgun was found near the father's body. 'The evidence indicates that the father shot and killed the children and the wife before turning the gun on himself,' said homicide Sergeant Dave Walker in a news release. 'There is evidence of multiple gunshots throughout the house. All the bodies were found in different rooms throughout the house.' Sergeant Walker added that the family had lived at the home for 10 years and there had been no previous history of domestic violence or criminal activity at the home, Newson6 reported. Questions: Tulsa police gather at the front entrance of a home as they investigate after a father shot dead his wife, their children and himself in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Wednesday. They are still searching for a motive . Tulsa police captain Matt McCord said the bodies may have been in the house for 'as many as two days' Mrs Khamitkar, whose Facebook page indicates she was originally from Pune in India, had worked as an Android app developer for American Airlines. 'Smita Khamitkar was a member of the American Airlines team in Tulsa for nearly five years and we're deeply saddened by the news of her passing,' the company said in a statement. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Smita's family, friends and colleagues during this very difficult time.' Online profiles for Mr Khamitkar show he had trained and worked as a mechanical engineer for companies including Oseco, a relief systems company, and Wellman Products Group, a company that develops car parts. He had also secured multiple patents in previous years for new types of rupture discs - a device that prevents equipment or a system from being damaged by too much pressure. Neighbors said they were shocked by the events and called the area safe. Most every property in the neighborhood has a large fence, so children can play or swim in privacy, though some play basketball in the driveway or at a cul-de-sac. 'I love this neighborhood. It's very quiet here,' Mercedes Perez told The Associated Press. Police investigate the scene after the bodies of four people were found following a welfare check . Her husband, Vinicio Perez, said he would sometimes see two children playing and bouncing around in the front yard of the home where the bodies were found. 'I'm shocked,' he said. 'This place should be a place surrounded by security.' Stephen Wiseman lived next door to the family for almost ten years. He said: They were wonderful, the most kind [and] gentle people you'd ever meet. Our kids played with them all day on Saturday, and … we saw the kids on Sunday.' Another neighbor reported hearing noises at the house late on Monday.","Sudheer Khamitkar, shot his wife, Smita Haval Khamitkar, and their sons Arnav Khamitkar, 10 and Arush Khamitkar, six, earlier this week .

"David Cameron was upstaged by a six-year-old school girl today after trying to unveil a new Tory education policy. The Prime Minister visited a primary school near Bolton to unveil the party's latest proposal to improve education standards, after announcing that under a future Tory government children who achieve poor SATs results will be forced to resit them in secondary school. As Mr Cameron tried to help school pupil Lucy Howarth read a story about 'Prince Ronald' the youngster pulled a series of funny faces before resting her head on the table after struggling with a tricky passage. Scroll down for video . David Cameron helps with a reading lesson with pupils Lucy Howarth, 6, and Will Spibey, 5, left, during a visit to Sacred Heart RC primary school in Westhoughton near Bolton today . The PM wants to see children who get poor Sats results  forced to resit them in secondary school . The Prime Minister shared a joke  with six-year-old Lucy at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Primary School near Bolton . The Prime Minister appeared completely taken with the youngster who showed no signs of being fazed by his attendance. Mr Cameron had planned to use the classroom visit to unveil his plan, which he said was intended to inject 'more rigour and zero tolerance of failure and mediocrity' in schools. The resit plan would mean 100,000 pupils taking a new test in English and maths during their first year after leaving primary school. The proposal would be implemented next year and is aimed at making sure that pupils have not already fallen too far behind at the beginning of secondary school. Pupils who did not get good grades in the Sats tests taken by 11-year-olds in primary school would have to retake a test during their first year after moving up to secondary school. In last year's tests, 79 per cent of pupils achieved the expected grades in reading, writing and maths. The Tories claim that, too often, pupils who have slipped behind by this stage never catch up. Among those who fail to make the grade at the age of 11, they say only 7% go on to get five good GCSEs, including English and maths. Children would be forced to retake a test in maths and English, marked by teachers rather than external examiners. There could be up to two retakes, in the spring or summer terms, and the number of pupils who had failed the retakes would be published as part of the league table data. The PM made the announcement in Lancashire today with the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (centre) Mr Cameron  chatted with  pupils outside at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Primary School near Bolton . Pupils with special needs would not have to take the resits. Mr Cameron said: 'There is no job that doesn't require English and maths, and this is about making sure every child gets the best start in life and that our country can compete in the world.' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan added: 'We know that the biggest predictor of success at GCSE is whether young people have mastered the basics at age 11. That means if we fail to get it right for young people at the start of secondary school they'll struggle for the rest of their time in education.' Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt dismissed the proposal as 'desperate' Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said dismissed the announcement as a 'a desperate attempt by the Tories to try to overshadow their failures on school standards'. Mr Hunt said: 'On their watch, 1.6 million pupils are being educated in schools that are rated lower than 'good' by Ofsted. And as a result of David Cameron's unqualified teachers policy, more than 400,000 pupils are being taught by unqualified teachers. 'Labour has a better plan for education. We will ensure that every teacher is qualified or working towards qualified teacher status and introduce a new master teacher status to raise the standing of the profession. That is how we improve education for every child, in every classroom,' he said. The Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws said the Tories had 'no credibility' on education because of their planned spending cuts after the election. He said: ' You simply can't improve schools by starving them of resources and burdening them with the bureaucracy of additional testing. 'The way to make sure every child starts secondary school achieving a good level of Maths and English is to invest in their early years and primary education, recruiting great teachers and getting extra support to the children who most need it. 'That's why we need to protect the education budget, in real terms, including schools, nurseries and colleges. 'The Tories are trying to paper over the cracks in their scorched earth education plans that would undo the progress of the last five years.' Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders union, warned the tests could become a bureaucratic nightmare. He said: 'It is important that the results of these tests are diagnostic and used to support the work of the teachers and do not become yet another performance indicator on which to measure schools.'","Six-year-old Lucy Howarth completely unfazed by the Prime Minister .

"Britain's biggest banks earmarked billions of pounds for 'remediation costs' and fines over the last three years . Britain's biggest banks have racked up a £39billion bill in just three years to pay for their financial scandals. ‘Remediation costs’ wiped out 61 per cent of their profits between 2011 and 2014, according to accountants KPMG. The bill has been driven by the payment protection insurance scandal, with banks setting aside £4.7billion last year to compensate customers. Another £2.3billion was earmarked by banks including Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC to pay fines for rigging foreign exchange markets. The total charge for wrongdoing last year – £9.9billion – was only 8 per cent less than the previous year. Describing it as a ‘problem that won’t go away’, KPMG said banks also face mounting costs from employing an army of compliance staff to keep them out of trouble. RBS is thought to be facing a multibillion-pound settlement in the US for mis-selling toxic bundles of mortgage debt – known as mortgage-backed securities – in the run up to the financial crisis. Barclays is also braced for a huge fine for rigging foreign exchange rates, having put aside £1.25billion so far to cover the bill. But the UK’s strengthening economy has driven a 72 per cent drop in losses from bad loans, with write-offs falling to £5.2billion last year. RBS was boosted by £1.4billion after not as many loans went sour as it had feared. This compares with an £8.1billion charge in 2013. So-called ‘impairment charges’ at Lloyds fell £2billion to £752million as the improving economy meant fewer retail customers and businesses defaulted on their repayments. Scroll down for video . This translated into a surge in the bottom line, with Lloyds posting a £1.8billion profit, up from £415million in 2013. RBS’s losses narrowed to £3.5billion last year from £8.2billion in 2013. Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered all saw profits fall. KPMG said banks must ‘urgently tackle’ their low return on equity – a key measure of shareholder value – and need to invest in technology to increase their profits. Tougher regulations forcing them to hold more capital have made it more expensive for them to do business, especially in higher-risk areas. Banks including RBS and Barclays have responded by shrinking their investment banking arms. KPMG’s Bill Michael said: ‘Banks are undergoing a once in a lifetime change, as they face evolving regulation, technology and society’s expectations … If further regulation creates too many strictures on non-retail banking, the industry risks losing its global relevance.’ KPMG said banks must ‘urgently tackle’ their low return on equity and need to invest in technology to increase their profits.","Britain's banks set aside £4.7billion last year in PPI compensation last year .

"Right now, you may feel that you know the inside of David Cameron’s kitchens – yes, both of them – better than your own. Two weeks ago the Prime Minister let the BBC film him preparing lunch at his home in his Oxfordshire constituency. Then this weekend it was the No 10 kitchen that was the focus of attention as he made a pitch for the family vote by being pictured at breakfast with wife Samantha and their three children. Scroll down for video . Breakfast time: David and Samantha Cameron talk to their nine-year-old son Elwen in tonight’s ITV film . Making a point: Mr Cameron chats with his children over the No 10 breakfast table during the ITV show . And tonight you can see the Downing Street kitchen all over again as they once more gather round the breakfast table (white marble and costing £750), this time for the cameras of ITV News. When he invited the BBC film crew into his constituency kitchen, Mr Cameron blundered into a row after admitting he did not want a third term as Prime Minister. This time round, he may have thought he was on safer ground being questioned by his own family over the No 10 breakfast table. But the chat showed them teasing the Prime Minister after he appeared to confuse the Disney film Frozen for a book. He asked his four-year-old daughter Florence about her fairy costume for World Book Day, adding: ‘Why are you not going as Elsa [from Frozen]? That’s what I want to know.’ His wife Samantha answered, saying: ‘Because it’s not a book.’ The PM laughed awkwardly before attempting to change the subject, asking: ‘Anyway, have you got some interesting views on school food?’ One of his older children replied bluntly: ‘It’s absolutely disgusting. I brought in a chip that was half green.’ Mr Cameron has previously said he shares the irritation of many parents at hearing the song Let It Go from Frozen sung too many times. Access all areas: The Camerons are joined by ITV News political editor Tom Bradby (right) during the show . Phenomenon: During the show, Mr Cameron is teased for appearing to confuse Disney film Frozen for a book . Earlier this year he said Florence regularly ‘launches into song’ in front of his security guards. He said: ‘I don’t know all the words but I have listened to it being sung more times than I care to remember.’ Mr Cameron was filmed at home with his family for an ITV profile due to be aired tonight, although his children’s faces were not shown on camera. His wife said the breakfast-time teasing was typical of the way the Prime Minister’s family keep him ‘grounded’, saying: ‘They take the mick all day long.’ She said oldest daughter Nancy, 11, and son Elwen, nine, had also teased their sister as ‘really uncool’ after she came home from school saying: ‘My daddy is the Prime Minister.’ Mrs Cameron said Florence later told her grandmother: ‘Don’t tell anyone but my daddy’s the Prime Minister.’ In the interview with ITV News political editor Tom Bradby, Mr Cameron also spoke frankly about the death of the couple’s disabled son Ivan.

She said: ‘They take the mick all day long' Caring: David Cameron took a break from the campaign trail on Saturday to feed a newborn lamb in Witney . He said: ‘It’s everyone’s dread to lose a child. You lose someone you love so much, so young. It does hit you like nothing else and there is a bit of you that thinks, well if you can face that sort of challenge in your life, then it puts everything else into perspective.’ Mr Cameron was also asked about his background. He said: ‘I went to a very posh school, I had a very privileged upbringing with parents who were incredibly loving and brilliant. I’ve never tried to hide that, I’m not going to change my accent or talk in a different way.’ Spotlight – David Cameron: Tonight will be broadcast on ITV at 7.30pm.","David Cameron invited ITV film crew into Downing Street kitchen for show .

Features with a high spatial frequency (Einstein) are only visible when you're viewing them close up, and those with low spatial frequencies (Monroe) are only visible from further away. Combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen. This classic optical illusion was created several years ago by neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a recent video, AsapScience highlighted the process behind the trick, which can also be seen in a still image by anyone if they move closer and then farther away from the screen. ‘Depending on how well you’re able to focus or pick up contrast your eye will only pick out details,’ the video explains. ‘Up close, we’re generally able to pick up fine details like Einstein’s moustache and wrinkles. ‘But as the distance increases, or if your vision is poor and creates a more blurred image in the first place, your ability to pick up details fades away. ‘Instead you only see general features, like the shape of mouth, nose and hair, and are left seeing Marilyn Monroe. ‘ . The MIT team, led by Dr Aude Oliva, has spent over a decade creating hybrid optical illusions that show how images can be hidden with textures, words and other objects. When you look at the image above, whose face do you see? At normal screen viewing distance you should see the face of Albert Einstein. Squint your eyes or take a few steps back from the image and Marilyn Monroe should come into view . 'Marilyn Einstein' was created by superimposing a blurry picture of Marilyn Monroe over a picture of Albert Einstein drawn in fine lines. Features with a high spatial frequency are only visible when viewing them close up, and those with low spatial frequencies are only visible at a distance. Combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen. Dr Oliva’s group say these images not only reveal vision problems, but can also highlight how the brain processes information. In one study, participants were shown hybrid images for just of 30 milliseconds, and only recognised the low spatial resolution, or blurry, component of the image. On the top row, up close, you can see that the man on the left is scowling, while the woman on the right has a placid facial emotion. Move back, and the faces change expressions and even genders. If you squint, blink or defocus, the angry man turns calm, and the calm woman turns angry, and male . At normal viewing distance, you may see a dolphin. But disguised within the low spatial frequency of this hybrid is a car, which you will see once you step back a few metres . But when the images were shown for 150 milliseconds, they only recognised the image that was produced in fine detail, or in high spatial resolution. In a separate test, they were shown sad faces in high spatial resolution and angry faces in low spatial resolution. They superimposed pictures used both male and female faces. When displayed for 50 milliseconds, participants always saw an angry face, but were unable to pinpoint the sex of the person pictured. Dr Oliva says this shows that our brains discriminate between picking out fine detail in some situations, and broader detail in others. The brain’s processing of fine details happens slightly later than processing other features, according to the research. The teams believes hybrid images such as this may prove useful to advertisers who want to change how their logos appear at different distances. It could also be used to mask text on devices so only someone viewing close up can read it. These images contain old fashioned maps of the distribution of cranial organs which can only be seen at close range to the image. At a distance, all that will be seen are two normal portraits . Hybrid images can create textures with viewing distance. This picture shows an example of a woman's face that turns into a cat at close distance .","Look at the hybrid image at a normal viewing distance from the screen .

"It was heralded as the world’s oldest musical instrument; a bone with two holes in it seemingly made by Neanderthals to serenade their companions. But now a study says it’s not an instrument at all - but rather, simply a bone chewed by hyenas and left in a cave. The research suggests historians have been fooled by these phoney objects - and, in fact, all such ‘instruments’ attributed to Neanderthals are simply chew toys of animals. A researcher says a 'bone flute' found in Slovenia is not an instrument - instead, he says it is simply a bone chewed by a hyena with teeth marks. The bone is shown here, believed to be the oldest musical instrument discovered in Europe, on show in Ljubljana. The bone was discovered on 18 July 1995 in Slovenia . The latest analysis was conducted by Dr Cajus Diedrich from the Paleo-Logic Independent Institute of Geosciences. In a paper published in the Royal Society of Open Science, he took a look at several ‘musical instruments’ that had been attributed to Neanderthals. Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists. Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet. The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found. Anthropologists at the University Kansas say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe. The findings add to evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primitive creatures they are often portrayed as. One in particular, the Divje Babe Flute, is often said to be the world’s oldest musical instrument. The cave bear femur, pierced with two holes, was found in 1995 at the Divje Babe Archaeological park near Cerkno in northwestern Slovenia. Dr Diedrich said analysis of the bone shows the holes are teeth marks, and the shape is just the result of the bone not breaking when it was chewed. In most caves, carnivore damage like this can be seen in about 20 per cent of animal remains and 80 per cent of bear cub remains. But while adult remains were often ‘crushed to pieces’, bear cubs often had certain patterns like this. ‘These are not instruments, nor human made, but products of the most important cave bear scavengers of Europe, hyenas,’ Dr Diedrich wrote. ‘Hyenas left bones in repeating similar tooth mark and crush damage stages, demonstrating a butchering/bone cracking strategy. ‘Hyenas produced round-oval puncture marks in cub femora only by the bone-crushing premolar teeth of both upper and lower jaw.’ One instrument in particular, the Divje Babe Flute, is often said to be the world’s oldest musical instrument. The cave bear femur, pierced with two holes, was found in 1995 at the Divje Babe Archaeological park (shown) near Cerkno in northwestern Slovenia . The latest analysis says that many bones found in caves can simply be attributed to animals around 30,000 years ago, rather than Neanderthals. Shown is an exhibit of the life of a Neanderthal family in a cave in the Neanderthal Museum in the northern town of Krapina in Croatia . The first ‘Neanderthal flutes’ were discovered in Slovenia in the 1920s and, since then, many others have been identified. Sadly for those who thought Neanderthals might have played music in this way to one another, though, it seems the earlier analysis may have been wrong. Shown is the 'Divje Babe flute' bear bone, believed to be the oldest musical instrument discovered in Europe, in the National Museum in Ljubljana . Dr Diedrich derides all the research that has gone into these bones so far. He also points out that there is no evidence on the bones that tools have been used to make the holes, further cementing the idea they were made by hyena teeth. What’s more, he also said that most of the ‘bone flutes’ do not actually date from Neanderthal times - 200,000 to 30,000 years ago. Rather, he says they can more closely be attributed to the Aurignacian culture 38,000 to 29,000 years ago - sometimes said to be the first modern humans in Europe, owing to their grasp of using tools. ‘The “cave bear cub femora with holes” are, in all cases, neither instruments nor human made at all,’ he concludes. ‘All cave bear pseudo-bone flutes are not dated to Neanderthal Middle Palaeolithic Mousterian layers, but instead, if possible to date, to Late Palaeolithic, Aurignacian/Gravettian layers.’ He added: ‘Hyenas left, therefore, “pseudo-bone flutes” during the Late Middle to Late Pleistocene all over Europe in cave bear dens, and on different cave bear species/subspecies. ‘This is known due to lack of breakage on most of the cave bear cub femora, which generally show additional diagonal zigzag margins (from chewing joints by scissor teeth of hyenas) or have triangular or smaller scratch tooth marks.’","Researcher says a 'bone flute' found in Slovenia is not an instrument .

"A dog belonging to a Brazilian drugs gang has proved that learning to drop and roll is not just for humans. When police in the southern state of Santa Catarina busted the gang's lair, the loyal canine laid down alongside its owner and rolled over on its back. The picture showing the line of gang members and their guard dog surrendering to police has since gone viral in Brazil. The incident happened during a joint police and military operation in the neighbourhood of Vargem Grande, in the south Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. Police spokesman Filippo Valdez said: 'The officers had been observing the gang for some time and when they arrested them they recovered a substantial quantity of marijuana and cocaine, as well as weighing scales, guns and ammunition. 'There was a male dog that was barking when officers burst onto the scene but when it saw its owners obeying the command to lie down, it ran over and laid down as well.' Brazilian animal psychiatrist and dog trainer Barnie Rico said: 'The dog lying on its back exposing its belly is a classic sign of submission in the dog world. Drugs bust: Police recovered a substantial quantity of cocaine, as well as weighing scales, guns and ammunition, at the scene (stock image) 'By exposing its underbelly to any potential attacker it is showing that it doesn't mean any trouble. 'The dog is also turning its head away as looking at the potential enemy can also be seen as a sign of aggression to another dog. 'It is clearly a very clever animal because it saw the rest of its pack given in, and decided to copy them.' Online users pointed out that with local police thing to simply shoot dogs on site when carrying out armed raids, it was probably a good move to make sure everyone realised the animal didn't cause any trouble. It was reportedly not arrested with the rest of the suspected gang.","Dog pictured 'surrendering' alongside its drug gang owners .

"New lease of life: Karen Bane with her daughter Jessica after undergoing the alternative procedure . It is a painful and embarrassing condition that affects millions of British women. Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs – including the womb – becomes weak, typically after childbirth. Complications include an uncomfortable dragging or ‘full’ feeling, discomfort during sex or stress incontinence. Although up to half of women are thought to suffer to some degree, far fewer seek help, and many who do are offered just one solution: a hysterectomy. While surgical removal of the reproductive organs solves the immediate problem, it also ends fertility, and with three months of recovery needed, it is no quick fix. Now, a leading gynaecologist has claimed thousands of patients may be undergoing the drastic operation needlessly. He is one of a growing number of surgeons who claim not enough women are offered the alternative: a half-hour keyhole procedure that uses an implanted mesh ‘sling’ made from nylon to lift and hold the womb back in place, providing a permanent solution to a prolapse and preserving fertility. The procedure, called a sacrohysteropexy, is rare, with just 1,072 admissions for the surgery in the past three years. By contrast, there were 145,310 admissions to hospitals in England in the past three years for hysterectomies due to conditions such as fibroids, pelvic pain or cancer, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Surgeon Jonathan Broome, who has performed more than 1,000 sacrohysteropexies in the past 15 years, has called for the option to be made more widely available on the NHS so women of child-bearing age are not forced to choose between quality of life or the chance to have children. ‘Most women requiring surgery for a prolapse will be referred for a hysterectomy by their GP,’ says Mr Broome, who performs the £4,000 procedure for both NHS and private patients at hospitals in Lancashire and Greater Manchester. ‘That means some women are faced with the dilemma of living a normal life without a prolapse, or the possibility of having children. 'Far too many GPs recommend hysterectomies as the solution to a prolapse, when a sacrohysteropexy is a much better alternative. It’s a shorter operation, with shorter recovery time because it is less invasive, and fertility is not put at risk.’ Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs – including the womb – becomes weak, typically after childbirth (file image) Common causes of prolapse include childbirth, lower levels of oestrogen at menopause, being overweight and chronic illnesses such as lung diseases, which create pressure inside the abdomen from coughing. Half of women over 50 will have symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and more than one in ten will have had surgery for the problem by the age of 80. Concerns have been raised about the use of mesh implants in gynaecological procedures, with some women in Scotland and the US complaining of problems including bleeding and infections. But consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Clive Spence-Jones says the risk of complications where mesh is inserted abdominally is very small. Medical watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has received two reports of adverse incidents relating to a sacrohysteropexy since 2011. ●A sacrohysteropexy is keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic to put the womb back into its normal position. ●Tiny cuts are made in the stomach through which a telescope and instruments are passed. ●A piece of mesh is inserted via an incision along the bikini line. Using tiny needles, one end of the mesh is attached to the back of the cervix and the other to the coccyx, and it is fixed with metal staples. The mesh is also covered with a thin layer of tissue to prevent scar tissue forming, encouraging the tissue to grow and make the repair stronger. ●It can stay in place indefinitely and does not require a repeat operation. ●The procedure takes half an hour and involves an overnight stay in hospital. Mr Spence-Jones agrees that too many women are given the wrong advice on what surgery is right for them. ‘There seems to be a notion in general practice that taking everything – in other words, a hysterectomy – is the answer to a prolapse, when that isn’t the case,’ he says. ‘Sparing the fertility is a reason for considering procedures other than a hysterectomy, but not the only one.’ One woman who says her life has been transformed by a sacrohysteropexy is 44-year-old mother- of-two Karen Bane, from Lancashire. She suffered feelings of bloatedness following the birth of her daughters Gabrielle, seven, and Jessica, five. ‘I felt sluggish – I had back pain, sitting was uncomfortable and intercourse was painful. I’d also started to have leakage. It was mortifying being a woman in my early 40s and not being able to control my bladder. ‘I put up with the symptoms for five years, but when I started to have bleeding, I knew enough was enough. I was a mother of two young children, yet all I could see were years of misery in front of me.’ Karen went to her GP with her symptoms in May 2014 and was referred to Mr Broome. He performed the procedure at Euxton Hall Hospital in Chorley, Lancashire, last October. Karen says the procedure has given her a new lease of life. ‘I can run, skip and hula-hoop with my daughters without giving it a second thought,’ she explains. ‘I feel so much more feminine since my operation – my only battle scars are tiny nicks on my stomach. And because I had a sacrohysteropexy rather than a hysterectomy, everything is still there. It’s not something we are planning to do as we feel our family is complete, but the chance to have another child has not been taken away from me.’ Why should I take... Creatine . Creatine is a compound found in muscle tissue that increases the body’s ability to produce energy, and is often used by athletes to boost performance during high-intensity exercise. But there is evidence that taking 5g of creatine daily can deliver a short-term boost to brain power. An Australian study involving 45 volunteers found that those who took creatine for six weeks performed better in IQ and memory tests than those who were given a placebo. Fish and red meat are good natural sources. Ask a stupid question... Beauty & Go Bioactive Beauty Drinks . You don’t just rub on moisturiser these days – you can drink it too. These fruity drinks deliver collagen proteins, hyaluronic acid and antioxidants in four ‘flavours’: Vitality, Detox, Anti-Ageing and Radiance. 250ml, £2.99, selfridges.com . Can you smell when it's going to rain? Professor Barry Smith, founder of the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London, says: ‘Yes you can. Air pressure falls and humidity increases when it is about to rain, and our noses act like a barometer, picking up these subtle changes in the air. ‘Humidity makes smells more intense. The smell gets stronger still when rain starts to fall, as droplets of water will pick up molecules from the surface they hit – such as grass or dirt – and carry them into the air.’","Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when tissue in the womb becomes weak .

"It's enough to pay for a small home extension – and if Jennifer Drew carries on like this, she might well need one. The mother-of-one has saved £17,000 over three years by spending an hour a day searching for deals and coupons. And she has now accumulated so many products and groceries that they fill a whole room of her house as well as her garage. Mrs Drew, 31, is so keen on a bargain she even bags items she does not need and gives them away to friends. Scroll down for video . Mother-of-one Jennifer Drew has saved £17,000 over three years by spending an hour a day searching for deals and coupons . Among the hoard of products – many of which were bought through multi-buy deals – are 20 bottles of mouthwash, 52 bottles of baby lotion and shampoo, and stacks of dog and cat food, even though Mrs Drew and her husband, 33-year-old plasterer Neil, do not have a pet. The frugal English teacher estimates she saves £70 each week on food, and once even managed to get a weekly shop worth £140 for just 29p. Mrs Drew, who uses newspaper coupons as well as voucher websites such as Wowcher and Groupon, said: 'I can't imagine life without coupons and, to be honest, I don't understand why no one else is cashing in. 'Once you get to grips with the process, it's very simple. What people don't realise is that a bit of research can save hundreds of pounds.' The 31-year-old has bagged so many bargains that she has even dedicated the garage at her home in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, to stockpiling extra products (above) Mrs Drew, pictured with son Nicholas (left), estimates that she saves £70 on her weekly shop by using coupons and money-saving websites - and once managed to buy a week's worth of food for 29p . Mrs Drew's obsession with couponing started when she was pregnant with her son Nicholas, now two. She suffered severe insomnia and while watching TV at night she stumbled across American reality show Extreme Couponing, which follows savvy shoppers as they find bargains. Mrs Drew, from Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, said: 'I thought I'd give it a try. By the time Neil came down for work, I'd saved more money than I'd earn in a full day's pay.' Not long after, Mr Drew was made redundant and, with a new arrival on the way, the couple were facing huge cutbacks. Mrs Drew said that when she began shopping for the baby she would bring home bags 'stuffed to the brim and Neil would look on in horror'. 'He panicked and thought I was spending a fortune but didn't realise how far my coupons had gone,' she said. 'He couldn't believe that I had saved so much money until I showed him the receipt.' She added: 'I get a real buzz every time I save money. It's like an addiction.' Mrs Drew now spends around an hour a day during the week, and three hours on Saturday and Sunday, searching the internet for the best deals. For a few months last year, she ran free classes at her local library and 'fully trained' around 20 people in using coupons.","Jennifer Drew estimates she saves £70 on weekly food shop with coupons .

Self-styled 'anarchist libertarian' squatters have set up camp in one of London's most historic monuments and unfurled banners reading 'Homes for all' One of the banners read, 'Respect existence or expect resistance' and another, 'better to squat than let homes rot' The protesters mounted the arch which joins Trafalgar Square with the Mall, and called for others to join them . It is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight, as a garbled message posted on Facebook by the group simply calls for 'Christmas lights... any and all radical/revolutionary messages' The gatehouse, built as a memorial to Queen Victoria, was sold in 2012 after a Spanish hotel developer paid £60 million to buy it from the government. The five protesters from anti fascist group 'Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians (ANAL)' called for support in a message on their Facebook page as police converged on the area. They posted: 'Urgent shoutout for banners, Christmas lights and anything else we can use to make the most of this massive canvas we have. Any and all radical/revolutionary messages welcome, but a preference for antifa (sic) in anticipation of the pegeda event on the 4th of this month. Much love.' One onlooker, who asked not to be named, said: 'I've seen a couple of guys on different parts of the roof throughout this morning. 'All they were doing was shouting power to the people. I have no idea how they got in there because I'm pretty sure it's offices.' A man was walking across the roof of the arch this afternoon wearing a black sleeveless hoodie with the hood pulled up and a black scarf across his face. They added five photographs of themselves up on the building. They are believed to be the same group who took over the former offices of the Institute of Directors on Pall Mall in central London last month. The building, not far from Buckingham Palace, was targeted because it was originally opened by Tony Blair, the groups said at the time. The squatters later bragged that it 'wasn't difficult' to get into the historic landmark which is a five minutes walk from Buckingham Palace. The group said they got into the building overnight by climbing through an unlocked window. Proclaiming that what they were doing was 'more punk rock than the Sex Pistols,' one of the men, who only gave his name as 'Fox' said the group decided to take Admiralty Arch because it was a 'significant' building a stone's throw away from the Palace. 'Fox', who claimed to be one of the founders of the Autonomous Nation, said: ' We decided to take it because it is a significant building - you can see Buckingham Palace - there is a significant flow of traffic and we wanted to highlight the fact there are some corrupt individuals affecting this country and they need to get dragged out. Banners bearing housing messages were seen hanging from the Grade-I listed building as the masked demonstrators sat with their legs dangling over the side . 'Also, we wanted to highlight the fact that there are so many people that are homeless. 'We got in overnight through a window that was unlocked and just climbed in through that, there's about 15 of us here. 'The ironic thing is that we had been evicted from the building in Pall Mall and all we were doing was walking around here when a security guard said 'you can't come in here, you can't take this' - which said to us it must be empty and that's when we decided we could take it. 'We are trying our hardest to keep it clean and tidy, but when your squatting in central London the chaos does take its toll. 'We want to stay here as long as we can.' Fox admitted he was one of the hooded figures seen standing on the roof of the arch today and said he was shouting 'power to the people.' He also said that some of his colleagues were shouting 'ACAB' which stands for 'All Cops are B*****ds.' He added: 'That is not something I join in with [shouting about police] because I find a lot of police officers can be quite reasonable.' A 'Notice to Vacate' has been posted up the entrances to the landmark, however Fox warned that if the group are evicted 'There may be some individuals that do resistance. ' Another squatter, who asked not to be named, said: 'We decided to take it because it is two fingers up to the Royal Family. 'We are anarchists, we are not left wing or right wing, we are anarchists - look up the dictionary definition of the word. 'The Sex Pistols need to start doing a new album because what we are doing is more punk rock than the Sex Pistols.' Asked how long he wanted to squat in the landmark he replied 'indefinitely.' It is not the first time protesters have 'taken over' Admiralty Arch. In 2006, 14 Greenpeace protesters spent a day on the arch demonstrating over claims the government is using illegally logged wood. The gatehouse, built as a memorial to Queen Victoria, was sold in 2012 after a Spanish hotel developer paid £60 million to buy it from the government . The five protesters from anti fascist group 'Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians (ANAL)' called for support in a message on their Facebook page as police converged on the area . They added five photographs of themselves up on the building. It is not the first time protesters have 'taken over' the memorial . They unfurled banners accusing the government of 'trashing rainforests' during Cabinet Office renovations . A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said: 'At approximately 10.22 this morning we were made aware of five protesters on the roof of Admiralty Arch opposite Trafalgar Square. 'They remain on the roof. Officers are in attendance.' Facebook user Love Activists posted: 'Love activists, SHA and the Autonomous Nation Of Anarchist Libertarians have occupied the old cabinet office opposite trafalgar square, on the road which leads directly towards the palace. We call out for all hands to assist us.' Another user Natasha Quarmby added: 'The Guinness Trust AST tenants are in court today, trying to save their homes, they are on their own, and not getting the support that perhaps other Social Housing campaigns are getting, like the Aylesbury Estate or Sweets Way.... I urge you to visit to visit their page and show some support, they would really appreciate it. 'What about these guys too, No Russel Brand on hand here.... Show them some support x (sic)' Tenants face losing their homes for a new housing development on the Guinness Estate in Loughborough Park, Brixton, and have been staging protests. Housing trust the Guinness Partnership is planning to redevelop the estate and create 525 new homes on the site. Tenants on shorthold tenancy contracts have been told they have until April to find new housing. Many of the tenants have been living in the building for over 10 years and claim they will have to find somewhere to live outside London as they can no longer afford to pay Brixton rent prices. Admiralty Arch was commissioned by King Edward VII as a memorial to his mother, Queen Victoria, and was designed by the architect Sir Aston Webb. Completed in 1912, it spans the entrance to Trafalgar Square from The Mall and was traditionally used as the residence of the First Sea Lord and the heads of the Royal Navy. Admiralty Arch was commissioned by King Edward VII as a memorial to his mother, Queen Victoria, and was designed by the architect Sir Aston Webb. It is pictured during the Royal Wedding of Princess Elizabeth (Queen Elizabeth II) and Prince Philip (Duke of Edinburgh) at Westminster Abbey in November 1947 . Neighbouring Admiralty House has provided grace-and-favour apartments for politicians including former defence secretary Liam Fox and former deputy prime minister John Prescott. The 147,300sq ft arch is spread across a basement, lower ground and ground floor, and five upper floors. The Government sold the long-term lease on the building in 2013. It is retaining the freehold, so will still have the final say after a Spanish hotel developer paid £60 million to buy it. Nights in the historic landmark, which joins Trafalgar Square with the Mall, won't come cheaply though; new owner Rafael Serrano is also the man behind the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge, where rooms cost from £850 a night.","Protesters mounted Admiralty Arch, which joins Trafalgar Square with Mall .

"A teen club volleyball player and her family are suing after they said her coaches spiked her playing time and her league blocked a transfer to another club. Audrey Dimitrew, 16, of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors in November believing she would get playing time, but was told by coaches she did not have the skills to compete with her team. The sophomore at Woodgrove High School and her family sued the Chesapeake Region Volleyball Association on March 10 after they said she was accepted to another club but was denied the transfer from her league. The lawsuit seeks to let Audrey transfer clubs and asks for attorney fees. Scroll down for video . Audrey Dimitrew, 16, of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors club but was benched first two tournaments of the season and was told her skills were not up to par to compete with her team . She along with her family (her mother Susan pictured left), have filed a lawsuit against the league, Chesapeake Region Volleyball Association, seeking for Audrey to transfer teams . Coaches told Audrey she had the potential to play college volleyball and that she would get 'significant tournament game experience' as one of two setters on the team, according to court documents. However, things changed after the season began, her attorney Robert J. Cunningham said, and she was told she did not have the skills to compete with the team. She was benched the first two tournaments and the coach told her she would not play much for the rest of the season, according to the Washington Post. Audrey was then told by her coach that she could transfer to another club in the league if she wanted or she could be a practice player for the team. She chose to transfer teams and found another club, NV Premier, who wanted her but the league cried foul and said no to a transfer. After several appeals to the league were denied, the family filed suit. 'It wasn't about playing time, it was about playing. She wants to play,' Audrey's mother, Susan told CBS. Audrey was offered a spot on another club, NV Premier, but the league said she could not transfer. Her mother said the dispute is not about playing time but about 'playing' claiming her daughter 'wants to play' The league's handbook says players are ordinarily forbidden to transfer teams but can switch if they show a 'verifiable hardship condition exists.' 'Should CHRVA allow players the ability to move teams when they are unhappy with the amount of playtime they are receiving, we would be overwhelmed with requests to change teams,' a league official wrote in a January 26 letter to Audrey's parents. The Dimitrews' attorney says that this is true in Audrey's case, but the league disagrees. An attorney for the league, Kenneth G. Stallard, declined to comment on the case Wednesday on behalf of his client, saying they 'will not comment on active litigation matters.' However the lawsuit turns out, Audrey is likely out of luck for the season as only one tournament remains in the club season, though depending on NV Premier's season performance it may be eligible for other tournaments. 'I never imagined in my wildest dreams there would be a lawsuit over this,' she Audrey's mother, Susan. 'But I think it's the right thing to do. I don't think my child is the only one that has experienced something like this. They don't think they have to answer to anyone.' The teen's lawsuit is one of several that have been filed across the country in recent years as more families have turned to the courts to intervene in youth sports disputes. Audrey might miss the opportunity to play this season as there is only one tournament remaining in the club season, but if NV Premier does well she might be eligible for other tournaments (Audrey pictured above with her family) The stakes can include scholarships for players and an advantage in college admissions. Two years ago, a Philadelphia father filed a lawsuit against his son's high school track coach for $40 million after the teen was cut from the team. He claimed that his son's chances of receiving a college scholarship were badly damaged. In the case of Audrey, a Circuit Court judge denied a preliminary injunction in the case on March 12, saying the law required him to defer to the decision of the league. Judge John M. Tran called Audrey's case 'unfortunate,' and he said he was 'unhappy' that 'a child is not given an opportunity to play', according to a transcript of the proceedings. He did not dismiss the case and said the issue has 'the possibility of recurring in the future.' The Chantilly Club released a statement to CBS saying they are happy to work with her within the club, and is happy to support her if she is able to move to another club.","Audrey Dimitrew, a sophomore in high school in Virginia, filed a suit with her family against Chesapeake Regional Volleyball Association .

"The kidnapper who claims to have masterminded the Gone Girl kidnapping of Denise Huskins in California says he will turn himself in, but only if his co-conspirators are given immunity. In yet another email to the San Francisco Chronicle, the individuals wrote that police could accept this offer, or that he would 'go overseas and teach English' or 'live off the grid and read books for the rest of my life.' This came just one day after the group demanded an apology from the police for calling the entire incident a hoax. Huskins, 29, was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on March 23, then released one day later 400 miles away beside her parents' home. After her 'release' police accused them of staging the kidnapping – a claim they both strongly denied. Scroll down for videos . The self-proclaimed kidnapper behind the Gone Girl abduction of Denise Huskins (second from right with her mother and two brothers) says he will turn himself in . This is the Vallejo Police Department and spokesman Lt. Kenny Park (above) grand his co-conspirators immunity from prosecution . This comes one day after the kidnappers claimed they monitored Huskins' boyfriend Aaron Quinn (above) after the kidnapping so he would not go to police, which is why he did not call authorities for 12 hours . In the email from earlier in the week, the kidnappers write; 'I/we may be the direct agent of harm. But it will be made crystal clear that the Vallejo Police Department, and you, Mr. [Kenny] Park, had every opportunity to stop it.' Last week Lt. Park, the spokesman for the Vallejo Police Department, said that the kidnapping of Huskins, which triggered a statewide search that involved 100 volunteers, 40 detectives and numerous FBI agents, was  an 'orchestrated event.' The letter to the Chronicle says authorities had until noon on Tuesday to apologize. That time came and went however, and this new email arrived Tuesday afternoon. The old email had demanded that the police make clear that neither Huskins or her boyfriend Aaron Quinn - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges. As for the main reason behind the kidnapping, they write; 'The Mare Island kidnapping was a training mission to test means and methods that would be used on higher net worth targets.' They then compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11, the famous caper film that starred members of the Rat Pack when it premiered in 1960 and Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and George Clooney in the 2001 remake. It is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either, also reaching out to them on March 24 with an audio file of Huskins to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in Mare Island. She  eventually turned up in Huntington Beach, where both of her parents live, just a few hours later. This latest email, sent on Saturday from a dummy account, was 9,000 words long, and detailed why the group kidnapped Huskins, and how they went about taking her from her home. The group consists of three members, two with college educations, and they claim they are also behind a recent string of burglaries and car thefts in the area. They claim they drilled holes in the window of Huskins and Quinn's home to gain entry, and then used squirt guns with 'strobe flashlights and laser pointers' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms. They say they played 'calming music' as they went about the abduction, and put monitors on Quinn, 30, so they could make sure he did not go to police. They then say they put Huskins in the trunk of Quinn's car and drove off with her. The group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of Huskins and Quinn's home (above) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take Huskins . The kidnapping, which has been called an 'orchestrated event' by authorities, has drawn comparisons to the film Gone Girl (above) In the end however, they claim it was a case of mistaken identity, and they did not mean to take Huskins, thinking that someone else would be in the house. They say that is why they decided to drop her off in Huntington Beach and that they were 'horrified at what we had done.' As for the ransom they requested, what police believe to be a rather paltry $8,500, the group said: 'We chose $8,500 because it was below the $10,000 reporting threshold, and far enough below that it likely would not be flagged as part of a structured transaction under that prong of the reporting law.' Attorneys for both Quinn and Huskins claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email, and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth. Huskins' attorney, Doug Rappaport, said that the reason police called the incident a hoax is because the kidnappers used 'sophisticated computer skills' that neither they or the FBI could 'comprehend.' Lt. Park, the Vallejo Police Department and the FBI all have yet to comment on the emails.","The self-proclaimed kidnapper behind 'Gone Girl abduction' of Denise Huskins now says he will turn himself in to police .

"The leaders of Britain's seven main political parties went head-to-head in an unprecedented TV debate on Thursday as the nation prepares for this year's general election. Nobody is expected to win a majority when votes are cast on May 7 in what is being touted as the closest and most unpredictable race since the 1970s. Prime Minister David Cameron, of the Conservatives, narrowly topped the polls assessing who 'won' the two-hour clash against six other parties in an unusual format for Britain. Crucially, 33 per cent of the 7.4 million viewers hailed Cameron as 'the most impressive' on the subject of the economy, which lies at the heart of each party's campaign. But pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be Cameron or the Labour Party's Ed Miliband who takes the top job in an inevitable coalition after votes are cast. Scroll down for video . The build-up: Prime Minister David Cameron went head-to-head with six other party leaders in a TV debate on Thursday night in an unusual format for Britain. It comes six weeks ahead of the general election on May 7 . Neck-and-neck: Cameron was hailed as statesmanlike in the debate as he tries to edge out Miliband (right) Nicola Sturgeon, of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), was widely touted as one of the victors in the debate, which also featured the environment-focused Green Party, led by Natalie Bennett, and Wales' Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party completed the line-up. Analysts remarked that none of the leaders managed to deliver a 'killer line' that would set them apart from the other participants. 'There was clearly no knock-out blow,' said Peter Kellner of pollster YouGov. Jonny Tudor, 17, who asked one of the questions on the night, said afterwards: 'Some performed well in answer to certain questions, other performed well on different subjects, but there was no definitive winner.' A rare moment of drama came when a female audience member briefly interrupted Cameron to complain about the number of homeless people sleeping in the streets. Too close to call? Pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be the Labour Party's Ed Miliband (left) or David Cameron (right) in the top job after votes are cast. But polls named Cameron as last night's debate 'winner' Range: Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, was touted as one of the victors. Analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a 'killer line' to stand out from the rest . Rare moment of drama: A woman stood up during the debate to heckle Cameron about homelessness . But in a result that will calm Conservative nerves, a Comres/ITV poll showed 40 per cent of voters asked afterwards judged Cameron was the most capable of leading Britain, compared to 28 per cent who named Miliband. The event was the first and only full TV debate of a campaign that has yet to stir voters, many of whom say they feel jaded despite a rising economy. It is the only time Cameron and Miliband will go head-to-head on issues of policy before votes are cast. In one of Cameron's more animated moments in an otherwise reserved performance, he pointed to his rivals, one-by-one, and said: 'What I'm hearing is more debt and more taxes, more debt and more taxes, a lot more debt and more taxes, some more debt and more taxes, and definitely more debt and more taxes.'

"A teenage girl who suffered horrific injuries after being dragged behind a car and left for dead in a gutter has broken her silence. On September 7, 2014, Samantha Giufre, 19, spent months in hospital after being towed behind a vehicle along a suburban street in Casula, south-west of Sydney, before she was abandoned. So far one man has been charged in relation to the violent incident, but police are searching for others they believe were involved. Scroll down for video . Samantha Giufre, 19, suffered multiple fractures to her skull and face, along with bleeding on her brain on September 7, 2014 after being dragged along the street behind a car . CCTV footage released by police shows the moment she was towed behind the car before being found in a gutter on Myall Road in Casula, south west of Sydney on September 7 . 'I just felt destroyed, not like myself,' she told 9News, adding that one of the hardest things she's had to come to terms with is how she now looks. 'I'm blind in one eye now, I have limited vision in the other eye, I have hearing loss in one of my ears, one side of my nose I can't smell out of,' Ms Giufre revealed. The young woman's parents have been by her side since the horrible day, and say her life has been consumed by her recovery for the last six months. 'She's continually at the doctors, having surgeries, her whole life is just consumed with what's happened to her,' Ms Giufre's mother Karen said. Ms Giufre told 9News her life has been 'destroyed' by the violent attack which has left her with permanent disabilities . Her parents Karen (left) and Frank (right) said their daughter's life is now 'consumed' by what happened . One of Ms Giufre's alleged attackers, 18-year-old Basher Hawchar, was supposed to front court on Wednesday but instead sent legal representation . 'I look at Sam and I think that she's been held prisoner, and someone's thrown the key away, and we're just trying to find that key for her,' her father Frank revealed. On Wednesday Ms Guifre fronted court with the hopes of confronting one of her alleged attackers, 18-year-old Basher Hawchar. However he instead sent legal representation, dealing the victim of the senseless crime another blow. On his behalf, Hawchar's lawyer plead not guilty to four charges, including dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. 'He needs to know how it feels, you know, how I feel,' Ms Guifre told 9News. The young woman has urged anyone else who was in the car to come forward . Last October when Ms Giufre was still in hospital, her parents spoke about their grave concerns that their daughter would have to learn to walk, talk and eat again. Ms Giufre was rushed to Liverpool Hospital in September where she spent time in intensive care after suffering multiple fractures to her skull and face, along with bleeding on her brain. 'We don't know whether she'll talk, whether she'll see. We don't know how she will end up, knowing that someone has taken that away from her. She's a good kid, she didn't deserve this,' her mother Karen said at the time. 'The image of Samantha when we saw of her in the hospital… I just want to see her like she was originally. She doesn't look like that any more.' Doctors believed early on that Samantha may have sustained permanent brain damage and could be blind in one eye following the incident. Footage of the incident, captured by a property's CCTV camera, shows a silver sedan driving down the street as Ms Giufre is dragged near the rear door of the vehicle . Her father Frank said the family were celebrating Father's Day when Samantha decided to go meet up with friends at Casula. Doctors believed early on that Samantha had sustained permanent brain damage and may be left blind in one eye following the incident . Her cousin gave her a lift about 5pm and by 6.30pm the family were told Samantha was in the emergency department. 'It's devastating. She had traumatic injuries and god knows what else was happening in her head,' he said following the horrific incident. 'We've been by her side 24 hours. I've given up work to be by her side.' The Giufre family say their daughter was a 'good girl' who had just finished a couple of courses through TAFE. 'She didn't have enemies,' Mr Giufre said. Her parents pleaded for anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward as police try to track down the driver. CCTV Footage of the incident shows a silver sedan driving down the street as Ms Giufre is dragged near the rear door of the vehicle. Just seconds after two people  crossed the road with their dogs, the car entered a round about where the teenager is believed to have been found. Police have described the incident as a 'cowardly and callous act' and are not treating it as an abduction attempt. Her parents, Frank and Karen Giufre, pleaded for anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward as police try to track down the driver . Mrs Giufre said last year her daughter would have to learn to walk, talk and eat again . 'Samantha was leaning in the rear passenger window… (and) subsequently fell out of the vehicle,' Liverpool Crime Manager Dean Johnston said. 'We're dealing with real victims here... This incident has left a young woman with serious injuries. 'Due to Samantha's injuries, investigators have been unable to talk to her.

"Japan's defence minister has been forced to assure MPs that the country has never been invaded by aliens. Speaking in parliament earlier today, Gen Nakatani promised lawmakers that there had been no alien breach of Japanese airspace, and that no government studies into extra-terrestrials were under way. Nakatani said the nation's war planes can be scrambled whenever there is a report of an unidentified flying object but, so far, they had not encountered visitors from space. ET no home: Defence Minister Gen Nakatani responded to questions from an MP about potential alien invasions, and assured parliament that Japan has never been invaded by extra-terrestrials . Nakatani addressed the 'alien question' after an enquiry from one of Japan's more flamboyant MPs - wrestler-turned-politician Antonio Inoki. 'When the Air Self Defence Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,' he said. 'They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth,' he said. At a meeting Wednesday of the budget committee in Japan's upper house, Inoki had asked if aircraft were dispatched to meet extra-terrestrial visitors and 'whether studies aliens are going on'. Inoki, founder and former owner of New Japan Pro Wrestling, said he did not know whether or not aliens existed, but he had once seen a mysterious flying object rocket into the air on the horizon and disappear. No visitors: Nakatani told MPs there has been no violation of Japanese airspace by aliens, and that no government studies into extra-terrestrials were under way . Wednesday's exchange was not the first official Japanese pronouncement on spacemen and their aircraft. A 2007 statement said the government 'has not confirmed the existence of unidentified flying objects believed to have come from anywhere other than Earth'. But the statement, formally endorsed at a cabinet meeting at the time, prompted a surprise rebuttal from the top government spokesman. Nobutaka Machimura, chief cabinet secretary at the time, said: 'Personally, I absolutely believe they exist.' Then-defence minister Shigeru Ishiba also said that in his personal opinion there were 'no grounds' to deny that there are UFOs controlled by alien life-forms.","Japan's defence minister forced to answer questions about UFOs .

"A 10-year-old boy has been rushed to hospital after being shot in the stomach by a person attempting to kill an aggressive dog. Danel Hall Jr was walking down the street in Centre Point, Alabama, when a man was chased by a neighbourhood dog. A third person suddenly starting shooting at the animal, but stray bullets hit Danel in the stomach and the second pedestrian in the buttocks, it was claimed. Danel Hall (pictured), 10, was shot in the stomach by a stray bullet intended for an aggressive dog . Police from Jefferson County swooped on the scene of the shooting just after 1pm yesterday . Deputies from Jefferson Country sheriff's office quickly arrived at the scene - just after 1pm yesterday - to find Danel in agony. The bullet had narrowly missed his liver and he was rushed to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery to save his life. Tom Henderson, Centre Point's mayor, said the unknown gunman had been attempting to shoot the aggressive dog, but his bullets instead hit Danel and the second man. He told AL.com: 'There shouldn't be any guns being shot in that incident.' Mary Brooks, Danel's great aunt, said she rushed home from work when she was told about the shooting. 'I can't even tell you what went through my mind,' she said. 'I prayed all the way that he'd be alright. And that's all that matters.' Trayvon Smith, the dog's owner and a neighbour of Danel's family, denied accusations he had been the one shooting. He told WTVM that he had no guns, adding that he was very sorry for the boy. 'Everybody pray for that little boy, he needs as much prayers as he can get.' Police are continuing to look for the person who fired the shots, and anyone with information about the incident can contact the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office at 205-325-1450.

"Lady Penelope (left) and her faithful chauffeur Aloysius Parker (right) have been given slight tweaks for the 2015 remake of Thunderbirds . FIVE. FOUR. THREE. TWO. ONE. Thunderbirds are Go! Again! Yes, 50 years after the futuristic puppet show launched and landed all over the world, ITV is bringing it back. However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by computer-generated figures. In a nod to 21st-century political correctness, there are also more women and several multicultural characters have been added. Geeky scientist Brains has lost his bow tie for an open-neck shirt and has been given an Indian accent. Even Lady Penelope and her faithful chauffeur Aloysius Parker have been given slight tweaks for 2015. Lady Penelope is this time voiced by Gone Girl actress Rosamund Pike. She has also lost the twin-set and pearls and looks a much more modern, dressed down lady secret agent. Parker, meanwhile, returns with his original voice, that of 89-year-old David Graham, but has dropped his chauffeur uniform and sports a roll-neck sweater. His new look is completed by swept-back, grey-streaked hair. Thunderbirds aired here between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 50-minute episodes over two series, shown in 66 countries. The show spawned a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products, from puppets and lunchboxes to T-shirts, so much so that December 1966 was dubbed Thunderbirds Christmas. This is not, however the first attempt at a remake. Thunderbirds, a 2004 Working Title film with real actors (including Ben Kingsley as arch-villain The Hood), was an unmitigated disaster, losing almost £20 million at the box office. Even Gerry Anderson, the show’s co-creator, called it ‘the biggest load of c**p’ he had seen and rejected an offer of £400,000 for just going to the premiere. ‘Remaking something as iconic as Thunderbirds means that your feelings of excitement are mixed with apprehension because you don’t want to do anything to tarnish it,’ says Giles Ridge, the show’s executive producer. ‘We didn’t want to mess too much with Thunderbirds but needed to make it in a way that would excite 21st-century children.’ In a nod to 21st-century political correctness, there are also more women and several multicultural characters have been added . As with the original, at the heart of Thunderbirds are the five gung-ho Tracy brothers, all named after real astronauts on America’s Mercury space mission in the early 1960s: Scott (Carpenter), John (Glenn), Virgil (Grissom), Gordon (Cooper) and Alan (Shephard). Their mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. Inspired by their widower billionaire father Jeff, (a stalwart of the original series but missing in this) they live on Tracy Island in the middle of the South Pacific in 2065. Lady Penelope (pictured as a puppet) has lost the twin-set and pearls and looks a much more modern, dressed down lady secret agent in the new remake . When they hear of trouble anywhere on the planet their swimming pool slides open to allow a rocket (Thunderbird 1) to take off. There are also an aircraft carrier, submarine and spaceship based on the island. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a shoestring budget, but the new production team spans the globe. Main writer Rob Hoegee is in Los Angeles but watches script readings on Skype. Peter Jackson’s animation workshop Weta in New Zealand made the 26 episodes (a further 26 are already commissioned) using a mixture of live action and computer graphics. Despite all the new technology, the backgrounds are models, including an 18ft-high Tracy Island. Gerry Anderson and his wife Sylvia came up with Thunderbirds after a mining disaster in West Germany in 1963. On the original show everyone had to multi-task; for Sylvia that meant voicing Lady Penelope, International Rescue’s London agent. Rosamund Pike says she didn’t hesitate when she was offered the role. ‘As soon as ITV asked me,’ she says, ‘I knew it would be very exciting. ‘Lady Penelope often plays up to the frivolous elements of who she is — a girl who loves clothes, pink cars, little dogs — to blindside people and conceal what she really is up to at any given point That is usually breaking in somewhere she shouldn’t be, finding secrets in dangerous situations.’ Her car is no longer a Rolls (no brands are used in children’s television programmes now), but thankfully she still has Parker. ‘The producers met me for coffee,’ says David Graham. ‘I think they wanted to see what sort of shape I’m in, but I was thrilled to be able to recreate this character. Parker was originally just a minor character, but he eventually became Gerry’s favourite.’ Parker returns with his original voice, that of 89-year-old David Graham, but has dropped his chauffeur uniform (pictured) and now sports a roll-neck sweater with swept-back, grey-streaked hair . Parker has retained his distinctive cockney-trying-to-be-snooty accent. David says: ‘Gerry took me to lunch and said: “I want you to listen to the wine waiter.” So the waiter came over and asked if we would like to see the wine list and he just had this great accent. I’m not sure he knew we modelled the voice on him.’ There has been a concerted effort to increase the female and multicultural roles in the show to make it appeal to aspirational girls and boys of all races. Merlin actress Angel Coulby plays Kayo, an ‘adopted little sister’ to the Tracy brothers who is in charge of security for Tracy Island. Former Casualty actress Adjoa Andoh voices Colonel Casey, commanding officer of the Global Defence Force. Thunderbirds aired here between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 50-minute episodes over two series, shown in 66 countries .","Fifty years after the futuristic puppet show launched ITV is bringing it back .

"One of the most widespread 'food rules' passed down from generation to generation may actually be a myth. The five-second rule, which has been cited to justify picking up everything from a salt and vinegar chip to an assortment of cold cuts, is not as sure-fire as many snackers would surely like it to be. Experts have largely dismissed the almost magical powers surrounding the five-second rule, but said what type of food and where you drop it does come into play. Scroll down for video . One of the most widespread 'food rules' passed down from generation to generation may actually be a myth, meaning this tart isn't safe to pick up . 'There's no such things as a 'five-second rule',' Food Safety Information Council spokeswoman Rachelle Williams told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's a myth; we definitely do not recommend it.' However, Ms Williams said we need to consider the type of food before picking something up off the floor and eating it. 'It all comes down to bacteria,' she said. Video courtesy of RMIT . Experts say dry foods, like cookies, are less hazardous and can be OK, according to health experts . Uncut fruit is one group considered non-hazardous, however cut fruits should never be subjected to the five-second rule . 'Bacteria relies on moisture to grow, so any food wet food is considering potentially hazardous. It's much easier for bacteria to grow on those foods. 'With dry foods, it is conversely much tougher for bacteria to grow.' Dry foods are things such as potato chips, lollies, nuts, biscuits, crackers and uncooked rice or pasta. Potato chips and nuts fall into the 'maybe' area of the five-second rule . Meat, such as cold-cuts and salami, are definitely not worth the risk, and can be a breeding ground for bacteria . If you drop some uncooked rice, it can be safe to pick it up and throw in the pan. However, cooked rice is very dangerous . Dry foods are things such as potato chips, lollies, nuts, biscuits, crackers and uncooked rice or pasta. Wet foods are cut fruit, cold meats, ham, salami, dairy products, and cooked rice or pasta. The comments come after the Food Safety Information Council released a food safety report card as part of World Health Day on April 7. Crakers and nuts have a lower risk than wet foods . Sausages should never be picked up - five-second rule or not . More than 4.1 million cases of food poisoning are diagnosed in Australia every year, with 31,920 hospitalisations and 82 deaths. However, the number is coming down, which experts credited to an increased basic understanding of food safety. ‘Australian consumers get an A plus for knowledge...', Food Safety Information Council Chair Professor Michael Eyles said. ‘But there are a number of other food safety practices where there can be ‘room for improvement.' Mr Eyles identified cooking food thoroughly, being aware of and sticking to use-by dates, and ensuring it is stored at the right temperature as important areas of focus.","Five-second rule dubbed a myth by food health industry experts .

"One of three kidnappers was granted parole 39 years after hijacking a school bus full of children and burying them alive in infamous caper inspired by the film Dirty Harry. The state Board of Parole Hearings granted parole to 63-year-old James Schoenfeld on the 20th time it considered the possibility of releasing the California man, the Fresno Bee reported. Details of the decision to release Schoenfeld were not immediately available. Schoenfield abducted the children and then kept them 'buried alive' in an underground trailer while he and his co-conspirators negotiated a $5million ransom. A state parole board granted parole for James Schoenfeld today, 39 years after he kidnapped 26 children on a school bus along with the driver in the hopes of asking for $5 million ransom . Granted parole: James Schoenfeld is escorted by Sgt. Splan of the Alameda County Sheriffs organization as Schoenfeld is removed from the Alameda County Jail in Oakland, California on August 4, 1976 . Dirty Harry: The kidnappers were inspired by the 1971 film Clint Eastwood film Dirty Harry in which the antagonist kidnaps a school bus for ransom . California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesman Bill Sessa said the ruling will now go through an internal review that could take up to four months before a recommended parole date is sent to Governor Jerry Brown. The kidnappers were influenced by the iconic 1971 Clint Eastwood film Dirty Harry in which the antagonist kidnaps a school bus of children in exchange for ransom. 'You've got to ask yourself a question: 'do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?' Eastwood as cop Harry Callahan famously says to an injured criminal at the end of the flick.. Schoenfeld, 24 at the time of the notorious crime,  his brother, Richard, and a friend, Fred Woods, were convicted of kidnapping 26 school students aged 5-14 and their bus driver Ed Ray in 1976. The driver stopped to see if men in a white van needed help. But three masked men, later identified as brothers Richard and James Schoenfeld and Frederick Woods, stormed onto the vehicle brandishing guns and forced Ray to the back of the bus. The children and Ray were loaded onto two vans and driven around for 11 hours, during which time the hungry, petrified children soiled themselves and held each other in fear. They then drove the vans to a quarry near Livermore and forced their captives into a buried trailer stocked with mattresses, food and water and equipped with fans and ventilation. Free: Young victims of the Chowchilla kidnaping huddle together under happier circumstances for celebration honoring them and bus driver Ed Ray on Sunday, August 22, 1976 after they were able to escape . Changed: Victims of the Chowchilla bus kidnapping, pictured a few years ago, have recounted their lifelong struggle after the traumatic kidnapping . The kidnappers, all from wealthy Bay Area families, planned to ask for a $5 million ransom for their hostages. Their plot, which they had worked on for 18 months, unraveled when they took a nap, and students and bus driver were able to escape through the hole in the ground unhurt. The driver and older boys were able to stack mattresses to a hole in the top of the van. They pushed open a weighted-down metal lid and freed the children who had spent 16 hours underground. 'He was a courageous man,' Medrano said of Ray, the driver. 'He kept 26 scared children in line and made us feel safe.' But even when they started to escape, they feared the men were waiting outside for them, she said. All three men received life sentences after pleaded guilty to kidnapping charges. Richard Schoenfeld was paroled in 2012. Woods remains in prison after he was denied parole in November 2012 and could be up for a parole hearing this fall. The victims of the kidnapping described the suffering they felt 39 years later in a heartfelt letter to the parole board. They expressed the desire for their captors to remain in jail. Jennifer Brown Hyde who was 9-years-old when she was kidnapped along with her 10-year-old brother described the chilling memory and life long trauma she has endured. 'I was honestly brutal,' said Brown Hyde. Hyde is now 48 and lives in Tennessee. The hero: Ed Ray Jr. the school bus driver was hailed as a hero for helping 26 students escape after three men kidnapped the group died in 2012 . Frank Edward Ray, pictured in 1992, stands in Chowchilla, California  by the bus from which he and 26 students were kidnapped years before . 'I wrote that they buried me alive, they stole my childhood and caused me immense emotional pain over the years. It affected my life, my parents’ lives and my children’s lives.' 'For me, it’s having to deal with hatred and anger toward other human beings, and that’s a struggle that almost 40 years later I still have to deal with,' she added. 'Until recently I slept with a night light. I have anxiety attacks when I’m in a confined space, and it’s a problem living in the South when we have tornado warnings and we have to take cover in storm shelters. … They took away my ability to be free.' The Fresno Bee reports that the kidnapping affected Hyde's ability to be a mother to two children since she did not have what she considers a normal childhood. 'You don’t go from being buried alive and thinking you’re going to die to having a normal childhood,' she said. 'I’m fortunate I’m not incarcerated or hooked on drugs, which is how some of the kids dealt with it. I’m as OK as a broken person can be.' Kidnapping victims Lynda Carrejo Lavendeira and Jodi Heffington-Medrano attended Wednesday's hearing. Madera County District Attorney David Linn said he was disappointed, but said he was not surprised that the men were granted parole. 'We’re very much opposed to releasing him,' Linn said on Wednesday. 'We sent our senior prosecutor there to argue in person, rather than a letter, because we felt it is important enough for the people of Chowchilla to make sure he stay in prison for as long as possible.' Buried alive: This is the trailer where the children escape from their armed captors - thanks to the bravery of the bus driver . The van: This is how it looked on Friday, July 23, 1976 inside the van in which 26 Chowchilla school children and their bus driver were held captive after being abducted . LInn attributed parole to the prison system's overcrowding. 'The word has been on the street within government circles for the past couple of months that they were going to go ahead and grant it,' he said. 'Considering what’s been happening throughout the whole California prison system, I’m not surprised,' Linn added. Linn said that his main focus is helping the victims come to terms with the news and to help them recover from their irreversible trauma. 'I did everything I could to resist it. Even his current attorneys wanted to meet with me and I refused to do that,' he said. 'What I want to do now is reach out to the victims, let them know we’re here for them.' Survivors: The Chowchilla victims kidnapped in 1976 recount the horrors they faced later in life as a result of their childhood trauma . Brown Hyde is no longer afraid of her captors but feels as though they should be serving life in prison and said that she could never forgive them. 'But for me it’s a feeling of injustice because we were told they would never get out,' she said. 'They got life in prison. It feels like a betrayal because the legal team that put them there, the DA and the judge, later came out on their side and said they never should have served this long. That’s what I have a hard time with. … Money can obviously buy you freedom.' 'I have to deal with the fact that I still struggle with forgiveness,' Brown Hyde said. 'I will never forget, but it was such a traumatic ordeal that even as a Christian it’s difficult for me to forgive. That’s how bad it was.'","James Schoenfeld who kidnapped 26 children and their school bus driver in Chowchilla nearly 40 years ago was granted parole on Wednesday .

"There can't always be a TV camera rolling when the big news happens - and Saturday Night Live has taken network news to task for how they paper over the cracks. The NBC sketch show parodied the daytime CNN Newsroom, which turned into a series of let-downs when it emerged there was no footage for the stories they were covering. But the ingenious producers for the skit managed to cover up with abysmal animations to illustrate the Germanwings crash, U.S.-Iran diplomacy, and domestic politics. Scroll down for video . Cutting edge: SNL writers joked that CNN's animations look like they belong in 1985. Above was 'their impression' of what the doomed pilot of the crashed Germanwings jet may have looked like trying to get into the cockpit . Real thing: Above is an actual animation CNN aired to illustrate the pilot not being able to get back in . An informative graphic of a man opening a door, and a producer's image of what the doomed pilot going to the bathroom may have looked like graced the screens, mocking their coverage of the tragedy. It was seemingly inspired by a much-derided, clunky animation of a man hammering on a cockpit door. Cecily Strong, playing anchor Brooke Baldwin, introduced a badly-animated hand grasping at a doorknob. A reporter then chimed in: 'We were lucky to get the same team who did the Dire Straits Money for Nothing music video in 1985.' The problems continued when CNN was unable to get a fly-on-the-wall view of Iran's nuclear negotiations - and went for a puppet show instead. Bobby Moynihan, playing a reporter on the ground, explained by saying: 'We couldn't get any footage from the actual negotiations - but once again CNN has the next best thing'. 'Next best thing': For its next story, CNN had no footage of the Iran nuclear animations, so went with Muppets-style puppets . Absurd: The network was imagined providing imagery for coverage of Indiana's religious freedom law through the medium of interpretative dance . Viewers were confronted with four Muppets-style puppets, including one representing John Kerry. A handshake to celebrate a deal being struck quickly escalated, with the Secretary of State sharing a passionate kiss with a U.S. diplomat. The theater of the absurd peaked when the network admitted it hadn't bothered to send anybody to Indiana to cover the controversial religious freedom law there - so demonstrated with an interpretative dance instead. They later added in 'random commentary' from Don Lemon, played by Michael Che, which consisted of the anchor repeating 'black people need to pull up their pants.' Then segment received a rapturous response on social media, with dozens of fans tweeting their appreciation. Against the grain: Donald Trump spoke out against the skit, which he said was insensitive . Even some CNN personnel enjoyed the ribbing. Brenna Williams, an associate producer at the network, said in response to the Iran sketch: 'Don't be surprised if I pitch a puppet politics piece on Monday' However, one high-profile dissenter was Donald Trump, who called laughing at the air disaster 'disgusting'. Earlier in the show, sketchwriters turned their attention to the NCAA finals, hot on the heels of Duke's Blue Devils and the Wisconsin Badgers winning their way into the April 6 final. Jahlil was busy: NBC imagined the impossible scenario of a college basketball player putting his studies ahead of sport . A satirical skit imagined the Blue Devils coach acknowledging that his players were students before athletes - and holding back Jahlil Okafor from the big game so he could revise for a test. Keenan Thompson, posing as head coach Mike Krzyzewski, said star player Okafor would be replaced by a 36-year-old incompetent to bone up on biology instead. He told baffled reporters: 'These guys get paid in education - and if we can't give them that it'd be like Duke didn't pay me my salary of $10million this year, which would be insane!'","Sketch mocked network's coverage of air disaster and other major stories .

"A hotel owner believes he has found the perfect solution for revitalising his flagging business - by converting it into a swingers' paradise. Jon Huxley, 46, hopes to cash in on the Fifty Shades of Grey effect and attract guests from the gay and swinging communities at his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent. He plans to install sex swings, bondage rooms and dungeons and have rooms of differing sizes to cater for couples and multiple groups. Jon Huxley, standing outside his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent, is looking at 'developing' his premises to cater for swingers . He hopes the craze in Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as his object of affection Anastasia Steele, can help transform his business. He said: 'We have plans to attract tourists from the gay and swinging community for short breaks and weekends of adult fun. 'Obviously a lot of equipment will need to be installed like swings, bondage rooms, red room of pain and dungeons of delight. 'We would be having these events each weekend and accepting tourist guests during the week. 'Food and drink will be provided as part of an all-inclusive hotel package and it would be a civilised and friendly environment.' Mr Huxley will be hoping to recreate scenes like this from the hit film Fifty Shades of Grey . Clothing will be optional and privacy for our guests will therefore need to be ensured. 'It is not intended to be a seedy or dirty business. It is a respected clientele who enjoy taking their clothes off.' Mr Huxley said he has decided to appeal to the swinging community after rowing with the council over the use of Grade-II listed building. Jon Huxley hopes the change in hotel ethos can see his business grow . For months he had been in a dispute with Shepway District Council over complaints about its use as a house of multiple occupation for homeless people. Councillors voted for an enforcement notice after neighbours complained of anti-social behaviour. Mr Huxley said the complaints had been about anti-social behaviour and noise from the street rather than from inside the property. He said he would not need a council entertainments licence because there would be no live entertainment, loud music or dancing. Asked what locals might think of his plans he said: 'I do not involve myself in what happens behind their closed doors and they should not involve themselves in what happens behind mine. 'I have bills to pay and the income has to come from somewhere. They have seen fit to take away my current source of guests so I have to look for other sources. 'I can't attract tourists because there isn't a market for it anymore and that is a fact I have to deal with. 'This is a growing market and I can't think of any other market that is growing at the rate of this one. 'Fifty Shades of Grey has been a phenomenal success and this is a sleeping giant in terms of the opportunities that are there.' Mr Huxley, who has owned the hotel for 13 years, said the special weekends would be controlled through advance bookings rather than being open to casual callers. They would be advertised predominantly through the internet or word of mouth with some advertising in 'appropriate places'. A spokesperson for Shepway District Council told MailOnline Travel: 'We would expect the owner to contact the council to discuss any licensing requirements, and to obtain listed building consent for internal works. 'The premises has currently got planning permission to be used as a hotel but does not hold a premises licence to sell alcohol. 'Anything the owner wishes to use it for outside permitted use may well require planning permission or new licences.'

"A 33-year-old Palestinian man says he has been 'duped' into selling a valuable work created by acclaimed British graffiti artist Banksy for less than £100. The popular street artist is believed to have ventured into Gaza earlier this year, leaving behind four murals - including an image depicting the Greek goddess Niobe cowering amid the rubble. That painting, titled 'Bomb Damage,' was drawn on the metal door that formed the last remaining part of a two-story house belonging to the Dardouna family in northern Gaza. But unaware that Banksy's works are usually valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds, Rabie Dardouna said he has been tricked into selling the door to a local artist for just £100. But having been told of its true value, Mr Dardouna is now demanding the decorated door is returned. In place: The painting, titled 'Bomb Damage,' was drawn on a metal door that formed the last remaining part of a two-story house belonging to the Dardouna family in northern Gaza . Unaware that Banksy's works have been valued for hundreds of thousands of pounds, Rabie Dardouna said he has been tricked into selling the door (left) for just £100. Pictured is how the door frame looks now . Speaking of the sale, Mr Dardouna said: 'I did not know that it was this valuable. I heard it can be sold for millions. Now I want the door back.' Artwork: Belal Khaled agreed to show reporters the mural on condition that its location not be revealed . He admitted, however, that he still has no idea who Banksy and struggles to pronounce his name. Meanwhile the Gaza artist who bought the door, Belal Khaled, said he did not mean to trick anyone, had no intention of profiting from the purchase and simply wanted to protect the painting. 'I bought the painting to protect its artistic value and preserve it from damage,' he said. 'Another reason is to display it in other places as well. I don't have any monetary interest in this.' Mr Khaled added that he has been in touch with Banksy's representatives, hoping to get a clearance to showcase the mural in Gaza art exhibits. The debate over the issue has heated up on Facebook, with Palestinian activists and journalists accusing the buyer of tricking the Dardounas family while others have defended him for buying it legally and not simply stealing it from the unguarded bomb site. Mr Khaled agreed to show reporters the mural on condition that its location not be revealed. The Dardouna home was one of 18,000 destroyed in the 50-day war between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers last summer.

"Police remain hopeful they will find missing 11-year-old Luke Shambrook who went missing from a campsite in Victoria on Friday. An increased number of police and other emergency crews continue to scour the thick bushland areas around Lake Eildon in an effort to find the boy. Search co-ordinator Acting Senior Sergeant Andrew Walker said Luke had a “very high pain tolerance”, a factor that would work in his favour given he has now been missing for days. Scroll down for video . The Shambrook family with children (left to right) Luke, 11, Lauren, 7, and Matthew, 10 . Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since . “Hence the reason why we’re out searching. We’re still hopeful that we can find him,” Sgt Walker said. The 11-year-old, who is autistic, was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. Luke has now been missing for four days. A Victorian Police spokeswoman told AAP late on Sunday that a family saw a young boy matching Lukes description while they were driving in the Devils River vicinity. With temperatures dropping to as low as eight degree Celsius, Senior Sergeant Ralph Willingham believes that the fourth day of searching will have a further level of urgency. 'The advice I'm getting from our search and rescue experts having regard to the overnight temperatures and the daytime temperatures is that he could well still be out there,' he said. 'We've got to be realists but we're positive, the family's positive.' However, Luke may not even know he is lost and is known to frequently hide, according to his family. He was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon at 9.30am on Good Friday. Luke has limited speech and his family says he is probably confused, and he may not even be aware he is lost. Campers are helping rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES volunteers in the search of thick bushland. Police hold hope that Luke has been able to stay reasonably warm as he was last seen wearing a beanie and warm jacket. There was a moment of hope when a beanie was found by the search party, however it was decided it did not belong to Luke.

Having met Luke's family during a push to open a special school in Melbourne's southeast, Opposition emergency services spokeman Brad Battin says it's devastating to hear the 11-year-old is missing. He says Luke's parents Tim and Rachel have been updating him on the search and appreciate the efforts of all those out looking for their little boy. 'He's a lovely young kid,' Mr Battin told AAP on Sunday. 'He displays all the characteristics of a child with autism, which means he might not even think he is lost.' Sergeant Greg Paul says the search is focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush, we've got a lot searchers searching all the tracks and in between the tracks and the gullies and the spurs,' he told reporters on Saturday. The Shambrook family has thanked emergency service workers, volunteers, family and friends for their help. They say the disappearance is completely out of character for him. A widespread search is being carried by search and rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES members, along with campers around the surrounding areas. A large search is being carried by a medley of search and rescue teams . Sergeant Greg Paul said the search was focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush,' he told reporters on Saturday. 'We've also got people walking the banks of the lake.' But he outlined a serious hurdle for the search efforts, according to ABC. 'With the autistic condition, Luke might not respond to searchers, he may not even know that he's lost,' he said. 'He won't necessarily respond to his name being called, but that might change a little bit as he gets hungry maybe. Sgt Paul said there were hundreds of other campers in the area over the busy Easter period, so there was a chance someone else could spot Luke. Luke is described as being of medium build, about 150 cm tall with olive skin, brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black windcheater, black t-shirt, grey track-pants, grey boots and a scarf.

"A former elementary school teacher who police say was obsessed with one of her 11-year-old students has waived a preliminary hearing on a felony charge that she interfered with the girl's legal custody. Geraldine Alcorn, 29, of Pittsburgh, and her attorney declined to comment as they walked from a city magistrate's courtroom Wednesday. In exchange for the waiver — which means Alcorn must now stand trial on the charge or take some kind of plea bargain — Allegheny County prosecutors dropped two other misdemeanors she faced: luring a child into a vehicle and corruption of minors. Leaving court: Geraldine Alcorn, left, leaves court on Wednesday April 1, 2015, in Pittsburgh after waiving a preliminary hearing on  Wednesday on a felony charge that she interfered with the girl's custody . Geraldine Alcorn, pictured walking to court on Wednesday, allegedly encrypted her phone number on the girl's math homework, exchanged thousands of text messages with her and even spoke of adopting her . Obsessed teacher: Geraldine Alcorn, 28, faces multiple charges for 'obsessively' texting an 11-year-old student . Prosecutors, who also declined to comment, allege Alcorn encrypted her phone number on the girl's math homework, exchanged thousands of text messages with her and even talked of adopting and running away with the girl before Alcorn resigned last month. The girl's mother, a single parent, complained to school officials after finding out Alcorn had visited the girl at their home while the mother was working. The mother then found stickers and letters from Alcorn in the girl's school binder, plus two letters the girl wrote to Alcorn with three headings: 'Things Ms. Alcorn and I can do,' ''what we can do,' and 'when we can do it,' the criminal complaint said. The girl told police she and Alcorn kept their relationship secret and, among other things, Alcorn discussed adopting the girl or taking her from her home. Alcorn had told the girl that 'they would be on the run for a while,' if Alcorn followed through on that, police said. Alcorn is not believed to have sexual feelings for the girl but allegedly told police of a 'deep love' she has for her. Pittsburgh Public Schools officials learned Feb. 13 that 'a teacher had developed an improper attachment' with a student at Pittsburgh Beechwood, a pre-K-5 school. Alcorn resigned March 2. Police said she tried to contact the girl on March 13, a Friday, when Alcorn returned to gather her personal belongings. The following Monday, police said, the girl found 'gifts and several letters, some encrypted, in her locker and desk,' according to the criminal complaint. 'The letters, written by Alcorn, instructed the 11-year-old female to contact her.'

"When it comes to getting a stunning view of New York, most people would be content with taking a trip to the top of the Empire State building. But not this teenager, who goes by the name of Dark.Cyanide. Instead he climbs up some of the city's tallest buildings, without ropes or harnesses, before sitting on precarious ledges - all in the name of capturing the perfect photograph. Many of the 18-year-old's vertigo-inducing images, which include some shot 72 storeys above street level, show his feet dangling hundreds of feet above the city streets below in his trademark turquoise trainers. Scroll down for video . Dizzying: These images were all captured by a New York teenager who goes by the name of Dark.Cyanide and scales some of the city's tallest buildings in search of the perfect view . Night vision: The 18-year-old describes himself as an 'urban historian' and says he likes photographing New York because it is huge and constantly changing . On a mission: He says that security guards often stop him from scaling the buildings, but even if he can get past the guards, he has to tackle fierce winds which blow above the streets .

Bright lights: The Chrysler Building is pictured as night falls across New York, as the rest of the city lights up in the background . He says that building security often stops him from climbing some landmarks, but even if he can get past the guards, battling strong winds at high altitude often presents an even bigger challenge. He said: 'What I like the most about photographing New York is that it's huge. I can never stop finding new places to photograph and go wandering into. 'The city is always growing and always providing new views with new skyscrapers being built. I am most fascinated by the views and different vantage points I come across.

"Facebook is often linked with depression, social anxiety and other mental health issues. But a new scheme hopes to reverse this reputation by using the site to instead find cures and improve treatments for diseases using the DNA of its members. Genes for Good is a Facebook app designed to survey the health of millions of social network users, who can also submit spit samples to tie their survey results to their genes. Genes for Good (pictured) is a Facebook app designed to survey the health of millions of social network users, who can also send in spit samples to tie their survey results to their genes. It was set up by biostatisticians from the University of Michigan and is available over 18s in the US . It was set up by biostatisticians from the University of Michigan, and although the app is hosted by Facebook, the site is not affiliated with the scheme in any other way. The app is available for free from Facebook's store but is only currently open to people aged over 18 with a valid mailing address in the US. The researchers don't have any plans to extend it outside of the US at the moment, but this may change depending on how successful the scheme is. Once a user has read and accepted the terms and conditions, which doubles up as a consent form, they are presented with health surveys they  complete each day. Sending a spit sample is voluntary, and users only become eligible once they've completed 15 of the Health History Survey questions, and each of the Health Tracking Surveys over two separate days.

Participants can withdraw at any time by clicking the withdrawal link in the Facebook app under the 'Your Account' option in the upper right corner of the site. After withdrawing, Genes For Good keeps the survey responses but deletes the participant's name and unique Facebook ID from its database. It also removes addresses, including an IP address and physical address, and phone numbers but keeps their age, sex, and zip code information. It also keeps the DNA. These questionnaires relate to a user's health, habits, attitudes, and relationships and the Health Tracking Surveys provide detailed information about how a person's health changes over time. After completing each survey, uses can view their own results as well as see summaries about other how these results compare to other participants. Once requested, a 'spit kit' is sent free of charge and the firm said DNA obtained from this sample will be frozen and 'stored indefinitely' in a secure laboratory supervised by the researchers. The researchers explained: 'Our goal is to accelerate genetic and health research using social media. 'We will use the information you provide to advance our understanding of genetics, disease, behaviour, human ancestry, and our relationships around the world. 'The findings from this research may benefit many individuals, for generations to come, as we learn more about how our genes affect our lives. 'You can also use capabilities in Genes for Good to track your lifestyle, habits and activities, and compare yourself to other participants. Each member who submits a spit sample will also see a copy of their results, which include their genetic ancestry as well as raw genetic data  in a securely encrypted computer file. Similar services, such as those offered by genealogy sites like Ancestry, cost $99 in the US and £99 in the UK. This applies to the first 2,000 kits sent out by Genes For Good. The scheme has not revealed whether kits will then need to be paid for, or if this is a limited number. MailOnline has contacted the university for more information. Sending a spit sample (illustrated) is voluntary.

'We use Facebook because of its vast existing social network, continued the researchers. 'Using Facebook will allow the study to grow both quickly and optimally through word of mouth. 'Otherwise, the study is independent of Facebook. Facebook cannot access the information you provide to Genes for Good. 'You can stop participating at any time. You can stop answering surveys or you can delete the app from your Facebook account.' Apple recently announced an initiative called ResearchKit that plans to gather health data from iPhone users. It will use, on a voluntary basis, data from medical tracking apps to help research asthma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Apple's senior vice president of Operations Jeff Williams said: 'ResearchKit is made for medical researchers, it lets them easily create apps.' Apple worked with University of Oxford, Stanford and others to develop this project. The Genes For Good's connection with Facebook may concern privacy campaigners following claims earlier this week that the social network tracks users, even if they've opted out. Facebook has more than 1.3 billion users but there are millions more visits from people who are not signed up. Researchers from the University of Leuven said Facebook puts tracking cookies on internet users' laptops, PCs and phones when the visit facebook.com so it can target them with online advertising. But Facebook today said the report is inaccurate and the researchers had persistently ignored its request to meet. A spokesman said: 'This report contains factual inaccuracies. The authors have never contacted us, nor sought to clarify any assumptions upon which their report is based. Neither did they invite our comment on the report before making it public. 'However, we remain willing to engage with them and hope they will be prepared to update their work in due course.'

"A former special education high school teacher who admitted to having sex with five underage male students has been sentenced to three years in state prison. Summer Michelle Hansen, 32, of California entered a guilty plea in February to 16 felony counts related to the sex acts which included seven counts of oral copulation of a minor, six counts of statutory rape and three counts of distributing pornographic material to a child, according to NBC. The mother of three was told during the sentencing on Friday that she must also register as a sex offender for life.

On Friday, one of the victim's mother referred to Hansen as a 'predator' in court and said she 'stalked my child in the sanctuary of a school'. The mother also said she was disappointed in the judicial system that gave Hansen a 'ridiculously low offer'.

"Sydneysiders missed out on Saturday night's lunar eclipse, but Melbourne and Adelaide residents had a spectacular view of the 'blood moon' as it lit up the sky. Wet and cloudy weather was to blame in Sydney, where the Sydney Observatory said the short lunar began at 10.58pm (AEDT) and finished at 11.03pm. 'Our live feed from Griffith Observatory is showing gorgeous totality pink!' observatory staff wrote on Twitter at about 11pm, accompanying their tweet with a picture of equipment showing off the bright pink moon. Scroll down for video . The lunar eclipse as seen from Melbourne on Easter Saturday, April 4. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon is completely in the Earth's shadow . Wet and cloudy weather was to blame for Sydneysiders missing out on the view, but the Sydney Observatory captured every moment with their equipment . Brisbane was also predicted to miss out due to bad weather, but the moon was pictured revealing itself through rain clouds towards the end of a total lunar eclipse . The beginning of the eclipse was captured from behind leaves illuminated by a street light in Canberra on Saturday . 'It's highly likely that it will still be cloudy,' The Bureau of Meteorology's Chris Webb had said of Sydney, adding that a break in the clouds at precisely the right moment could still present a slim chance for hopeful sky gazers. Brisbane, Darwin, Canberra and Hobart residents were also promised slim chance of viewing the phenomenon due to poor weather conditions, but clear night skies were predicted for Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth. Those faced with bad weather may not have missed out on much however, with the event being one of the shortest lunar eclipses of the century. 'Some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality, which will make it the shortest since 1917, but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592,' Sydney Observatory astronomer Andrew Smith told the ABC earlier.

Residents of Auckland in New Zealand also had a spectacular view of the 'blood moon' A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the edge of the earth's shadow. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. Part of the lunar eclipse is seen behind fully bloomed cherry blossoms in Utsunomiya in Tochigi prefecture, 100km north of Tokyo on April 4 .

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its 'blood red' appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. Simon Allen, BOM's senior meteorologist, told the ABC that Adelaide would have the clearest skies out of all the states - where the partial eclipse began at 8.45pm and the peak at 10:30pm. In Brisbane, cloudy conditions and showers were forecast, denting the chances of seeing the eclipse. There was no rain in Melbourne, where an uninterrupted view of the lunar event began at 9:15pm and peaked at 11pm. Less positive wass the forecast for Hobart, which was for clouds and a 20 per cent chance of rain. The same was also expected in Canberra and a late storm was due in Darwin, however the former managed to clear up enough for some to see the lunar show. Those who miss out will have to wait until January 31, 2018, for the next lunar eclipse visible from Australia. As did the Echo Park district of Los Angeles.

"A sailor who vanished after heading out to sea more than two months ago has miraculously been found alive and well off the North Carolina coast. Louis Jordan, 37, was picked up by a German-flagged ship at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday - 66 days after he took off to do some fishing. He was found sitting on the capsized hull of his sailboat, Angel, which had lost its mast and was approximately 200 miles east of Cape Hatteras. 'They saw me on the front of my boat standing up there waving my arms,' he told the Today show of the huge German ship after he left hospital. 'And they turned that huge skyscraper around.' A Coast Guard helicopter crew from North Carolina flew to the ship and airlifted Jordan to a hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, said Lt. Krystyn Pecora, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard. Scroll down for videos . Found safe: Louis Jordan, second from left, walks from the Coast Guard helicopter to the Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, after being found off the North Carolina coast on Thursday . Jordan's family said he sailed out of a marina in Conway, South Carolina, on January 23, and hadn't been heard from since until a German boat saw him clinging to the hull of his boat on Thursday morning . Rescue: A Coast Guard image shows Jordan being pulled up into the helicopter from a German ship . Safe: One of his rescuers pulls him into the helicopter after he spent more than two months at sea . Heading home: Another image shows Jordan inside the helicopter as they head towards a hospital . Incredibly, she said Jordan was in good condition despite a broken collarbone and dehydration. He survived his ordeal by drinking rain water and eating raw fish and flour fried in oil. As he walked towards the hospital unaided, he did not appear to have lost a drastic amount of weight. He was released from the hospital on Friday. He also told the Today show that he repeatedly read his Bible from cover to cover to pass the time but that the ordeal 'seemed like a lot longer' than 66 days. While stranded, he had dreamed of eating barbecue and organic ice cream, he said. Back on land, he was reunited with his relieved parents. 'I was just praying about you because I was afraid you guys were crying and sad, that, you know, I was dead...and I wasn't dead,' Jordan told his father, WITN reported. His father Frank responded: 'I thought I lost you.' Doing well: Jordan appeared in good health when he was brought to shore. He spoke to the Today show, pictured, after he left hospital and said he didn't know if he'd ever return to sea . Reunited: Jordan is pictured hugging his father Frank after they were reunited following his ordeal . Back together: He said he had been concerned that his parents, Frank and Norma, would think he was dead . Relief: His mother, Norma Davis, said she had given up hope of her son returning 'many time' Speaking to the Today show, his mother, Norma Davis, said it had been an emotional two months and that she had given up hope 'many times'. 'It's been terrible,' she said. 'You live moment to moment and those moments turned into days.' Jordan's 35-foot sailboat had drifted out into the ocean and capsized, snapping the mast. 'My boat got flipped and did a 180 on me while I was sleeping at night, and I was flying through the air and somersaulting and all my junk and all my equipment, all my GPS devices and everything, even my stove dislodged and it was all flying with me, all rolling around,' he told ABC News. But he was unable to repair the mast as he had broken his collarbone when the boat flipped over. He waited for the shoulder to heal slightly before he was able to build up enough strength to fashion a makeshift mast and sail - but he was unable to fight the strong currents, he said, and the boat capsized on two further occasions. He caught rainwater in a bucket and, although he struggled to catch fish at first, he learned that they were attracted to his clothes when he put them in the ocean to clean them, CNN reported. The fish would swim through his clothes so he would scoop them up with a hand net, he said. The tanker crew said it found Jordan sitting on the hull of his boat. On Thursday night Davis posted on Facebook that she had spoken to her son and that he was in 'good spirits and hungry' Rescuers found Jordan sitting on the hull of his 35-foot sailboat that had lost its mast and capsized some 200 miles east off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina . Jordan had been living on his docked sailboat at the Bucksport Plantation Marina in Conway, South Carolina, until January, when he told his family he was 'going into the open water to sail and do some fishing,' his mother said. The family had not heard from him since, she said. 'We expected him to come back and he did not return,' Davis said. 'We knew something happened. To us it's just a miracle. We're just so thrilled that he was found alive... It's been very difficult not knowing anything and I just feel like all of our prayers have come true. They've been answered.' 'We just talked to Louis Jordan-sounded wonderful,' she wrote on Facebook on Thursday night. 'He said that he felt our prayers. He is in good spirits and hungry!' In the weeks before their son was found, Frank wrote about his sadness and worry and asked for prayers on his Facebook page. Two weeks after his disappearance, the father wrote: 'When your son disappears and the weeks wear on, and the weather is cold and the Atlantic is stormy and wild, many horrible thoughts begin to go through your mind, and you begin to unravel. Vessel: Jordan is pictured on his 35-foot boat. It capsized at sea in January, causing the mast to snap off . At sea: Jordan had been living on his docked sailboat in Conway, South Carolina, before he told his family he was 'going into the open water' to go fishing more than two months ago . 'Your life becomes a muddled jumble of prayers and tears and doubts. That is when friends gather around you to lend their support and prayers, too. It is so, so much appreciated.' A few weeks later, he added: 'Nothing from or about Louis. You don't know whether to mourn or what. When they're lost at sea, only God knows where they are. 'But by God, He does. Louis is in His loving hands, and that is enough to know. Thanks for all the messages of concern, a living, moving tribute to his sweet and gentle soul.' Then on Thursday, he could finally write: 'Good news - My son Louis Gregory Jordan was picked up by a freighter several hundred miles off Cape Hatteras.' Jordan had spent months sanding and painting his docked 1950s-era, single-masted sailboat in Conway, where marina manager Jeff Weeks said he saw him nearly every day. Jordan was the only resident in a section of about 20 boats docked behind a coded security gate, Weeks said. 'You'll probably never meet a nicer guy,' Weeks said. 'He is a quiet gentleman that most of the time keeps to himself. He's polite. I would describe him as a gentle giant:' measuring 6-foot-2 and weighing 230 pounds. Rescued: Mr Jordan is pulled up into the helicopter after being attached to a device by a rescuer . Rleief: The sailor, who was lost for more than two months, is reeled into the rescue chopper . Salvation: A rescuer is hoisted up after attaching Louis Jordan to the winch . Jordan appeared to be knowledgeable about wild fruits and mushrooms and fished for his meal in inland waterways, Weeks said. But his January trip may have been his first time sailing in the open ocean. 'He might sail up and down the Intercoastal Waterway, but he didn't have the experience he needed to go out into the ocean,' Weeks said. Records show that Louis Jordan sailed out of the marina in Conway, on January 23, aboard the sailboat Angel, said Marilyn Fajardo, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard's 7th District. Fajardo said the Coast Guard in Miami was notified by Frank Jordan on January 29 that he hadn't seen or heard from his son in a week. One week later, Davis confirmed their son was still missing. Fajardo said alerts were issued from New Jersey to Miami to be on the lookout for Jordan and his sailboat. Officials also searched financial data to determine whether Jordan actually had come ashore without being noticed, but found no indication that he had, she said. Officials searched financial data to determine whether Jordan actually had come ashore without being noticed, but found no indication that he had . Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss said Jordan's 35-foot sailboat had lost its mast and capsized. The German tanker crew said it found Jordan sitting on the hull . A search was begun on February 8, but Fajardo said the Coast Guard abandoned its efforts after 10 days. Despite reports from other sailors claiming to have seen Jordan's sailboat, none of the sightings were confirmed and the case was suspended. The Coast Guard said Jordan didn't file a 'float plan,' the nautical equivalent of a flight plan, to determine his route or destination, and Fajardo said there wasn't enough information to narrow down his whereabouts. Davis said she is looking forward to celebrating her son's return. 'We do plan on having a wonderful Easter celebration with family and I can't wait to get him back,' she said - but neither she nor her son were sure he'd ever head back to see. 'I don't know,' he responded. See below for video .","Louis Jordan, 37, had been missing at sea for more than two months before he was picked up off the North Carolina coast by a ship on Thursday .

"An adorable orphaned wombat has found herself a new friend - and a very prickly pillow. Chloe the wombat, who first made headlines after her special bond with her surrogate zookeeper mum emerged last December, has found herself a new buddy at Taronga Zoo's grounds in Sydney after she moved into her new digs alongside a couple of echidnas. In an adorable video uploaded to Instagram by Taronga Zoo, Chloe is seen trying to take a nap in the mud on one of the echidnas. As she rolled over to snuggle up, the echidna moved away but Chloe still rested her eyes for a moment before getting up. Scroll down for video . Chloe the wombat has mistaken her new echidna friend for a pillow at Taronga Zoo . She recently moved into her new digs alongside a couple of echidnas who don't seem as eager to snuggle as she is . 'Chloe wasted no time making friends with her spiky new housemates and they've been busy digging in the soft dirt together,' Taronga Zoo said. When she's not napping, Chloe likes to follows her zoo keeper Evelyn Weston around the zoo. ‘It’s a natural behaviour and something Chloe would be doing with her real mother if she’d survived,’ Evelyn said. Adorable wombat Chloe is now one-year-old and lives at Taronga Zoo in Sydney . She has become zoo keeper Evelyn Weston's little helper and follows her around the zoo . ‘Wombats stay with their mothers for up to two years, walking by their side until they’re old enough to fend for themselves.’ The pair have been inseparable since Chloe came to the zoo three months ago after her mother was struck and killed by a car near Jenolan Caves, west of the Blue Mountains, in June 2014. Chloe stays by Evelyn’s side while she cleans out exhibits and prepares breakfast for the other animals during morning walks. She is fed by a bottle every five hours and has her own makeshift pouch.

Keepers at the zoo have also built the joey a home where she can dig burrows and forage for her own food. ‘She’s really learning how to be a wombat. Her paws are already toughening up and she’s quite happy digging about on her own,’ said Evelyn. When the time comes for Chloe to be released back into the wild she will first be transferred to a wombat ‘halfway house’. But Evelyn admitted she’ll be a little sad to lose her. ‘I’ve been doing this job for a long time, but it’s always hard to say goodbye. I like to think I’ve toughened up, but sometimes I’m still a wuss,’ she said. ‘She’s really learning how to be a wombat,' zoo keeper Evelyn says .

"ABC is  filming a pilot episode of The Muppet Show, in the hopes of bringing the beloved variety show back to the small screen. The network has asked Big Bang Theory co-creator Bill Prady to mastermind the revival, which would see the return of Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and other old favorites. New Muppets TV content hasn't been since since Muppets Tonight ended in 1998, though old episodes have been re-run extensively and several movies have been filmed. Scroll down for video . Light the lights? Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy could be back on TV screens soon if a planned pilot of a rebooted Muppets Show proves a success . A 'proof of concept' presentation for advertising executives is in the works already, ABC confirmed to DailyMail.com. Filming is due to take place next weekend at a Disney studio in Burbank, California - and will see some original Muppet puppeteers take the reins again. The episode will start with Muppets stalwarts including Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo gathering at ABC Studios in the hope of getting the new show off the ground. But the cuddly characters will apparently have a problem to solve - Miss Piggy hasn't agreed to join in, and is reluctant to get involved so long as she is going through a rough patch with her on-off lover Kermit. Details of the new episode were first reported by The Hollywood Reporter. Gang's all here: The new series will feature a host of favorites including Gonzo, bottom right, Fozzie Bear, center right, Animal, top center, and Rowlf the Dog, top left . Sources told them new characters including a girlfriend and in-laws for Fozzie Bear could also be on the way.

"Marylin Stoneman, pictured leaving court, stole more than £22,000 from her vulnerable victim to fund her gambling addiction . A gambling addict stole more than £22,000 from her grandmother's 98-year-old partner to blow on her scratchcard habit, a court heard. Marylin Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's pin number, cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into care at Cedar House, Rothley. But the court heard that she abused that trust and began withdrawing up to £200 a day to feed her gambling habit. The 64-year-old admitted stealing £22,650 from the elderly victim but was ordered to pay back just £1,350 - which was all that remained of the stolen funds. The theft was  discovered after the deputy manager of the care home became suspicious that Stoneman's step-grandfather, Douglas Woodrow, was receiving a number of letters from the bank. On August 19, he asked a member of staff to open one of the letters which indicated the victim had no money left in his accounts. The care home alerted Lloyds Bank in Loughborough, where they noticed unauthorised cash withdrawals had taken place from July 2013 and the police were contacted. Leicester Crown Court heard that Stoneman was 'solely responsible' and 'had been waiting for the police.' She had also taken an overdose as a result, the court heard. The devastated victim, who had gone into the care home in Leicestershire after a number of falls, said he felt angry and betrayed by Stoneman. In a statement read to the court, Mr Woodrow said: 'She has stole money from my bank account which is my life savings. It is what I have paid for my care. 'I am so angry she has taken everything. I am angry at everyone. It has really hurt me. 'I have worked hard all my life to be left with nothing. 'I can't trust anyone.' Defending Stoneman, who has no previous convictions, Vasanti Vaitha said: 'It was a relief when the police knocked on the door. She had been waiting for it for a long time. 'She does take full responsibility - and realises the impact it has had on the family. Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's financial affairs after he went into care at Cedar House, Rothley . 'This offence occurred from a gambling addiction while she was looking after the victim's finances. Her gambling spiralled out of control. 'She tried to take her own life.' Judge Michael Fowler said: 'I know you understand the meanness and seriousness of what you have done. 'It is more serious that Mr Woodrow trusted you. And the fact the funds you took were funds he had accumulated over his life and depended on them to some extent to pay for his care home fees. 'I can't ignore the fact that addictions do exist and there is no other motivation.' She was handed a suspended sentence of two years with 200 hours of unpaid work and be part of a supervision requirement for 18 months. The judge also stated that £1,350 would be confiscated for compensation and any sums recovered in the future should be paid to Mr Woodrow.

"More than 10,000 dogs a year are poisoned after eating everyday items such as paracetamol and chocolate, a pet charity has warned. The Kennel Club says seemingly harmless foods such as hot cross buns and onions can be killers – and is urging owners to be alert to the threat. Around 56,000 dogs were treated for poisoning between 2010 and 2014, according to figures compiled by the charity and the Veterinary Poisons Information Service. Of those, 470 dogs died. Sick: Around 56,000 dogs were treated for poisoning by vets between 2010 and 2014 . Unlike Crufts prizewinner Jagger the Irish setter, who died last month after eating meat laced with poison, most poisoned pets will simply have eaten something they found lying around the home or fallen ill after being fed treats by their well-meaning owners. Painkillers were the most common cause of poisoning, followed by rat and mouse bait and chocolate – which can cause sickness, diarrhoea and fits and trigger heart problems. Dark chocolate is particularly toxic. Foods such as sultanas, grapes and raisins are also highly dangerous for dogs, causing canine kidneys to fail. Dried forms of the fruit found in cakes are the most toxic. Onions, garlic and leeks can cause life-threatening anaemia. Nick Sutton, a Kennel Club poisons expert, said: ‘There are any number of ways a dog can get access to dangerous and potentially lethal substances, whether by accident, deliberate feeding or through owners mistakenly believing certain products – particularly foods eaten by humans – are fine for a dog to eat. ‘Many seemingly harmless foods can be dangerous for a dog and owners need to be aware of these risks in order to protect their much-loved pets.’ The popularity of e-cigarettes has seen them feature more prominently among poisoning cases, with 64 dogs taken to the vet in 2014 after chewing the nicotine-rich refills – an increase of 300 per cent. However, many more cases are suspected to have occurred, because not all poisonings are reported. Chewing gum was another major cause of poisoning. Just one pack of gum can prove deadly, causing dangerous drops in blood sugar and liver failure. If you fear your dog has been poisoned, the Kennel Club urges owners to contact their vet immediately, even if their dog appears well, as it can take several days before symptoms appear. Mr Sutton said: ‘Dogs are very intelligent, very curious and have a great sense of smell. ‘But we have to be careful about feeding them things that aren’t intended for them.’","About 56,000 dogs treated by vets for poisoning between 2010 and 2014 .

"Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has labelled Nigel Farage a 'd***' during last night's leader's debate. The former England footballer launched the scathing attack on the head of Ukip after leaders from each of the seven largest parties went head-to-head for the first time in the historic TV election debate. Opinion polls produced mixed results on who had 'won' the contest, with ComRes survey showing that 40 per cent of voters think David Cameron is 'most capable of leading the country', while others backed SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and others putting Ed Miliband ahead. Scroll down for videos . Leader of Ukip Nigel Farage has come under attack for his controversial comments made on the TV election debate last night . Match of the Day pundit Gary Lineker labelled Mr Farage a 'd***' after claimed that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment . Mr Farage topped the list for worst and best performing leaders after his controversial comments that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment. The debate spurred a flurry of reaction from footballing stars on Twitter who came out to give their opinions on the leaders. Mr Lineker tweeted: 'Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!' He took another dig at the Ukip leader later on writing: 'Who would you back? I reckon Farage would leather it over the bar. And blame the foreign goalkeeper for moving.' Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was also left uninspired by the debate, tweeting: 'Unfortunately, none of these people on that stage engage with the generation of today.' The former England player took another dig at the Ukip leader later on writing: 'Who would you back? I reckon Farage would leather it over the bar. And blame the foreign goalkeeper for moving' Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was also left uninspired by the debate tweeting that the leaders had failed to engage with today's generation . The Match of the Day presenter launched the scathing attack on the head of Ukip after leaders from each of the seven largest parties went head-to-head for the first time in the historic TV election debate . Mr Miliband, whose hopes of using the debate to catapult him into Number 10 floundered last night, also came under fire. The Labour leader fell flat during the clash, and was left lost for words after being challenged on live TV by Nick Clegg to apologise for Labour crashing the economy. Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Sol Campbell criticised the Labour leader on Twitter saying: 'I've captained a number of teams and it's clear to see Miliband is no leader.' While Mr Lineker suggested a different way to settle the debate. 'Can this please end with a penalty shoot-out. #leadersdabate.' It was the first time ever that leaders of the seven largest parties had gone head-to-head in a televised election debate . Both Mr Farage and Labour leader Ed Miliband faced criticism for their performances at the ITV debate . A BBC Spokesperson said: 'Gary has no involvement in any BBC programmes involving news, current affairs or politics. In common with other such presenters, therefore, he is able to express views on personal social media and that has no bearing on the BBC's impartiality.' In the first debate of its kind, lots were drawn in advance to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The seven party leaders clashed repeatedly on spending and the future of the NHS, as Mr Cameron bluntly told Mr Miliband: 'It's a service not a weapon.' Mr Farage launched into a controversial rant on 'health tourism', complaining about people with HIV who come to Britain in search of treatment. But Miss Wood, leader of Welsh Nationalists Plaid Cymru, won the first significant applause of the night as she accused Mr Farage of 'dangerous scaremongering' for blaming migrants for problems in the NHS. She told him he should be 'ashamed' of himself. Mr Farage caused outrage after he said that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment. Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Sol Campbell got stuck in to Labour leader Ed Miliband saying he was 'no leader' Mr Lineker suggested a more football-friendly way to end the debate- with a penalty shoot-out . He said: 'Here's a fact and I'm sure that other people will be mortified that I dare to talk about it. 'There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive. 'It's not a good place for any of them to be I know, but 60 per cent of them are not British nationals. 'They're both blaming each other and they're both right' - Ed Miliband on David Cameron and Nick Clegg. 'When he was in the Cabinet about half a million people lost their jobs so never mind zero-hours, with Ed there'd be zero jobs' - David Cameron on Ed Miliband. 'Nigel Farage talks about 'remember history'. The Farage family were foreigners once. I'm married to a foreigner. You are married to a foreigner' - Nick Clegg to Nigel Farage. 'What's going on here? Get real, please' - Nigel Farage to everyone else. 'The answer is investing more in homes and public services and enforcing a decent minimum wage, not scapegoating immigrants' - Nicola Sturgeon . 'You don't have to go on voting for the lesser of two evils. That's how we ended up with the tired, failed politics that we have now' - Natalie Bennett. 'It was not Polish care workers or Estonian bar workers who caused this economic crisis - it was bankers' - Leanne Wood. 'You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 a year per patient. 'I know there are some horrible things happening in many part of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.' At the end of the historic contest, Mr Miliband said: 'You've heard from seven leaders tonight. But there's one fundamental choice. 'If I'm Prime Minister I will make sure everyone will play by the same rules. If I'm Prime Minister we will cut the deficit every year. 'I believe that when working people succeed Britain succeeds. If you believe in that too, then I ask for your vote.' Mr Cameron had the last word, after drawing the final slot, telling viewers: 'I've been your Prime Minister for the last five years and all that time I've tried to have one task in mind above all others. 'And that has been turning our economy around, putting the country back to work and clearing up the mess that was left to us. 'I want to stand for another five years because I want us to finish the job that we have all started. We've created two million jobs. Let's create a job for everyone that wants and needs one.' The Prime Minister had been accused ahead of the clash of 'running scared' after dodging a head-to-head showdown with the Labour leader. After Mr Cameron objected to broadcasters' plans for three TV debates during the five-and-a-half week campaign, the ITV show marked the only occasion before the May 7 election where the Tory and Labour leaders faced each other.","Gary Lineker launched the scathing attack after  historic election debate .

"The U.S. Army Sergeant who left his post in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years was found to have be 'going over to the other side with a deliberate plan,' according to a former military intelligence officer. Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer said on Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor on Monday night that Bowe Bergdahl 'had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban.' The former military intelligence officer said he had been told the information by  two senior sources who knew about a 2009 Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigation into Bergdahl's activities. Scroll down for video . Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army Sergeant who left his post in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years was found to have be 'going over to the other side with a deliberate plan,' according to a former military intelligence officer . The investigation reportedly included a forensic review of Bergdahl's computer which showed his apparent intent to travel to Uzbekistan. 'He had made contact with local Afghans and wanted to be moved to Uzbekistan and then made contact with the Russians because he wanted to talk to Russian organized crime,' Shaffer told O'Reilly. 'Clearly he was not all there relating to what he was doing. I think we're going to see more and more, as this report is made public that there were a number of disconcerting things within Bergdahl.' Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer (pictured)  said on Fox News ' 'The O'Reilly Factor' on Monday night that Bowe Bergdahl 'had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban. Both are very severe' He said the NCIS investigaiton,  which included interviews with squad mates, indicated that Bergdahl made contact with an Afghan in an attempt to prepare for his departure. Bowe Bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice . 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty': . Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.' It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case . MAXIMUM SENTENCE: 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': . Article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' MAXIMUM SENTENCE: life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . Army officials announced Thursday that his Article 32 hearing will be held July 8 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas - he is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. That proceeding is similar to a civilian grand jury. From there, it could be referred to a court-martial and go to trial. His attorney says Bergdahl was trying to find a U.S. general officer to report a disturbing situation when he left his combat outpost. Eugene Fidell, the attorney leading Bergdahl's defense, said in a letter released this week that the Army major general who investigated Bergdahl's capture in Afghanistan found he did not intend to remain away from his base permanently. Bergdahl disappeared in June, 2009 from a combat post in Paktika Province in eastern Afghanistan and was captured by the Taliban. He spent five years as a prisoner of war before he was freed last summer in a prisoner swap that angered members of congress members and some members of his unit. After an investigation of the circumstances of his capture, Bergdahl was charged this week with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, counts that could lead to life in prison. Documents released by his defense lawyers suggested the tack they may take in defending Bergdahl. The papers also included a statement from Bergdahl about his attempts to escape from his Taliban captors and his beatings while a prisoner. In a March 2 letter to Army General Mark Milley, who was responsible for deciding how to proceed with the case, Fidell said an investigation by an Army major general had concluded that Bergdahl did not plan to desert. 'While hedging its bets, the report basically concludes that Sergeant Bergdahl did not intend to remain away from the Army permanently, as classic 'long' desertion requires,' Fidell wrote. 'It also concludes that his specific intent was to bring what he thought were disturbing circumstances to the attention of the nearest general office,' he added. Bowe Bergdahl, shown before his handover to US troops in May 2014 . Fidell declined to elaborate further on Friday. Bergdahl was released in exchange for five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo Bay. They were sent to Qatar and had to remain there for a year. Some U.S. lawmakers were angered by Bergdahl's release because they were not given 30 days notice before the transfer of the Guantanamo prisoners, as required by law. Some fellow soldiers also said he had deserted. 'While many Americans have taken a broader and more sympathetic view, the depth and breadth of the current hostility to Sergeant Bergdahl are extraordinary and have enveloped the case with a lynch mob atmosphere,' Fidell said. 'Taliban five': The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori . He faces up to life in prison if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy. A former platoon-mate of Bergdahl told Daily Mail Online that Bergdahl is trying to win a public-relations battle with new claims about his defense strategy. CNN reported based on a Pentagon leak, that Bergdahl told Army investigators he left his forward operating base in 2009 so he could report 'a breakdown in discipline and order' to military higher-ups – not with desertion in mind. 'This is clearly just a stunt to build sympathy before they go to trial,' said retired Sgt. Jordan Vaughn, who spoke for the first time since the Army announced Bergdahl would be court-martialed. 'No logical person would ever take the actions he undertook for the reasons he is now saying,' Vaughn told Daily Mail Online. He said the claim broadcast by CNN is 'ridiculous,' and that the Army's decision to charge Bergdahl with desertion is 'in direct conflict' with any claim that he intended to be a whistle-blower. CNN reported that a Defense Department official said Bergdahl had 'concerns about leadership issues at his base. 'He needs to be held responsible for what he did, for abandoning his post, for abandoning his platoon, for putting thousands of American soldiers, Marines and the whole United States military, thousands of members, in more danger, putting us into spots we wouldn't already have been in, had he not walked away,' he said. President Barack Obama announced the return of Bergdahl on May 31, 2014 in a White House Rose Garden press event as the soldier's parents Jani (left) and Bob (right) looked on . Vaughn also noted that his decision 'cost the US multiple soldiers' lives, five Taliban POWs, and the incredible monetary expense of searching for him.' However, both Cornelison and Buetow, who have left the US Army, stopped short of demanding that Sgt Bergdahl face prison. 'I don't want to ruin his life,' said Buetow. 'He does need to be dishonorably discharged, have all his ranks taken away, and he does not need to receive any benefits or back pay.' He added that he was proud the military had reached its decision despite the fact it would heap further pressure on the Obama administration for negotiating with the Taliban over a man accused of deserting. 'You can't get around the fact this makes some people look bad,' he said. But they had little sympathy for Sgt Bergdahl's account of being beaten and tortured during his time in Taliban captivity. 'He wouldn't have been put in that position, he wouldn't have been tortured, he wouldn't have been put through all that hardship if he'd never walked away,' said Cornelison. The punishments suggested by the veterans are within the range open to the court. It can reduce him to E-1, forfeit his pay and give him a dishonorable discharge.","Lt. Col.

"Google is facing a fine of up to £4billion as Europe prepares to file a high-profile anti-competition lawsuit against the internet giant. The EU has been investigating the US search engine for five years following complaints that it abuses its dominance in the continent - but proceedings have stalled on three previous occasions. Now the European Commission, the EU's top antitrust authority, is asking companies who previously filed confidential complaints against Google for permission to publish them, so that officials can begin to build a case against the firm. If found to have been behaving unfairly, Google could be fined ten per cent of its annual revenues, which would be more than £4 billion based on last year's performance. Facing huge fine: Google is facing a fine of up to £4billion as Europe prepares to file a high-profile anti-competition lawsuit against the internet giant . Shopping, comparison and travel companies are among those that have been contacted by the EU, The Wall Street Journal reports. US companies Microsoft and Trip Advisor are among those that have filed complaints against Google with the EU. A decision to file charges would kick start the EU's most prominent antitrust suit since its ten year-long campaign against Microsoft Corp. - the firm was forced to pay out more than a £1billion in fines in 2012. The specific document the EU is said to be preparing is referred to as a Statement of Objections. Once filed, it's likely that a number of deeper investigations, counter-statements, and settlement discussions would ensue. If the search engine and the EU cannot come to an agreement, then fines could be issued and restrictions placed on Google's behavior. Leading investigation: New EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has suggested she favours pursuing legal action against Google over pushing for a settlement . The company would then have the right to appeal the case to the highest European court. Even if it is settled without a huge fine, antitrust cases can be hugely disruptive for firm, as Microsoft discovered. The European Commission has also been investigating whether Google has been 'scraping' content from rivals' sites, and placing unreasonable restrictions on advertisers and software developers who do business with them. A 'preliminary view' taken by the commission in March  2013 was that Google was abusing its dominant position in a number of areas . The company has denied any wrongdoing. Speaking in Berlin last week, Kent Walker, the company's Senior Vice President & General Counsel, highlighted the 'painfully long list of unsuccessful Google products', including Google+ and Street View in Germany, as proof that competition laws were serving their purpose. Long-running dispute: Former EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia, above, made three unsuccessful attempts to resolve the dispute between Google and its European rivals . The EU's investigation of complaints that Google abuses its dominance of the online search market to hurt rivals began in 2010. The US company handles more than 90 per cent of Web searches in Europe - considerably higher than its share of the US market. Comparison-shopping sites claim that when consumers use Google to search for products online, Google positions results from Google Shopping prominently. The argument is that this relegates products from rival sites to positions lower down the search page, where they might not be seen. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's new antitrust chief, has  suggested she will pursue legal action rather than seek a settlement. Google and Commissioner Vestager’s predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute, but in each case intense pressure by national governments, Internet rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort. The latest settlement proposed by Mr. Almunia fell apart following a series of interventions by powerful political players, including a letter from the economy ministers of France and Germany calling for greater concessions from Google, and protests from German publishing houses. In November the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for a possible breakup of Google, brushing aside an unusual series of objections from the US Congress that the move risked politicizing an antitrust investigation. Ms. Vestager met a month ago with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman. Last week, she indicated that her priority was to ensure that smaller Internet firms could compete with the industry's giants.","EU has been investigating the US search giant's practises for five years .

"Her mom moves on the dance floor have been well-documented over the years, thanks to her Lets Move! program. But on Thursday night, to celebrate the fifth anniversary of her fight against childhood obesity, Michelle Obama once again busted some moves, this time on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In a segment called The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2, the pair partnered up once again to show off some self-made maneuvers to a cover of I Like The Way You Move. It was a follow-up routine to a similar jaunt they did in 2013, in an attempt to inspire parents to get out and get moving with their kids. Lets disco: Michelle Obama strutted her stuff on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night, in a follow-up routine to one they first did in 2013 . OMG: Called The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2, the pair  pulled some embarrassing 'mom moves' Join in: First Lady Michelle Obama and Jimmy Fallon took it to the dance floor again during her appearance on The Tonight Show on Thursday night . Oh no you didn't: At the end of the routine, Fallon pulled a goofy move he called the 'Barack Obama' Take this: But Michelle came back kicking, showing off an equally-awful jive called the 'Jimmy Fallon' In dancing up a storm, the two demonstrated some jives they called 'You Go Girl' and 'Oh My God, I Didn't Know You Were Coming Here!' But when Fallon pulled a silly move he called the 'Barack Obama', Michelle obviously hit back with a terrible take on Fallon himself. The Let's Move! Initiative encourages people to eat better, be more active and healthier. It was first launched in February 2010. During a sit-down with Fallon, Michelle spoke of what she's achieved in the last five years, and her love of music. 'I have an iPod,' she said. 'I usually just put my earphones in in the car. I’m always listening to music. That’s the way I kind of settle myself.' Initiative: Lets Move! is an anti-childhood obesity campaign that Michelle first launched in 2010 . However music isn't something she necessarily shares with her daughters,  Malia, 17, and Sasha, 14. 'Now I’m at the stage where my kids are introducing me to music and they’re like, ''You don’t wanna hear this mom - the language is too bad'',' she said. 'Well, what are you doing listening to it?' On March 16, Michelle busted some similar moves with Ellen DeGeneres, dancing in a much more choreographed segment to Uptown Funk. Healthy eating: Michelle Obama told Jimmy Fallon that she gets her daughters to eat vegetables by having a 'no treat' rule in the house if they choose not to eat healthy . Give me broccoli!: Michelle Obama told Jimmy Fallon that the no treat rule worked and her daughters asked for her to give them the broccoli . The US First Lady revealed that she - and a party of helpers from So You Think You Can Dance - will be performing a routine to the same song on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. This year's event, which will take place on the 6th April, is part of a tradition that dates back to 1878 when President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House gardens to local children. Michelle said she has been practicing the dance, called Gimme Five!, for over a year. In addition to breaking it down on stage, Michelle Obama told Fallon how she gets her teenagers to eat healthy food. Obama said she has a 'no treat'  rule in her house if her daughters Sasha and Malia don't eat their vegetables. If the girls tell her their 'full' because they don't want  to eat the vegetables in front of them, there are no substitute meals if they become hungry later. 'After a couple of days of starvation, it’s like, ‘gimme the broccoli,’ she joked . Fallon told FLOTUS that he too has a method of getting child to eat healthy but his method is a lot sneakier than hers. 'I’m trying to sneak vegetables into anything, but there is a sneaky way to do it,' Fallon said of giving his two young daughters vegetables. 'I hide it in brownies,' he said. Polished: Michelle Obama wore classic black and white with a touch of silver in shoes when she went on Jimmy Fallon earlier in the week . Tadashi Shoji Crochet Knit Collar Dress . From the Resort 2015 collection . Visit site . Michelle Obama made another stylish appearance on the Tonight Show to promote her Let's Move! program in two chic outfits. First she danced away in a pink twinset and black pants (her signature look), then she went glam in a Tadashi Shoji cocktail dress. The knee length number featured a black and white color block design and had on-trend mesh motif on the sleeves and hemline. The First Lady's style is always on point whenever she is in public and this time was no different.

"The plot where Lizzie Borden and her family are buried in Fall River, Massachusetts, was vandalized . The final resting place of Lizzie Borden and the father and stepmother she was accused of killing was vandalized over the weekend. The Borden family burial monument at Oak Grove Cemetery in Fall River, Massachusetts was defaced with black and green paint. The vandalism was discovered on Monday, the day after a Lifetime miniseries, The Lizzie Borden Chronicles, premiered on Sunday night. Borden went on trial for brutally murdering her father and stepmother with a hatchet in their Fall River home in 1892. She was acquitted, but her innocence is questioned even today. The murder and trial inspired the schoolyard rhyme: 'Lizzie Borden took an ax and gave her mother 40 whacks. 'When she saw what she had done, she gave her father 41'. The house where the murders occurred is still standing. It is located next to the Bristol Superior Court House, the venue where the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez is taking place. Borden went on trial for brutally murdering her father and stepmother with a hatchet in their home in 1892 . The historic Lizzie Borden house, where the killings of her father and stepmother took place, still stands today . The murder and trial surrounding Borden made her a cult figure and led to an appearance on the Simpsons . This is not the first time the plot, which also contains Lizzie's sister Emma, has been vandalized, the Herald News reported. Cemetery director Tony Eaton said: 'I'd like to catch the guys who did it. 'I don't know what the reason is for putting that on a grave stone. 'It just irks me... not just when it's Lizzie Borden, but anyone.' In addition to graffiti, the Borden grave has also been covered with pennies, flowers, notes, amulets, chicken claws, feathers, blood and urine in the past. Borden, who was acquitted of murder, died from complications following gall bladder surgery at the age of 66 . Christina Ricci is playing Borden in a Lifetime miniseries, The Lizzie Borden Chronicles, that began on Sunday . Historian and author Shelley Dziedzic said the start of the show may have led to the graffiti, according to the Boston Globe. Dziedzic said: 'My thinking is it's probably related to the Lifetime series that debuted. 'Anytime the programs are on television there's a huge influx in visitors.' The new show, which stars Christina Ricci, is 'an intense and fictionalized account of actual events and people surrounding Lizzie's life after her controversial acquittal of the horrific double murder of her father and stepmother in 1892', according to Lifetime, . Ricci's character is an 'exonerated figure' who 'lives a life awash in newfound celebrity filled with scandalous love affairs'. Borden died from complications following gall bladder surgery at the age of 66.","Lizzie Borden and her family are buried in Fall River, Massachusetts .

"The moon is set to turn a sinister-looking blood red this Easter weekend. The total lunar eclipse will transform the moon on Saturday night and will be visible in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia. According to one US pastor, the event was predicted in the Bible and hints at an imminent world-changing event, but Nasa is quick to point out that the change in hue is entirely harmless. Scroll down for video . Saturday’s total lunar eclipse, which will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange, will be visible in in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia. A previous total lunar eclipse as seen from Mexico city on December 21, 2010 is pictured . The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. Pastor John Hagee told The Mirror that the sight suggests a world-changing event will take place, as predicted in the Bible. According to the King James Bible: ‘The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes.’ Mr Hagee, who has written a book on the Tetrad called ‘Four Blood Moons’, said that because the Blood Moon falls on Easter Weekend, it’s a sign that 'something dramatic will happen which will change the whole world'. The event is called a Tetrad since it involves four successive total blood red lunar eclipses each followed by six full moons. ‘I believe we're going to see something dramatic happen in the Middle East involving Israel that will change the course of history in the Middle East and impact the whole world,' he said. The strange celestial sight, which will be visible in the US, was predicted in the Bible and could hint at a world-changing event, such as the return of Christ, according to one pastor. This image shows the red moon over a church in LA during the last blood moon in October last year . A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. There are numerous mentions of blood moons in the Bible, such as in the Book of Joel, chapter two, which says the 'Day of the Lord will be as when the sun refuses to shine' and in Luke, which hints that signs in the sun, moon and stars will tell of the second coming. While the Bible prophesises blood moons, it does not give a timeline of when the significant event will happen. Mr Hagee said: ‘It just says “when you see these signs” - and four blood moons is a very significant one - '”the end of this age is coming.”’ While the event may be of huge religious significance to some people, for others it will simply be a chance to see something beautiful light up the night sky. The lunar eclipse will occur when the moon passes behind the Earth, into its shadow. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon. This gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks. At the eclipse's peak, the moon enters the Earth's full shadow; the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sun's red visible light; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. As a result, the red light reflects off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it . Blood moons  - an image from the last event is shown-  are predicted in the Bible. According to the King James Bible: ‘The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes’ Two of the four blood moons have already occured. The first happened on April 15, 2014 and the second on October 8, 2014. The third blood moon will begin on Saturday April 4, 2015 . The last will happen on September 28, 2015 . ‘During the eclipse, the moon often looks reddish because sunlight has passed through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out most of its blue light,’ Nasa said. ‘This eerie, harmless effect has earned the tongue-in-cheek nickname “blood moon”’ The ‘Tetrad’ of four alignments within two years, happens just a few times in every 2,000 years. Sky watchers will have to be quick to catch this installment because Nasa predicts the total eclipse will last for just five minutes in the US. The partial phases will be visible on April 4 just before the sun rises in the US, Space.com reported. People living on the West Coast of America will see the moon turn red from 7.58am (11.58 GMT), while sky watchers in Australia, Japan, China, and Southeast Asia will see the total phases for up 12 minutes, from 7.54am EDT.

Saturday’s total lunar eclipse, which will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange, will be visible in in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia. In this image the last blood moon is situated high above Sydney . The 'Tetrad,' cycle began in April last year. It involves a series of four dark red 'blood moons.' At the end of the cycle in September 2015, some believe the end of the world will happen . The final blood moon of the Tetrad will occur on September 28 and there will be nine sets of them in the 21st century. But Nasa has previously said that the Tetrad only happened three times in the past 500 years. From 1600 to 1900, for example, there were none at all. According to Mr Hagee, each time the Tetrad has happened during that time, there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it. In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition. The second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded. And the most recent one, in 1967, happened during the Six-Day War between Arabs and Israelis. Mr Hagee said that the first of the Tetrad blood moons happened on April 15, right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover. The second, on October 8, occured during the Feast of the Tabernacle. The third, this Saturday is also occurring during Passover and on Easter weekend. The final one happens on September 28, 2015, during the Feast of the Tabernacles. The final blood moon of the Tetrad will occur on September 28 and there will be nine sets of them in the 21st century.The moon is seen glowing red and partially obscured in shadow as it rises during a total lunar eclipse from Kathmandu, Nepal in October .","Blood moon will be visible in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia .

"Tough stance: Health minister Marisol Touraine wants to impose fines and prison sentences for inciting binge drinking . They look down on our food, our weather and even our language. Now France has cocked a snooty nose at our drinking habits, too – and is blaming us for exporting them across the Channel. French health chiefs say the UK is responsible for causing a sharp rise in the number of youngsters who binge-drink. It has slammed the practice of going out to get drunk as an 'Anglo-Saxon phenomenon' and says it is being copied by increasing numbers of youths on the continent. But critics have said it's a case of double standards for a country where children are encouraged to drink wine at the table from a relatively early age. The latest figures reveal that almost half of French 18 to 25 years olds have consumed alcohol with the sole aim of getting drunk – compared to 33 per cent ten years ago. The rise in binging is particularly high among young women, soaring from eight per cent who admitted they had done it in 2005, to three times that number by 2015. Now France's state health watchdog has claimed the sharp increase is due to French youths copying the English. Francis Bourdillon, head of the National Institute of Prevention and Health Education, said: 'This is an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon that's starting to creep into the generation of the 15-24-year-olds. 'Consumption of alcohol in France is particularly worrying among young people and especially among young women. 'Besides the obvious health concerns, binge drinking can also lead to violence against women, sometimes fatal drunken accidents, and unprotected sex.' Bad influence: French officials claim binge drinking is an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon, pictured here on TV programme Booze Britain . Sophisticated: French officials would prefer youngsters to move back to the more traditional pastimes such as a picnic lunch, after new figures revealed more youths are drinking solely to get drunk . The slur on the British comes in the same week that Health Minister Marisol Touraine presents her new health bill to the government, which includes reforms to crack down on France's binge-drinking culture. Ms Touraine said: 'We have to put a stop to drunkenness that does such damage to young people. 'This trend is a risk to their own health, and as a result puts an extra strain on the health service. 'Some may accuse the government of wanting to arrest people for having fun. But it is our job to encourage citizens to moderate their alcohol intake.' Her new law would impose fines of up to £12,000 for inciting someone under 18 to get drunk, and fines of £5,000 or six months in prison for inciting someone of any age to binge-drink. France's language watchdog the Academie Francaise has banned the English expression 'binge-drinking' from all government literature, ordering that the phrase 'beuverie express' be used instead.","French health chiefs say  binge-drinking is 'Anglo-Saxon phenomenon'

"Millions of petrol and diesel engine cars would be banned from the road within 25 years under Liberal Democrat plans.

Normal petrol and diesel engines which make up the vast majority of all motor vehicles would be barred. Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg takes a short break from campaigning and takes part in Go Ape Haldon Forest Park near Exeter today . Mr Clegg thanked 'Go Ape' for having him this afternoon. He said it was 'healthy and active fun after being on the battle bus for so long' As part of its 'green' efforts, the party today announced a £100million 'prize' for car companies who build the first ultra low emission vehicle.

He used a visit to Dymag, a specialist manufacturer of high performance racing wheels in Chippenham, Wiltshire, to highlight the plan to encourage greener motoring. To win the money, firms would have to create a family car which breaks into the top five in UK sales and have ultra low emissions (Ulev). A Ulev is defined as a vehicle which has CO2 emissions of below 75g/km, far cleaner than the current 128.3g/km average for new cars. On current trends, becoming one of the five best selling cars in the UK would require sales of around 60,000.

Mr Clegg said he wanted to tackle 'dangerous levels of air pollution' which cut average life expectancy by up to eight months . Mr Clegg said: 'For the first time since the 1970s, Britain now sells more cars than it buys thanks to Vince Cable and the Liberal Democrats being in the driving seat at the Department for Business. 'However, we need to go further and faster in making Britain a world leader in low emission vehicles by providing the right incentives and infrastructure to attract green investment and green jobs. 'This isn't just about re-balancing the economy, it's also about tackling dangerous levels of air pollution that reduce average life expectancy by up to eight months. 'Our Liberal Democrat £100 million prize fund will spark a low emission car revolution in Britain and help to build a stronger and greener economy for years to come.' A party source said the prize would 'turbocharge the technology' already being developed by manufacturers, incentivising them to bring models to market that would be affordable enough to become a best-seller. The party indicated that it expected a successful model would cost around £10,000 to £15,000 and would result in lower running costs for consumers.","Lib Dems want only ultra low emission vehicles and electric cars from 2040 .

"All schools should display posters warning pupils and parents to respect teachers, union officials have said. The ‘hospital waiting-room-style’ signs are needed as rising numbers of staff are subjected to swearing and physical attacks from pupils and their families. Research from the NASUWT union shows that the majority of teachers today are verbally abused by pupils. Union officials from NASUWT say the ‘hospital waiting-room-style’ signs are needed as rising numbers of staff are subjected to swearing and physical attacks from pupils and their families . The behaviour of some youngsters – who hurl chairs, bring fireworks to school and threaten to slit other pupils’ throats – is so horrendous that staff have refused to teach them. Some 82 per cent of 3,500 NASUWT members polled were verbally abused by pupils in the last 12 months, up from 52 per cent in the union’s survey last year. Meanwhile 38 per cent suffered similar problems with parents or carers compared with 24 per cent in 2014. Some 23 per cent had received threats of physical assault from a pupil, up ten percentage points, and 16 per cent had actually been attacked. This was a rise of seven percentage points on last year. Some 82 per cent of 3,500 NASUWT members polled were verbally abused by pupils in the last 12 months, up from 52 per cent in the union’s survey last year . NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates blamed factors including a narrow curriculum, rising class sizes and a lack of parental support for the growing tide of indiscipline. Speaking ahead of the union’s annual conference, which opened in Cardiff yesterday, she called on the government to produce poster templates for schools, using ‘strong messages’. ‘Increasingly, you go into railway stations and you see these posters which are basically saying we don’t tolerate our staff being abused,’ she said. Violent and disruptive pupils led the union to hold eight so-called refusal to teach ballots in schools last year. Here are some of the worst cases: . Birmingham . A Year One boy (age 6-7) was not excluded despite a history of physical assaults against staff and other pupils. Following notice of NASUWT action, the boy was removed from the school roll. Cardiff . A Year Ten pupil (age 14-15) verbally assaulted a woman teacher and threw a book which hit her face and drew blood. He was not expelled. Following notice of intention to ballot, the boy was assigned a learning support assistant at all times and was barred from the teacher’s lessons. Glasgow . An 11-year-old boy with a history of physical assaults, verbal abuse and threats of violence to teachers hurled chairs and other objects, but was excluded for only two days. The local authority moved him to another school after the NASUWT’s notice of intention to ballot. ‘You go into hospitals and you see similar posters, yet the government draws back from wanting to promote that kind of thing in schools.’ Miss Keates said that teachers are seen to be ‘exempt from that kind of protection and respect’. However, posters that tell ‘anyone using the premises – pupils, visitors, parents – that staff are not there to be abused’ give an ‘important message’. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the posters were a ‘good idea but shouldn’t be forced’ on schools. It comes after the NASUWT launched eight ‘refusal to teach’ ballots last year due to pupils being allowed back into the classroom despite their abysmal behaviour. In Gwynedd, north-west Wales, a 14-year-old girl was only temporarily suspended after threatening to slit another girl’s throat at a funfair and making a similar threat at school. She was expelled following the NASUWT’s ballot notice. Overall, 73 per cent of union members in this year’s survey believed there was a ‘widespread behaviour problem in schools’. The main causes of misbehaviour were lack of parental support (61 per cent) and pupils coming to school not ready to learn (44 per cent).","Schools should display posters warning pupils to respect teachers .

'I love how black diamonds look in fine jewellery so I wanted to replicate the style by creating a diamond encrusted egg using individually placed sugar pearls.' Suzanne Thorp, from The Frostery, said: 'Faberge created these lavish eggs for Russian royalty - so I thought about our ""Queen of Cakes"", Mary Berry. 'My egg is in appreciation of her. The inspiration came from the 1902 Clover Leaf egg and it includes clover leaves, a hand-painted plaque and a sugar fairy as the surprise.' Yellow Bee Cake Company's Vicky Turner said:  'As soon as I saw the Fabergé carousel eggs, I knew that would be my inspiration for my own egg. 'I wanted to give the egg a cake theme so, instead of horses, I've used cakes. You'll even spot my first ever hidden scene cake in there, amongst slices of cakes and a tiny model of a crab on a cupcake.' Ceri Badham and Linda Donnelly make up the mother and daughter team of Fancy Cakes by Linda. Fancy Cakes by Linda's (left) pink egg cake features spring flowers made from sugar paste and was made by a mother-daughter team.  A 1920s flapper girl perches on top of Pimp My Cake's pastel blue creation which was inspired by Lily of the Valley style eggs  (right) Mrs Donnelly said:'Our design is inspired by the beautiful pink and gold Fabergé eggs. The colours work beautifully together. 'Fabergé eggs have a very ornate presence and we wanted to keep this in our design, but also add our own style. 'We created oval plaques with rich gold moulded edging, in keeping with Fabergé, and inside, we placed hand-crafted sugar flowers inspired by the four seasons of weather in the UK.' Calli Hopper of Callicious Cakes was inspired by art. She said: 'I was inspired by a Baroque/Rococo theme for my Faberge egg. I came across a series of delightful late 18th century illustrations by German artist Felix Schlesinger, who did a series of rustic paintings. 'As we are nearing Easter, I thought this an endearing theme to reproduce and hand paint.' Diana Woolmer of Dee's Sweet surprise said: 'My favourite Fabergé eggs are the ones decorated in pearls with lots of gold detail. This is my style of cake decorating so, for me, this is what I had to go with in terms of design. I kept my colours simple and let the gold do its thing.' Calli Hopper, who runs Callicious Cakes, was inspired by 18th century illustrations by German artist Felix Schlesinger . 'The hardest part of the process for me was the design part, my head was full with too many ideas,' she continued. 'In the end I ditched the sketch pad, covered my egg in icing and just went to work with what felt right. Each pearl was added individually and I even made some of my own silicone moulds for some of the details. The egg took me around five days to finish.' Rhu Strand of Pimp My Cake said: 'My inspiration came from the Lily of the Valley style eggs. 'My passion in sugar is creating figurines; I was drawn to the Lily egg and instantly wanted to include a 1920s flapper girl. I have used wire work to create the stems and sugar pearls for the flowers.' Inga Ruby-Burn of Bella Baking said: 'My egg is inspired by the series of exquisite Imperial Faberge eggs, which were made for the Russian Imperial family between 1885 and 1916. During that time period, ornate royal iced cakes were affordable only to the very wealthy and so it seemed only appropriate to pipe all the decoration on to my egg. The main covering represents a speckled duck egg.' The Cake Masters Magazine Sugar Eggs Collection went on display at the ExCel in London from March 27 to 29 with more than 1.2 million visitors flocking to see the elegant edible treats.

"The attorney representing a 16-year-old Pennsylvania boy charged with fatally shooting a friend in the face and then taking a selfie with his lifeless body stated in court Wednesday that the killing was an accident. Defense attorney Patrick Thomassey doesn't deny that Maxwell Morton, of Jeannette, killed 16-year-old Ryan Mangan at Mangan's home February 4. But Thomassey disputes that Morton meant to kill Mangan. He says the boys were horsing around with a loaded gun when Mangan was shot in the left eye. Scroll down for video . Maxwell Morton (left), 16, has been charged with murder in the death of Mangan (right), 16, after Mangan was found with a single gunshot wound to the face . Headed for trial: Morton, seen here being led in handcuffs into a courthouse Wednesday, was ordered to stand trial for the alleged murder . Accidental or intentional? Morton's lawyer and family insisted he and the victim were friends and there was no animosity between the two boys . During a hearing Wednesday, a police officer testified that Morton was trying to take a picture of Mangan with the cellphone aimed down the barrel of the gun before pulling the trigger. Thomassey says Morton panicked and took the selfie to send to a friend via Snapchat as 'proof' after the friend refused to believe what happened. The defense attorney said it was Mangan who brought the gun and reloaded it for Morton. What happened next, according to Tomassey, was a terrible accident. 'Obviously, there was no animus whatsoever between these two young men,' he told reporters. Morton's relatives, who attended Wednesday's hearing, sounded a similar note when asked about the deadly shooting outside the courtroom. 'It was an accident. That was his friend,' said the teenager's mother, Honey Morton, accoding to the station KDKA. Mangan's family were also in the audience but declined to speak to the press. Morton, dressed in a suit and tie, was led in handcuffs into the Westmoreland County Courthouse by a pair of officers for a preliminary hearing Wednesday, which concluded with District Judge Joseph DeMarchis ordering the 16-year-old to stand trial for first-degree murder and possession of a firearm by a minor. Detective Bob Weaver testified in court that Morton had sent the selfie of Mangan's body slumped over a chair via an Xbox to a friend in Wisconsin. He also allegedly boasted that he 'got his first body, reported TribLive. Morton was identified by police after he sent a selfie on Snapchat of himself posing with Mangan's (above) body . According to authorities, when police came to interview Morton a day after the shooting, the teenager made a confession. 'I just shot him. it didn't matter, and I don't care,' he was quoted as telling the cops. Police also recovered a 9mm handgun from the basement of the boy's home, which Morton allegedly identified as the weapon used in the shooting. District Attorney John Peck said that based on the evidence and Morton's own statements, the shooting was not accidental and the suspect's actions afterwards show a 'callousness of guilt.' Morton is being held without bond pending his formal arraignment scheduled for May 20. Ryan Mangan, a junior at Jeannette High School where Maxwell Morton was also a student, was found dead around 6pm on February 4 by his mother, Rebecca Murtland. Investigators at the scene found a 9mm shell casing but a handgun was not recovered at the time. The day after Mangan was found, a mother of one of Morton's friends told police her son received a selfie on Snapchat of the victim who was sitting in a chair with a bloody wound to his face, according to the Post-Gazette. Morton's friend saved the image before it deleted itself, as Snapchat lets users send images that are removed from the recipient's phone after a few seconds. The friend's mother also said her son received messages from Morton that said: 'I told you I cleaned up the shells', 'Ryan was not the last one' and 'got my first body.' The teen was discovered by his mother in her home (above) last Wednesday evening . Mangan was a junior in high school at Jeannette High School and has been described as a fun-loving guy by friends . Following a search at Morton's home, he confessed to shooting Mangan after police found a 9mm handgun hidden under the basement steps that matched the shell casing found at the scene of the murder, according to Triblive. Mangan's friends have gathered to comfort each other as they mourn his loss, and described him as a fun-loving guy who was goofy and funny. His friend Taylor Wiltrout said she just wants justice served in the case. She said: 'That would be the most important thing. That's what he would want. He would want all of us to continue on and go on like he's still here and do what we planned on doing.'","Maxwell Morton, 16, from Pennsylvania, will be tried as an adult for shooting Ryan Mangan .

"A personal trainer who claims to have helped Gwen Stefani get into shape hit a woman so hard that she lost a tooth and was left lying unconscious in a pool of blood, a court has hard. Mike Heatlie, 42, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney outside a nightclub in Edinburgh because she did not give him a cigarette. Heatlie, from Edinburgh, was once voted as one of the city's most eligible bachelors and claims to have helped train Stefani before her 2009 U.S tour. At the time, she described him as 'Superman'. Personal trainer Mike Heatlie, 42, (left), who claims to have previously work with Gwen Stefani, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney, 43, (right) outside a nightclub in Edinburgh . But Ms McCartney is now facing a £7,000 dental bill and says she is too frightened to leave her home after being assaulted by the personal trainer. He pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March to the attack. He is due to appear again on April 22 for sentencing. Speaking for the first time about the attack, Ms McCartney, a legal PA from Greenbank in Edinburgh, said: 'I used to love going out on Saturday nights. But since the attack I have been very wary and like to be home by a certain time. 'I don't like to go out to nightclubs now and I get very panicky in crowds after this unprovoked attack. 'I'm on sleeping tablets from a doctor because I don't sleep at all. I still have this constant reminder and feel I can't move on because I still have the injuries from that night. I'm reminded every day of this attack.' Ms McCartney said the incident unfolded after Heatlie approached her while she was with a friend outside The Jam House club in March last year. The Edinburgh-based trainer apparently worked on and off with the No Doubt singer (pictured) since 1997 . A testimony which claims to be from Stefani appears on Heatlie's website, which describes him as 'completely passionate' and a 'wonderful motivator' He asked the pair for a cigarette but neither woman had one to give him. He then lashed out and punched her, she said. Ms McCartney said she still suffers from numbness and aching in her mouth. She is also due to have expensive and painful dental work, over the next few months. Heatlie (pictured above) pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to the attack . Speaking about the incident, Heatlie said: 'This was an unfortunate incident that occurred last year. 'I have been in touch with Ms McCartney and the situation is now very amicable and both parties, I'm sure, would like to move on from it.' In a text message, which Ms McCartney said had been sent by Heatlie to her partner, the trainer wrote: 'Please pass on my sincerest apologies to your partner Fiona, I wanted to get in touch but obviously couldn't with the case proceedings. 'This incident, that I have virtually no memory of, has turned my life upside down and I can't imagine how it has impacted Fiona's. 'I am so sorry, this is completely out of character for me, I've never been involved in a violent incident in my adult life.' Heatlie used an endorsement from Stefani to help promote his new studio when it opened six years ago. At the time, she described Heatlie as being 'completely passionate about health and fitness'. She said: 'I’m so happy for Mike that he’s opening his own studio. I know it will be a huge success. I can’t wait to start working with him again in preparation for our summer tour. 'Mike is completely passionate about health and fitness and is a wonderful motivator. 'He is tireless, compassionate and makes working out something to look forward to.

"We all need a helping hand sometimes, and nobody more so than Kecil the baby orangutan, who had a tough start to life after his natural mother and another surrogate mother rejected him. But the one-year-old ape found love at the third time of asking with second surrogate mother Maggie at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo, and has today been pictured cuddling up to the experienced mother ahead of his first public outing this weekend. Maggie, 53, who has already raised one surrogate child, has proved herself yet again by helping to raise Kecil (pronounced Ka-cheel) for the past 10 months, and the two now have an inseparable bond. Scroll down for video . Taking care: Maggie, 53, wraps a protective arm around Kecil the baby orangutan who she has been raising for the past ten months after his mother and a surrogate mother both rejected him . Inseparable: Zookeepers were nervous that Maggie might reject Kecil after raising four of her own children and another surrogate which was given to her in 2002, but she has proved her parenting prowess once again . When the pair appeared in front of news crews earlier today, Kecil began crying after losing sight of Maggie for a few moments. But the elder orangutan quickly returned, at which point Kecil quietened down and scooted over to join her, reports the Chicago Sun Times. Kecil had to be moved from his birthplace at Toledo zoo, in Ohio, 14 months ago after his natural mother failed to bond with him properly after birth. He was moved to Milwaukee County Zoo and given to a second surrogate, but she did not form a bond with him either. In a final attempt to find a parent for Kecil, he was handed over to Maggie, the oldest orangutan in North America, who has already raised four children of her own, and a fifth surrogate which was given to her in 2002. The pair immediately showed signs of intimacy, but zookeepers still faced a tense wait to see if the elderly orangutan would take on full parental duties. Nava Greenblatt, one of the zoo’s lead primate keepers, said that the turning point came when a fire alarm sounded at the zoo a few weeks ago, frightening Kecil, who ran to Maggie and cuddle up to her. Turning point: Keepers in Chicago said the turning point for Kecil came a few weeks ago when a fire alarm went off on the zoo, frightening him. Usually he turned to people for comfort, but instead he ran and cuddled up to Maggie . Big day: After settling into his new enclosure, Kecil will go on display for the first time this weekend in two hours slots between 10am and midday, allowing him to nap in the afternoons . Getting into the swing of things: Keepers said when Kecil and Maggie were first put into their new enclosure, the older ape would wander too far ahead, and Kecil would get lost, but the pair have now learned to stick close to one another . She said: 'Initially when he would be feeling insecure he would turn to people, and then there was a shift where he would turn to Maggie if he felt insecure. That was a big milestone. He really needs her to learn how to be an orangutan.' The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild. Kecil will be on display on Saturday and Sunday at Brookfield Zoo's Tropic World Asia enclosure between 10am and midday. The other orangutans will be allowed into the enclosure around those times to help them acclimatise as well. Hanging out: The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild . Happy monkey: Keepers said: 'On his first day out he was wide eyed and a bit amazed. He stayed close to Maggie and whimpered if she moved too far away. We saw many joyful reunions those first few days as they separated and found one another again'","Kecil the one-year-old orangutan was taken to Chicago zoo after being rejected by his mother and surrogate mother .

"Six hostages who hid in a supermarket freezer during January's Islamist attacks in Paris have sued French media for broadcasting their location live during the siege. Amedy Coulibaly stormed into the Hyper Cacher Jewish store, killing four and taking others captive before being shot dead in a hail of gunfire by French special forces. The heavily televised events in eastern Paris came two days after Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Patrick Klugman, a lawyer representing the six survivors, said images broadcast from Hyper Cacher on January 9 'lacked the most basic precautions' and endangered those still alive inside. Scroll down for video . Police storm the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket, killing an Islamist terrorist in hail of gunfire. Six hostages who hid in a  freezer during the Islamist attacks have sued French media for broadcasting their location live . Terrorist: Amedy Coulibaly slaughtered customers during the siege at the Hyper Cacher store. Lawyers claim French media endangered the lives of hostages hiding a freezer by revealing their location live on air . He singled out French 24-hour news channel BFMTV which revealed live on air that the group - including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby - was hiding  in the freezer. They had been taken to the cold room by one of the supermarket's employees. 'The working methods of media in real time in this type of situation were tantamount to goading someone to commit a crime,' Mr Klugman told AFP Thursday, roundly criticising coverage by other outlets of the movements by security forces during the standoff. The lives of those hiding 'could have been at risk if Coulibaly had been aware in real time what BFMTV was broadcasting,' Klugman said. He added that the jihadist was following the coverage of his raid on different channels and had been in contact with BFMTV journalists. The lawsuit charges media  with endangering the lives of others by deliberately ignoring security protocols, which carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a €15,000 (£11,000) fine. Extraordinary pictures emerged in the days after the siege showing the hostage huddled together for warmth amid cardboard boxes of food inside the freezer. Defying terror: Hyper Cacher reopened last month with a vow to 'show that life is stronger than barbarity' One woman is seen cradling her child, while in another image a hostage sends a text message to a loved one. Hearing shots, shoppers at the back of the store fled downstairs to the storeroom where they huddled together in temperatures of -3C (27F). Fearing they would not escape alive, they made what they believed would be their last calls to family to tell them they loved them. One man, known only as Ilan, was with his young son and quickly removed his jacket and wrapped him in it as they cowered in freezer for nearly five hours before Coulibaly was shot dead. The Kouachi brothers were also killed after three days of attacks that killed a total of 17 people and deeply shocked France and the world. Hyper Cacher finally reopened last month with a vow to 'show that life is stronger than barbarity'.","Amedy Coulibaly stormed Jewish store before being shot dead by police .

"The businessman father of a 15 year-old girl who fell 19 floors to her death says he is ‘distraught’ as he faces the prospect of losing a second daughter to social services while his wife remains in police custody. Nick Cousins, 57, was arrested over alleged 'ill treatment' of Blanca after it emerged police are investigating whether her birth, and that of her 14-year-old sister, were ever registered. It is also alleged that they did not attend school. She died in the early hours of Tuesday after falling from the family’s luxury apartment in Hong Kong. Mr Cousins was also questioned over claims that his Filipino partner, Grace Garcia Cousins, 53, had overstayed her visa by 20 years. Scroll down for video . Blanca Cousins, 15, who fell to her death from her family's flat in Hong Kong this week, told friends she went to an American school to explain why they never saw her in a uniform . A mother at the local pony club Blanca and her sister attended said that not even the sisters' closest friends knew they weren't going to school . He was released on bail yesterday pending police inquiries. Speaking for the first time, from the £7.5 million family home, he said: 'I am distraught. We all are. There is nothing else I can say.' Police yesterday applied for a 'care and protection order' for his second daughter but she has been returned home pending a second court hearing. Ms Cousins remained at a detention facility. Mr Cousins, originally from Thurrock, Essex, is managing director of the Hong Kong arm of international insurance broking firm Jardine Lloyd Thompson, and has worked for the firm in Asia for more than 20 years. It is understood that his partner moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines in the 1990s to work for Mr Cousins as a domestic helper before becoming his partner. It is unclear whether they had married, although she uses his surname. Their two children were both thought to have been born at a private hospital in Hong Kong. The couple were watching television in the family’s home, on the 19th floor of Hong Kong's most luxurious apartment buildings, when Blanca locked herself in a bathroom following a row at around 2am. She fell to her death from a window just before dawn. Paramedics declared her dead at the foot of the building in Repulse Bay Road. It is alleged British businessman Nick Cousins, 57, and Filipino Grace Garcia Cousins, 53, never registered the births of Blanca and her 14-year-old sister Carla . A police spokeswoman said a security guard found Blanca lying on the ground at the foot of the apartment . Police sources claimed while no suicide note had been found they were aware the girl had been 'unhappy' in recent weeks. Blanca – who was known as Blancs – was due to celebrate her 16th birthday in July. If their births were not registered, it means she would not have been able to attend school, travel abroad or receive medical treatment – unless paid for privately. School attendance is mandatory in Hong Kong, but a more relaxed approach is taken with expatriate residents and some 'home school' their children without official permission. She appeared to have enjoyed a relatively normal life, and seemed to have a wide circle of friends among the city’s well to do expatriate community. She was a member of the Hong Kong Pony Club and had recently attended Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament, after her father secured a box there, and had invited friends to join her at the event. Today, the mother of a member of the Hong Kong Pony Club where the sisters attended regularly told MailOnline everyone at the club was shocked with the news. 'The two girls told us they went to an American school in Hong Kong and that was why they weren't wearing uniforms. They seem to have had it all planned,' the mother, who asked not to be named. 'Even one of the girls closest to Blanca did not know they weren't going to school. 'Blanca was a lovely girl and everyone is in absolute shock. We had no idea what was going on. At first we wondered if her death was down to cyber bullying, but when we found out the story we couldn't believe it at first. The girl's father has been named as Nick Cousins (pictured) the managing director of insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson's Hong Kong office . 'I met the mother once at a pony camp but I never saw her again. Her dad was always here. He would pick the girls up after pony club and take them home. He was very kind and we thought they were a normal family with a dad that was involved with his children. 'Was it one lie that led to another lie? We simply don't know.' It is understood that she received private tuition with her younger sister. Yesterday, some of her friends paid tribute and expressed their shock at her death. Chiara Martin said on Twitter: ‘R.I.P Blanca Cousins You were a great friend and a sister to me’, posting a picture of Blanca nuzzled up to a pony. Charmaine Kima said: 'Such devastating news of Blanca and her family #RIPBlanca #staystrong.’ The 21-storey apartment block is one of the city's most prestigious addresses, with four-bedroom apartments selling for £7.5million each while they rent for £8,000 a month. Neighbours told the local Apple Daily newspaper that they would often see Blanca walking her dog ‘smiling’ or carrying books. They said her mother was ‘elegant’ and often accompanied her husband when he went out. They said she would talk to neighbours, but rarely spoke about their private life. Last night, police would not comment whether or not the girls were registered saying only that the matter was ‘under investigation’. Officers have applied for a ‘care and protection order’ for the youngest daughter. However the court is not due to rule on this until early May, and she has been returned to her family in the meantime. She is understood to be back at the family home with her father. Ms Cousins remained at a detention facility which houses illegal immigrants last night. A friend of the couple’s said yesterday: ‘The girls were/are adored by their parents, anyone knowing them knows this - but it’s a shock to even their close friends that they didn’t attend school, no-one knew this.’ This week, one expat who knows Mr Cousins described the family as 'down to earth and decent'. He added: 'He isn't a Hooray Henry at all, like so many of the expats in top jobs in Hong Kong. He's more of an Essex-boy type who worked his way up the corporate ladder and is just very bright and very good at what he does.' Tragedy: Blanca fell to her death in an apparent suicide early on Tuesday morning after locking herself in a bathroom of the apartment in Hong Kong's exclusive Repulse Bay Road (pictured) The 21-storey apartment is one of the wealthy city's most prestigious addresses with luxury four-bedroom apartments selling for prices in the region of £7.5million . A police source last night said: 'Initial investigations showed there were no suspicious circumstances and [Blanca] was suspected to have fallen from a height. 'We arrested a 53-year-old Filipino female for overstaying and a 58-year-old British male for aiding and abetting an overstayer. 'Both have also been arrested for suspected ill treatment of the girl. Our investigations indicate the girl was unhappy with her life.' Last night a spokesman for the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group said: 'We can confirm that our colleague Nick Cousins, the managing director of our Hong Kong office, has suffered the loss of his eldest daughter in tragic circumstances. 'We are giving Nick our full support through this difficult time and he will be on compassionate leave until further notice. 'We are aware that the authorities are investigating a number of matters that have come to light in the wake of this tragic event. As these are private matters, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further. 'Our thoughts are with Nick and his family.'

"A heroic mother saved her daughter from the jaws of a 13ft crocodile in a 10-minute long battle, armed only with a wooden washing paddle. Diwalinen Vankar, 58, had gone with her 19-year-old daughter Kanta, to the bank of the Vishwamitri River, 40 kilometres from Vadodara, in west India, to wash their clothes. As they were wringing out their laundry, a mugger crocodile grabbed Kanta's right leg and dragged her into the murky river.

But the mugger crocodile clasped its powerful jaws round her daughter with its razor-sharp teeth. Vankar said: 'I was using all my force to pull her back, but the crocodile was so powerful I could not move her an inch. 'For a moment I felt the crocodile would drown my daughter as it tried to roll into the water.' But the quick-thinking mother then decided to attack the crocodile - that can grow up to 15 feet long - with her washing paddle. 'For several minutes I tried to pull her with my hands, but then I got hold of the wooden bat and started hitting its head forcefully', she said. 'Her leg was trapped between the piercing teeth as she cried in pain, her hands were scratching the river bank to get a grip but it didn't let her go. 'It took me 10 minutes to finally free her from its jaws.' Kanta suffered a leg injury after the crocodile grabbed her right leg and dragged her into the murky river . This map shows the Vishwamitri River, near Vadodara, where the attack by the crocodile took place . Vankar said she went to wash her clothes in the river as there was a lack of water and electricity in the village . After hearing the commotion, villagers rushed to help and drove Kanta to hospital, where doctors were treated her for a leg injury. She has since been discharged. Speaking from the hospital, her mother said: 'I thank God for saving my daughter. The injuries are not that serious and doctors say she will be fine in sometime.' She said they had been forced to wash their clothes in the river because of a shortage of water and electricity in the village, but vowed never to return. A wildlife officer said the river is home to ferocious crocodiles and villagers have been warned to steer clear of the river. 'She has miraculously survived. These crocodiles are huge and ferocious,' Ashok Pandya, Vadodara wildlife officer told the Times of India. 'We have been warning them not to go near the river.' Last year, six people were killed in crocodile attacks across Vadodara. There are more than 200 crocodiles in the Vishwamitri River.

"Five prisoners - including an Islamic extremist who allegedly shot dead two police officers - have been killed as they tried to escape from a van taking them to court in southern India. Prisoner Syed Viqaruddin - who had links to a network of feared terrorist groups -  is understood to have asked the police van to stop in a deserted area, claiming he needed a toilet break, while they were en route to a court in Hyderabad. But when the blue bus stopped at about 10am, another of the prisoners 'tried to snatch a rifle from a policeman and tried to escape', according to Anurag Sharma, the head of Telangana state police. Shoot out: The five suspects were killed this morning after allegedly trying to escape police custody . He added: 'The police first warned them to stop and surrender, and when they did not listen, police opened fire.' The five men were all killed in the shooting, while just one of the 17 officers guarding the group was left with minor injuries. The incident came two days after a gun battle in the same state left two terror suspects and a police constable dead. India.com has named the four other men killed today as Syed Amjed, Izhar Khan, Mohammed Haneef and Mohammed Zakir - all of whom were said to be members of a terrorist group called Tehreek Ghalaba E Islam, according to OneIndia.com. The group is said to be funded by Harkat-ul-Jihadi Islami - an extremist group banned in Bangladesh in 2005, and which claimed responsibility for killing 17 people at Delhi courthouse in September 2011. Viqaruddin - who is said to be their leader - has also been linked to the banned terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba. Fatal: Just one of the 17 officers guarding the truck was hurt, and the bodies were later taken for autopsies . He had been in custody since his July 2010 arrest for allegedly carrying out a series of attacks against policemen - including the killing two policemen in Hyderabad, as well as triggering two bomb blasts in the southern high-tech city. OneIndia.com also reports him as having bragged of plans to assassinate Narendra Modi, who was then the Gujurat chief minister. However, he is said to have abandoned the plot at the last minute when he realised 'there was too much security in the area'.","The van had stopped after Syed Viqaruddin asked for a toilet break .

"It will not worry Andy Murray one iota that his victory over Tomas Berdych on Friday night may have lacked the drama or controversy that accompanied their Australian Open semi-final in January. Instead the world No 4 – next week to be world No 3 – was all business as he produced a performance of clinical excellence to take down the powerful Czech 6-4 6-4 in an hour and 42 minutes. He is through to Sunday's final of the Miami Open where the Scot will face his growing nemesis, Novak Djokovic after he dispatched John Isner in straight sets. Andy Murray reacts as he reaches the Miami Open final with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Tomas Berdych . Murray reacts after winning the final point before shaking hands with Berdych as he heads into the final . The Czech Republic star could not contend with Murray's selection of shot making in Florida . It will be Murray’s first Masters level final since he won the title in what is his home from home two years ago. That fact backs up the belief that he is returning to the kind of form last seen from him in the first half of 2013, which led to him winning the Wimbledon title. Since then there has been back surgery, a new coach in Amelie Mauresmo and a revamped support team and all manner of setbacks. But a Grand Slam final, making the last four of Indian Wells and now the final here tells the story of his improvement this season. Occasionally there have been periods of wandering concentration in the past week but his mind was very focussed. It may have helped that ex assistant coach Dani Vallverdu was sitting in Berdych’s corner accompanied by ex-fitness coach Jez Green, who is now also working with the Czech. But there was none of the highly-charged atmosphere of that night in Melbourne. Kim Sears, who he is marrying next week, kept a much lower profile this time, hidden beneath the wide-peaked straw hat protecting her from the fierce Florida sun. The 27-year-old was in clinical form as he set up a final showdown with Novak Djokovic . There is no love lost between Murray and Berdych, especially after this year's Australian Open semi-final . Murray was annoyed after Berdych asked for one of the balls to be taken out of play during the first set . Both players thought it necessary to question the umpire as events unfolded in the first set . Berdych questions the chair umpire following an overruled call at the Masters 1000 evnt . Murray and his close friend Vallverdu have now regained the equilibrium in their relationship, but the Scot admitted afterwards that there are still extraneous factors with him playing Berdych, who he does not especially like. “It was different from then (Melbourne) for sure, but it was still not easy even if it appears that way,” he said. “It’s still a bit tricky and not a comfortable situation. I’m quite pleased with the way I have handled the emotions in both these matches.” Murray has played more matches on this Crandon Park court than any other outside Wimbledon’s Centre Court and the Rod Laver Arena, and knows what to expect in conditions that are usually heavy and humid with a brisk breeze. Murray's fiancee Kim Sears was back in the stands wearing the same wide brimmed hat . Berdych's model fiancee Ester Satorova cools down with some water as she watches her beau . Murray's former coach Dani Valverdu (left) and trainer Jez Green (right) switched camps to join Berdych . “When the conditions are like that, Tomas can still generate a lot of power. But when I've played him on some of the quicker surfaces, I feel like I've been able to hit through the court and make him move a lot. “It’s been a long five or six weeks for me so I wanted to try and conserve as much energy as I can. I obviously have some days off next week to relax.” Murray had a fairly clear game plan, taking some speed off his first serve to increase its percentage and not allow Berdych too many looks at his more vulnerable second delivery. He also sought to exploit the 6’ 5” Czech’s slightly cumbersome movement and prevent him from hitting too many of the bazooka forehands that had helped the Czech forge a 6-5 record in their previous encounters. Murray stretches to make a return as he battles to win a place in Sunday's final . Murray cannot hide his delight as he throws his sweatbands into the crowd after the game . Murray, now sure to overtake Rafael Nadal in the rankings to close on Roger Federer at two, took advantage of two wobbly Berdych service games at the start of each set, but was then unable to hold his serve before breaking again. The only whiff of controversy came after four games of the match when Berdych, whose whingeing makes Murray appear positively laidback, complained about the state of the balls. It did not impress his opponent. At this time of year it might be appropriate to describe him as Doubting Tomas and Murray was in such purposeful mood, and serving so consistently, that he comfortably held onto his lead in both sets.","British No 1 defeated Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-4 to reach Miami Open final .

"A Florida woman is facing charges after being accused of kicking a deputy in the groin and thigh several times before offering him oral sex in exchange for a get out of jail free card. Police were called to Boonies Bar  in West Palm Beach on Friday night after getting a report about a woman who was offering oral sex in exchange for money and refusing to leave the establishment. The bar manager also told police the woman, Beatrize Carrion-Moore, was 'extremely intoxicated'.

"England international Ben Morgan has delivered an encouraging fitness bulletin as he continues to recover from a season-ending injury and retain the hope of keeping alive his World Cup dream. The Gloucester No 8 has not played since breaking his left leg during an Aviva Premiership game against Saracens in early January. But the signs suggest he is on course to play a part during England's World Cup warm-up period ahead of the tournament kicking off in mid-September. Ben Morgan is hopeful of featuring for England at the forthcoming World Cup despite his long-term injury . Morgan last featured for England when he scored two tries during their victory over Australia five months ago. Injury then struck, and he missed the entire RBS 6 Nations campaign as a result. The 26-year-old, though, remains an integral part of England boss Stuart Lancaster's World Cup plans, and the current prognosis is a good one after Morgan recently underwent final surgery to remove a pin from his leg. 'To be honest, I have not found this difficult at all,' said 27 times-capped Morgan, after watching his Gloucester colleagues continue their preparations for Friday night's European Challenge Cup final against Edinburgh. 'I am really positive and using this as a great experience to make myself better for when I come back. Who else gets six months off to rest up and train hard? 'Yes, I will be at a disadvantage in terms of the fact I haven't played any rugby. 'But looking at the World Cup in particular, there will be lads who wouldn't have played for probably two and a bit months going into the first (warm-up) game, so everyone is going to be on an equal playing field. 'Things are going well at the moment. I am just trying to make sure I get back healthy when I come back. Gloucester No 8 Morgan broke his left leg playing against Saracens in the Aviva Premiership in January . 'I have a lot of strengthening to do around my legs - in the early stages you don't want to rush that. When things strengthen up, that's when I can start chucking some serious tin around. 'I had an operation last week. It is a case of seeing if things affect my ankle, and if they don't, then I can do them again. 'It is very reactive. I just have to take it day by day. It could be a couple of weeks down the line or a couple of months down the line when I run again, but there is no point rushing this sort of thing.' Lancaster is due to name a 45-man World Cup training squad next month, followed by his final 31-man group for the tournament in late August. England's World Cup preparations, meanwhile, also feature home and away games against France in August, plus a September appointment with reigning Six Nations champions Ireland at Twickenham. Morgan last played for England during his side's victory against the Wallabies at Twickenham in November . Reflecting on the injury, Morgan added: 'It was tough, but it was one of those things. It happens - deal with it. 'If I start thinking about what I missed out on, I'm just going to become negative. I have this mindset going forward about living the law of attraction. 'It is basically positivity breeds positivity. If you get that positive mindset, you attract everything into your life that is positive. I'm thinking of this as a positive experience. 'I can get bigger, better, faster, stronger and improve myself as a player before I come back. I can use this to my advantage. Otherwise I could sit there and fester and get fat, lazy and never come back. 'I sat in the hospital and thought to myself 'okay, it's done. How long is it going to take me to get back?'' 'Ideally, I would like to be back playing in those warm-up games because that gives me a shot of getting in the squad. 'There are so many variables about what can happen, though. 'I might get a couple of months down the line and think that realistically I'm not going to get back, so think about next season instead. I have to look after myself. 'Yes, I desperately want to get back and put myself in contention, but I'm not going to do anything that is detrimental to my health. 'Right at this moment, I am in a great place.'","Ben Morgan broke his left leg playing against Saracens in January .

"The teenager who was famously pictured in a bloodied state in his mugshot after he sexually abused an 11-year-old boy and was beaten unconscious by the child's father has been jailed for 25 years. Raymond Frolander, 18, was beaten to a pulp by the furious father after he walked in on the teenager performing a sexual act on his son at his home in Daytona Beach, Florida, last July. After Frolander's arrest, police released his mugshot, which saw him sporting swollen lips and eyes, black bruises and lacerations to his face. The photo was quickly shared thousands of times online. Now, the defendant has been sentenced to a quarter of a century in prison by Circuit Judge Leah Case after pleading no contest to lewd and lascivious molestation of a victim younger than 12. Scroll down for 911 tape . Jailed: Raymond Frolander, 18, who was beaten unconscious by a furious father after sexually abusing his 11-year-old son, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Above, the convict is pictured in court on Thursday . Bloodied: After Frolander's arrest, police released his mugshot, which saw him sporting swollen lips and eyes, black bruises and lacerations to his face. The photo (above) was quickly shared thousands of times online . Wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, Frolander showed little emotion as he agreed to a plea deal in a bid to avoid a mandatory life sentence on Thursday,  the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported. Speaking outside court, the child's 35-year-old father - who is not being named to protect the identity of the victim - said the sentence would give his son's attacker the chance to reflect on his actions. 'He’s going to learn in the next 25 years why I let him live,' he told reporters, according to WFTV. The youngster's grandmother added that the plea deal means her grandson will not have to go through the psychological trauma of a trial, saying: 'He just needs to learn to trust again.' As part of the deal, Frolander, who had been molesting the boy for years, will be listed as a sexual predator, be on sex offender probation and undergo electronic monitoring for life after his release. On the night of the attack, the child was apparently playing video games with Frolander and some friends. However, after the others left, the defendant took him to a back room, the boy told police. Father: Speaking outside court, the child's 35-year-old father (pictured)- who is not being named to protect the identity of the victim - said the sentence would give his son's attacker the chance to reflect on his actions . Plea deal: Frolander (pictured alongside his attorney on Thursday) showed little emotion as he agreed to a plea deal in a bid to avoid a mandatory life sentence lewd and lascivious molestation of a victim younger than 12 . Locked up: The youngster's grandmother said the plea deal means her grandson will not have to go through the psychological trauma of a trial. Above, Frolander is pictured being led away from the courtroom Thursday . There, Frolander reportedly pulled down the child's pants and performed a sex act on him, before being caught by the boy's father, who had just returned home after picking up some food. The father, who had heard a strange noise coming from the bedroom, pushed open the door and discovered Frolander with his genitals exposed, police said. He immediately started beating him. In the early hours of July 18,  the father called 911 and told the dispatcher: 'I just walked in on a grown man molesting [name redacted]. And I got him in a bloody puddle for you right now, officer.' He continued: 'He is nice and knocked out on the floor for you, I dragged him into the living room,' before adding: 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one.' Police arrived at the house to find Frolander unconscious. During an interview, the boy told officers the suspect had been molesting him for three years - something Frolander later admitted to. Sex offender: As part of the deal, Frolander (pictured), who had been molesting the boy for years, will be listed as a sexual predator, be on sex offender probation and undergo electronic monitoring for life after his release . Bruised: The defendant is pictured during his first court appearance, still sporting injuries from the beating . After his arrest, Frolander was was treated at hospital before being taken to the closest police station. In his mug shot, his still-swollen face was evident from the beating he had received. Officers appeared to understand the father's reaction. 'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood said. Speaking to WFTS, he added: 'You have an 18-year-old who has clearly picked his target, groomed his target and had sex with the victim multiple times.' Days after the incident, the father admitted that it was only his son's pleas which had stopped him from killing the pervert after he had stormed into the kitchen and grabbed a knife in his rage. 'My son is the one who stepped in front of me and stopped me. My son saved his attackers life, so who's really the hero in this situation?' he asked WKMG after Frolander's first court appearance in Volusia County. The man admitted he had 'just snapped' when he walked in on Frolander naked with his son. Shortly after beating the teenager into a coma, he  grabbed the knife and walked over to him, he said. 'I was going to kill him,' he admitted, adding that he and his family had considered Frolander a close friend and had often allowed him to spend time with the 11-year-old boy at their home. 'There was nothing uncommon to let the kids go in the bedroom and play video games together and now I have to wonder why the door was shut,' the father explained last July. Sexual assault: Officers appeared to understand the father's reaction. 'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood said. Above, the father is pictured with his 11-year-old son (left) before the attack, and Frolander is seen in a previous mug shot (right) He added that his rage also stemmed from being molested himself as a child at a foster home in California. He said beating Frolander was the easy part and that much harder days lay ahead. 'I'm not going to pressure anything on [my son],' the father told reporters. 'I know exactly what he's going through, when he's ready to talk about it, he will.' Police defended his actions but later criticized him for creating a Gofundme page, initially entitled 'Rebuilding Innocence' and featuring an image of a sleeping boy, asking for $1million in donations. On the page, the father wrote: 'We are reaching out to anyone that can help. Our son was sexualy (sic) assaulted and we are now faced with the challenge of picking up the pieces, the emotional and financial burden is about more than we can endure.. Please.. Anything helps.' Chf Chitwood told DailyMail.com he was 'pretty shocked' by the page, which was later taken down by the charity site. 'The police, investigators and prosecutors go to great lengths to protect victims of sexual abuse. I'm sure his intentions are in the right place but this is not good for the young man's recovery,' he said. During his interview with police, the child reportedly told officers that he had been intimidated and told by Frolander that terrible things would happen to him if he revealed the abuse. 'He's 11 years old, he should be running around outside and playing video games, not dealing with something like this,' Chf Chitwood said at the time. No charges were filed against the boy's father.","Raymond Frolander, 18, sexually abused 11-year-old boy at Florida home .

"She was just eight when she first attended the Maundy Day service. The then Princess Elizabeth was photographed in 1935 at Westminster Abbey in her smart bonnet and buttoned-up coat. It would be another 18 years before her coronation. Eighty years on, the Queen yesterday gave out Maundy coins in the pre-Easter tradition. Resplendent in a turquoise coat by Stewart Parvin and matching hat, the Queen was all smiles as she arrived at Sheffield Cathedral for the traditional ceremony. Eighty years ago: The then Princess Elizabeth was pictured in Westminster Abbey at the service in 1935 . Handing out alms: The Queen presents a lady with the two Maundy Purses at Sheffield Cathedral . Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, Her Majesty was there to present 'alms' to 89 women and 89 men, among them D-Day veteran, Denis Gratton. 'It was just quick. I'm not very good at hearing,' said Mr Gratton, 91, after the ceremony. 'She did say something but I'm not sure what it were.' The Queen, who had arrived on the Royal Train, was driven to the cathedral where she got a warm welcome from the flag-waving crowd and was presented with a nosegay of spring flowers. Met at the church door by Peter Bradley, the Dean of Sheffield, and the local Bishop, Steven Croft, Her Majesty spoke briefly to the clergymen before being whisked inside for the service. After the hour-long service, the Queen posed for pictures with the Yeoman of the Guard, who had lined the cathedral's aisles during the ceremony. The Royal party then left for a reception at Sheffield Town Hall as the recipients emerged into the sunshine, all pleased with their royal acknowledgement. Patricia Durkin, 72, said: 'It was brilliant, absolutely wonderful. When I got here the atmosphere was tremendous.' The Royal Maundy Service is one of the UK's oldest royal customs and sees the monarch distribute alms in the shape of two purses of specially minted coins. This year, the Red Purse contains a £5 coin, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Winston Churchill and a 50p coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Custom: Monarchs have been presenting Maundy Money since 1210 and King John . Commemorative: The red and white bags contain commemorative coins, this year featuring Winston Churchill . Thank you: A gentleman looks pleased as he receives his commemorative coins from the Queen . Bodyguard: The Queen was accompanied by the Yeoman of the Guard who carried in the purses . Signing up: The Queen signed the visitor's book at Sheffield Cathedral before she left . Tradition: The Queen and Prince Philip were handed traditional nosegays made from spring flowers . Historically, this sum of £5.50 in the Red Purse is made up of £3 for clothing, £1.50 in lieu of provisions and £1 for the redemption of the Sovereign's gown. The White Purse contains uniquely minted Maundy Money, which, unlike coins in general circulation,   bear the portrait of the Queen produced by Mary Gillick at the start of her reign. Gillick, a sculptor, designed the portrait which appeared on the coins of the UK and some Commonwealth countries from 1953 until preparations for decimalisation began in 1968. The portrait of the Queen wearing a wreath on her head was considered to reflect the nation's optimism as it greeted a new monarch in the post-war years. The Royal Maundy is an ancient ceremony which has its origin in the commandment Christ gave after washing the feet of his disciples the day before Good Friday. Warm welcome: The Queen is greeted at Sheffield Cathedral ahead of the traditional Royal Maundy Service . Jaunty: The Queen, looking wonderful in turquoise, arrived in the state Bentley with the Duke of Edinburgh . Cheerful: The Duke of Edinburgh was on jolly form as he arrived for the service . Busy week: The Queen will also appear at church in Windsor on Easter Sunday . Meeting: The Queen speaks to the Dean and Bishop of Sheffield ahead of the Royal Maundy Service . In an echo of the Last Supper, mediaeval and Tudor monarchs also washed the feet of beggars during the service. Unlike the nosegay, which was originally introduced as a means of disguising the repellent smell, that custom failed to survive the 18th century. The first monarch to take part in a Maundy Thursday service was King John, of Magna Carta and Robin Hood fame, who distributed gifts of clothes and money to the poor in Knaresborough in 1210. John was also the first to present the poor with silver coins and is recorded as having done so in Rochester in 1213. John's grandson Edward I, the king known to posterity as 'the Hammer of the Scots', was the first to confine the tradition to Maundy Thursday alone, which, until his reign, could be conducted on any day of the year. Recipient: One of the men receiving Maundy Money clutches his ticket as he arrives for the service . Enthusiastic: A little girl waves as the Queen's Bentley pulls up outside the Cathedral . Patriotic: Crowds of people waited outside the Cathedral, many clutching Union Flags . Turn out: A lady keeps her Union Flags tucked under her arm as she waits to see the Queen . Long wait: Many of the well-wishers outside the Cathedral had waited there for hours . By 1363 and Edward III, the tradition had evolved into a ceremony that is still recognisable today, with monarchs handing out money equivalent to their age in years. The ceremony was little changed by the dawn of the Tudor period, although rulers could - and did - increase the number of beggars involved to show their religious devotion and humility. None took it more seriously than Mary I - or Bloody Mary - who in 1556 washed the feet of 41 'poor women' and spent the entire ceremony on her knees. Later monarchs were less keen on the service, with some, among them Charles I, rarely bothering to take part. Charles II, anxious to curry favour with his subjects following the Restoration, took part in the ceremony without fail, including during the plague years. Originator: The custom originated with King John, shown here signing the Magna Carta in June 1209 . Modernising: The 800-year-old tradition used to involve washing beggars' feet - hence the nosegay . Smell: The scented nosegays were originally used to disguise the stench of unwashed people . All smiles: The Queen, who has only missed the ceremony four times, was all smiles as she arrived . Schoolchildren: The Queen was also introduced to a group of schoolchildren outside the cathedral . Although today's ceremony takes place in a different location each year, Queen Victoria insisted on doing it at Westminster Abbey - a custom that remained in place until the Queen took the throne in 1952. The Queen has taken part in the Royal Maundy Service in all but four years of her reign, including in 1954 when she was away touring the Commonwealth. She was also forced to pull out in 1960 thanks to the imminent birth of Prince Andrew, again in 1964 for the birth of Prince Edward and in 1970 due to a tour of New Zealand. Dapper: The 93-year-old Duke of Edinburgh cut a dapper figure in his tailored suit . Bodyguards: The Queen was flanked by members of King's Bodyguard of the Yeomen of the Guard . Long history: The Yeomen have been part of British life since 1485 and are the UK's oldest military body . On her way: After the ceremony, the Queen was driven away for a lunch at Sheffield Town Hall . Busy: The scene outside Sheffield Cathedral ahead of the Queen and Prince Philip's arrival .","The Queen has distributed the traditional Maundy Money in Sheffield .

She said: 'I saw the blue tit completely by chance one day on my way to work. 'This little bird was flying from the lamp post, which I thought was really weird. I didn't believe my eyes the first time I saw her coming out of there. 'The next day I went back to the lamp post with my camera in the hope I could take a picture of it - and also to make sure what I had seen was right. Jeanette Rosenquist was on her way to work from her home just outside Copenhagen, Denmark, when she spotted the bird flying out of the lamp post . The female blue tit usually builds the nest by herself with very little help, or no help at all, from the male . 'The bird flew out and back a few times, and each time she came back to the lamp post she was carrying moss, grass, and reed straw in her beak.' Ms Rosenquist, who works in the Danish health system, added: 'I was so afraid that by the bird making its nest in the lamp post it would create a short circuit and be killed.' A blue tit will normally collect moss, grass and straw to make her nest which she then lines with feathers, fur or wool so it is ready for laying.

"Police were twice called to an aircraft when 'disruptive' passengers mutinied over being stranded  on the tarmac  for five hours after their plane was diverted. Pilots of the Qatar Airways flight landed at Birmingham airport on Monday night after severe winds foiled two landing attempts at Manchester, where the plane was due to arrive at 7pm. Passengers were made to stay in their seats as they waited for the plane to be refuelled and for a new flight crew to arrive at the airport. Scroll down for video . Revolt: Footage taken in Manchester Airport, pictured, shows passengers becoming frustrated with airport staff after the events in Birmingham caused a knock-on delay to the aircraft's return flight to Doha . Frustration: Passengers are filmed at Manchester airport. Police were first called to Birmingham after passengers started 'kicking off', according to one witness. Officers returned two hours later . Police were first called to the tarmac when some passengers 'kicked off', according to one witness. Officers returned two hours later after reports that angry passengers were trying to disembark. Meanwhile, footage taken in Manchester airport shows passengers becoming frustrated with staff after the events in Birmingham caused a knock-on delay to the aircraft's return flight to Doha. Some claimed they had been waiting in the airport for up to 24 hours after earlier delays. Passengers in Birmingham were eventually allowed off the aircraft and were later bused to Manchester. But some claimed they were left waiting hours for transport and did not arrive until  7am. Delay: A Qatar Airways spokeswoman apologised for the delay, which she said occurred after strong winds meant the aircraft couldn't land at Manchester. Above, passengers in Manchester airport who were delayed . One passenger who was on the tarmac and asked not to be named, said: 'We were told they were waiting for refuelling and then a new crew. 'Some passengers started kicking off so the police were called. An old lady next to me was shivering so we asked for blankets but there weren't enough. 'When we got home I had to sleep for two days to recover.' A Qatar Airways spokeswoman apologised for the delay, which she said occurred after strong winds meant the aircraft couldn't land at Manchester. She said after the diversion it was unable to fly back to Manchester as the operating crew exceeded their legal flying hours by the time the aircraft had been refuelled. Passengers and crew safety, she said, were the number one priority and a new crew was taken to Birmingham as fast as possible, at which point the aircraft took off for Manchester. She added: 'In the meantime, Qatar Airways arranged for the transportation of the passengers to Manchester.' West Midlands Police have confirmed reports of 'disruptive passengers' at 10.30pm. Officers boarded and spoke to passengers and crew and no complaints were made. But a spokesman added: 'A further delay in the flight's departure resulted in officers being called again two hours later after passengers became angry and some tried to disembark. 'The airline decided to cancel the flight and transport the passengers to Manchester by road.' Passengers were finally allowed into the terminal, but claim they then waited until 5.30am for a bus to Manchester, arriving at around 7am. Safety: A spokeswoman for Qatar Airways said passenger and crew safety were the number one priority and a new crew was taken to Birmingham as fast as possible, at which point the aircraft took off.

Footage was later uploaded to YouTube. The caption on the video claims some people had been waiting more than 24 hours after their flight the night before was cancelled. It added that 'zero information was given for the delay' or about connecting flights. On Tuesday, seven flights were diverted out of Manchester Airport due to windy weather.

"A wife has told how she has put her husband on a lifelong sex ban and tracks his every move, after discovering he had cheated on her after taking a lie detector test. Despite his infidelity, Haley and Kev Mulholland still share a house in Bristol, though Mr Mulholland has to sleep on the living room sofa. The mother-of-eight says that while she does not want her husband, she does not want any other woman to have him either. Haley Mulholland became suspicious husband Kevin was having an affair after reading his Facebook page . Mrs Mulholland monitors her husband’s movements, checks his phone and even sniffs him to see if she can smell another woman’s perfume. 'I might not want Kev, but I don’t want anyone else to have him either,' said the 45 year old, who is mum to Sophie, 27, Kerrie, 25, Kasey, 14, Brittany, 13, Paige ten, Tyler, nine, Madison, eight and five-year-old Alexius. 'I keep tabs on his phone and on his Facebook page. He swears he’s staying true, but I couldn’t trust him as far as I could throw him. Over the past few months I’ve become quite the detective.' Though Mrs Mulholland has so far found no evidence to suggest he is straying, she refuses to take her husband of 15 years back. She said: 'While we’re not divorced, we’re not together. There’s no kissing, sex or anything like that, though Kev’s tried his luck. 'He creeps into my room saying the sofa’s given him a bad back and that he needs to sleep in my bed. I just tell him where to go. Kevin and Haley, who have been together for 15 years, are pictured on their wedding day . 'The other night he started stroking my thigh. I slapped his hand away. This body is well and truly out of bounds.' The Mulhollands' marriage became rocky shortly before they renewed their wedding vows on Valentine’s Day in 2013. Mrs Mulholland said: 'A month before the big day I was on the computer and noticed Facebook was still logged on to Kev’s profile. 'I clicked on his inbox, and discovered a message from one of our neighbours. 'She’d written ""Have you told her yet?"" which made my heart race. 'Had my Kev been going round for more than a cup of sugar? 'The rest of their correspondence was harmless enough, so I decided to give Kev the benefit of the doubt. Haley learns that Kevin did cheat her on after a lie detector test on the Jeremy Kyle televsion show . 'But just weeks after our wedding I started hearing rumours about the two of them. 'I asked Kev if something was going on and he denied it. But I smelt a rat - a love rat.' That is when Mrs Mulholland started to doubt her husband and put him on a sex ban until he admitted the truth. She said: 'I trusted the people who were telling me. So I told him, no nookie until I get to the bottom it. 'Two years went by and I stuck to my word. We slept on opposite sides of the bed, absolutely no touching. Haley says she has banished Kevin to the sofa after learning that he cheated and has also imposed a sex ban . 'By the end Kev was so desperate for some hanky panky he suggested we went on the Jeremy Kyle show for a lie detector test. 'I booked for us to go on the show. A couple of nights later I checked Kev’s Facebook inbox and felt sick to my stomach. 'There were loads of messages from this other woman. She had written that she was worried she’d caught an STI from Kev. It was absolutely disgusting.' Mrs Mulholland went round to confront her neighbour who claimed her Facebook had been hacked. But the lie detector test on the Jeremy Kyle show revealed that Mr Mulholland had cheated on his wife with their neighbour. The couple trip the light fantastic after renewing their wedding vows just one month after Haley discovered the incriminating Facebook message suggesting Kevin was having an affair . The couple kiss after renewing their wedding vows before friends and family . She said: 'Kev walked off stage, swearing that the results were fixed. But that evening he finally admitted the truth. 'He said it had only lasted five minutes, but that didn’t matter to me. Once a cheat always a cheat. 'I knew we were over but I didn’t kick him out for the sake of the kids, instead I moved him downstairs. 'The little ones are none the wiser.' Mrs Mulholland said she has now started to track her husband’s movements to make sure he isn’t seeing other women. 'It sounds crazy as, hand on my heart, I do not want him back. But whenever he goes out I make a note of how long for and calculate what he could be doing,' she said. In happier times: Haley and Kevin who is father to six of her eight children . 'Maybe it’s jealousy or perhaps it’s because I want him to suffer. 'I know his Facebook password and I log in most days to check whether his floozy has been in touch. 'She’s kept quiet, and if she has any sense she’ll continue to do so.' It’s not just technology Mrs Mulholland uses to try and catch her husband out. 'The other day I hugged him as soon as he walked through the door. I think he saw it as progress, but I was just seeing if I could smell another woman on him. 'I make sure I know where he is at all times. 'So far he has passed the test, but if he ever fails I’m ready to pounce.' Mr Mulholland, who is unable to work due to a bad back, has told his wife he will win her back by remaining celibate until she changes her mind. He claims he’ll show he’s remained faithful by doing another lie detector test. Haley Mulholland says she now keeps tabs on her husband and checks his Facebook page . Mrs Mulholland said: 'I don’t know what I’d do if the results came back and he’s telling the truth. Maybe I’d take him back, maybe I wouldn’t. 'For now I’m happy being single. I don’t see a man in my future and I’ll be damned if there’s a woman in Kevin’s. 'He’s made his bed and he has to lie in it – alone.' Mr Mulholland, 46, said he was determined to win his wife back. 'I love Haley more than anything, no other woman compares. The kids and her are my life. 'I’m still living in the house, so there’s still love there. I’m not having sex with anyone to prove just how serious I am. 'The fact that she’s checking up on me tells me that she cares.'","Haley Mulholland still lives in Bristol home with partner Kevin .

"Since 2013, Dr Milton Wainwright has been trying to convince the scientific community that he has found aliens in Earth's stratosphere. Now the controversial British professor claims he has new evidence of these 'extra-terrestrial organisms' floating 25 miles (40km) above the planet. He says the organisms test positive for DNA, and have masses that are 'six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from Earth to this height.' Dr Milton Wainwright has been trying to convince academics that he has found aliens in Earth's stratosphere for several years. Pictured are one of the so-called 'ghost particles' that the researcher claims to be proof of extraterrestrial life forms. His views have been widely dismissed by the scientific community . The organisms, he claims, are contained in a microscopic metal globe designed by an intelligent species to 'seed' alien life on Earth. Dr Wainwright announced the discovery in an email to his students at Sheffield University, who posted it on Reddit. 'We sent balloons and a sampler and found no pollen or grass, nothing up there to contaminate, it was completely pristine,' Dr Wainwright told Jason Koebler at Motherboard. 'For these reasons, we think [the organisms] are coming from space,' he added. 'All the time when you walk outside, you are being pelted with organisms that come from space.' He said that his latest discoveries has been accepted in the journal Astrobiology and Outreach. Dr Milton Wainwright (right) claims he has new evidence of these 'extra-terrestrial organisms' floating 25 miles (40km) above the planet. He says the organisms test positive for DNA, and have masses that are 'six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from Earth to this height' Dr Wainwright's research has been widely criticised by the scientific community as being backed by poor and flimsy evidence. 'The critics claim that the samples we obtained must have come from Earth, that it that there must be a mechanism which can lift these particles from Earth to the stratosphere,' Dr Wainwright told Dailymail.com. Panspermia is a theory that suggests life spreads across the known physical universe, hitchhiking on comets or meteorites. For example, life such as extremophiles, capable of surviving the inhospitable conditions of space, could become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets. The idea of directed panspermia, however, suggests that lifeforms are deliberately sent out through the universe by intelligent civilizations . Professor Francis Crick, one of the biologists who discovered the structure of DNA, examined the possibility of this in a paper in 1973. However, Professor Crick and his ccolleagues concluded that the scientific evidence was 'inadequate at the present time to say anything about the probability'. 'However, we have provided evidence that the DNA-containing masses, plus other strange organisms we have isolated are not associated with pollen, grass and fungal spores on our sampler. 'If our organisms came from Earth they must be contaminated with common Earth organisms and they are not.' 'We will probably not be believed until Nasa repeats our findings,' he added. 'I suspect that Nasa they will then try and take the credit by claiming that their methods were somehow more sterile or precise.' Earlier this year, the astrobiologist revealed an image of what he said was a tiny metal ball spewing out a 'gooey' substance in samples gathered by a balloon in the Earth's stratosphere. Dr Wainwright said the ball, which is about the width of a human hair, could be an example of directed panspermia. This describes the belief that life was deliberately sent to Earth by some unknown extraterrestrial civilisation. He argued that the strange material coming from the titanium ball is biological and could in fact be a colony of tiny microorganisms. However, he conceded it is virtually impossible to prove that the tiny sphere was sent by aliens from outer space. Dr Wainwright said the sphere made a tiny 'impact crater' on the sampler that was attached to the balloon as it collected dust and particles in the atmosphere. He added: 'The sphere made an impact crater on the sampling stub. This proves beyond doubt that the particle was travelling at speed from space when it was sampled.' Dr Wainwright and his team discovered the sphere when examining samples of dust and particulate matter collected by a balloon sent around 16 miles into the atmosphere. The metal sphere found by Dr Wainwright and his colleagues (above) appears to be oozing goo from its side . Using X-ray analysis to examine the sphere, he concluded that it was made from titanium and traces of vanadium, while the material appearing to come out of the side was biological. They found that it also had a 'fungus-like knitted mat-like covering'. Dr Wainwright and his colleagues have published their findings in the Journal of Cosmology but their conclusions have yet to be corroborated by other scientists. The journal often publishes papers on astrobiology but is highly controversial among scientists as it has been criticised for its peer review process and for publishing papers of a fringe variety. Two years ago it controversially published a paper that claimed to have identified fossils of microbiotic life in a meteorite, sparking a blaze of publicity, but was also met with a great deal of skepticism. The idea that life can survive high the Earth's atmosphere, however, is not new. Scientists working with Nasa recently discovered bacteria living up to five miles above the Earth's surface. However, most scientists believe they are likely to have been carried up from Earth rather than having an extraterrestrial origin. Air currents and winds are known to be capable of carrying dust and bacteria for hundreds of miles and high into the atmosphere. But research has shown that microorganisms can survive the intense heat and pressures of entering the Earth's atmosphere from space, raising the prospect that life may have originally been carried here. Some astrobiologists believe life started on Earth after being carried here on a comet or asteroid, while others believe it is more likely that the basic chemical building blocks were carried in this way rather than established life. However, the idea of directed panspermia has been proposed by some heavyweight scientists. Professor Francis Crick, one of the team who one a Nobel Prize for discovering the structure of DNA, examined whether it was possible that organisms could have been deliberately transmitted to the Earth by intelligent beings from another planet. Dr Wainwright used balloons similar to this one above to collect samples from the stratsophere . He eventually concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support such a claim. Dr Wainwright, however, insists his findings may help to provide some of that evidence. 'Unless of course we can find details of the civilisation that is supposed to have sent it in this respect it is probably an unprovable theory,' he added. Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, an astrobiologist at the University of Buckinghamshire and editor of the Journal of Cosmology, said: 'I think more work needs to be done on this particular structure, for example to study its DNA, if it has any. 'But already there is clear proof from many directions to confirm that we are constantly bombarded by fragments of comets that carry living microorganisms.' Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, said the idea that such material were being sent out by aliens attempting to seed other planets was a 'leap of the imagination'. He said: 'This would seem to provide proof that outer space and not just the surface of our planet is teaming with life. 'I'm sceptical about this and we would need to collect more samples like this to have a better idea of where it originates from. 'It is a leap of the imagination that it came from an ET race trying to seed our planet with their biological constructs. 'Perhaps there are luminous or 'invisible' jelly-fish like creatures that inhabit our skies, or microorganisms flooding our planet, I'm not convinced, but they are fascinating ideas that make a change from stories of starships loaded with aliens.'","Radical claim made by Dr Milton Wainwright from Sheffield University .

"A new study has revealed that students on computer science and dentistry courses at university are much less likely to have had a sexual experience than pupils enrolled in other subjects. According to a new survey by student newspaper The Tab, 11 percent of computer scientists currently in higher education haven't had sex. 11,549 students were asked about their bedroom habits for the study, which then broke down the statistics in terms of which courses each person was enrolled on. A new study says students on computer science and dentistry courses at British universities are much less likely to have had sex (picture posed by models) Nine per cent of physicists declared that they were still virgins, followed by five per cent of dentists and four per cent of law, chemistry, engineering and medicine students. In contrast, pupils enrolled in Arts subjects like history and English were far more likely to have lost their virginity either before or at university. Art and sociology pupils were most likely to have had sex, with just one per cent claiming they were virgins. History of Art, philosophy, languages, business and politics all followed with just two percent of students revealing they were still virgins. The same survey recently showed that university pupils in Britain have an average of 8.2 sexual partners by the time they reach the middle of their higher education. A new survey of university students has revealed that they have had an average of 8.2 sexual partners (picture posed by models) According to the answers they received, 22 per cent of students didn't lose their virginity until they were 18 years old, with the second most popular age to have sex for the first time being 16. 19 percent of those asked lost their virginity at 17 and 15 percent lost theirs just before the age of consent - at 15. A shocking 1.66 per cent of students revealed they first had sex when they were 13 years of age or younger. There was still a significant number of young men and women who were still waiting for the right partner though, with five per cent of people declaring that they were still virgins. 22 per cent of students questioned during the survey revealed they didn't lose their virginity until they were 18 years old (picture posed by models) The student newspaper also compiled a list of the universities where people lost their virginity earliest. Seven per cent of people who took part in the study followed by Aston and Ulster with six per cent each. Meanwhile, one in ten students who took part in the from Lancaster University said they were still virgins, followed by nine per cent at both Kent and Royal Holloway University.","Survey by student news website The Tab looked into university sex habits .

"Steven Abberley caused a major security alert by throwing marbles at MPs and shouting 'you are all just liars' during Prime Minister's Questions . A protester who caused a major security alert by throwing marbles at MPs and shouting 'you are all just liars' during Prime Minister's Questions has walked free from court. Steven Abberley, 28, hurled a tirade of abuse at politicians during a session in the House of Commons in October last year. He then threw the glass balls from the public gallery, but they missed MPs and hit a security screen. Abberley excused himself to fellow observers before shouting 'you are all just liars' at Prime Minister David Cameron and the rest of the chamber during the televised Parliamentary debate. When arrested, Abberley told police officers that he had daubed the words 'the enemy within' in red paint on the palace's walls, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told. Prosecutor Mavis Ramkissoon said the incident happened five minutes before the end of the weekly question-and-answer session. She said: 'Without warning at 12.25pm, Mr Abberley stood up and began to shout, ""I'm sorry about this ladies and gentlemen"". 'Mr Abberley's arms were outstretched, he said: ""you f***ing w*****s, you are just liars"".' Abberley, who is unemployed, then interjected from the dock, telling the court: 'Can I just say for the record I didn't call anyone ""f***ing w*****s"". I called them ""dishonourable b******s"".' Ms Ramkissoon continued: 'He produced a cloth bag and threw the contents of the bag at the security screen, causing a loud bang.' The prosecutor said there was no damage to the screen, but the marbles scattered causing 'distress and shock' to the people in the gallery. 'When he was arrested, Abberley made admissions to the arresting officer concerning criminal damage to the Palace of Westminster', she said. Abberley had scrawled the words 'the enemy within' on the wall just outside the public gallery. Steven Abberley, pictured with his mother, hurled a tirade of abuse at politicians during a session in the House of Commons in October last year . Abberley threw the glass balls from the public gallery during Prime Minister's Questions, but they missed MPs and hit a security screen (file picture) There is no footage of Abberley spray painting the wall, and the judge said he would not have been caught if he had not told the police what he had done. Ms Ramkissoon said it cost £2,416 to remove the graffiti. The court heard that Abberley, whose mother was in court today, is taking medication for mental health and a behavioural disorder. He said that he is looking for a job, and is hoping to join the Army. Abberley, from Carshalton, south London, admitted one count of criminal damage and one of threatening behaviour. District Judge Quentin Purdy sentenced him to eight weeks in prison for throwing the marbles and four weeks for the graffiti, but suspended both jail terms. 'Your personal view of politicians, whatever they may be, are entirely a matter for you,' he said. The unemployed 28-year-old was given suspended sentences for criminal damage and threatening behaviour . 'But the difficult you have is how you chose to express it, by criminal damage and your antics in the gallery at the House of Commons. 'People are entitled to go to that place and listen calmly to that said below. You chose to disrupt them.' The judge said Abberley had caused 'disquiet' which may force others to think again about attending Parliament. 'Those that cause disruption at the Palace of Westminster have a knock-on effect to other freedoms and confidence in going that, and that must be actively deterred.' The sentences will run concurrently and Abberley has been ordered to pay back £500 in compensation at a rate of £5 a fortnight. He will also undergo supervision sessions for two years, mental health treatment for the next year, and pay an £80 victim surcharge.","Steven Abberley threw marbles during PMQs but they hit a security screen .

"A father whose 20-year-old daughter was found murdered in Iowa last year made a desperate plea from China for U.S. authorities to do more in tracking down her killer, six months after the girl's body was discovered. And police in Iowa seem to have now answered it, by issuing a warrant for the girl's boyfriend, according to reports. Tong Shao, a chemical engineering student at Iowa State University, went missing in September 2014. After a three week search, police found her body stuffed in the trunk of her Toyota Camry in Iowa City. Shao's boyfriend, Xiangnan Li, 23, was listed as a person of interest in the case and is believed to have been the last person to see her alive, however he bought a one-way ticket to China in the days after his girlfriend went missing and has disappeared, CNN reported. Wanted for murder: An arrest warrant has reportedly been issued for , Xiangnan Li, 23 (right), the boyfriend of Tong Shaom 20 (left), a University of Iowa student found murdered in September after going missing . Li had transferred to Iowa from Rochester Institute of Technology to be closer to Tong. The two had meet studying English in Beijing in 2011. They had checked into a hotel room together on September 5, 2014. The pair had stayed at the same hotel three times before and the owner knew them. According to police records obtained by CNN, two days earlier Tong had accidentally called Li - or 'pocket dialed' him - and he stayed on the line for 30 minutes, overhearing a conversation. Tong was complaining about Li to a friend and said things that 'were not nice', the records noted. The owner of the hotel told investigators Li left the hotel either on the night of September 6 or the morning of September 7, which he said was unusual, because he usually had to tell the couple to leave after the checkout time of 11am. Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8. He landed September 10. Before Li left Iowa, a text from his phone was sent to one of Tong's roommates. 'This message was purportedly from (Tong) and read that Li had an emergency in China and was flying back there, that she was going to take a bus to Minnesota to visit friends, and she would return in about a week,' the police documents stated. On September 9, Karen Yang, a friend of Li's sent him a message asking how things were going with Tong. 'Fine for now,' he replied. Killed: Tong Shao, 20, was found dead in her Toyota Camry on September 26 at an apartment complex in southeast Iowa City. Police believe she had been in the car for three weeks . Disappeared: Police say Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8, less than two days after his girlfriend was last seen alive . Tong's roommate, Jean, filed a missing person report on September 18, when she couldn't contact her. Together her roommates reached out to Tong's friends in Minnesota via social media, however they had not heard from her. On September 26 were body was found in her car parked near a low income housing complex on the outskirts of Iowa City. Residents had reported a foul smell, and responding officers wore Hazmat suits while inspecting the car, KCCI 8 reported at the time. Tong was found in the trunk, where her body had been for about three weeks, and next to her was a 15-pound barbell. An autopsy showed Tong died of  asphyxiation and blunt force trauma. A towel from the hotel had been wrapped around her head, according to police records. Inside the car police found copies of Li's flight information. Scene: Investigators had to don Hazmat suits to inspect Tong's car. Her body is believed to have been in the trunk for three weeks before they found it . Investigation: Tong died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Her body was wrapped in a towel, and next to it was a 15-pound barbell, police say . Stench: Investigators grimace at the smell emanating from Tong's car after finding it dumped in September . A search of their hotel room found 'splatters and drips of various dried liquids throughout the room and behind the headboards of the beds,' the records said, concluding that 'it is possible her death may have occurred in the hotel room'. Tong's father, Chunsheng Shao, told CNN he was informed by detectives last month that an arrest warrant had been issued for Li. Li is wanted for the first-degree murder of Tong Shao. Police would not confirm this, saying their investigations are ongoing. While it is the first break in the case since the discovery of Tong's body, Mr Shao says he wants more to be done in solving his daughter's murder. Mr Shao and his wife saved $100,000 to send their daughter to university, and believed Iowa would be a quiet, safe place for her. 'We've given all our love to our daughter'"" Mr Shao said. 'I feel my life is meaningless after losing her.' Tragic: Tong, a junior chemical engineering student from China, was last seen in Ames more than three weeks before her body was discovered . While the U.S. has strong ties with China, there is no extradition treaty between the two. Legal experts say the most likely outcome is that China would prosecute people within China for crimes committed elsewhere. For Mr Shao, more needs to be done. 'We now plead with you, the U.S. authorities ...  share the evidence you have gathered with the Chinese authorities,' he said. 'This honorable act could very well save the life of other innocent and vulnerable victims, and will most assuredly allow the soul of our precious daughter to be comforted and rest in peace.'","Tong Shao, 20, was an international student from China attending Iowa State University .

A hilarious new hashtag has popped up on social media site Instagram exposing some of these 'awful' that things parents do to their children- such as giving them a bath (how dare they), putting them in their high chair (so mean), and even giving them cookies (what a truly evil thing to do). #a**holeparent has almost 4000 posts from parents all over world, admitting through their uploaded pictures to cleaning, feeding, and entertaining their children to their immense dissatisfaction. Scroll down for video . 'I wouldn't let her have a knife,' explained one parent on the #a**hole parent thread . Most of the photos show children crying, followed by an explanation of exactly what their parent has done to upset them so. 'I wouldn't let her have a knife,' explained one parent alongside a picture of their daughter sobbing in a highchair. 'I wouldn't let him drink the bubble solution, therefore I'm an #a**holeparent,' wrote another, next to a picture of more tears.

"It was once a colourful backdrop for the shenanigans of Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, but years of neglect meant this piece of film history risked being lost forever. The Gilmore  Gasoline Filling Station has now been restored to its former glory - but people wanting to refuel here will have to be content with a skinny cappuccino. Coffee giant Starbucks bought the garage in Los Angeles last year and have now finished its transformation into a drive through coffee shop.

Starbucks worked with a historical consultant to ensure the character of the building was preserved during the renovation . Opened in 1935 by Gilmore Oil, which was then the largest independent oil company on the West Coast, the art deco building served the drivers of Hollywood until it was abandoned in the 1990s. It became a filming location soon after with wacky weatherman Harris K. Telemacher (Steve Martin) stopping to fill up with lover Sara McDowel (Victoria Tennant) prior to attending a fundraising event. He asked for the 'full-service' treatment, which includes a tank of petrol, a car wash, and removal and exchange of all four tires. The petrol station was also where Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) informed Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) of the location of the stolen money in the 1982 comedy 48 Hours. It was listed as a Los Angeles cultural monument in 1992, but was soon after left to vandals and graffiti artists. Starbucks store design manager Jonathan Alpert said despite its poor state he saw the potential of the petrol station from the start. The new store, which has a drive through, serving hatch and outdoor seating area, retains the main existing structure as well as the canopy from an added car wash . He said: ""At the very beginning we knew this was something special. 'The building was in such a dilapidated state, but we could see it had potential. 'We wanted to restore the building in a way that allows us to serve the community while celebrating its history.'

The team added energy-efficient LED rope lights to replicate the old tubes of neon lighting. Non-historic contemporary service bay roll-up doors were replaced with aluminum frame garage doors in the style of the period to form an exterior wall. Mr Alpert added: 'We didn't try to over-brand the building; we tried to keep it true to the original with only limited signage.

"At first glance, it appears to be any ordinary play-date for two young girls at primary school. In a pink-walled bedroom, decorated with posters of Justin Bieber, best friends Zoe and Eleanor settle themselves on to the bed and press play on the webcam of their computer. But they’re not about to video-chat with friends or a relative abroad. What they’re doing is far more pernicious — and will be horrifying to parents everywhere. Scroll down for video . In a world where girls grow up fast, should these online hot or not videos really surprise us? Half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, with a fifth of girls under 11 confessing to have even tried diets (picture posed by model) ‘This is mine and Eleanor’s hot-or-not video,’ announces Zoe, waving a list of her classmates’ names at the camera. Then she settles down — seemingly without any comprehension of the genie she is unleashing from its bottle — to publicly deem each one of them as either ‘hot’ or ‘not’. It’s hard to think of a more spiteful game. ‘If we say you are not pretty or good looking, don’t get offended,’ pipes up Eleanor, issuing the standard disclaimer for videos of this kind. ‘It’s just our opinion!’ The roll-call then begins. ‘Anna Wright’ is the first of the 30 names on the list to be read out as if from a class register. ‘Hot!’ the girls immediately exclaim in unison. Next is Charlotte Davies. ‘Hot!’ is the decree. The name of a third classmate, however, is met with a pause just long enough for the girls to exchange knowing smirks. ‘Not hot. Sorry!’ they chime in high voices which belie the cruelty of what they’re saying. Remember, these girls, and the objects of their derision, are no more than ten or 11. And they’re far from alone. I’ve discovered that these kinds of scenes are being played out in children’s bedrooms across the country. Seven more classmates, both boys and girls, get the thumbs-down. As soon as the last judgment is handed down, the girls sign off with a satisfied: ‘Thanks for watching!’ They then upload the video to YouTube for everyone to see. In just a few days, the clip gets 120 views, suggesting no one in their class — or perhaps their school — has missed it. But what people will miss is the sight of the stricken faces of the children so cruelly dismissed, the tears shed into pillows, and the bravery needed to go to school the next day. Of course, cruelty among children has existed since the words ‘No, you can’t play with us’ were first uttered. But this is a new, more public humiliation. Scroll through YouTube and you’ll find ‘hot-or-not’ videos by girls who look no older than nine. Thousands more can be found on Facebook pages. These all seem to be filmed in bedrooms and verdicts delivered with a brutal certainty even Katie Hopkins would baulk at. There are variations — one angelic-looking little girl called Brianna used ‘Perfect’ or ‘Not Perfect’. She’s had 2,000 views so far. As a parenting expert who’s written five books on raising children, I know the effect this could have on those deemed ‘not hot’. And coming at such a critical time in their lives, when youngsters are looking to their peers to help them work out who they are, those effects can be life-long. The fact ‘hot-or-not’ videos are so public increases a young person’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look. My worry is that youngsters internalise these labels and start bullying themselves, telling themselves they are ugly and they can do nothing about it. Feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success: study after study has found that the grades of such children go down. The fact ‘hot-or-not’ videos are so public increases a young person’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look. Feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success: study after study has found that the grades of such children go down (picture posed by models) And if they feel they do not belong, they often start to avoid school. Meanwhile, those who feel ugly or not good enough rarely join in class discussions, for fear of drawing attention to their appearance. Indeed, more than six out of ten children who have been bullied said it had a detrimental effect on their education, according to a survey by charity Ditch The Label. Even worse, almost one in three bullied children goes on to self-harm, with 10 per cent attempting to kill themselves. Who knows what nightmares this new type of bullying will cause? Living up to these ideals of beauty is one of many pressures bearing down on 15-year-old Alannya Blackmore as she prepares to take her GSCEs this summer. Alannya, who lives near Yeovil, Somerset, has been on the receiving end of some of the judgments passed down in the 50 or so videos made by fellow pupils at her school, an oversubscribed academy rated ‘good with outstanding features’ by Ofsted. Although she has been mainly rated ‘hot’, she has also been dismissed as ‘not’ in some clips. When she describes her experiences, it offers a glimpse into a brutal world in which youngsters’ popularity is dictated by looks and the ‘in’ girls seek to maintain their classroom pecking order by passing down decrees on others. As girls grow up, the prettiest rise to the top of the popularity poll, and it is this group, says Alannya, who are more likely to feel entitled to declare from up high who also makes the grade. She says: ‘If you are judged to be “not”, you don’t say anything as you don’t want the others to think you are upset. But it’s humiliating because it’s so public. Some people will try to change the way they look because of it. There are loads of these videos. There are so many of them on people’s Facebook pages as well as YouTube — and there’s nothing adults can do.’ ‘Hot or not’ started off as an American phenomenon, where young women would put a picture of themselves online and be rated by other users. In the UK, it morphed into the version we have today. Some youngsters justify these videos by saying classmates can put themselves forward to be rated by ‘liking’ a status announcement saying someone at their school is planning to film one. Sadly, it’s often the most insecure youngsters, aching to be accepted by the pretty girls who make these videos, who volunteer. They’re seeking validation they won’t get. So why is such ruthlessness starting ever younger? One reason is puberty is kicking in earlier, with as many as one in seven girls showing signs of breast development (with the associated surges in hormones) aged just eight. Girls can also be allowed by their parents to grow up too soon, so they act like teenagers without the maturity to understand the consequences of their actions. In a world where girls grow up feeling like they are in a constant beauty contest — half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, and a fifth of those under 11 have already been on a diet — these ‘hot-or-not’ videos should hardly surprise us. And middle-class girls are most likely to post these videos, as their families more often own iPads and computers. Middle-class values also make them more likely to want to look a certain way and avoid conflict, says Rachel Simmons, author of best-selling book Odd Girl Out. That also means any anger and aggression comes out in indirect ways — such as those brutal video judgments. What is so shocking is their total disregard for others’ feelings. But in an age where children spend longer in front of a screen than with friends, one result is that they’re not learning social skills or empathy. Indeed, they may be genuinely unaware of the impact. Throw into the mix that they see adults being just as judgmental on some of our most popular TV shows — The X Factor, Britain’s Got Talent, The Apprentice — and it’s easy to see where they get the idea that being nasty wins friends. ‘You are showing children that it’s entertaining to you — that normalises it,’ says Rosalind Wiseman, author of self-help book Queen Bees And Wannabes. But there may be a glimmer of hope. In a clip in another bedroom, Sophie, yet another girl in her early teens, signs off her YouTube video — which was viewed 13,000 times — saying: ‘If it offends anyone, I am not sorry. I don’t care because I am just telling the truth.’ The comments posted by viewers make clear that some of her peers see life very differently. ‘Everyone is beautiful in their own way. What is the point of doing these videos?’ asks one. ‘I can only hope that one day, you’ll understand what a terrible thing this is to do,’ adds another. Let’s hope parents can help that message spread before too many young lives are damaged. Some names have been changed.

"Historians have unearthed nearly 2,000 perfectly preserved examples of poignant graffiti written on the walls of a cave 100 feet beneath the French countryside by doomed First World War soldiers just weeks before they were to join the fighting on the Western Front. The inscriptions were found in Naours - a two-hour drive north of Paris - and left for posterity by young men facing the horror of trench warfare a few dozen miles away at the Somme. The site's proximity to the battlefields, where more than a million men were killed or wounded, adds to the discovery's importance, with experts saying: 'It provides insight into how they found a sense of meaning in the conflict.' Scroll down for video . Poignant: The names of 9th Battalion Australians' G. Fitzhenry of Paddington, Sydney and Alistair Ross of Lismore are engraved on the walls of the former chalk quarry in Naours, northern France and dated July 1916 . Horror or war: The inscriptions were found in Naours - a two-hour drive north of Paris - and left for posterity by young men facing the doom of trench warfare a few dozen miles away at the Somme . A direction sign engraved with the names of soldiers who went on to fight at the Somme is seen at the site in Naours, northern France . Discovery: Nearly 2,000 century-old inscriptions that have recently come to light at the former chalk quarry in Naours, northern France . One inscription found in a rough-hewn passage 100 feet underground read: 'James Cockburn 8th Durham L.I.' It's cut so clean it could have been left yesterday. Only the date next to it - April 1, 1917 - roots it in the horrors of the First World War. The piece of graffiti is just one of nearly 2,000 century-old inscriptions that have recently come to light in Naours. 'It shows how soldiers form a sense of place and an understanding of their role in a harsh and hostile environment,' said historian Ross Wilson of Chichester University in Britain. Etchings, even scratched bas-reliefs, were left by many soldiers during the war. But those in Naours 'would be one of the highest concentrations of inscriptions on the Western Front' that stretches from Switzerland to the North Sea, said Wilson. Photographer Jeff Gusky has tallied 1,821 individual names: 731 Australians, 339 British, 55 Americans, a handful of French and Canadians and 662 others whose nationalities have yet to be traced. 'All these guys wanted to be remembered,' Gusky says, pointing out examples from Texas and Florida.

History: The site's proximity to the Somme battlefields, where more than a million men were killed or wounded, adds to the discovery's importance, with experts saying: 'It provides insight into how they found a sense of meaning in the conflict' Painstaking: Jeffrey Gusky began photographing the site last December and has so far tallied 1,821 individual names: 731 Australians, 339 British, 55 Americans, a handful of French and Canadians and 662 others whose nationalities have yet to be traced . Naours' underground city is a two-mile-long complex of tunnels with hundreds of chambers dug out over centuries in the chalky Picardy plateau. During the Middle Ages villagers took shelter there from marauding armies crisscrossing northern France. By the 18th century the quarry's entrance was blocked off and forgotten. In 1887 a local priest rediscovered the site and it eventually became a tourist attraction. That's what likely drew the soldiers to it during the war, said Gilles Prilaux, an archaeologist for France's national archaeology institute. Gusky began a three-year study of the tunnels last July, intending to focus on the site's medieval past - but stumbled on this more recent slice of history. 'It was a big surprise' Prilaux said of the discovery of the World War I graffiti left by soldiers from Australia, Britain, Canada and the U.S. Soldiers left similar inscriptions in tunnels at Arras and Vimy. But unlike those sites, Naours is well back from the front lines. And it wasn't known to have been used as a shelter or hospital like other Western Front quarries. Naours' underground city is a two-mile-long complex of tunnels with hundreds of chambers dug out over centuries in the Picardy plateau . Location: Naours is only a few miles from Vignacourt, a town used as a staging area for troops moving up to and back from the Somme battlefields some 25 miles to the east . Taking a break: Experts believe the young soldiers from distant countries would have heard about the famous 'Naours caves' and taken advantage of a break from war to do some sight-seeing . Surprise find: Jeffrey Gusky began a three-year study of the tunnels last July, intending to focus on the site's medieval past - but stumbled on this more recent slice of history . Naours is only a few miles from Vignacourt, a town used as a staging area for troops moving up to and back from the Somme battlefields some 25 miles to the east. Prilaux thinks that the young soldiers from distant countries would have heard about the famous 'Naours caves' and taken advantage of a break from war to do some sight-seeing. That idea is backed by an entry in the diary of Wilfred Joseph Allan Allsop, a 23-year-old private from Sydney, Australia. 'At 1 p.m. 10 of us went to the famous Caves near Naours where refugees used to hide in times of Invasion' Allsop wrote on Jan. 2, 1917. Wilson said the importance of studying graffiti like this has only emerged in the last 10 to 20 years. 'What were previously regarded as incidental acts that occur away from the battlefield have been shown to be highly important in understanding the lives of those who experienced the conflict,' Wilson said. One of the most moving inscriptions at Naours was made by Herbert John Leach, a 25-year-old from Adelaide. His inscription reads 'HJ Leach. Merely a private. 13/7/16. SA Australia.' Barely a month after Leach added his name to the wall he was killed in action on Aug. 23, 1916, during the Battle of Pozieres. On his grave, in the Australian cemetery in nearby Flers, his father inscribed 'Duty Nobly Done.'","More than 2,000 perfectly preserved inscriptions were found on the walls of an underground cave in Naours, France .

Fox 2 reported that employees at Ceva Logistics, an international company specializing in freight shipping, heard moaning coming from a bathroom stall at around 10am Tuesday. Not long after, staffers entered the restroom and discovered blood all over a stall. The Ceva employees returned to the office asking their co-workers if everyone was OK, but one woman seating in a cubicle remained silent. Police were called to the office and found that the 26-year-old worker had blood on her clothes, but there was no sign of a baby.

"A Spanish hospital claims it has performed the 'world's most complex' face transplant, allowing a man terribly disfigured by a disease to lead a normal life. Doctors said the 27-hour procedure – to reconstruct the man's entire lower face and neck – is the most difficult surgery they have carried out to date. A spokesperson for the Vall d'Hebron hospital in Barcelona, where the surgery was performed, said a team of 45 doctors, surgeons, nurses and anaesthesiologists took part in the operation in February. Scroll down for video . The 45-year-old man, who did not want to be identified, underwent the 'world's most complex' face transplant to reconstruct his neck, mouth, tongue and throat. The X-rays show the man before and after the surgery . Other specialists from the hospital's plastic surgery and liver transplant departments were also brought in to advise on the procedure, details of which have only just been released. The patient, a 45-year-old man, did not want to be identified. Unlike similar operations, where a patient has had features of their face replaced, or rebuilt, the latest procedure was much more invasive. The man had suffered a condition called arteriovenous malformation for the past 20 years. This is a tangle of blood vessels in the brain which diverts blood from the arteries to the veins, bypassing normal brain tissue. In this man's case, it caused facial deformities and problems with his vision and speech. As a result, most of the man's face lower face was been reconstructed, including his neck, mouth, tongue and the back of his throat. And all the skin and muscles of his face, nose, lips, jaw, all teeth, palate and cheek bones were transplanted by using plastic surgery techniques and  microsurgery. There was, however, a risk of severe bleeding that put his life in danger. The man had been examined in several other hospitals, including the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School, which had considered him to be inoperable. Doctors at the Vall d'Hebron hospital in Barcelona, who carried out the procedure, say it was the world's most complex to date. The operation took a team of 45 medical staff 27 hours to complete . But the Vall d'Hebron hospital ruled surgery was his only treatment option - and this week reveled the good news that the man is now living a normal life. The hospital released a statement saying: 'This is the first time that a transplant of this complexity has been performed in the world.' 'The patient evolution after the surgery was successful, similar to any transplant patient at the hospital. 'Now he is already at home and only comes to the hospital for routine check-ups.' In 2010 the same hospital carried out the world's first full face transplant on a man who suffered an accident leaving him without a nose and with a deformed jaw and cheekbones. The first ever partial facial transplant was carried out by doctors in France in 2005, on a woman who had been mauled by her dog.","Vall d'Hebron hospital in Barcelona claims it has carried out a world-first .

"Scientists have revealed a sophisticated new dating . technique shows that Little Foot, an important fossil of an . early human forerunner unearthed in the 1990s in South Africa, . is roughly 3.7 million years old. 'The age of Little Foot has been highly debated,' said . geologist Darryl Granger of Purdue University in Indiana, whose . research appears in the journal Nature. The study found Little Foot, a member of the species . Australopithecus prometheus, lived at roughly the same time as . Australopithecus afarensis, the species whose most famous . fossil, known as Lucy, comes from Ethiopia. Scroll down for video . The researchers analyzed 11 rock samples from around the nearly complete Little Foot fossil skeleton from theSterkfontein Caves to gauge its age . The researchers analyzed 11 rock samples from around the nearly complete Little Foot fossil skeleton from the Sterkfontein Caves to gauge its age. The species was much bigger and taller than Lucy's, with gorilla-like facial features but fully upright and very strong with powerful hands for climbing. Like Lucy, Little Foot was female. Its hands were proportioned like ours, with a long thumb and . relatively short fingers and palm, unlike the elongated hands of . modern apes. Its legs were slightly longer than its arms, unlike . modern apes. Both species blended ape-like and human-like traits but with different features. The researchers analyzed 11 rock samples from around the . nearly complete Little Foot fossil skeleton from the . Sterkfontein Caves to gauge its age. The findings may have important implications about the . evolutionary relationships among humankind's ancient relatives. Our species, Homo sapiens, appeared roughly 200,000 years . ago. Earlier members of the human genus, Homo, date back more . than 2 million years. Our genus was predated by other species on . the human family tree including various representatives of the . genus Australopithecus. Members of Lucy's species were contemporaries of Little . Foot, although Lucy herself lived about 500,000 years later. Like Lucy, Little Foot was female. The species was much . bigger and taller than Lucy's, with gorilla-like facial features . but fully upright and very strong with powerful hands for . climbing, according to paleoanthropologists Ron Clarke and Kathy . Kuman of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The face of Little Foot, which has now been accurately dated for the first time. Its hands were proportioned like ours, with a long thumb and . relatively short fingers and palm, unlike the elongated hands of . modern apes. Its legs were slightly longer than its arms, unlike . modern apes. Clarke and Kuman noted similarities in facial structure and . some teeth between Little Foot and the later human relative . Paranthropus, indicating Little Foot's species may have been . ancestral to Paranthropus or a close cousin. The new date for Little Foot indicates Lucy's species was . not the only one that could have given rise to later members of . the human family tree, Clarke and Kuman said. 'The fact, therefore, that we have at least two . (Australopithecus) species living at the same time in different . parts of Africa, (about) 3.67 million years ago, raises the . question of how many other species there may have been which . have not yet been discovered,' Clarke and Kuman said by email. The team used Purdue's PRIME Lab's powerful accelerator mass spectrometer and a new detector, called a gas-filled magnet detector, to measure the radioisotopes. 'We succeeded in our measurement, but we were surprised the dates were so old,' said Darryl Granger, a professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at Purdue. The team used Purdue's PRIME Lab's powerful accelerator mass spectrometer and a new detector, called a gas-filled magnet detector, to measure the radioisotopes. 'We succeeded in our measurement, but we were surprised the dates were so old,' Granger said. 'We double-and triple-checked our results, running the measurement again and again.' The gas-filled magnet creates a different charge on the two radioisotopes and throws the magnesium-26 on a different path with a curvature that misses the detector. This lowers the magnesium ratio and increases the aluminum-26 count in the sample that makes it to the detector, which results in a much smaller margin of error in the measurement. some of the other material found at the site: Stone tools found at a different level of the Sterkfontein cave also were dated at 2.18 million years old, making them among the oldest known stone tools in South Africa. The gas-filled magnet detector was originally to be used to analyze samples of solar wind collected by the Genesis spacecraft. Unfortunately, the space capsule carrying the samples crashed in 2004 on its return to Earth. The crash delayed analysis of the Genesis samples, but Caffee continued to build the detector and it was completed the summer of 2014. Caffee has since used it to perform analysis for other projects, including those from the Sterkfontein site. 'Only a few detectors of this kind exist in the world,' Caffee said. 'We double-and triple-checked our results, running the measurement again and again.' The gas-filled magnet creates a different charge on the two radioisotopes and throws the magnesium-26 on a different path with a curvature that misses the detector. This lowers the magnesium ratio and increases the aluminum-26 count in the sample that makes it to the detector, which results in a much smaller margin of error in the measurement. Ron Clarke, a professor in the Evolutionary Studies Institute at Wits University in South Africa holds the Little Foot skull, among the oldest hominid skeletons ever dated at 3.67 million years old, according to an advanced dating method.  The date places Little Foot as an older relative of Lucy, a famous Australopithecus skeleton dated at 3.2 million years old that was found in Ethiopia. The gas-filled magnet detector was originally to be used to analyze samples of solar wind collected by the Genesis spacecraft. Unfortunately, the space capsule carrying the samples crashed in 2004 on its return to Earth. The crash delayed analysis of the Genesis samples, but Caffee continued to build the detector and it was completed the summer of 2014. The new findings suggest Little Foot roamed the Earth at around the same time as the famed 3.2-million-year-old Lucy, an Australopithecus afarensis - shown in a reconstruction above. When discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia, Lucy was the only skeleton of the species known; she would've stood 3.5 feet (about a meter) tall. Currently, more than 300 individuals of this species, which lived between about 3.85 million and 2.95 million years ago, have been uncovered . Caffee has since used it to perform analysis for other projects, including those from the Sterkfontein site. 'Only a few detectors of this kind exist in the world,' Caffee said. 'One of the reasons I came to Purdue was to be a part of the revolutionary science that can be done when such resources are applied to challenging problems. These results highlight what can be accomplished through a collaboration that spans multiple disciplines. It couldn't have happened without the unique skills and resources each person brought to the table.' INRAP's French researcher Laurent Bruxelles shows Little Foot, a fossil with both ape-like and human features found in a cave at the Sterkfontein site, near Johannesburg. The 'Cradle of Life' is one of eight World Heritage Sites in South Africa . In 2008 the 47,000 hectare site site yielded the . discovery of Australopithecus sediba - thought to be an early human . ancestor that combines simian and modern human characteristics . The world-renowned Sterkfontein Caves is home to the oldest and most continuous paleaontological dig in the world. It is also the site of discovery of the famous pre-human skull affectionately known as 'Mrs Ples', and the almost complete hominid skeleton called 'Little Foot'. Granger's original attempt was the first time aluminum-26 and beryllium-10 radioisotopic dating had been used to determine the age of a fossil. He developed the method in 1997 and first used it to study changes in mountains, rivers and other geological formations. Because of their very slow rate of decay, these particular radioisotopes allow dating to reach back millions of years, much further in history than the more commonly known carbon-14 dating that can only stretch back about 50,000 years, he said. Only a small amount of the radioisotopes remain in the quartz after millions of years, and it can only be measured by the ultrasensitive analysis of accelerator mass spectrometry. 'We had given up and nearly walked away from the project thinking we had failed,' Granger said. 'Then the new detector was completed, and we thought we would give it one last try.'

"Satellite TV operator DirecTV has pulled the plug on its popular advertising campaign featuring 80s heartthrob Rob Lowe after complaints by rival Comcast. The cable company complained to the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division (NAD) that the ads featured a number of false claims and the watchdog has ruled that several of the campaign's claims couldn't be substantiated. The series of ads, which launched last October, featured the 50-year-old actor playing two characters: a handsome Lowe in a slick suit who is always the DirecTV customer and then an 'odd or awkward alter-ego' who was a cable user. Scroll down for video . Satellite TV operator DirecTV is ending its advertising campaign featuring 80s heartthrob Rob Lowe after complaints by rival Comcast that their claims couldn't be substantiated . The ads all ended with Lowe saying: 'Don't be like this me — Get rid of cable and upgrade to DirecTV.' The NAD report highlighted a number of inaccurate claims concerning signal reliability, shorter  customer service wait times, better picture and sound quality and a better sports package. Other issues included the 'superiority message' of Lowe's closing phrase, as well as DirecTV's 'rated No. 1 claim' and another that stated that it has been 'ranked higher than cable for over 10 years.' The NAD also recommended that DirecTV 'either discontinue the price claim featured in the ""Scrawny Arms Rob Lowe"" commercial or modify it to reflect the price of a package that included the sports programming featured in the commercial.' 'While humor can be an effective and creative way for advertisers to highlight the differences between their products and their competitor's, humor and hyperbole do not relieve an advertiser of the obligation to support messages that their advertisements might reasonably convey — especially if the advertising disparages a competitor's product,' the NAD said on Tuesday. A National Advertising Division report highlighted a series of inaccuracies concerning signal reliability, shorter customer service wait times, better picture and sound quality . 'Given the absence in the record of supporting evidence, NAD recommended the advertiser discontinue the claims.' DirecTV has said it disagrees with NAD's findings with respect to its ranking claims, picture quality claims and sports programming claims and that it plans to appeal. The operator is discontinuing the Lowe-fronted ads, but claims that 'it was always scheduled to end at the end of Q1'. 'We wanted to launch our new campaign with Hannah Davis in the Final Four [NCAA basketball championship],  Jon Gieselman, SVP, Marketing at DirecTV told TheWrap. 'We always reserve the right to bring back the Rob Lowe campaign, either in its current form or with new spots, it has been extremely successful for the brand.' The company had previously argued that its advertisements were 'so outlandish and exaggerated that no reasonable consumer would believe that the statements being made by the alter-ego characters are comparative or need to be substantiated.'","Satellite TV operator has ended the campaign  after complaints by rival Comcast that their claims couldn't be substantiated .
