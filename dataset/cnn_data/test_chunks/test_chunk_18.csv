"Patrick Vieira's Manchester City Elite Development Squad saw their Barclays Under 21 Premier League title hopes take a hit as an own goal gifted West Ham a deserved victory over them at Upton Park. A Dan Potts header and Adam Drury's own goal gave West Ham a two-goal lead before Olivier Ntcham pulled back a goal for City, but it was not enough. Patrick Vieira's side were missing a number of players who were busy preparing for Monday night's FA Youth Cup final second leg against Chelsea, when they will be looking to overturn a 3-1 deficit at Stamford Bridge. Dan Potts scored the opener to set West Ham on their way before an own goal doubled their lead . Patrick Vieira witnessed his Manchester City Under 21s side lose to West Ham  at Upton Park on Friday . West Ham United: Spiegel, Knoyle, Page (c), Nasha (Mavila 80), Pask, Potts, Ward (Pike 72), Makasi, Brown, Diangana, Parfitt-Williams. Unused subs: Bogard, Westley, Hector-Ingram. Manchester City: Gunn, Drury, Oliver, Smith-Brown, Horsfield, Holland, Intima, Ntcham, Pozo, Glendon (c), Dilrosum (Nuttall 60). Unused subs: Tattum, O'Brien, Bullock, Fernandes. Under the Upton Park lights, the hosts took the lead inside just 11 minutes. A Djair Parfitt-Williams cross came in from the right and full back  Potts was the surprise recipient, popping up to head past Angus Gunn at the far post. City rallied and Potts proved his worth at the other end, clearing Jorge Intima's strike off the line following a corner. The visitors were in the ascendency going into half-time but within nine minutes of the restart West Ham had doubled their lead and this time it was a gift. Jordan Brown fired in a teasing cross and Drury could only stab into his own net in an attempt to clear. Olivier Ntcham, pictured playing against Roma earlier this season, pulled one back but it was in vain . City finally pulled one back with 14 minutes to go when Ntcham rounded goalkeeper Raphael Spiegel to half the deficit. Tom Holland and Jose Pozo both went close to levelling matters and substitute Fernandes shot wide when he maybe should have scored. But the Hammers held on for three points as City's title hopes at Under 21 level took a hit.","Manchester City lost in the Under 21 Premier League at Upton Park .

"A home video of a six-year-old boy taking his morning pills to treat cystic fibrosis has had more than one million hits in just a week – with no sign of global interest waning. The  footage of Jesse O'Brien was taken by his mother Heidi, 37, to encourage the brave youngster to take the vast volume of drugs he has to consume every single day to battle his terminal illness. 'I've always wanted to be famous so this is just brilliant,' says Jesse, from Kesgrave, Suffolk, who is seen taking nine out of his daily dose of 45 pills. Scroll down for video . Jesse O'Brien, pictured with his mother Heidi, has to take a daily dose of 45 pills to treat cystic fibrosis . A video of six-year-old Jesse O'Brien (left) taking his morning pills (right) to treat cystic fibrosis has gone viral . Heidi, a nail technician, said her idea to provide encouragement with ‘likes’ on Facebook from family and friends exceeded her wildest expectations within just one hour. 'Jesse’s been in and out of hospital his whole life with his cystic fibrosis, and I remembered once taking a picture to post on Facebook and it lifting his spirits,' Heidi revealed. 'For the past two months Jesse has been getting increasingly frustrated with the amount of medication he has to take, and last Wednesday morning I had the brainwave to try the same trick. 'Jesse’s always loved attention, so he agreed, I posted it up on Facebook and YouTube, then his dad took him to school.' The footage of Jesse (pictured) was taken by his mum Heidi, 37, last Wednesday to encourage the brave youngster to take the vast volume of drugs he has to consume every single day to battle his terminal illness . It was only after putting their five-month-old son Rocco down for a morning nap just over an hour later that Heidi realised this time would be different. 'I was expecting ten or maybe 20 views and likes, but saw there were over 4,000,' she said. 'I remember staring at the my phone thinking there must be some mistake, so I called my husband Chris, and he was as shocked as me. 'I sat there crying at how amazing it was to have so much support from complete strangers. I spent most of that day personally thanking everyone who’d posted words of encouragement.' By the time Heidi picked up Jesse from Heath Primary School, they had more than 12,000 views. 'I told Jesse the news when we got home and screamed and dived on the sofa – he was hysterically happy, which brought tears to my eyes,' she says. By 7pm, around Jesse’s bed time, there were over 70,000 hits, so Jesse made a poster saying: ‘Oh My God, this will definitely help me take my meds!’ Jesse lives at home with his mum and dad, siblings Brooklyn Randell, 14, Tigerlily O'Brien, five, and new four-month-old arrival Rocco O'Brien (pictured) Jessie pictured with his sister Tigerlily during a visit to Legoland . His mum posted a picture of Jesse holding that poster up on Facebook as a way of saying thank you to all the well-wishers, realising she no longer had time to send individual messages of gratitude. By the time Heidi and Chris went to bed that evening they were up to 100,000, then 200,000 by the end Thursday. 'We made a poster each time we hit another 100,000, but it was snowballing so fast by the time we were finishing one poster, we’d hit the next target – it was crazy,' Heidi says. 'Of course Jesse’s only six years old, so anything over 1,000 to him is incomprehensible, but he could tell by our reaction how this had gone viral.' The video finally hit the one million mark exactly a week after Heidi posted it, first thing on Wednesday morning. 'We decided to post another video of Jesse telling everyone in his own words as we had to show how much this meant,' she says. 'Since then I haven’t been able to tell how much more than one million we’ve gone to, because my phone can’t show a bigger number than one million – I’m going to have to upgrade my phone!' 'I've always wanted to be famous so this is just brilliant,' says Jesse, based in Kesgrave, Suffolk, who must take 45 pills every day to manage his condition . The family has received personal messages from all over the world, Nigeria to Canada to New Zealand, and so many words of support from other families affected by cystic fibrosis . The family has received personal messages from all over the world, Nigeria to Canada to New Zealand, and so many words of support from other families affected by cystic fibrosis. Every day Jesse has to take 45 different pills, use a nebuliser to administer more medication, on top of four 15-minute physio sessions.. 'It’s crushing seeing him so upset at all this pain he has to go through,' Heidi says. 'It’s about three hours a day, and it’s only because he’s hit this more aware age that he’s protesting, and I honestly can’t blame him. 'But it’s my job as his mum to protect him as best I can against this terrible illness which we know will most likely take him from us in the not too distant future.' Jesse was just a two-week-old baby when he was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. The devastating genetic disorder hits the lungs and digestive system as they become clogged with thick sticky mucus. He was rushed to the Royal London Hospital and prescribed drugs to tackle the condition, a regime which has changed and grown with each passing year. 'Because of the video he’s now fine with the pills, but he still hates using his nebuliser,' Heidi says. 'The trouble with cystic fibrosis is that it doesn't show - you can't see it, so it’s harder to let people know something is wrong and to raise awareness and funds to find a cure for what is now an untreatable illness. 'People have said they’ve shown the video to their son or daughter who needs medication and it’s helped them a lot. Others are saying ""Wow, if he can take nine tablets, why can't mine?""' Jesse was just a two-week-old baby when he was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis . Jesse plays as a striker for Woodbridge Peckers and supports Ipswich Town, Liverpool and Barcelona . His dad, Chris O'Brien, 39, a self-employed builder, said: 'I even forget he's got CF a lot of the time. 'All my family say Jesse is a true little fighter. They always say to me, ""you're lucky he is how he is, because he will fight it"".' Jesse lives at home with his siblings Brooklyn Randell, 14, Tigerlily O'Brien, five, and new four-month-old arrival Rocco O'Brien. The family were given the bombshell after Rocco’s birth that while he doesn’t have the condition, he carries the same faulty gene so will need have any prospective partner tested to avoid the very risk of their children having cystic fibrosis. 'We were told that if he’d born with CF 20 years ago his life expectancy would’ve been just ten, but because of medical developments that figure’s around 30 now,' Chris says. 'Every year that goes by more advances are made, and we’re obviously doing everything we can to raise awareness and funds. We’re just taking each day as it comes.' Jesse, pictured as a toddler, was just a two-week-old baby when he was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. The devastating genetic disorder hits the lungs and digestive system as they become clogged with  mucus . Jesse plays as a striker for Woodbridge Peckers and supports Ipswich Town, Liverpool and Barcelona. James Barrow, spokesman from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust charity which has been supporting the family, says: 'It's great to see young people like Jesse raising awareness of cystic fibrosis. 'His video illustrates how young people living with the condition often have to undertake a lengthy and difficult regime on a daily basis just to keep well.' To support children like Jesse, text JESSE to 70300 to donate £3 to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting genetic condition. Only half of those diagnosed with the illness live to celebrate their 40th birthday. It causes the internal organs, especially the lungs and digestive system, to become clogged with thick sticky mucus, resulting in chronic infections and inflammation of the lungs. Cystic fibrosis directly affects around 10,000 people in the UK. The faulty gene is carried by over two million people in the UK, most of whom have no idea. If two carriers have children, there’s a one in four chance their child will have the condition, which slowly destroys the lungs and digestive system. People with cystic fibrosis often look perfectly healthy. But it poses a lifelong challenge involving daily intake of drugs, time-consuming physiotherapy and isolation from others with the condition. It places a huge burden on those around them and the condition can critically escalate at any moment. Olivia and her family have been supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, which is in its 50th year. The charity aims to fundraise for better treatments and investment into cutting edge research so that people with cystic fibrosis can also look forward to their fiftieth birthdays.

"Men do almost twice the amount of housework after they retire - but they are still doing far less than their wives, according to new research. The study of 1,302 German couples found working men did just two hours of house work each day, which almost doubled to 3.9 hours when they retired. But they are still lagging behind their stay-at-home female partners when it comes to sharing the burden. Division of labour: Men do just two hours of housework a day while working, which increases to 3.9 after they retire - but it is still far less than the amount carried out by their stay-at-home wives . The study, published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, found women who did not work did an average of 6.8 hours before their husband's retired. Chores included doing the laundry and the washing up, as well as running errands, according to New York Magazine. However, the number of hours they did each day only dropped to 6.1 after their husbands retired. What's more, it seems the men were still avoiding the washing up, even post-retirement. The research noted the increase in the men's hours was mainly taken up by more 'manly' chores - like repairs and gardening. However, the study - conducted by Thomas Leopold at the University of Amsterdam and Jan Skopek at the European University Institute - does not reveal how the burden was shared when both the husband and wife were working. Manly: The men were also less likely to do the 'female' chores, sticking to gardening and repairs .","Study of 1,302 couples found working men do two hours of chores a day .

"After years of hoping he would rip opposition defences to shreds, Pep Guardiola has admitted he has to start trying to work out a way to stop Lionel Messi. On the prospect of facing the greatest player in Barcelona's history, Guardiola – the greatest coach the club has had – said: 'We will have to see what we can do in each of the two games and we will try to create the best defensive system possible to stop Messi. 'They are a wonderful team but so are we,' said the Bayern Munich boss. Pep Guardiola will be reintroduced to Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals . The Bayern Munich coach must think of a way to stop the superb Lionel Messi next month . Guardiola goes back to Barcelona with the team now coached by Luis Enrique playing their best football since he left the club in 2012. 'It will be a very special game for me,' he said after the teams were drawn to face each other. 'It will also be special for Thiago [Alcantara] and for the rest of the coaching staff. I lived my whole life in Barcelona, it' s my home.' Guardiola nurtured Messi into the best player in the world while manager at the Nou Camp . Guardiola showed how much the club still means to him when alongside his father he watched them beat Manchester City in the last 16, cheering them on from the stands of the Nou  Camp. He did little to hide his appreciation for Messi that night and admitted that the four-times Ballon d'Or winner could punish Bayern if they are as sloppy as they were in the first leg against Porto in the quarter-finals. They went down 3-1 before hammering the Portuguese outfit 6-1 in Bavaria. He said: 'If we make the same mistakes then the tie will be all over in Barcelona.'","Bayern Munich face Barcelona in the Champions League semis .

"It's the hallowed turf where the modern day game of rugby was born when one of its pupils picked up a football and ran with it in the early 19th century. Rugby School is known as the spiritual home of the game, with the World Cup trophy named the Webb Ellis Cup in honour of the schoolboy called William who made the daring decision to disregard the rules in 1823. Today the school is still steeped in the traditions of the sport, alongside its own rich history of 'muscular Christianity' led by its most famous headmaster, Dr Thomas Arnold who is credited with transforming Rugby School's values in an effort to build pupils' characters.

"Jose Mourinho resisted the temptation until someone mentioned defending. Arsene Wenger had been talking about how it was easier to set up a team designed primarily to defend, just as Brendan Rodgers had ventured after Chelsea’s victory at Liverpool, last year. ‘It’s not easy, not easy,’ said Mourinho. ‘If it was easy, you wouldn’t lose 3-1 at home to Monaco. If he defends well he draws 0-0 against Monaco and wins in Monte Carlo. It’s not easy to defend.’ Jose Mourinho hit back at Arsene Wenger during his pre-match press conference on Friday . Arsene Wenger (left) and Mourinho have over a decade of history in the Premier League . Arsene Wenger will be sick of the sight of Didier Drogba. He has scored 13 times for Chelsea against Arsenal, averaging a goal every 87 minutes. Monaco, ouch. Mourinho is not afraid to hit where it hurts. Arsenal have been brilliant since the turn of the year, but they were downright awful at home to Monaco. They conceded three and they crashed out of the Champions League. It was a blemish to support the theory that Arsenal are fine until the pressure is on. When Chelsea crashed out of Europe they were, as usual, snarling and disputing every decision. ‘Maybe you will discover the Chelsea team are completely offensive and we are defensive for 90 minutes,’ said Wenger, resorting to sarcasm as he assessed the clash at the Emirates on Sunday. ‘Our job is to win football games and that’s what they’ve done in recent games. What’s important for me is to do what it takes to win the game. It’s easy to defend, if we have to defend then we will defend.’ It is the issue at the heart of this ideological clash. On one side Wenger, committed to the romance of attractive football. On the other Mourinho, doing what it takes to win even if it proves ugly, stacking up the trophies. Beat Arsenal and Leicester, on Wednesday, and he will clinch the title. Arsenal lost 3-1 to Monaco in the Champions League - a result which Mourinho mentioned to the media . Prince Albert of Monaco celebrates with the away fans after the full-time whistle at the Emirates . Wenger looks dejected as he stands on the touchline during the Gunners' Champions League defeat . The challenge for Wenger is next season. Can he produce a team fit to fight for the title once again? ‘We have played amazingly well for most of the season,’ said Mourinho. ‘In the last period we have been more strategic and less artistic because we had injuries and suspensions and lost the balance of our team. ‘But we are having results. It is a great feeling to deal with the difficult moment in a strategic way. When you are lost at sea and you have no boat, you must survive. You build a raft.’ Diego Costa’s injuries and suspensions were Chelsea’s shipwreck. Without his muscular spearhead, the balance was lost and it is three months since his team won by more than one goal. Still they win, taking six points from their last two games — against QPR and Manchester United — while recording a total of only three shots on target. They are, as Wenger says, efficient. ‘We are top since day one,’ said Mourinho. ‘We are second in terms of goals scored. We are second best for goals conceded, the team with fewest defeats. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (second from left) scores against Manchester United last time out . Hazard scored the only goal of the game against United to take Chelsea a step closer to the league title . A TV camera gets a close-up of the goalscorer as Hazard celebrates with Didier Drogba at Stamford Bridge . ‘We have some of the best goals of the season, not individual action or shots like Charlie Adam’s from midfield, but spectacular team goals. ‘So, if we win the Premier League, we did everything right. It will be a great achievement. Looking at where Chelsea were in the last four or five years, it means a lot.’ It will be the first title in five years at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal have not won it since 2004, the year of Wenger’s Invincibles and the year Mourinho first swept into London claiming to be the Special One. Since then, two famous clubs have been soaked in the contrasting views of two men. Arsenal are Wenger, after more than 18 years of his leadership, and Chelsea have been Mourinho for more than a decade — even during his six-year absence. Mourinho (right) and Wenger have had plenty of touchline battles during their managerial careers . The pair rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital . Arsenal's Emmanuel Eboue is restrained by Chelsea boss Mourinho during the 2007 League Cup final . They rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital. For many years, Wenger pursued Chelsea for ‘financial doping’ and, more recently, their tactical style, while Mourinho gorged on Arsenal’s nine years with neither a trophy nor a managerial change. Mourinho has never lost to Wenger, a record which clearly eats away at the Frenchman, who exploded on the touchline at Stamford Bridge, in October, and shoved the Chelsea manager in the chest. There has been no apology. ‘No, but I don’t need that,’ shrugged Mourinho, who remains incredulous that Wenger was not disciplined by the FA. Does he feel it would have been different had the roles been reversed? ‘I don’t feel, I know,’ he said.","Chelsea can secure the league title if they beat Arsenal and Leicester .

"Francis Coquelin is confident he can show his potential as Arsenal's long-term midfield enforcer when he goes head to head with 'unbelievable' Nemanja Matic in Sunday's Barclays Premier League showdown with Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners tackle the leaders aiming to eat into their 10-point advantage at the top of the table following last weekend's 1-0 victory over third-placed Manchester United. Coquelin was drafted back into the Arsenal squad from a loan spell at Charlton in December, since when the 23-year-old has gone on to cement his place in shielding the back four, and has been instrumental during a run of 21 victories from the last 25 matches. Francis Coquelin has made 23 appearances for Arsenal this season since ending his loan spell at Charlton . Coquelin is looking forward to his duel with Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic on Sunday at the Emirates . The Frenchman, though, knows he will be up against one of the best defensive midfielders around when the Serb Matic aims to close out another triumph for Jose Mourinho's men. 'What he has done is unbelievable. At Chelsea he is one of the main men, so credit to him. He has had a great season and is a great player. It is always good to play against players like that,' Coquelin said on Arsenal Player. 'It is an important position and Matic has shown how important he is - that is what I am trying to do as well for Arsenal. 'The fans want a good defensive midfielder - they know it is important for the team.' Arsenal will be out to beat Chelsea for the first time since October 2011, when Robin van Persie netted a hat-trick in a remarkable 5-3 victory at Stamford Bridge. Coquelin played against Reading in the FA Cup semi-final last weekend and has cemented his place in the side . Wenger, though, has every confidence his side can again answer another stern examination. 'From a good run of form you get a good belief and we have a good solidarity,' he said. 'We know that we have passed many tests recently where we were questioned. This season is the first time we have won away from home against Manchester City [in a while]. 'So we have passed many tests and we have another on Sunday that we want to pass.' Wenger added: 'Chelsea have been very, very efficient on counter-attacks, very efficient on set-pieces as well, so to nullify their strengths will be important.'","Francis Coquelin ready for head-to-head battle with Nemanja Matic .

"Mark Selby fell victim of the Crucible curse and a rookie Scot with pots of class as Anthony McGill pulled off a monumental Betfred World Championship shock. Qualifier McGill exuded calm assurance as he saw off the defending champion 13-9 to book a quarter-final place, never appearing overawed by the match or the gradual position of control he developed over the course of Friday. This is McGill's first World Championship and it had already been one to remember before he crossed cues with Selby, having beaten his fellow Glaswegian and sometime practice partner Stephen Maguire 10-9 in the opening round, finishing with a century. Anthony McGill celebrates beating Mark Selby during day seven of the Betfred World Championships . Sinking Selby made it even more special, and now the sky is the limit for the 24-year-old, who has been quietly earmarked for greatness by those who know him best. Former Crucible semi-finalist Alan McManus, a close friend and a steady hand on McGill's shoulder, has tipped the former Junior Pot Black runner-up to take the trophy in Sheffield one day, and Ronnie O'Sullivan said there would be no worthier champion because of his dedication. In 2005, Shaun Murphy came through qualifying and went on to lift the title. Tantalisingly Murphy could be next in line for McGill, a slender, shy man with a short ginger crop and a contagious giggle he often breaks into around the table. Selby, the Jester from Leicester, found little to laugh about during their contest. Like Murphy 10 years ago, McGill was a 150/1 outsider with bookmakers before the tournament began. McGill was the architect of Selby's demise, but the famous curse, which has at the very least become a factor lodged in the back of every first-time champion's mind, will be cited too. Selby (left) congratulates McGill on his victory during day seven of the Betfred World Championships . No maiden winner of the World Championship in Sheffield has returned a year later to retain the trophy, with Selby becoming the 16th man to falter, joining a list that includes greats of the game such as Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and O'Sullivan. A steady opening session on Thursday had seen he and McGill reach 4-4, but the Scot stretched 10-6 clear by lunch on Friday after firing breaks of 56, 125 and 54, and there was no flinching from the outsider when play resumed in the evening. They shared the opening two frames, before 87 from McGill took him 12-7 clear, inflicting a mortal blow to Selby's prospects. McGill sets his sights on the white has he plays his way to victory against Selby at the Crucible . When Selby edged the next he at least had the thinking time the subsequent interval allowed, knowing he needed a further five frames without reply to extend his defence. He re-emerged with a break of 101 to make it 12-9 and keep McGill waiting. But not for long. After a safety battle, McGill potted a terrific red to the middle pocket and was away on a victory charge, firing in a brilliant 82 before Selby offered a warm handshake. McGill said: 'I'm just ecstatic. To beat the world champion at the Crucible, I just can't believe it . 'No-one expected me to win. I wasn't expecting myself to win, I was just hoping to put up a decent fight and try my best. Selby's facial expressions say iy all as he crashes out of the World Championship at the Crucible . 'I knew if I gave everything my mind would have been at ease whatever the result . 'To beat Mark 13-9 is just a dream. I knew it wasn't over even when it went 12-7. He's not world champion for nothing. 'Time and time again Mark Selby comes back at people, and better players than me. 'It seems like every time I win a game it's the biggest win of my career. Fingers crossed it keeps happening.' McGill will be careful not to let his mind drift beyond a last-eight clash with Murphy or Joe Perry, who begin their second-round clash on Sunday. Snooker player Selby in action against Anthony McGill during day seven of the Betfred World Championships . 'I've knocked out the world champion, so you think whoever knocks him out could (win the title) - but I don't know,' McGill said. 'It's going all right but I'm not winning enough frames in one visit. There's a few areas I need to brush up on before I start thinking about those things. 'I don't think people will be fearing me. 'I'm probably a good draw in the quarter-finals of the World Championship to be honest. I'll just go out and try my best. 'Some players might let the attention get to their head but not me.'

"Joe Root admitted pitches like the one in Grenada make it easier to make centuries and harder to win games, as West Indies batted themselves into a position of relative comfort on day four of the second Test. Regardless of the state of the wicket, Root was in superb touch on his way to 182 not out in the morning session, his second highest score and the fourth of his six hundreds to pass the 150 mark. But for the second match in a row England's hopes of pushing for victory were railroaded by a dead pitch that was arguably better for run-making than on day one. Joe Root hits another ball to the boundary on his way to an impressive big hundred in Grenada . Root admitted that the flat pitch made it too easy to score runs and too tough to take wickets . Root's efforts left the West Indies with a 165-run deficit, but they cleared that to finish 37 ahead on 202 for two at stumps. Speaking after the match, Root lifted the lid on the tourists' frustrations. 'These pitches are great for batters because we get big scores but as far as Test cricket is concerned, it's not ideal,' he said. 'Unfortunately, it's a very unresponsive pitch and it's been hard work . 'We all thought it might break up a little bit more and give a little bit more spin than it has done, but unfortunately it hasn't happened. 'This is what we've got to deal with, and we've just got to get on the best we can.' Stuart Broad, who eventually took the wicket of Darren Bravo, found the going tough in Grenada . Ben Stokes sees the ball disappear to the boundary once again as England struggled on day four . In all likelihood, the destiny of the game will be decided in the morning. England are five overs away from a new ball - which has been the only bankable way of making things happen - and must make it count with a cluster of wickets to set themselves for success. 'We're going to need a very good first hour in the morning,' he said. 'With the new ball we'll need a couple of early wickets and you never know. They're only 40 ahead, so if it's bang bang in the morning we've got a game on our hands. 'That would definitely give us the best chance of winning the game on a very flat wicket. 'Our only chance is wickets with the new ball, whether it be with seam or spin, that's the way it looks at the moment, but you never know.' Root admitted that England need early wickets with the new ball, just as James Anderson achieved on day four . West Indies go in to the final morning with Kraigg Brathwaite on 101 not out having compiled a dogged fourth Test ton and England's tormentor-in-chief Marlon Samuels alongside. Samuels, who memorably saluted Ben Stokes after his dismissal on the third evening, was not sledged when he arrived at the crease but Root had no guarantees that would continue. 'Everyone was very well behaved tonight, there was no-one speaking up,' he added. 'We'll see how tomorrow goes. Concentration might come into it, and maybe a bit of banter could spice things up a bit.'","Joe Root scored 182* but criticises lifeless pitch in Grenada .

"Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man v PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the sixth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I recall when a hard man could take no more... THE NO MAS FIGHT . New Orleans, Louisiana . November 25, 1980 . Sugar Ray Leonard v Roberto Duran . The first two of the three fights between the Sugar Man and Hands of Stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing, with Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran, Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler engaging each other in some of the ring’s epic battles. By way of a preview, Leonard had defeated the previous — and equally great — Felix Trinidad to win the world welterweight title. Sugar Ray Leonard celebrates after Roberto Duran quit in their fight in Louisiana in November 1980 . Leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the Panamanian in the second fight . GEORGE FOREMAN V MUHAMMAD ALI . October 30, 1974, Kinshasa, Zaire . JOE FRAZIER v MUHAMMAD ALI . March 8, 1971, Madison Square Garden, New York . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . MUHAMMAD ALI V JOE FRAIZIER . October 1, 1975, Quezon City, Philippines . In his first defence, Sugar Ray had been contentiously outpointed by Duran in Montreal’s Olympic Stadium. So confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision. That was changed to unanimous in Duran’s favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147. There was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of Duran and only two for Leonard — with 10 even. That was described as ‘a monument to indecision’. Come the inevitable rematch eight months later, in the Louisana Superdome in New Orleans on November 25, 1980, controversy was to be replaced by disbelief. Leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the Panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out. Second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability, especially his speed and movement. Duran became frustrated as Leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches . After being caught flush in the face in the eighth round, Duran turned his back and said 'No mas' ‘The whole fight I was moving. Moving. Then voom, I’d snap his head back with a jab. Voom, I’d snap it back again. He’d try to get me on the ropes. I’d pivot, spin off and pow, come under with a punch.’ So it went for more than seven rounds, with Duran becoming increasingly frustrated. In the eighth Leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in Duran’s face. There had been a moment earlier when Leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside. Just before the bell Duran turned his back and walked to his corner, waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee: ‘No mas.’ Spanish for no more. Leonard celebrates after his opponent quit, and said it was more of an achievement than knocking Duran out . The result stunned the watching world, and it took three years for Duran to rebuild his reputation . The watching world was stunned. Here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible. Clearly he felt humiliated. Sensing the reaction Duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in. But his manager Carlos Eleta said: ‘He always eats like that before a fight. He quit because he was embarrassed.’ Duran had been a national icon in Panama and there was anger on the streets at his action. Television commercials featuring him were taken off. It took three years for Duran to restore his high place in his country’s esteem. He did so on June 16, 1983, his 32nd birthday, by knocking out Davey Moore in Las Vegas to win the world light-middleweight title. Rejoicing returned to the streets. Leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide, thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title. But Sugar Ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing Duran to say No Mas. He said: ‘To me, making Roberto Duran to quit was better than knocking him out.’","Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao is now just nine days away .

"Sam Burgess starred for Bath as Mike Ford's men moved within one point of Aviva Premiership leaders Northampton with a five-try hammering of London Irish at the Rec. Burgess, playing only his second game at blindside flanker, claimed the man-of-the-match award and was among the try-scorers along with Leroy Houston, Jonathan Joseph, Matt Banahan and Semesa Rokoduguni. The Exiles were ahead at half-time thanks to Tom Court's try, but Bath were in imperious form in the second period and coasted to victory - Blair Cowan scored a late consolation for the visitors.

Ford fired the home side into an early lead with a third minute peanlty after Exiles No 8 Tom Guest infringed at the breakdown. Bath began the match a furious pace and soon had the second kickable penalty of the night with Ford making no mistake from the tee four minutes later. Chris Noakes registered the first points of the night for the visitors in the 16th minute following a powerful Exiles scrum. Ford added two more penalties to give Bath a comfortable 12-3 lead after 30 minutes of play. Noakes clawed back three points with a second penalty and the former Auckland Blues No 10 almost scored the first try of contest when he intercepted Houston's pass to sprint clear. Anthony Watson had other ideas, however, as the England flyer showed great pace to get back and bring down the Exiles playmaker. Bath winger Matt Banahan glides over for another five-pointer during a dominate second-half . The Exiles were not be denied before the break as ex-Ulster prop Court burrowed over from close range after great work from Guest and Topsy Ojo in the build-up. Noakes knocked over the conversion to give his side a 13-12 lead heading into the break. It took Bath just six minutes of the second half to get their act together, however, as Houston peeled off an untidy scrum to touch down, with Ford adding the conversion. Five minutes later, Joseph raced away to score from his own chip and collect after deft work by Houston and Francois Louw. Ford converted again to give Bath a 26-13 lead. Bath lock Dave Attwood celebrates Burgess's bonus point-clinching try at the Rec . The third Bath try followed almost immediately as replacement lock Matt Garvey made a storming run into the visitors 22. From the ensuing ruck, the ball was moved swiftly to Kyle Eastmond whose long pass gave Banahan an easy route to the corner. This time Ford was wide with the conversion but the bonus point was wrapped up on the hour mark as Burgess touched down following a powerful driving maul from the home pack. Rokoduguni completed the rout in the 72nd minute with an easy finish in the corner. Scotland flanker Cowan barged his way over in the dying minutes but it was merely a consolation for Glenn Delaney's side.

Joe Root's 182 not out took him past 2,000 runs in Tests, the second fastest Englishman to the milestone . Dad Stokes joins fun . Thursday's play finished with Marlon Samuels’ comedy salute to England’s Ben Stokes after the batsman was dismissed following days of needling between the pair. Cue outrage from some, indifference from others and a sprinkling of laughter thrown in. Stokes’s dad, Gerard, saw the funny side, tweeting: ‘Great send off Marlon Samuels.

"Divock Origi has revealed that the progress of Jordon Ibe at Liverpool this season has left him counting the days until he makes his Anfield bow. The Belgium striker was signed by Liverpool in a £10million deal after impressing at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, before being loaned back to Lille for the 2014-15 season. But Origi has been following Liverpool's progress from across the English Channel and after seeing the rise of Ibe and Raheem Sterling, is eagerly anticipating working under Brendan Rodgers. Divock Origi said the progress of Liverpool's youngsters have heightened his excitement at joining the club . Origi referenced the progress of winger Jordon Ibe (left) as an example of youth players improving at the club . Origi added that he thinks the long-term progress of Raheem Sterling means he is joining the right club . 'When you see how the coach and the staff work with the young players - how Sterling, for example, has learned over the years and how Ibe is now integrating with the team, it is very interesting,' Origi told Liverpool's official website. 'It is very nice to have seen that this season. 'The manager is one of the reasons I came to Liverpool - he's someone who has proven he knows how to work with young players, knows how to develop young players and also lets them play.' Origi, who has scored seven times in Ligue 1 this season, believes that the backing of Liverpool's supporters will help him elevate his game. 'I'm somebody who when I feel loved, when I feel appreciated by the supporters, then I can give even more. It gives you a boost on the field.

Origi admits it has been a challenging season at Lille attempting balance the demands of the league with the Europa League but believes the experience he has gained means he will arrive at Liverpool a better player than this time last year.

"Paula Radcliffe expects her emotions to spill over once more when she pulls down the curtain on her competitive running career in Subday's London Marathon. David Beckham memorably cried in the dying moments of his last appearance for Paris Saint-Germain, overwhelmed during the final moments of his professional football career. ‘I spent most of my career crying, didn’t I?’ said Radcliffe, laughing at the comparison, ‘I have done enough crying but I don’t know, I think the marathon does that to you anyway because you are so exhausted by the end of it, emotions are really close to the surface.’ World record holder Paula Radcliffe says she is likely to cry when she runs the final race of her career . Sunday's London Marathon will be Radcliffe's final competitive marathon of her career . Radcliffe joked that she has never been far from tears in her career, as she was at the 2004 Athens Olympics . Radcliffe has battled with an injury to her left foot, which made it difficult for her even to walk short distances two months ago, to make it to the start line. She will set off with the masses rather than the elite runners but the memory of her stunning 2hr 15min 25sec world record run in London in 2003 will not be far from her thoughts. Almost 12 years later no woman has come close to that mark, but Radcliffe insists her remarkable time was not a mixed blessing. ‘I would never call it double-edged,’ she said, ‘The longer it stands, and now as I get older and training gets harder, I appreciate it a lot more than I did. When I crossed the line I thought I could go and run faster.’ Thereafter Radcliffe’s career was plagued by injury and misfortune, particularly at the Olympics. She pulled out of the Athens 2004 marathon at 22 miles and sobbed at the side of the road. In Beijing four years later she wept as she struggled over the line in 23rd place. She was forced to pull out of London 2012. The former World Champion says she knows she got the best out of her career, despite several injuries . Radcliffe set the world record in 2003 when she won the London Marathon in a time of 2:15:25 . ‘Maybe my career was a little bit shorter because I ran so hard to do those times early on. But, still, I can look back and say I got the best out of myself that I was capable of doing.’ Radcliffe maintained she wanted to finish her career on her own terms and in London. ‘If you said to me you could run another marathon hard and be competitive but you’ll never be able to run again, I wouldn’t choose that. ‘I don’t want to do something that would jeopardise the health of my foot. I want to be able to run with my kids.’ The 35th London Marathon will double up as the IPC World Championships, and the women’s elite race sees Edna Kiplagat attempt to retain her title. The men’s race features a much anticipated battle between defending champion Wilson Kipsang — who is aiming for a third win —and the new world-record holder Dennis Kimetto, who makes his London debut.","Paula Radcliffe will retire from competitive running after London marathon .

"An axe-wielding robber  has been jailed after his attempt to rob a store was foiled when he was jumped on by the shopkeeper and hit by his wife with a baseball bat. Ex-juvenile offender Shaun Andrew McKerry, dubbed Boomerang Boy or Homing Pigeon Boy in his youth, burst into Shildon Post Office and Stores, County Durham, at 8pm on March 15. The masked 31-year-old waved an axe as he demanded cash from terrified assistant Andrea Brighty, but he did not see owner Sab Dhillon's rugby tackle which dropped him to the floor, sending shelves and produce tumbling. Scroll down for video . As the men wrestled, Sab Dhillon's wife Sam helped by hitting McKerry with a baseball bat . She struck him twice, helping to disarm him while her husband twisted him around to reveal his face to the cameras . As the men wrestled, and with McKerry still holding the axe, Mr Dhillon's wife Sam helped, hitting him twice with a baseball bat to make him drop the weapon. Blood can be seen coming from the would-be robber's nose as Mr Dhillon gestures to his wife to drop the bat. Minutes later the police arrived and arrested McKerry. He previously pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court to attempted robbery and court officials confirmed he had been jailed for six years after the hearing today. McKerry, from Coundon near Bishop Auckland, earned the nicknames Boomerang Boy or Homing Pigeon Boy as he always returned home after committing a crime. He started shoplifting at the age of 12 and by 15 he had been arrested 80 times, and had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. McKerry once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave.

"With just two weekends of Football League action to play, and one in the Conference, it is crunch time for a number of clubs. Some are fighting for promotion and some relegation, but this Saturday could see a number of ups and downs in English football. Here, Sportsmail's guide takes you through the permutations in the Championship, League One, League Two and the Conference. Watford can be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth or Middlesbrough lose and Norwich fail to win . Rotherham's desire to stave off relegation to League One has been made more difficult by a points deduction .

"The draw for the Champions League has pitted Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich against his former club Barcelona, while handing Italian champions a daunting task against holders Real Madrid. With sub-plots aplenty, and quality assured, the final four of European's premier competition will all feel they have a real chance of adding to their European titles. Sportsmail's reporters look at each side's reasons for optimism, and caution, ahead of the semi-finals... BAYERN MUNICH by Chris Wheeler . Reasons they can win the Champions League… . Bayern have an excellent Champions League pedigree, with a coach in Pep Guardiola who won this competition twice at Barcelona and a squad that has retained its best players since beating Borussia Dortmund in the final at Wembley two years ago. So do Barca and Real Madrid but, unlike their main rivals, Munich can focus largely on Europe thanks to a 12-point lead over Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga and the minor inconvenience of a German Cup semi-final against Dortmund. Guardiola can also expect to call on key players like Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger who did not appear in either of the quarter-final legs against FC Porto. Pepe Guardiola issues instructions to his players during a supremely impressive performance against Porto . Guardiola must now work out how to prevent his side's old vulnerabilities returning against Barcelona . Reasons they can’t… . Usually so dominant, there is a peculiar vulnerability about Bayern under Guardiola. It was painfully evident in their 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals a year ago, and again in the 3-1 loss to Porto earlier this month before they turned it around in the second leg in stunning fashion. Munich cannot afford to be off their game against Barca. No-one knows Guardiola’s game-plan better than his old club. He will have to overcome them - and then possibly Real - if he wants to win the Champions League again. Bayern were brilliant in Munich, but a repeat of their Porto horror-show could see them dumped out . REAL MADRID by Pete Jenson . Reasons they can win the Champions League… . There’s a sense that the worst has past. They did not want Atletico Madrid in the quarter-finals having failed to beat them already six times this season. Then when Jan Oblak worked his miracles in the first leg and the injuries and suspensions mounted up in the second, the task looked even tougher but they came through. Carlo Ancelotti was vindicated for pitching Javier Hernandez into his forward line and moving Sergio Ramos into midfield. With the coach in a strong position and the squad behind him they can do it. Real Madrid will feel like they have got over their biggest hurdle after their late win over Atletico Madrid . Reasons they can’t… . No one player is more important to Real Madrid than Luka Modric. They can cope without Bale if Ronaldo is playing and they can cope without Ronaldo if Bale is playing — they won the Copa del Rey last year that way. But Bale’s former Tottenham team-mate has no real replacement. Atletico were poor on Wednesday night and so the Croatian was not missed too much but against Juventus his absence will be felt. He could be back for the final but they may not get there without him. The injury to Luka Modric is the single biggest obstacle standing in Carlo Ancelotti's way to retaining the title . JUVENTUS by Neil Ashton . Reasons they can win the Champions League... The travel advice to anyone planing to watch Juventus in the semi-final is to take a good book. Massimiliano Allegri’s team are living proof that the art of defending Italian-style is alive and well after keeping nine clean sheets in their last 10 matches. That three-man defence, comprising Leonardo Bonucci, Andrea Barzagli and Giorgio Chiellini, loves smothering opposition strikers. Conceivably both legs of the semi-finals could finish 0-0 (as well as the final) and the Italians will be delighted to fast-forward to the penalty shootout. Up front they rely on the example set by their talisman Carlos Tevez, with his non-stop chasing and harrying of opposition defenders, plus his goals. The likes of Giorgio Chiellini (left) and Leonard Bonucci have provided a solid defence for Juve to build on . Reasons they can’t… . Even Allegri knows there are many limitations with this Juventus team. Do not get seduced by the cries of ‘Ole ole ole ole, Juve Juve,’ because tiki-taka this isn’t. Andrea Pirlo’s masterful powers are also on the wane after his brilliant career with Milan, Juve and Italy. Andrea Pirlo still runs the show for the Old Lady, but the Italian's best days are now behind him . BARCELONA by Pete Jensen . Reasons they can win the Champions League… . It may be true that Bayern Munich have scored 115 goals this season but Leo Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar have scored 95 between them. Barcelona’s front three have clicked in a way that Luis Enrique would not have dared dream. Neither is the Barcelona forward line ornamental when the team are defending. Messi drops deep to try to get the team passing — once he has stopped being Messi he will become the new Xavi — and Suarez defends from the front chasing down the opposition and forcing errors. There is a sense that they are carrying the team to Berlin. Barcelona's front three of Luis Suarez (left), Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi can carry the whole team . Reasons they can’t… . For now there are neither injuries nor suspensions but they are forever on the cusp of a potential crisis because the strength in depth is just not there. Ivan Rakitic, Sergi Busquets and Andres Iniesta is a fine midfield but the second-string middle three of Rafinha, Sergio Roberto and the now 35-year-old Xavi offers fewer guarantees. Likewise at the back there is a gulf in class between the four first-choice defenders and those who would have to step in. Injuries to key players like Ivan Rakitic could expose the lack of depth in Barcelona's squad .","Bayern Munich dmonstrated their quality in second-leg demolition of Porto .
But Pep Guardiola's side still have major vulnerabilities, as first leg showed .
Real Madrid may struggle without Luka Modric, despite easier draw .
Juventus' defence is reason for hope, but Andrea Pirlo is past his peak .
Barcelona's front three is formidable, but they lack required depth ."
"West Ham United's on-loan Barcelona midfielder Alex Song  has picked his #one2eleven of stars he played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports. Song, who has also played for Arsenal as well as representing Cameroon at international level, has picked a mixture of talent in his squad. Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. GOALKEEPER: CARLOS KAMENI . He could have played at one of the top teams in the Premier League. When I was playing for the (Cameroon) national team he would just say, 'just score and I will do the rest'. For me he is the best 'keeper. Alex Song believes Cameroon goalkeeper Carlos Kameni could have played in the Premier League . RIGHT-BACK: DANI ALVES . This guy is unbelievable. He plays like a joke. He makes things look so easy when he is going forward and his delivery is unbelievable. CENTRE-BACK: CARLOS PUYOL . He is a character player because he never gives up. Every time you need character, you want players to be like him. When he says 'vamos' at training, that's it, you have to wake up. He gives you motivation to come to training and is such a great professional. He is a captain and a leader. CENTRE-BACK: RIGOBERT SONG . He has the same character like Puyol. When I was young I was always watching him play. When you have this guy behind you, you don't have a lot of room. You will have a very bad night. Every time you would play for the national side people would say, 'you have to play like Rigobert Song' because they know he never gives up and shows a fighting spirit. Song believes Rigobert Song is a similar character to Carlos Puyol so makes his Fantasy Football Club XI . LEFT-BACK: JORDI ALBA . Jordi is like a small bike because he never stops running. He's very good with the feet as well. Every time he looks (to go) forward and attack . MIDFIELER: XAVI . Xavi is an unbelievable player. He gives you the tempo of the game. When you have this guy in the middle he sees everywhere (on the pitch) and always plays a good ball. He also knows how to slow the game down. MIDFIELER: ANDRES INIESTA . Iniesta is the magician. For one player it could be hard, but for him it's easy. I see him training every single day, he was unbelievable. When I went to Barcelona I was training with him but I couldn't get the ball off him. Song has room for Spanish midfielder Andres Iniesta in his side for the magician's magic touch . MIDFIELDER: CESC FABREGAS . He is one of the most clever players I have played against. For him, he sees everywhere and gives a good delivery. I know he is a quality player. He's done it at Arsenal and Barcelona so I was not surprised to see him come back to the Premier League with Chelsea. STRIKER: NEYMAR . He's just 23 and he has achieved so much at this age. When he came from Brazil people didn't think he would adapt to European football, but for him it's easy. I think he is doing very, very well. He is fast and knows how to dribble. I'm sure he will do well in the Premier League as well because he has the ability. Barcelona's Brazilian winger Neymar has earned himself a starting spot in Song's Fantasy Football Club XI . STRIKER: THIERRY HENRY . Thierry is the king. We played away against Real Madrid in the Champions League and he scored that goal. STRIKER: LIONEL MESSI . Messi is the best player I have seen in my life. There is nothing to say because he is just a genius. He is just 27 and has a lot of time to achieve so much more. When he comes into training, he just doesn't lose the ball. And when he loses in training, he is upset and that's what makes him such a special player. Song poses with his Fantasy Football Club XI which includes a whopping NINE Barcelona players .","West Ham's on-loan Barcelona ace has picked his Fantasy Football XI .

"Steven Davis believes the fact so many Southampton players worked under Mauricio Pochettino could give them the edge in this weekend's vital match against Tottenham. The former Argentina defender last season led Saints to their best ever Premier League points tally during a memorable campaign at St Mary's. Southampton fans' goodwill towards Pochettino was soon eroded, though, as his departure to White Hart Lane proved the catalyst to an unparalleled summer talent drain. Steven Davis (pictured against Hull earlier this month) says Southampton have an advantage over Spurs . Davis' assertions come as Mauricio Pochettino heads to Southampton for the first time since leaving . Despite that, just a point and a place separate Saints and Spurs as a remarkable season comes to a close, with a positive result for the hosts on Saturday enough to break the points record set last term. Victory would see Ronald Koeman's men usurp Spurs in the standings and bolster their European chances, with Davis, one of many to have worked under Pochettino, well aware of what a 'big game' this is for all connected to the club. 'The players never back away from (the fact this is a big game),' the Northern Ireland captain said. 'It's nice to be in a position where we're having big games at this stage of the season and there's an importance on it. 'We're looking forward to the game and hopefully we can bounce back and get the three points. 'It is great to be in a position where we're still challenging for a European spot at this stage. 'We've had a great season so far but we don't want it to peter out, really. 'It's about seeing it through and Saturday gives us an opportunity to pick up points against one of our nearest rivals.' James Ward-Prowse celebrates after scoring for Southampton against Hull City . Tottenham are the only current Premier League side Southampton have failed to beat since their Premier League return in 2012 - a run Davis believes the players' knowledge of Pochettino's methods can help them end. 'Obviously we know how Mauricio works and how he sets up his teams,' he told Southampton's official YouTube channel. 'Hopefully that will be an advantage to us in terms of the players as we know a bit of background . 'Obviously it will be nice to see him as enjoyed some good times under him here, but we're confident going into the game and looking to take the three points. 'The fans will hopefully get behind us as they always do. There will be an edge to the game with a returning manager, so it's a game for everyone to look forward to.'","Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham travel to St Mary's on Saturday .

"The man in the mask is back. But it might take more than a slice of carbon fibre to protect Cesc Fabregas from what could be a quite hateful reception when he takes his first steps at the Emirates Stadium since he left to join Barcelona. That 2011 move was seen and widely accepted - externally - as the prodigal son going home. This next fixture is seen by some as the return of a player who rejected a second coming at Arsenal in favour of Chelsea. He will surely win the league, having already won the Capital One Cup, but what has he lost at the club that made him? What of the line of communication he once had with Arsene Wenger? Cesc Fabregas will be making his first return to the Emirates since leaving Arsenal in 2011 . The 27-year-old is expected to wear a protective mask when he travels to north London this weekend . Fabregas joined Arsenal as a teenager (left) before returning to the Premier League with Chelsea (right) Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger speaks to a young Fabregas after snatching him away from Barcelona in 2004 . It has been suggested they have not spoken since Fabregas made the summer move that got so many backs up. There is nothing terribly unusual in that except they used to be so close, to the extent that Wenger continued to text Fabregas on birthdays and career milestones while he was at Barcelona. ‘He hasn’t spoken to me since I came back,’ Fabregas was quoted as saying in September. ‘It was the kind of relationship I always would have liked to keep. ‘But I'm sure once everything dies down a bit in the future we will talk. There is no problem. I'll always be grateful to him whatever happens.’ Except there is still believed to be only silence from the man he once called his ‘second father’. And for the first time, the Fabregas narrative is something less than delightfully romantic. Until now he had followed a largely clean script. He was the boy who attended his first Barca match as a nine-month-old baby with his grandfather. The tale of how he came to be their player 10 years later is wonderful. The story goes that he was playing for Mataro, 35km north of Barcelona. Rodolfo Borrell used to search the surrounding areas for young players for Barca’s Under 11s side and one day watched Fabregas’s team. Nothing to report. When he came back, two months later in September 1997, he saw a midfielder he simply needed to sign.

Fabregas impressed by scoring against Juventus as Arsenal reached the 2006 Champions League final . The Spaniard is involved in a scuffle with his future club during the 2007 Carling Cup final . ‘I went to see them play again and suddenly I saw this one player who was simply wonderful,’ he told the BBC. ‘They told me he was called Cesc Fabregas and he was one year younger than the rest. He was good at running with the ball, had a fantastic pass over short, medium and long distances. He was very mature for his age and had all the attributes we were looking for at Barcelona at that time. ‘At half-time, I asked the coach why I had not seen this kid before. He admitted that, when he saw me coming, he had decided not to play him because he knew that if I saw him I would take him.’ He ultimately became part of a group that included Lionel Messi, coming through the ranks. His idol was Pep Guardiola and when Fabregas’s parents divorced in 2001, Guardiola handed him a signed shirt with the message: ‘One day, you will be the number four of Barcelona.’ Wenger bestows his wisdom on a young Fabregas during a training session at London Colney in 2008 .

The Arsenal playmaker scores a penalty against Braga in the Champions League in 2010 . Alas, he left for Arsenal in 2003 having not been picked for a single first-team game. By the time he returned in 2011, he had become Arsenal’s youngest first-team player, their captain and a European Championship and World Cup winner with Spain. In 2005, aged 18 and with 60 first-team games already played, he told The Independent: ‘I will always be a fan of Barcelona. But Arsenal gave me an opportunity. It's like you are standing at a station and there's a train that you must take. It's the opportunity of your life. ‘At Barcelona, I was playing for the Under 16s. Here, they gave me the opportunity to play for the reserves straight away, soon the Carling Cup. It gave me the motivation that I needed. Now I want to improve, get more mature, get more experience.’ Fabregas celebrates with Spain team-mate David Villa en route to wining the 2010 World Cup in South Africa .

Fabregas walks off dejected after Arsenal crash out to his boyhood club Barca in the 2011 Champions League . The midfielder's relationship with mentor Wenger became strained after he left Arsenal in 2011 . Six years on from that interview, he detailed his relationship with the club and Wenger as he explained why he was joining Guardiola’s Barcelona. ‘I only won one FA Cup really, and this is the biggest regret I will have in my career, probably, not to be able to lift a trophy as Arsenal captain,’ he said. ‘I will always be an Arsenal fan because what they have done for me is unbelievable and I will never forget it. ‘Wenger is a special person to me. He'll always be a second father to me. I think if Arsenal want to keep being the club they are then they have to always be under his control, because he's the best, everyone respects him, and for me, he will always be the best person that I've met in football. ‘I'll never be able to find the words to express my thanks for what he did for me.’ Fabregas is given a hero's welcome on his return home to the Nou Camp with Barcelona .

Spain stars Andres Iniesta (left), Fernando Torres (centre) and Fabregas crash out of the 2014 World Cup . By that point, it would be hard to blame the rationale in wanting a move to Barcelona, but staff at Arsenal were disappointed in how the switch was pushed through. What followed was a three-season spell that has, perhaps, been unfairly characterised. The suggestion is that he under-performed at Barca, which in part is the fault of the club itself. Upon leaving last summer, the club, oddly, flagged up in an official statement that he tends to flag in the second half of seasons. They were right, as this campaign has proved, but it was unusual for a club to say so much. In any case, he won La Liga, Copa del Rey and Club World Cup winners’ medals and in his second season, only Victor Valdes had more La Liga starts. It was not exceptional, though, and last summer came the chance to leave, bringing with it much of the confusion that still surrounds the midfielder. Wenger himself gave the impression that there is more to know about the circumstances behind the move to Chelsea, saying on Thursday: ‘We will have to discuss that one day. With all the terms.’ The 27-year-old celebrates scoring against Stoke in his debut season at Stamford Bridge .

Wenger has previously claimed that by the time he knew Fabregas was available a deal with Chelsea was almost done. It is interesting to wonder how much from either side is PR and how much is genuine. Did either side really want the other? At the very least Fabregas will likely endure a tough afternoon under his mask on Sunday. He might soon have that league title he craved, but it will not have come without some significant losses.","Chelsea travel to Arsenal for their Premier League clash on Sunday .

"John Carver has hit back at former Newcastle captain Michael Owen after he said they would lose every remaining match this season. The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side . Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe . Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 . Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone . Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. ‘I could be nasty about Michael because let’s not forget what happened when he was here,’ said Carver. ‘But listen, I don’t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. ‘They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, ""Where’s that come from?”.’ He added: ‘Let’s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven’t. I understand that. ‘But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. ‘There are a lot of people out there who don’t do it because they can’t do it. ‘It’s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don’t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don’t see that.’ Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively. ‘I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,’ said United’s head coach. ‘And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like. I respect what he says.’ Newcastle ace Siem de Jong will be included on the substitutes' bench for his side's match against Swansea . Meanwhile, Newcastle will include Siem de Jong on the bench for the first time since August. The £6million former Ajax skipper has suffered a torn thigh muscle and collapsed lung this season and has started just one Premier League game. But Carver said: ‘You can see what a talent Siem is. I remember watching him play against Man City in the Champions League. He scored two at the Etihad and I thought, “What a player he is”. ‘If I see anything like that then I will be delighted. He is a super lad and is a talented footballer. We just have to be patient with him.’ Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon .

"Jose Mourinho revealed he prepared his Chelsea players to deal with the threat of Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini all week – only to be told by a hotel doorman that the Belgian was not playing. Mourinho planned for Kurt Zouma to man mark Fellaini - with teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek playing the 6ft 4in midfielder in training. But he feared his tactical master plan was set to be for nothing when the Chelsea boss was told that the Manchester United man was not playing by the doorman at the club's hotel.

Mansour (left) and Marouane (right) look on from the stands during Everton's game Leyton Orient in 2012 . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has admitted his side were confused as to whether Fellaini was playing . Mourinho, relaying his conversation with the doorman, said: 'Fellaini doesn't play because he was here to get tickets for the game from Eden Hazard. He was dressed in jeans, this and that'. '(It) didn't smell well for me. I go to Google and I put 'Fellaini brother'. Images. 'So I go with the pictures to the doorman. I say 'hey, this one or this one?' And he looks 'this one'. 'He's the brother'.' Mourinho said the other Fellaini - his twin brother Mansour - posed for photos as the United player, who had been in the Blues boss' thoughts all week, did start the game at Stamford Bridge which Chelsea won 1-0 to move within two wins of the Premier League title. Indeed, Chelsea could claim the trophy as early as April 29 should they beat Arsenal and Leicester in their next two fixtures.

"Rotherham have a serious fight on their hands to avoid relegation from the Championship after they were deducted three points for fielding an ineligible player. The Millers fielded Derby defender Farrend Rawson in their 1-0 win against Brighton on Easter Monday after his youth loan had expired. The Football League maintain the paperwork for his extension wasn’t handled properly. They have until May 1 to appeal the decision and, should they choose to, that could have ramifications with an ultimate decision likely to be taken after the season has finished. Rotherham manager Steve Evans has seen his side deducted three points by the Football League . On-loan Derby defender Farrend Rawson (third right) played in the 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday . Rawson (right, pictured playing for Derby's Under 21 side) wore the Rotherham shirt four times . Rotherham were on 44 points (left) but are now just one point above the relegation zone after the deduction . A Football League statement read: 'Rotherham were also fined the sum of £30,000, half of which will be suspended until the end of the 2015-16 season. The club must also pay the costs of the hearing and the Football League.' The Football League set a precedent for penalties this time last year after slapping AFC Wimbledon with a three-point deduction and £5,000 fine after playing Jake Nicholson when he wasn’t registered correctly. Blackpool were fined £30,000 earlier this season after starting on-loan Donervon Daniels once his 28-day youth loan had expired but escaped the loss of points because they lost at Millwall on August 30. Top QC Jim Sturman unsuccessfully defended Rotherham, who will feel the full force of financial relegations should they are to drop into League One. The punishment means they are now only one point ahead of the Championship relegation zone with two games left. Rotherham drew 1-1 with Fulham last Wednesday, which left them four points above the relegation zone . Rotherham’s scenario has set-up a tantalising end to the campaign, bringing two teams who appeared doomed back into play. Wigan lie on 39 points, Millwall 40 and Rotherham 41 before this Saturday’s fixtures. Steve Evans’ side have a tough trip to Norwich, while Millwall host Derby and Wigan play Wolves at the DW Stadium. All three opponents still have things to play for in the final two weeks of the season. Derby can secure a play-off place on Saturday, with Norwich still gunning for automatic promotion and Wolves retaining an outside chance of a top-six berth.","The Millers fielded on-loan Farrend Rawson in 1-0 win against Brighton .

"He has just been given licence to pick one of the finest backs of the era for the World Cup, but Michael Cheika is more pre-occupied with the denigration of his Wallaby pack. Toulon playmaker Matt Giteau could be a glorious asset at the showpiece tournament after Australia’s policy against picking players based abroad was relaxed this week, but one thing he can’t do is anchor the scrum. The national coach refuses to bite back, but he has evidently noted and logged claims from these parts that his forwards will be cannon fodder for their English and Welsh rivals, amid the three-way tussle for qualification from daunting Pool A. Australia head coach Michael Cheika is aware that his pack is being written off for the World Cup . Cheika's side will face England and Wales in crunch pool games at the tournament in September . England's pack demolished Australia at scrum-time during last November's 26-17 victory at Twickenham . In fact, many of the claims have come from these pages. Speaking to Sportsmail from Sydney, Cheika repeatedly name-checked a certain knight of the realm and columnist of this newspaper, among the voices arguing that the green-and-gold pack will be smashed into submission. ‘It has been pretty well reported here that Clive Woodward and others have said that England are going to take us apart in the forwards,’ he said. ‘That’s what we’ve been hearing. I understand that they will have a lot of confidence in their forwards to take us on, but I think you discount the English backs at your peril, because they have some very powerful runners. In Ben Youngs, Care and Wigglesworth, they have three half-backs who will challenge the line every time. ‘Joseph looks like a nice player and they’ve got some good options in midfield now. Tuilagi will come back into it, they have Barritt too and big Sam (Burgess) might even get a run soon enough, as he grows into the game. Ford has done well for England at 10, they’ve got fast wingers and I’m a big fan of Mike Brown at full-back. There are a variety of threats that we will have to deal with.’ Cheika’s admiration for England’s attacking runners behind the scrum is part of the former Leinster coach’s overall assertion that the European nations are just as adept at playing an open game as their southern rivals, when conditions allow. But his repeated references to the pre-tournament dismissal of his pack suggest that there will be a strong emphasis on the set piece in particular during the World Cup countdown over the summer. Toulon playmaker Matt Giteau (left) is set to feature for the Wallabies at the World Cup . ‘Commentators in the UK are saying we won’t be able to match it with England and Wales in the forwards,’ he reiterated. ‘They’re saying that it’s a shame to waste the talent in our backs. There’s been a fair bit of that coming out, but we’re working hard to make up ground in that area. ‘Clive Woodward – who is not just your average spectator – says we won’t be able to compete with the English scrum. For us, it’s about having a clear philosophy about how we want to do it then practising a lot. We will aim to be at our best in every single scrum.’ According to Cheika, the epic final day of this year’s Six Nations – truly ‘Super Saturday’ – gave a vivid demonstration to viewers Down Under about the threat to the Wallabies from England and Wales. ‘Both those sides are shaping up well,’ he said. ‘England will be on home soil and the Welsh will be much closer to home than we will be. I’m sure they will be fancying their chances against us. Most people are looking at us as the ones who will be in the most trouble, but we will relish it and enjoy it. ‘England and Wales will be feeling good about themselves after the Six Nations. The performance by Wales against Italy in their final game was incredible. I was watching it until it was 13-12 and it was the wee small hours here so I went to bed. When I woke up, they had won by 50! When they needed to, they were able to do that and that is very confidence-building.’ As a long-standing fan of rugby league, Cheika is well aware of Sam Burgess’s potential to make a major impact in his new code, once he has come through the transition phase. He is preparing for the Bath player to be unleashed against Australia; a country where he is revered in light of his title-winning exploits for the Rabbitohs in Sydney. Cheika has cited Ben Youngs (left) and Danny Care as dangerous No 9's who challenge the advantage line . Jonathan Joseph (second left) was superb for Stuart Lancaster's side throughout the RBS 6 Nations . ‘I believe that he will be picked and that England will use him as a weapon off the bench with 10 or 15 minutes to go,’ he said. ‘He is a class footballer – a quality player and athlete. He’s aggressive too, which he showed with the way he played in the rugby league Grand Final here last year. ‘You would have him involved just for his mental approach and the way he takes the game on. There are going to be some tough calls, but just the fact that he is in the reckoning at all – even though he’s only been in union a few months and had never played it before – is positive for him.’ In contrast to his Kiwi counterpart, Steve Hansen, who is concerned that rugby is becoming boring, Cheika is expecting an ‘awesome’ World Cup with an emphasis on try-scoring, thanks in part to the improved pitches at leading grounds here such as Twickenham and the Millennium Stadium. ‘It is like playing on a carpet,’ he said. ‘It makes teams a lot more confident to play positive footy.’ Australia should be able to play positively, with their backline enhanced by the presence of Giteau – who had been in Test exile since moving to Toulon in 2011. Cheika confirmed yesterday that he met the 32-year-old recently, prior to the announcement of the ARU’s historic policy change and believes that he can add utility value to the Wallaby squad. ‘As far as I know, Matt Giteau has played No 9 there, on the odd occasion,’ he said. ‘His strength is at No 10 and No 12 obviously.’ There will be reinforcements up front too, with veteran flanker George Smith another exile now back on the radar. He could find himself competing against a fit and revitalised David Pocock, and Michael Hooper – vying with hooker Stephen Moore for the captaincy – for the openside berth. With such pedigree in just one position, Australia’s pack cannot be written off lightly. Cheika will use the jibes from afar to make sure his side are ready for the ‘Pool of Death’. England full back Mike Brown rises high to claim a high ball despite the attention of Noa Nakaitaci . Cheika is convinced Burgess will feature for England at the World Cup despite his quiet start in union .

"There was a time when the name of Juventus would be one to avoid in the semi-final of European competition. Those days are long gone. When The Old Lady of Turin takes her place alongside Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid on Friday, it will appear that Massimiliano Allegri has returned this great club to the elite level. In reality it will be a clash of cultures as Juventus, who have kept nine clean sheets in their last ten fixtures, plot their path to the Champions League final in Berlin. It will be painful and far from pretty if Juve, who held on to the lead Arturo Vidal gave them from the penalty spot in the first leg against Monaco, progress to the final on June 6. There were scenes of elation as a scoreless draw saw Juventus through to their first Champions League semi-final since 2003 . Juventus's Andrea Pirlo and Carlos Tevez react at the full-time whistle as their 0-0 result against Monaco proved a victory for the Italians . Juventus players celebrate after their 1-0 win in Turin, courtesy of a penalty from Arturo Vital, was preserved in Monaco . The Juventus players ran to their supporters with Carlos Tevez (third left) ditching his jersey for the celebrations .

Veteran Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon punches clear as his defense live dangerously in their second leg against Monaco . Juventus's midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo shows his strength as he holds off Monaco's Jeremy Toulalan in their 0-0 draw in Monte Carlo . MONACO: Subasic 6; Fabinho 7, Raggi 6, Abdennour 6.5, Kurzawa 6; Joao Moutinho 6.5, Toulalan 6 (Berbatov 46mins, 7), Kondogbia 7.5; Bernardo Silva 6.5, Martial 6 (Germain 76', Ferreira-Carrasco 6.5 (Carvalho 87'). Booked: Bernardo, Kondogbia. Subs not used: Stekelenburg, Dirar,   Wallace, Elderson. Manager: Leonardo Jardim: 6.5 . JUVENTUS: Buffon 6.5; Barzagli 6, Bonucci 6.5, Chiellini 6; Lichsteiner 6.5, Marchisio 6, Pirlo 6.5, Vidal 6 (Pereyra 77'), Evra 6.5 (Padoin 90'); Tevez 6.5, Morata 6 (Llorente 69'). Subs not used: Storari, Ogbonna,  Padoin, Sturaro, Matri. Booked: Chiellini, Tevez. Manager: Massimiliano Allegri 6. Referee: William Collum (Scotland) 7. At the final whistle Giorgio Chiellini raced across the athletics track at Stade Louis II to throw his number three shirt into the hordes of Juve supporters celebrating their first appearance in a semi-final since 2003. The feeling is that Juve’s race is run. On the surface Allegri’s team are looking good, 15 points clear of second placed Lazio in Serie A and heading for a semi-final against a genuine European force in a couple of weeks’ time. The reality is that this team is relying on some classic Italian traits, with some stubborn defending and the dogged work of Carlos Tevez, Juve’s only out ball, for some hustling up front. It works, painfully so at times, and they are certainly a long way short of the last Juventus team to reach the Champions League final at Old Trafford in 12 year ago. Back then Marcello Lippi’s team had some real class, with the names of Edgar Davids, David Trezeguet, Alessio Tacchinardi and Alessandro del Piero taking Milan to a penalty shoot-out in Manchester. Today’s team relies on the presence of their veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, a survivor from that defeated 2003 team, to provide some reassurance. Before this tie against Monaco, the Italian World Cup winning goalkeeper spoke about the honour and prestige for Juventus if they could reach the semi-final. The second leg was all about survival. At times this was about the darker side of the game, with Chiellini shown an early yellow card when he scandalously scooped the ball away with his hand to prevent Joao Moutinho racing clear. All three at the back - Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli - lived dangerously, a mistake waiting to happen on a tense and anxious night. Monaco were brisk and innovative, using the first half energy of their central midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia to provide the momentum for Leonardo Jardim’a side. Kondogbia deserved so much more from this tie. Juventus and Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini (left) reaches out to pull the ball away from Monaco's Joao Moutinho after slipping over .

Juventus striker Carlos Tevez takes on Monaco's Geoffrey Kondogbia after referee Collum plays the advantage . Former Manchester City and West Ham marksman Tevez puts his hands to his mouth as a well-hit strike sails off target . He had a decent shout for a penalty in the first half when he was sandwiched between Chiellini and Vidal, sent off balance when the pair squashed him as he made his way into the area. Kondogbia was awesome here and anyone who can outshine Pirlo, save for the odd killer pass for Tevez or Alvaro Morata, in the centre of midfield must be doing something right. Tevez and Morata, who was eventually replaced in the 69th minute by Fernando Llorente, should be credited for their tireless performance in this second leg because they had both picked up a virus the night before the game. Both are believed to have been sick on the pitch. It was Tevez who had Juve’s best chance here, an effort that skidding wide of Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic’s left hand post on the stroke of half-time. Monaco sent for Dimitar Berbatov at the break, sending on the Bulgarian striker to replace the withdrawn figure of France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan. He had a poor game here.

Switzerland defender Lichtsteiner knows how key Croatian Subasic's speed off the line was as he comes close to an opening goal for Juve . There was a touch of the old Berbatov in this 45 minute spell, increasing the tempo with some quick-witted first team passes and some blindside runs into the Juve penalty area. What he craved was the one chance to beat Buffon, to carve out an opening that could, at the very least, have given them another 30 minutes to get the job done. Instead, Juve are heading for extra time. Monaco's French midfielder and captain Toulalan (left) is beaten to the jump by Juventus's Spanish forward Alvaro Morata .

"Millwall left Ewood Park down, almost out, and in danger of needing snookers to avoid relegation from the Championship. One source of salvation could yet come in the form of a three-point deduction for Rotherham when a Football League disciplinary commission rules on whether they fielded an ineligible player against Brighton on Easter Monday. But even that might not be enough. The result leaves Neil Harris’s side four points adrift of fourth-bottom Rotherham with two tough games remaining against promotion-chasing Derby and Wolves. Rotherham have a game in hand and a much better goal difference. Rudy Gestede (centre) scores the opening goal for Blackburn as he fires past the helpless David Forde . Goals certainly make a difference and, in Rudy Gestede and Jordan Rhodes, Blackburn have two players that Millwall simply do not. Gestede, scorer of a hat-trick against Nottingham Forest here on Saturday, took his tally for the season to 20 in the 78th minute, despatching a clinical right-foot shot into the top corner after Craig Conway’s cross found its way to him on the edge of the six-yard box. Rhodes is just behind on 19 goals after coming on as a substitute to make sure of victory, steering his shot past a stranded David Forde in the third minute of added time after the keeper had gone forward in the search for an equaliser. The big striker bagged goal number 20 for the season as he continues his excellent form for Rovers . BLACKBURN (4-4-2): Steele 7; Marshall 5.5, Spurr 6, Kilgallon 6.5 (Lenihan 37, 6.5), Olsson 6; Conway 8, Spearing 6, Evans 6.5, Taylor 6 (Cairney 71, 7); Brown 6 (Rhodes 71, 7), Gestede 6.5. Subs: Eastwood, Henley, Williamson, O’Sullivan. Scorers: Gestede 78, Rhodes 90+3 . MILLWALL (4-2-3-1): Forde 6; Dunne 6.5, Nelson 5.5, Beevers 6, Harding 5 (Taylor-Fletcher 83); Bailey 5.5, Abdou 5; Gueye 5 (Cowan-Hall 61, 5.5), O’Brien 6.5, Woolford 6; Fuller 6.5 (Gregory 61, 6). Subs: Archer, Hooiveld, Martin, Powell. Booked: Cowan-Hall . Referee: Nigel Miller . Star man: Craig Conway . In contrast, Millwall’s two leading scorers — Ricardo Fuller and Lee Gregory — have just six apiece. The failings in front of goal were all too apparent on Tuesday night. ‘Their two goalscorers have scored more than my whole squad,’ lamented Harris. ‘It’s clear to see why they won 2-0. ‘The team were excellent but we didn’t take our chances. Before tonight we had to win two games to stay in the division. We need six or seven points so my thoughts still haven’t changed.’ Millwall’s best chance fell to substitute Paris Cowan-Hall in the 68th minute. He was clean through on goal after Blackburn were caught out by Alan Dunne’s long ball forward, but goalkeeper Jason Steele rushed off his line to block. Rovers, who lost captain Matt Kilgallon to injury in the first half and had to play debutant Darragh Lenihan in central defence, had their fair share of chances, but it needed a touch of class to make the difference. Gestede and Rhodes provided it for Blackburn. Jordan Rhodes slots home the second in injury time to make Millwall's survival aspirations look impossible . Rhodes celebrated being named in the Football League team of the decade with the second goal . Neil Harris' side look almost condemned to relegation from the Championship with two games to still to play . Manager Gary Bowyer is realistic enough to know that they might not both be at Ewood next season. ‘I understand the business we’re in,’ he said. ‘Liverpool sold Luis Suarez and no doubt there will be people leaving bigger clubs than Blackburn Rovers in the summer. But you’ve seen with Jordan and Rudy this season, if the owners’ valuation is not met, then we won’t sell them.’ Magaye Gueye (left) and Jay Spearing compete for the ball during Blackburn's win at Ewood Park .","Neil Harris' side look likely to be relegated from the Sky Bet Championship .

"In the end it took a Mexican to end this utterly absorbing stand-off, the irrepressible, if rather unimpressive, Javier Hernandez scoring the goal that ended almost 180 minutes of deadlock between these fierce city rivals. Only here on loan from Manchester United for a season, it was a goal that means Hernandez will be adored at the Santiago Bernabeu long after he has gone. But it was also a reward for ambition over the more conservative approach of Diego Simeone and his well-drilled side; for the team that enjoyed twice as much of the ball and the better of the chances that were created in this tense, niggly Champions League quarter-final tie. Javier Hernandez scores the only goal of the two legs in the Champions League quarter-final between the Madrid neighbours .

It was hard to see what Atletico were trying to achieve at times. A victory on penalties perhaps. But when Arda Turan was dismissed in the 75th minute for what looked like a harsh second yellow card for a challenge on the all-too theatrical Sergio Ramos, an opportunity suddenly presented itself to Real. A frustrated figure until Atletico were reduced to 10 men, Cristiano Ronaldo made a jinking, purposeful run into the penalty area before executing the all-important pass. Hernandez had missed his earlier chances. One of them a clear cut opening thanks to a wonderful reverse-pass from Isco. But this time he delivered, the Little Pea scoring arguably the biggest goal of his career with a sweeping effort from 12 yards. In the starting line-up only because of an injury to Karem Benzema, Hernandez performed much as he has all season here. Committed and energetic but just lacking the class of his temporary club-mates. But with this contest only two minutes from moving into extra-time, goalless if far from gutless, Hernandez made no mistake when it mattered most. Ancelotti seems to beat Atletico when it matters most. In last year’s Champions League final. Here on Wednesday night. Seven times already this season these two teams had met and seven times Real had failed to conquer their less glamorous neighbours. But there is a reason why Ancelotti is the only living manager to have lifted the European Cup on three occasions, and today he is a significant step closer to winning the greatest club competition of all for an unprecedented fourth time. It might even secure his position at the Bernabeu, given how uncertain his future appears to be despite delivering La Decima last season. ‘Every game is an exam and tonight we passed the exam well,’ said the amiable Italian with his trademark chuckle. What an extraordinary night it had been. As early as two hours before kick-off the streets around this magnificent stadium were packed with people, their rhythmic chanting rivalled only by the hum of the police helicopters hovering overhead. Champions League nights between two teams from the same country have this special quality. Rarely has an atmosphere been greater in English football than when Chelsea travelled to Anfield for that first semi-final back in 2005. Real Madrid striker Hernandez had been having a frustrating evening for Real Madrid up until his goal in the 88th minute . Hernandez couldn't quite believe how he missed his chance to give Real Madrid the all-important lead at the Bernabeu before his goal . Hernandez's starting place for Real Madrid was described by local media as the 'biggest match of his career' and he lived up to it . But this was extra special. This was a Madrid derby with a difference and the deafening roar that greeted the end of the Champions League anthem said as much. You could barely hear yourself think never mind what the person sat next to you was saying, and it was no different when Turan was dismissed and when Hernandez then struck the decisive blow. For Ancelotti it must have come as something of a relief after the tactical juggling he had to perform in the absence of key personnel. As well as Benzema, Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Marcello were also missing and the decision to deploy Ramos in midfield caused some concern here. After all, only once before had the Italian tried it and after losing 2-1 to Barcelona he admitted to making a mistake. Afterwards he laughed about it too, joking that attempts to kill him last time had proved unsuccessful so he felt safe doing it again. This game quickly followed a familiar theme, with Real pressing deep in the half of the well-drilled Atletico. Simeone, simmering and animated on the sidelines, applauded his players for the naughty challenges as well as the good ones, seemingly happy to see his side play so negatively.

But the chances would come for Real, with Ronaldo forcing a fine save from the impressive Jan Oblak just before the break and Hernandez failing to capitalise on that delightful ball from Isco just after the restart. Only when Turan was dismissed did the breakthrough come, however, Ronaldo and Hernandez exploiting the slight tactical change Simeone had been forced to make as a result of the red card. Atletico’s manager said he had no regrets. ‘I am proud of my players,’ he said. ‘But congratulations to our rivals, who played a good game and scored a beautiful goal.’ Which it was.

"Dietmar Hamann believes Bastian Schweinsteiger should leave Bayern Munich at the end of the season after losing his place to Xabi Alonso in Pep Guardiola's side. The World Cup winner was an unused substitute in Bayern's 6-1 Champions League win over Porto on Tuesday. And former Germany international Hamann thinks Schweinsteiger faces an uncertain future at the Allianz Arena, with Alonso viewed as Guardiola's preferred midfield choice. Bastian Schweinsteiger speaks with Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola during training this week . Dietmar Hamann (above) thinks World Cup winner Schweinsteiger may be heading for the Bayern exit . 'The game against Porto was quite meaningful for two players in particular,' Hamann told Kicker. 'Schweinsteiger has apparently lost the battle for a place in midfield to Xabi Alonso. I do not think Schweinsteiger will still be playing for Bayern next year.' Meanwhile, Hamann also expressed his doubts over whether injured winger Franck Ribery would fit seamlessly back into the side when fit, given the form of Thomas Muller in his absence. 'It will also be quite tricky for Ribery,' he added. 'If you have to make a choice between Ribery and Muller once Robben returns, I would always pick Muller.'

"Memphis Depay had a secret meeting with Manchester United on Wednesday as the club look to tie up a move for the PSV Eindhoven winger. Depay, 21, jetted to England with representatives including his agent Kees Ploegsma for a summit with a United delegation led by manager Louis van Gaal. United are leading the hunt for the pacy Holland international but face opposition from Paris Saint- Germain while Liverpool have also expressed an interest. Memphis Depay had a secret meeting with Manchester United as the club look to tie up a move . Depay during a photo shoot back in October 2013 where he modelled the Can-Am three-wheeled bike . Manchester United are hoping to leave their rivals behind in the race to sign the young winger . PSV coach Phillip Cocu admitted: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach and the Premier League is great' Van gall refused to squash the reports in his weekly media briefing. When asked about the Depay link, Van Gaal said: 'I don’t discuss it with the media, you know my answer. 'I have a lot of relationships with players. I cannot buy all the players I've coached already.' Van Gaal, who worked with Depay at the World Cup, made inquiries over the player's availability last summer but decided to keep track of his progress rather than make a move. That could prove to be a costly decision, with the Dutch club looking for around £25m for his services after he scored 20 goals in 28 games. Depay, who has 'dream chaser' tattooed to his chest and is pictured here modelling a three-wheeled bike in October 2013, could line up at Old Trafford next season. PSV coach Phillip Cocu was unaware of the meeting when asked on Friday. He said: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach with whom I have worked and he was always very pleasant and the Premier League is a great league. 'I have contact with Memphis on a daily basis about many things, but not on a specific club or league.' United hold the upper hand in the hunt for Depay thanks to Van Gaal, who worked with the player during his stint in charge of Holland. PSV appear to be resigned to losing their star man this summer. Depay has become one of the hottest properties in European football after a blistering season . Louis van Gaal (right) was tempted to sign Depay last summer and will have to fork out around £25m . Depay, who often plays on the left wing despite being right-footed, has been compared with international team-mate Arjen Robben. However, Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age. Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better. 'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.'","Manchester United looking to tie up a deal for Memphis Depay .

"Ashley Young has revealed the secret of his team-mates' changing room playlist - and it's not what you expected. Young is known for being the resident DJ at the Red Devils, but he admitted to being under strict orders from manager Louis van Gaal to play only house and funky house music. In an interview with MUTV, the English winger is joined on the sofa by singer-songwriter Olly Murs, who asks whether or not his mainstream tunes are played in the Old Trafford changing room. VIDEO Scroll down for 'DJ Ashley Young' revealing to Olly Murs he only plays funky house . Ashley Young meets Olly Murs outside Manchester United's Aon Training Complex ahead of MUTV filming .

'I would love to,' responds Young. 'But I've been told by the manager I can only play funky house or house. Seriously, he's liking the playlist.' It came as a big surprise to Murs that the Dutch Master of Ceremonies loves nothing better than to listen to undercover tunes with a funk-inspired bass line after guiding his side to victory. 'Funky house?' responds Murs. 'Van Gaal wants funky house?? Can you imagine watching him coming out the shower [shouting] come on lads! We just won!' United have been slowly resurgent since the turn of the year, with the 20-time English champions third in the Barclays Premier League and odds-on to secure a Champions League return despite last weekend's 1-0 defeat by Chelsea.

"With a possible 11 games left to their season Barcelona’s front three of Leo Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar are just seven goals short of clocking up a century in their first season together. The three amigos will match the total scored by Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto’o and Messi in 2009 if they reach 100 goals and they will inevitably fuel the debate that they are fast becoming the greatest front three in Barcelona’s history. Henry scored 26, Eto’o 36 and Messi 38 goals in the 2008-09 season. In this campaign Messi has 46, Neymar 28 and Suarez 19 despite missing the first three months through suspension. Scroll down for video . Lionel Messi, Neymar Jnr and Luis Suarez are seven goals short of reaching 100 for the season . Messi rounds Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves to score during Barcelona's 2-0 win on Saturday . Suarez celebrates with Neymar and Messi after netting the opener against Valencia in the La Liga clash . Gareth Bale with 17, Cristiano Ronaldo with 50, and Karim Benzema 22, have 86 between them for Real Madrid but the question is no longer can Messi, Suarez and Neymar out-do their La Liga rivals, rather can they out-do the greatest forward lines in Barcelona’s history? The Henry/Eto’o/Messi forward line won the 2009 European Cup and was followed two years later – after the failed attempt to bring Zlatan Ibrahimovic into the mix in 2010 – by the Messi/David Villa/Pedro strike force that also won a European Cup against Manchester United in 2011. They scored 98 goals in the 2010-11 season with Messi getting 53, Villa 23 and Pedro 21. Both attacks had a tendency to come good in the Clasicos with the Henry/Eto’o/Messi strikeforce playing in one of the most famous Real Madrid-Barcelona games of all time in 2009 with Barca winning 6-2 at the Bernabeu and Henry and Messi both scored twice. Messi celebrates with Thierry Henry after Barcelona won the Champions League in 2009 . The Argentine congratulates team-mate Samuel Eto'o after he scores in the Champions League final in 2009 . The current combination lacks the European Cup the other two have and a big win over Real Madrid but there is still time for them to combine the two with a Clasico final still a possibility. When they first came together at the start of the season there was the fear among Barcelona supporters that the team would not be big enough for the three of them. Barça legend Johan Cruyff had already warned a year early that ‘a ship cannot have two captains’ and that Neymar and Messi would not get on. When Suarez was introduced that was, for some, another reason to believe Luis Enrique would have problems. But nothing could have been further from the truth. Suarez has had his fair share of highly controversial incidents but has never been a bad influence in the dressing room. In Monday’s training session at Barça’s Sports City he received a playful knee between the legs from Neymar in a light-hearted training session ahead of tonight’s game. His relationship with the Brazilian is good; and with Messi’s it’s even better. After a slow start to his Barca career Suarez has now scored 19 goals despite missing the first months of the season through suspension . Messi celebrates with Suarez after the Uruguay international netted against Valencia . Messi never saw eye to eye with David Villa or Ibrahimovic and both were put out at times at having to play second fiddle to the four times Balon d’Or winner but after a season accommodating Daniel Sturridge's preference for playing through the middle, the demands of Messi have not been a problem for Suarez. The training-ground chemistry has been good and has translated on to the pitch. Goals statistics aside Barcelona have always boasted brilliant front threes. Messi was first thrust into a forward line that boasted Ronaldinho and Eto’o and they won the Champions League in 2004 against Arsenal. Hristo Stoichkov, Michael Laudrup and Romario was Johan Cruyff’s Dream Team front three in the 1993-94 season but their time together was brief and they never won the European Cup – losing 4-0 to Milan with Laudrup on the bench. If this season ends with Messi, Suarez and Neymar smashing the 100 goals barrier and lifting the trophy in Berlin no other forward line in Barcelona’s history will be able to touch them.","Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar have scored 93 goals this season .

"Barcelona will play Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-finals, meaning Pep Guardiola will return to the Nou Camp. Guardiola, who spent four trophy-filled years at Barcelona, took over at Bayern in 2013. In the other semi-final, defending champion Real Madrid will face Juventus, with the Italian champions playing at home first. The four teams have combined to win the European Cup or Champions League 21 times, with 16 runner-up finishes, in the competition's 60-year history. The first legs will be played on May 5-6, with the return matches on May 12-13. The final will be played on June 6 at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. Here's how the draw unfolded... Host commentator . How about that, then? Pep Guardiola will return to the Nou Camp in the semi-finals with his Bayern Munich team. Many would have wanted this as the final. Personally, I think it's much better that Pep goes back to Catalunya rather than a final at a neutral venue. Real Madrid vs Juventus is the other tie. The possibility of an El Clasico final and a second straight all Spanish final on June 6 is still there. That's all from me this morning, though. Goodbye. BARCELONA vs BAYERN MUNICH . JUVENTUS vs REAL MADRID . Ties to be played on May 5/6 and May 12/13 . REAL MADRID . JUVENTUS . BAYERN MUNICH . BARCELONA . Napoli will play Dnipro and Sevilla will face Fiorentina in the semi-finals of the Europa League. That draw has just been made. Time for the main event, then. Don't blink... this will be quick. We're all ready for the draw to to start then. UEFA will make the Europa League semi-final draw first. Join me HERE for live coverage of that before the main event shortly after. It's been everything you'd expect from Barcelona really. They topped their group ahead of PSG before Christmas and have made light work of Manchester City and the French champions in the knockout rounds. Whatsmore, they are starting to look like the team to beat around Europe again and that front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar are awesome. PSG are the team who knocked Chelsea out, but Barcelona dismantled them 5-1 in the quarter-finals. It was all plain sailing for Pep Guardiola's side, right up until their quarter-final tie with Porto that is. Bayern set off in their quest to regain the title they won at Wembley in 2013 by topping a tough Group E, which featured Manchester City, Roma and CSKA Moscow, with five wins out of six. They showed no signs of letting up in the last 16 as well, thrashing Shakhtar 7-0 at the Allianz Arena. But the last eight was a different story. Bayern fell to a shock 3-1 defeat in Porto in the first leg and needed something close to a miracle to go through. What they got was five goals in a sensational first half on their way to a 6-1 second leg victory. Today, they could be drawn against Real Madrid, as they were last year, or Pep Guardiola could return to the Nou Camp to take on Barcelona. Juventus are by far the least glamorous side left in this season's Champions League. They are well on their way to another Serie A title, and their European campaign this season has been just as efficient if a tad unspectacular. Juve finished second in Group A behind Atletico Madrid, just edging Olympiacos into third place. But their 5-1 aggregate thrashing of Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 went under the radar, as did their 1-0 win over Arsenal's conquerors Monaco in the previous round. Juventus are a team not used to losing many games, and will be a tough draw for either of the other three sides. It's been a season of two halves for Real Madrid, and their path to the last four of the Champions League is a perfect reflection of that. The 2014 winners were an unstoppable force before Christmas and won 22 games in a row in all competitions, including all six matches in a group that featured Liverpool, Basle and Ludogorets. It's been a different story in 2015, though, and their progress through the knock-out rounds has been far from convincing. In the last 16 they were made to hang on by Schalke, who inflicted a shock 4-3 defeat at the Bernabeu after Real cruised into a 2-0 lead in the away leg. In the last round, an 88th-minute strike from Javier Hernandez was all that separated them and local rivals Atletico Madrid. With the La Liga title race firmly in Barcelona's hands, Real will once again be looking to the Champions League for success this season. LAURIE WHITWELL: Sorry Pep, but Barcelona vs Real Madrid is the dream Champions League final . It's a pretty tough question to answer... so we picked the brains of our team of experts. As you can see, even our reporters can't even agree... OUR REPORTERS HAVE THEIR SAY ON WHO WILL WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . Plenty of build-up to this morning's draw on the front pages of the national press in both Spain and Italy. The feeling in Spain is that Juventus are the team to draw. AS have also listed the number of times each of these four teams have won the trophy - 21 cups between them from 37 finals. The Italian press seem to have a 'bring it on' message for Juventus. They also look forward to Fiorentina and Napoli in the Europa League draw a little later.

This morning, then, we will move one step closer to discovering our line-up for the final of this year's Champions League final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on June 6. The first leg of the semi-finals will take place on May 5/6 with the second leg a week later on May 12/13 and, regardless of today's draw, we should have some intriguing scenarios. Will Suarez have to face either Chiellini or Evra again? Will Pep come up against his former team? Will Bayern face Real Madrid as they did last year? Or will we have a home and away El Clasico tie to look forward to? All will be revealed, I guess. Good morning everybody. I'm sure you'll agree it's not a bad way to start a Friday by finding out the line-up for this year's semi-finals of the Champions League. There may be no English involvement, but don't let that get you down. Featured in this morning's draw in Nyon are four European powerhouses Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus.

"Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man v PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the fifth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I look back on one of the greatest sporting events of all time. THE NEAR-DEATH FIGHT . Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier . The Thrilla in Manila . Quezon City, Philippines . October 1, 1975 . Just as they are saying about Mayweather v Pacquiao, the perceived wisdom was that Ali-Frazier was coming five years too late for two great boxers in their 30s. Let us hope they are so spectacularly wrong again. That star-spangled night in New York when Smokin' Joe knocked down and defeated The Greatest had been followed in 1974 by a tamer, scrappier, points victory for Ali. A poster for Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier, also known as the Thrilla in Manila, in Quezon City, Philippines . Ali (right) swings for Frazier, who eventually lost in the 14th round to a technical knockout . And so to the trilogy, a year later. Both men had come through battles with George Foreman, Frazier losing and Ali famously winning The Rumble in the Jungle in Zaire. GEORGE FOREMAN V MUHAMMAD ALI . October 30, 1974, Kinshasa, Zaire . JOE FRAZIER v MUHAMMAD ALI . March 8, 1971, Madison Square Garden, New York . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . This time Don King had Manila in mind as the next heavyweight stop for his globe-trotting circus. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, like Zaire's President Mobuto before him, saw sponsorship of the fight as a distraction from the poverty and social unrest in his country. It was Ali who became most distracted during the build-up. When invited to a photo-opportunity with Marcos and his infamously big-spending wife Imelda, he took his mistress Veronica Porsche along and introduced her as his wife. Mrs Belinda Ali watched that happen on US television and immediately flew to Manila to confront her husband, loudly, in his hotel suite. Ali returned to his customary psychological baiting of his opponents. He had insulted Frazier before their first fight and did so again chanting: 'It will be Killa and a Thrilla and a Chilla when I get The Gorilla in Manila.' Thus the title for the fight, The Thrilla in Manila, was coined. Ali pictured alongside his infamously big-spending wife Mrs Belinda Ali in September 1975 . Frazier, the quiet man, was plotting a strategy of breaking down Ali with shots to the stomach, ribs, kidneys and liver, quoting the old ring maxim: 'If you kill the body, the head will die.' Ali would target the Frazier head and won the early rounds while his legs were at their freshest. But it was impossible for him to keep dancing in the pressure-cooker heat, with the ring temperature reaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit. As Muhammad started slowing, Joe began Smokin'. They would engage in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game. Ali was forced to lower his guard as they landed more than 100 blows to the head between them, each of such force that any one of them would have stopped lesser fighters. Ali supplemented those power shots with his quick jabs and combinations and thereby inflicted more of the facial swelling. Boxing greats Frazier and Ali pictured in the ring on October 1, 1975, for the Thrilla in Manila . Ali and Frazier engaged in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game . Frazier's eyes began closing in the ninth. By the time he came out for the 13th he could barely see and Ali sent his gum-shield flying with the second of two massive right hooks. Exhausted though he was, Ali went for the Killa in the 14th. Although the monstrous barrage which sent Frazier reeling and staggering could not put him down, it was enough to bring a sensational end to an epic battle. Ali ordered his corner-man Herbert Muhammad to cut off his gloves, saying he could not go on. But before he could do so Frazier's trainer Eddie Futch called a halt. A relieved Ali famously said: 'This is the closest to death I have ever been.' Frazier begged to be allowed to see out the 15th and final round but Futch told him: 'It's over. No-one will ever forget what you did here today.' Frazier never forgave him. Not fully. Nor Ali for the trilogy of insults. Ali defied the rigours of Parkinson's to attend Frazier's funeral. Ali lifts his arms in the air after defeating Frazier in the 14th round, but later attended his great opponent's funeral when he died at the age of 67 .","Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao is now just eight days away .

In this, the fourth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I look back on one of the greatest sporting events of all time. RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE . George Foreman v Muhammad Ali . Kinshasa, Zaire . October 30, 1974 . The fight voted the greatest sporting event of the 20th century. The fight which crossed oceans and continents. The fight which drove boxing through social barriers. The fight which put a shadowy central African republic on the world map. The fight which established Muhammad Ali as the most recognisable human being on Earth. The fight which made George Foreman famous in defeat. The fight about which millions of words have been written and movies made. A photograph taken on October 30, 1974, shows Muhammad Ali (left) and George Foreman (right) USA's  Foreman (right) approaches his compatriot Ali (left)  during the iconic Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 . The Rumble in the Jungle was the brainchild of promotional genius Don King backed by the multi-million dollar investment through which Zaire president Mobuto Sese Seko hoped to excite his people into keeping him in power. King had persuaded Ali and Foreman to sign $5million contracts which he could not afford but would talk President Mobuto into bank-rolling. JOE FRAZIER v MUHAMMAD ALI . March 8, 1971, Madison Square Garden, New York . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . As the 25-year-old world heavyweight champion with enormous punching power Foreman was odds-on favourite to crush the brilliance of the man they called The Greatest but who, at 32 and diminished by his three-and-a-half-year banishment from the ring for refusing to go to war in Vietnam, was perceived as a fading force. Ali went to work on Foreman’s psyche from the moment the circus arrived in Kinshasa, turning up at his training session to mock Big George for his size and make fun of his intellect. The irritating effect on Foreman was prolonged after he suffered an eye-cut in sparring, the date of the fight was put back more than a month and King, fearful of cancellation, insisted they stayed in Zaire instead of taking a break back in America. Ali also charmed the local population, who happily took to the streets throughout those weeks chanting ‘Ali, boma-ye’ – ‘Ali, kill him.’ The fight developed into a tactical triumph for Ali, albeit a self-punishing one which may have contributed to the subsequent onset of Parkinson’s which afflicts him now. Ali (left) often found himself against the ropes in a strategy which even surprised his trainer Angelo Dundee . Ali spent much of his time against the ropes, inviting Foreman to punch himself out before landing his blow . In a strategy which he later entitled ‘Rope-A-Dope’ – and which came as a surprise to everyone including his fabled trainer Angelo Dundee - Ali spent much of his time lolling against the ropes, inviting Foreman to punch himself out. Big George duly obliged by throwing hundreds of blows in the first seven rounds. Ali evaded many of those punches and blocked numerous with his arms but he had to withstand the brute force of those which got through his defences. The verbal taunting went on. ‘They told me you could punch, George,’ he said as Foreman began to flag. ‘Is that all you got, George?’ he rasped as Foreman connected to the Ali chin with virtually the last of the punches which had knocked out many a former foe. It had not been all negative. Throughout, Ali had peppered the swelling Foreman face with break-out with lightning combinations and the steamy 4 am heat had contributed to the weakening process. Foreman, the world heavyweight champion, is down on count two after being struck by Ali's right-hander . Ali looks on after he knocked Foreman to the canvas with the holy mother of all right-handers during the bout . Come the eighth round, come the coup de grace. A succession of right hooks, a two-fisted burst and then a left-hook which straightened up Big George to receive the holy mother of all right-handers. Foreman staggered to his feet at the count of nine but referee Zack Clayton knew he was finished. Sensation. Bedlam in the jungle. Astonishment around the satellite world. Foreman would eventually emerge from denial to become Ali’s great friend, an inspiring Christian preacher and the seller of countless top-of-the-range barbecues. Ali was still The Greatest.

The Greatest had been stripped of the world heavyweight title he had won so sensationally against Sonny Liston but it was the reason for that decision which added cultural significance to what was to be a magnificent fight. Sweat sprays off Muhammad Ali (right) as Joe Frazier collects his jaw with a strong left in 1971 . Ali and Frazier at Madison Square Garden, New York, on March 8, 1971, was the second 'Fight of the Century' Ali's evasive abilities and speed, such as this swerve from a Frazier hook, kept him in the fight . Smokin’ Joe was the undefeated two-belt champion but it was this proud black man’s bizarre adoption by America’s conservative right which stoked the fires of society still further. Muhammad Ali had been banned from boxing for three-and-a-half years for refusing induction into the US military to fight in Vietnam – but as a consequence become the darling of the young, the black and the Civil Rights movement. Joe Frazier found himself unwittingly the standard bearer for the white establishment. Ali fanned the flames by labelling the simpler man who would become his arch-rival an ‘Uncle Tom,’ the most wounding insult for an African American . There was a foretaste of the current scramble for Mayweather-Pacquaio tickets. Woody Allen was one of the very few celebrities give a complimentary seat and other famous names had to work their way into the 20,000 crowd at the Garden. Frank Sinatra persuaded Life magazine to give him a camera and send him as their ringside photographer. Fast-talking Ali offensively labelled Frazier an 'Uncle Tom' due to the support he got from white conservatives . Referee Tony Perez, widely believed to have acted leniently in Ali's favour, orders the pair to their corners . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . Author Norman Mailer reported on the fight. Actor Burt Lancaster picked up a TV microphone for his only stint as a colour commentator. Artist Leroy Neiman sat at his easel painting Ali and Frazier as they fought. This was one fight in which the action fully lived up to the hype and its place in history. Ali came out fast to dominate the first three rounds. Frazier, encouraged by catching Ali with the last punch of the third, launched an attack to the body in the fourth which brought him into the ascendancy. Ali’s speed of hand, dancing feet and combination punching kept him in a fight in which he was taking increasing punishment – along with a little help from referee Arthur Mercante who declined to call a knock down when Frazier sent him crashing in the eighth. Ali is laid out on the canvas as Frazier is send to the corner before a long 10-count in the 15th round . Somehow, heroically, survived the especially torrid 11th and 14th rounds. Still some good judges had it close going into the 15th and last round. There all argument was ended. Frazier caught him with the most wicked of all those trademark left hooks and this time there was no denying a count which appeared to edge a fraction longer than the stipulated ten seconds. Ali rose to his feet. Unsteadily. His jaw grotesquely swollen. Again his courage carried him to the bell. The decision was unanimously in favour of Frazier, although both men went to hospital. Frazier got the unanimous decision from the judges but both men went to hospital after the epic bout . Very late that night word spread through New York’s animated bars that one of them had died. Frazier checked out early, quietly. Ali pronounced the rumours of his passing to be premature. Their trilogy was born. They were to fight twice more and on one of those occasions each would come close to death again.","Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao's fight will be the richest ever .

Here are my 12 most significant fights in boxing’s history. THE FIGHT FOR RACE . Jack Johnson v James J Jeffries . July 4, 1910 in Reno, Nevada . Jim Jeffries came out of a six-year retirement to take on Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champion . Jack Johnson, as the first black world heavyweight champion, was the bane of the white supremacists in America in the early 1900s. They hated it when the Galveston Giant beat Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia, in 1908 to win the title they had brandished as the symbol of their racial superiority. Thus began the quest for The Great White Hope. When Johnson KO’d their best hope of all, Stanley Ketchel, the crusade to bring their old idol Jeffries out of six-year retirement reached a frenzy. Jeffries finally agreed ‘to respond to that portion of the white race that has been looking for me to defend its athletic superiority’ – in return for a purse of $120,000 (worth more than three million dollars today). So racist was the press coverage of the build-up to the fight that even The New York Times wrote: ‘If the black man wins, thousands and thousands of his ignorant brothers will misinterpret his victory as justifying claims to much more than mere physical equality with their white neighbours.' As the racial tensions grew, the sheriff of Reno took the then-unusual step of banning guns and alcohol in the 20,000 capacity arena erected down town. Jeffries, by then a contented farmer, had shed more than 100 lbs to get close to his old fighting weight. White America hated it when 'Galveston Giant' Johnson (left) beat Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia, in 1908 to win the title and after a frenzied campaign, Jeffries (right) agreed to take the fight for what would equal £3m . The bout was scheduled for 45 rounds but Johnson said he knew it was as good as over in the fourth when he saw the alarmed reaction to his trademark uppercut and ‘the old ship sinking.’ Jeffries, hitherto undefeated, had never been off his feet but after two knock-downs his corner threw in the towel at the end of the 15th. He dismayed white America by saying: ‘I could never have whipped Johnson at my best, not in a thousand years.’ Symbolically, the Fourth of July shook the foundations of America’s old white order. Riots broke out that night in 25 cities across the United States and 50 cities including New York and Washington. As police joined enraged white citizens in subduing black American celebrations, 20 people were killed and hundreds injured. Johnson continued to anger the racists on several counts. As heavyweight champion he reigned another five years before surrendering the crown to white challenger Jess Willard, afterwards claiming he had thrown the fight. After beating Jeffries convincingly, Johnson would be world champion for another five years . Johnson then surrendered the crown to white giant Jess Willard, and later claimed to have thrown the fight . Outside the ring he lived the high life of a celebrity and angered the old order again by continuing to marry white wives, three of them in all. The American establishment vented its grudge by accusing him of taking women across state lines for immoral purposes and pursuing him into exile in Europe and Cuba. He finally gave himself up at the Mexican border and served a nominal one-year prison sentence. Before his death, in 1946 at the age of 68, he collaborated on movies about his life and a Broadway play entitled ‘The Great White Hope’ Jack Johnson is still regarded by many boxing historians as the greatest heavyweight of all time.","Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao's fight will be the richest ever .

Here is the second of my 12 most significant fights in boxing’s history. THE FIGHT AGAINST THE NAZIS . Yankee Stadium, New York . June 22, 1938 . Joe Louis vs Max Schmeling . Joe Louis (left) knocks out Max Schmeling in the first round to win the heavyweight title on June 22, 1938 . Although Herr Hitler was trumpeting Max Schmeling as a hero of the Third Reich following his knock-out victory over Joe Louis two years earlier, the German was anti-Nazi and remained so during World War II which was imminent at the time of the re-match. Louis had come back from that shock to win the world heavyweight title by defeating James J Braddock but announced he would not consider himself the true champion until he avenged the loss to Schmeling. The fight was billed as a political war between an America struggling to emerge from the Great Depression and a Germany provoking armed conflict in Europe by annexing Austria. Yet such was Schmeling’s distaste for being exploited by Adolf Hitler’s propaganda machine – and his loyal refusal to sack his Jewish manager – that his wife and mother were refused permission to travel to New York to support him in case he defected to the U.S. The social picture was clouded further by black America’s belief in Louis as a high-profile campaigner for Civil Rights. Louis is carried by his supporters ahead of his 1938 re-match with Schmeling . A poster for the rematch (left) while Louis and Schmeling shake hands at the weigh-in ahead of their  fight . Jack Johnson vs James Jeffries . Louis, who had complacently trained on the links rather in the gym for the first fight, gave up golf and women in serious preparation for the return bout. President Franklin D Roosevelt invited Louis to the White House and told him: 'Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat the Germans.’ Louis would say: ‘The whole damned country was depending on me.’ Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Gregory Peck were among Hollywood celebrities in the 70,000 crowd, along with FBI boss J Edgar Hoover. Louis is pictured jumping aside as Schmeling falls after the knock-out . Louis had been tactically out-thought in their first fight so decided to go for broke from the first bell. A barrage of left hooks followed by a right to the body had Schmeling doubled-up in pain and referee Arthur Donovan gave him a standing eight count. Louis switched his attack to the head, dropping Schmeling twice, and Donovan called a halt only two minutes and 40 seconds into the fight. Louis, the Brown Bomber, had fractured Schmeling’s spine with his body attacks. As the man from Brandenburg was taken to hospital the ambulance passed through Harlem and he recalled later: ‘I could the noise of crowds dancing. Bands had left the bars and were playing on the sidewalks. Everywhere was filled with celebrations and saxophones.’ Louis goes on the attack against Schmeling as he gains revenge after defeat two years earlier . Schmeling would be forcibly conscripted as a German paratrooper war but served only briefly and his resistance to Hitler made him a hero in his country for a second time, after the war. He invested in successful businesses and lived until shortly before his 100th birthday, in 2005. Louis lost his money and became a greeter at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. His old friend Schmeling visited him there once every year until his death in 1981, when he acted as a pall-bearer at Louis’ funeral.","Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao's fight will be the richest ever .

"Arsenal will play in their yellow and blue away strip for the FA Cup final against Aston Villa on May 30 - and the history books points towards that being a good thing for the Gunners. Tim Sherwood's Villa side won the coin toss ahead of the final next month - which allows the winner to select club colours in the event of a clash of strip. They picked their claret and blue home kit for the Wembley showpiece and therefore guaranteed that they will have worn the same strip for every round of the competition this season.

But that won't phase Arsene Wenger's side at all, with a creditable record of three cup final wins in five appearances in the yellow and blue strip, giving Gunners fans room for optimism as they look to retain the FA Cup. Arsenal last wore yellow in the 1980 FA Cup final where they narrowly lost to London rivals West Ham United, but a year earlier donned the same colours as they got the better of Manchester United in a five-goal thriller at the home of English football. The Gunners also won the competition in 1950 and 1971 while wearing yellow, on both occasions seeing off Liverpool.

The kick-off time for the clash - which will be shown on both BBC One and BT Sport 1 - has also been confirmed as 5.30pm on Saturday May 30, with both clubs receiving an equal allocation of 25,000 tickets. These tickets will be classified into four different pricing bands - £50, £70, £90 and £120. In addition to the 50,000 tickets split between the two clubs involved, approximately 20,000 tickets also will be distributed to volunteers throughout the football family which most notably includes counties, leagues, local clubs and charities. And 17,000 tickets will also be used by Club Wembley members, with the FA Cup final part of their membership package.","Arsenal face Aston Villa in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 30 .

"Chelsea can take another step closer towards securing the Premier League title when they face Arsenal on Sunday, and Jose Mourinho's side stepped up their preparations for the Emirates showdown in training on Friday. The league leaders were put through their paces at their Cobham training headquarters just a couple of days before a London derby against Arsene Wenger's side. Mourinho has never lost to Wenger in 12 outings, and he will be hoping 13 is not unlucky as well on Sunday as his side look to extend their 10-point lead over the Gunners. Chelsea trained at their base in Cobham on Friday ahead of their game against Arsenal . Chelsea's Spanish midfielder prepares to face his former club Arsenal at the weekend . Didier Drogba has an excellent record against Arsenal and could start up front . Cesc Fabregas will make his first return to the Emirates, but another of Chelsea's summer signings Diego Costa is a doubt for the clash due to injury. That would mean Didier Drogba, who was seen training at Cobham on Friday, or Loic Remy could start up front for Chelsea at the Emirates. At his press conference on Friday, Mourinho said: 'Didier for sure is good, is fine. Remy, not for sure. And Diego, let's make a decision tomorrow. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho takes charge of the training session at Cobham on Friday . Belgian star Eden Hazard is in line to be named PFA Player of the Year this weekend . Dominic Solanke is in reserve, having missed Chelsea's Under 21 team match on Thursday, and will be on the substitutes' bench as back-up to Drogba if Costa is not fit. Costa has scored 19 Premier League goals this season, including one in the 2-0 win against Arsenal in October. But Costa has missed the last two matches - wins against QPR and Manchester United - after a recurrence of the hamstring problems which have plagued him. 'He's a very important player for us, but the reality is we are coping with the difficulties of every match without him,' Mourinho added. Teenage striker Dominic Solanke joined the first team for their training session at Cobham on Friday . Youngster Solanke with Hazard in training ahead of the Arsenal game at the Emirates . Mourinho has never lost to Arsene Wenger in 12 previous meetings between the pair . 'We played amazingly well during the most part of the season, scoring a lot of goals and controlling games very well through the quality of our possession. 'In the last period we are more strategic, less artistic, but we are having results. I would love Diego to be back, but I trust the other people.' Eden Hazard was also on target in the autumn home win over Arsenal. The Belgium playmaker is expected to be crowned PFA Player of the Year on Sunday, but Mourinho insists collective honours are more important for Hazard.

The Blues boss also played down the prospect of Hazard moving to Real Madrid after the 24-year-old's idol Zinedine Zidane, now a coach at Real, lauded him this week. Mourinho said: 'We just signed a new contract with him (until 2021). We didn't put a gun to his head. He had a lot of time to think about it. 'He made a commitment for the future of the team, signing a very good contract. I don't think he's interested in going.' Mourinho recently said every player has a price. Asked to put a figure on Hazard, he said: 'That's a good question. I have my idea about it.'","Chelsea players train at their Cobham headquarters on Friday .

"Steve Bruce has revealed that Hull players will have their salaries slashed by up to 50 per cent if they are relegated. The Tigers are fourth-bottom of the Premier League with one of the toughest run-ins facing them, and Hull manager Bruce said all players' contracts have been set up to protect the club financially in the event of relegation. Hull have the third-lowest total wage bill in the Premier League, £43.3million in 2013/14 according to figures filed in Companies House, with only Leicester and Burnley paying less overall. Tigers boss Steve Bruce has revealed that players will have their salaries cut if they don't beat the drop . Hull City currently lie in 17th place but have a daunting run-in to survive in the Premier League . Bruce, speaking ahead of Hull's trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday, said: 'We are a newly-promoted club who have been in the Premier League about 20 months so we always knew we were going to be up against it. 'Everybody concerned takes a huge reduction in salary. The club has had a really, really stringent policy so that if we do get relegated the club doesn't fall into drastic times which a lot of clubs do. 'Most players take a 40 and 50 per cent reduction in their salary which is key throughout it all. So we are all realistic to know that yes we want to avoid going into the Championship but we have made sensible provisions, our budget is pretty stringent, so that the club doesn't leak into the realms it was before and I think that is very important for a club like ours.' Bruce hopes Mo Diame (centre) will recover from a training knock to face Crystal Palace at the weekend . Bruce said battling to avoid such a huge drop in salary should act as a big incentive for his players. He added: 'Absolutely - I think they need reminding of that! For a club like ours it's the right provision. 'If you get relegated it's a major overhaul and you basically start over again on your journey, but you want to remain positive and make sure the club doesn't go through the horrendous times of four or five years ago before the current owners took over.' Hull have not won for two months, their last win being a 2-1 victory over QPR, and desperately need to end the run with matches against Liverpool and Arsenal to come. Bruce's hopes of Mo Diame providing a welcome boost on return from a lengthy knee injury have yet to be realised however, and the Senegal midfielder again complained of pain in his knee in training this week. 'He has been out for five months and he is still not 100 per cent,' said Bruce. 'And we know that if you are not 100 per cent you cannot perform in this league. 'It's a crying shame as we have missed him.' Bruce has praised the job done by Alan Pardew, and before him Tony Pulis (right), at Selhurst Park . Bruce hopes the fact Palace have little to play for will go in Hull's favour but is taking nothing for granted given the turnaround at the Eagles performed by Alan Pardew and before him Tony Pulis. 'A big pat of the back deserves to go to Alan and Tony,' Bruce said. ' Only 18 months ago everyone thought they were a goner.' Andy Robertson (ankle) and Curtis Davies (thigh) are still out for Hull while Alex Bruce's badly broken nose makes him a doubt.","Hull are currently 17th in the Premier League table with a difficult run-in .

"Louis van Gaal has revealed that he has spoken to Marouane Fellaini about keeping his cool when the Manchester United midfielder returns to Goodison Park on Sunday for the first time since his £27million move from Everton. Fellaini, who followed manager David Moyes to Old Trafford in the summer of 2013, is set for a more hostile reception than Juan Mata received at his old club Chelsea last weekend. The Belgium international became a symbol for the failure of the Moyes era but has turned his career around under Van Gaal and goes back to Merseyside as an established first-team player at United. Marouane Fellaini (second right) shares a joke with goalkeeper David de Gea during training on Friday . United are gearing up for a trip to Everton, and the game will be Fellaini's first return to his former club . Louis van Gaal has spoken to Fellaini about keeping his cool on his first return to Goodison Park . Asked about suggestions at Everton that Fellaini has a short fuse, Van Gaal said: ‘I have spoken with Fellaini because I know this. Fellaini is always dry in his answers. He said ""it’s a game"". Yes, but it’s a special game for you. I hope the fans shall receive him like the Chelsea fans received Juan Mata because I like that very much. I hope it’s like that. ‘I am always communicating with my players about philosophy, performance, attitude, behaviour, and maybe one or two aspects more. 'That is what I’m doing, not more than that. When players believe in you they want to convince me because every player playing for Manchester United has qualities. 'Also Marouane Fellaini has qualities and we want to let his qualities dominate in the team and that is what we are trying to do. I believe that we are doing that. That’s why his performances are better just now.’ United have confirmed that Rafael has been ruled out of the remaining five games of the season with a rib injury, and Van Gaal expects to be without Michael Carrick, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind for the trip to Goodison after all four players missed the defeat at Chelsea.

Robin van Persie is not expected to return to the starting XI after his run-out for United's Under 21 side . Van Gaal insists that fellow Dutchman Van Persie (centre) must show his qualities in United's second team . ‘All the players are still injured,’ he said. ‘Only Blind maybe, it’s a question mark, can reach the game against Everton. Jones, Carrick and Rojo cannot play against Everton.’ Robin van Persie is unlikely to regain his starting place despite playing for the Under 21s against Leicester earlier in the week. The Holland striker was an unused substitute at Stamford Bridge, and Van Gaal said: ‘He has to train very hard and play in the second team and show his qualities again. Then I have to compare him with the positions he can play with the players in that position. It’s always the same.’ Juan Mata looks on during United's final training session ahead of their weekend trip to Merseyside .

We set this goal because it was very difficult to reach the top four. We have discussed our goal with the board and the owners and they have set this goal. 'I am the manager and I have to achieve, but they have set this goal for me to achieve. I am always in a club to win the championship not the third or fourth position.

"Tottenham have been encouraged to make a bid for Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin after the French club decided to listen to offers. The 22-year-old winger, who can also play behind the striker, was the subject of enquiries from Tottenham earlier in the year and has also been watched by Chelsea and Valencia. Marseille will listen to offers for highly-rated midfielder Florian Thauvin in the summer . Tottenham want to offload their fringe players first but are looking for attacking options. They are unlikely to pursue Everton's Kevin Mirallas though. Manager Mauricio Pochettino has dismissed the prospect of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris seeking a move if Spurs miss out on the top four this term. 'Hugo wants to play the Champions League here for Tottenham and I think this is a rumour and nothing true,' added the Spurs boss, whose only definite absentee is Kyle Walker. 'Hugo is very happy here and wants to reach the Champions League with Tottenham. This is his dream.'

"A mere 53 hours to kick-off and all is serene at the training base of Queens Park Rangers. Mowers clip along on distant pitches as the sun beats down and the whitewashed pavilion is brightened by pots of forget-me-nots, a flower which could be adopted as the emblem of relegation. QPR boss Chris Ramsey appears relaxed and untroubled, insisting he had more sleepless nights coaching Tottenham last season and joking about the difference between Lidl and Waitrose. His job is to chase pressure and negativity away at times like this, but beneath the surface fear tightens its grip on those near the drop zone. QPR boss Chris Ramsey (centre) is one of seven managers trying to keep their club in the Premier League . Ramsey's side host West Ham on Saturday as they look to climb out of the relegation zone with four games left . Cesc Fabregas' 88th minute strike saw Chelsea grab a late 1-0 win at QPR earlier this month . It will be the same at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Leicester, Sunderland and Hull. Even at Burnley, where Sean Dyche was keen on Thursday to stress his club feel no pressure because their financial commitments are so much less than their rivals. ‘We are probably half the wage bill of the next team in the division, let alone all the superpowers, and half the spending of the next team in the division,’ said Dyche. The financial implications are bigger for others but there still exists a fear of sporting failure, a fear of letting people down, a fear of losing your job, your status, security, your self-esteem. These everyday, human anxieties trouble Premier League footballers, too. When Cesc Fabregas celebrated Chelsea’s winner in the 88th minute at Loftus Road two weeks ago, Ramsey curled into a ball on the touchline and bottled up his fury until he was well clear of the dressing room. ‘It was old-school,’ he smiled. ‘I was a little bit angry. The cat was running. I was so disappointed, probably the most disappointed I’ve been. It was a very soft goal and it would have given us a massive lift to know we could compete with a team of that calibre.’ Four of the bottom seven did not play in the Barclays Premier League last weekend and watched helplessly as Leicester won again, tightening the pack. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says his side have had to compete with the smallest wage budget in the league . NEWCASTLE . Swansea (Home) - April 25 . Leicester (Away) - May 2 .

Having reached the point where all seemed lost, perhaps the pressure left Nigel Pearson’s team. They have won three on the bounce. Now, off the bottom at last, it will get tense again as they head for Turf Moor. Pearson said: ‘I’m delighted. It’s a very difficult feat to achieve for any side, let alone one on the foot of the table. But we’re not in a position to sit back and enjoy it. ‘My perspective is that we’re still in the bottom three. The danger is there’s an assumption the hard work is done. Far from it.’ Sunderland’s Dick Advocaat and QPR’s Ramsey have fixed their survival targets at 35 points. Hull’s Steve Bruce thinks he might get away with 34. At Newcastle, John Carver has 35 and is still uneasy. Leonardo Ulloa was on the scoresheet as Leicester  beat Swansea 2-0 in the Premier League on April 18 . That win elevated Nigel Pearson's (right) side off the bottom of the table and into 18th in the Premier League . Newcastle manager John Carver believes his team need four points from five games to avoid relegation . How the league form table looks like as of April 23 . ‘You can never tell,’ said Carver. ‘For me, we need four points from five games. The unexpected can happen. Look at Sunderland.’ Sunderland were last year’s Houdini: bottom with six to play and doomed according to many by virtue of a daunting fixture list. Then they drew at Manchester City, won at Chelsea and Manchester United and then beat relegation rivals Cardiff and West Brom. They lost the last game and still finished in 14th, five points clear, helped by Connor Wickham’s burst of five goals in three games. Wickham has scored only four since - no-one at Sunderland has more in the Premier League this season — and these acts of escapology are more difficult without a goal supply. Christian Benteke with eight in seven has boosted Aston Villa. ‘For him to be at a club fighting at the bottom is a mismatch,’ said Tim Sherwood, but Villa still require points as they head to Manchester City. QPR have 17-goal Charlie Austin. Will he be enough? Burnley have Danny Ings, almost out of contract and without a goal in more than two months. Hull’s top scorer Nikica Jelavic is injured. The cost of relegation is estimated at £60million by football finance expert Professor Rob Wilson of Sheffield Hallam University. Connor Wickham scored five goals in three games last season to help Sunderland avoid relegation . ‘We normally say promotion is worth £100-120m,’ said Professor Wilson. ‘Relegation is harder to quantify. Clubs won’t get the full TV rights payment which is about £80m but they will get parachute payments. Sponsors pay a premium for the Premier League and those deals will end and salaries can quickly eat up this smaller revenue if there are no clauses to reduce wages or allow a quick sale. ‘For a club’s first season in the Championship it’s in the region of a £60m direct cut in revenue.’ Fates unknown, clubs sketch out alternative recruitment strategies. QPR have a dozen players out of contract and, should they go down, Football League penalties are pending for breaking Financial Fair Play rules last season. Charlie Austin has scored 17 goals in the league for QPR this season - but they still find themselves in 19th . Relegated clubs will receive a parachute payment of £25m next season, followed by £20m in 2016-17 and two more of £10m if they do not go back up, as fewer seem to do. No team has bounced straight back with automatic promotion from the Championship since Newcastle and West Bromwich Albion in 2010. West Ham and QPR rebounded via the play-offs and Norwich are in the race this year. The Championship is an unforgiving pit to fall into, with 17 managerial sackings this season and an average tenure of less than a year. ‘Football has its own laws,’ said Ramsey. ‘I’d be shopping in Lidl instead of Waitrose. I’ll have a different shopping basket if I look at it from a personal point of view.’ It's truly squeaky bum time in the Premier League relegation battle as just nine points separates the bottom seven teams. Sportsmail asks some of the managers in and among the dog fight what they feel is required for them to avoid the drop this season. CHRIS RAMSEY (QPR) 'If we win three games I think we will stay up. It might take less. I'm not saying that's the definitive amount - but we really need to start winning, starting with this weekend. To do that, we need to concentrate right to the end and make sure that our performances stay similar with a bit more defensive resilience.' QPR manager Ramsey (centre) feels they will avoid relegation if they win three more league games . TIM SHERWOOD (Aston Villa) 'I don't know how many points it will take. We've done alright. Nothing's been achieved yet. I'm a new voice and given them a lot of belief and confidence that they are better than what they were showing. They have managed to score a few more goals and have real belief they can go to places and win. Something was probably a little bit missing previously. I want to make sure that I don't take my foot off pedal. I'll make sure the players don't.' Tim Sherwood (left) believes his appointment at Aston Villa has given them a lot of belief and confidence . NIGEL PEARSON (Leicester) 'We've put ourselves in a position now where we have a more realistic chance. That's where we are. If it raises optimism elsewhere, fine. If it applies a bit more pressure on other sides around us, fine also. But as far as I'm concerned it's about making sure we're back to business when we play Burnley. Because it's a really big game for both sides. We've got players in decent form. We want to keep the work ethic that we've shown all season.' Leicester City manager Pearson (right) hopes his side can continue their momentum against Burnley . SEAN DYCHE (Burnley) 'The biggest psychological difference is that others are talking about relegation. Our fuel is about staying in the Premier League. It's a slightly different twist. 'Others are scared of relegation. We're not scared of relegation because we were told by everyone we were going to get relegated. We are actually looking for the goal of being in the Premier League.' Dyche insists his side aren't scared of relegation as a lot of people have written them off in the past .","Just nine points separates the bottom seven clubs in the Premier League .
Burnley sit bottom of the table on 26 points after 33 games in the league .
Newcastle are 14th in the table on 35 points with five games remaining ."
"The panel that cleared Inverness defender Josh Meekings to play in the William Hill Scottish Cup final did not even consider his handball, the Scottish Football Association has revealed. Meekings saw his cup-final ban thrown out by a judicial panel tribunal on Thursday after Caley Thistle challenged his one-game suspension for denying Celtic an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberate handball. And it has emerged the Highland club's lawyers successfully argued that SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan had no right to bring the case because match officials had seen the incident where Meekings stopped a Leigh Griffiths header during his side's 3-2 win over Celtic on Sunday. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . The SFA published the reasons given by the chair of the three-man panel. They read: 'Further to the judicial panel hearing yesterday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings' solicitor. 'In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. 'The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned before the verdict that the SFA was veering into dangerous territory . 'It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.' The decision could effectively blunt the SFA's powers to bring retrospective cases against players, unless an incident has been completely missed by all match officials. Players have previously been cited for diving to win penalties. The rule states that the compliance officer can bring cases for alleged sending-off offences 'not seen by match officials'. The Meekings case was brought because referee Steven McLean and his team had not seen the ball hit the defender's hand. PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned before the verdict that the SFA was veering into dangerous territory. He said: 'I think you have seen this week from the reaction of players across the country, players have no problem with video evidence being used for incidents that genuinely haven't been seen by the referee. 'Maybe a punch behind the referee's back and fly kick when the ball is away. 'But we think, if the rule has been extended, then it is now erring into re-refereeing a game on a Monday. 'That's not the purpose of video evidence. That's why the English FA and FIFA and UEFA steer away from that. The referee could see the incident on Sunday, he just didn't see the handball.'","Inverness defender Josh Meekings won appeal against one-match ban .

"Football equality campaigners Kick It Out have warned Hartlepool supporters over a Bob Marley-themed fancy-dress day planned for their League Two trip to Carlisle on the final day of the season. Officials from the anti-racism body say they have acted on complaints from some Hartlepool fans and urged Carlisle to refuse admission to any fans who might decide to 'black up' for the occasion. Jamaican reggae artist Marley was a multi-million-selling artist, famed for his music and as a Rastafarian for his dreadlocked look, who died of cancer aged 36 in 1981. Hartlepool United fans have a history of fancy dress, travelling as the Smurfs to Charlton in 2012 . Hartlepool fans are planning to dress up as Bob Marley for the final game of this season at Carlisle . A statement from Kick It Out read: 'We have received a number of complaints from Hartlepool United supporters about the Bob Marley fancy dress theme planned by a group of the club's fans for their fixture against Carlisle United at Brunton Park on Saturday 2 May. 'The main concerns raised have been over the potential of fans deciding to 'black up'. 'We have subsequently followed up on the complaints by contacting both Hartlepool United and Carlisle United on the matter. 'We clearly outlined that 'blacking up' has historically been a way of acting out racist stereotypes, and while the theme planned by fans may be well intended and chosen as part of an annual fancy dress tradition, such behaviour, if it occurs, is likely to cause offence. 'We have provided guidance to both clubs on the matter, and advised Carlisle United of our own stance that if any fans do choose to 'black up' they should be refused entry to their stadium. Kick It Out have urged Carlisle to refuse entry to any fans who decide to black up for the fixture . 'We have also contacted the Football Association, the Football League, and the United Kingdom Football Policing Unit to inform them of the complaints we have received from Hartlepool United supporters. 'If we do receive complaints informing us that supporters have 'blacked up' at the fixture between Carlisle United and Hartlepool United, or that any incidents or disturbances of a discriminatory nature have occurred, we will follow our usual procedures by making the Football Association and the Football League aware for them to investigate.' Neither Carlisle nor Hartlepool were immediately available for comment but Carlisle boss Keith Curle told the local News & Star at a press conference this week: 'I've been to fancy dress parties when white people have dressed up as Bob Marley. I haven't been offended.'","Anti-racism campaigners have asked Carlisle to refuse admission to any fans who black up as part of the fancy-dress theme .

"Raheem Sterling insists he has not been affected by the criticism of his ongoing contract stand-off with Liverpool. The England international has been abused, even by his own fans, over his decision to put deal talks on hold after rejecting an offer worth £90,000-per-week. Sterling was even heckled at the club's recent kit launch, but the 20-year-old, speaking for the first time since his now infamous BBC interview, insists he is immune to the negative comments. Raheem Sterling says he pays no attention to criticism levelled at him for contract stand-off with Liverpool . Sterling (left) tussles for possession with Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson during training on Thursday . In an interview with BT Sport, Sterling said: 'Everyone has their opinion on me at this moment in time but I’m just a kid who loves to play football and to try and improve every day and be the best I can be. 'It just goes in one ear and goes out the other. I don’t read anything, don’t look at anything and, for me, it’s all football. I’m genuinely focused on doing my best for this football club.' Sterling is one of Europe's most sought after young players. Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United all have a genuine interest. Real Madrdid supremo Zinedine Zidane admitted the Spanish giants were keeping tabs on the youngster, while Bayern Munich and Juventus are monitoring his contract situation. Sterling is wanted by all the Premier League's top clubs, as well as Real Madrid and Juventus . Nevertheless, Sterling, who has scored 11 goals this season, admits there's still much more to come from him. Sterling added: 'I set targets for myself at the start of the season and I’m probably a few goals behind where I wanted to be. 'I’m just taking it in my stride and hopefully in these last few games, the run-in until the end of the season, I can kick on again. I’m still learning and developing so only time will tell. 'I’m my own biggest critic. I don’t need anyone to tell me when I’ve played badly. I know when I’ve done bad, I’m always looking where I could have done better or scored an extra goal. Sterling (left) is challenged by Ron Vlaar during Liverpool's defeat by Aston Villa at Wembley last Sunday . 'This is the world that we live in. You look at the players like Ronaldo and these players are critical on themselves. These are the people that you need to idolise and look up to. 'It’s fallen really nicely for me to play at the highest level. From when I signed at Liverpool as a 14 or 15-year-old boy, it was my dream to be at Anfield and I was not going anywhere until I’d done that. 'Last season was a great season for everyone at this football club. Obviously we didn’t start the season as well as we would have liked, we’ve definitely shown qualities and the manager has shown us stats from the start of the year and we’ve probably been one of the better teams in the league.'","Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling rejected a £90,000-a-week contract .

"The tears have dried but for how long? It’s been almost a year to the day since Darrell Clarke cracked in front of the cameras as he explained how Bristol Rovers fell out of the Football League for the first time since 1920. If he had spent the entire press conference scratching his head in silence no-one would have blamed him. The circumstances were extraordinary; the chance they have on Saturday for quick redemption is made all the more fascinating because of what happened in that crazy finale. Rovers had spent less than an hour in the League Two relegation zone all season but, crucially, it was the last hour of the campaign. The music stopped, Mansfield had beaten them 1-0, the two other teams that needed to win had won, and Rovers were left without a seat. The tears came, £1million from the playing budget went and Rovers were a Conference side, three years after being in League One. But, if nothing else, it taught Clarke that anything can happen on the final day. A year ago, Bristol Rovers lost their place in the Football League for the first time since 1920 . Darrell Clarke was distraught at the end of last season, but there could be tears of joy this time around . He needs that hope now, when the battle for the Conference title is wrapped up. It’s between second-placed Rovers, who play Alfreton, and Barnet, who hold a one-point lead and a vastly better goal difference going into their game against Gateshead. ‘It’s a pretty big weekend for us,’ Clarke told Sportsmail. It’s not quite the Championship race for £120m — the financial boost available here is roughly £600,000 — but the real-world difference between Football League and the rest is every bit as significant. Barnet are heavy favourites to take the one automatic spot, by virtue of their lead and the fact Gateshead are safe in mid-table. There is also the fact that Wrexham approached Gateshead manager Gary Mills this week to discuss their vacancy. ‘I know the lads at Gateshead and I know they will be professional and they have a very professional manager,’ Clarke said. For his part, Clarke’s players must beat an Alfreton side fighting to stay up. ‘We both have a lot to gain,’ Clarke said. ‘We will be on our front foot from the first whistle to win.’ If they do, and Barnet lose or draw, it will be a remarkable achievement and a rare one, considering no side have returned to the Football League at the first time of asking since Carlisle in 2005. If Bristol Rovers go up, they will be the first team to go straight back up since Carlisle in 2005 . Carlisle won the Conference play-off in 2005 and Bristol Rovers will hope to match their promotion success . The upheaval that followed Rovers’ demise was dramatic. Clarke’s own position came under review and he lost three members of his backroom team. ‘It hurt me personally very much and for the club the finances changed and we had the consequences of that,’ he said. ‘People around the club lose jobs and that is hard.’ Twenty players left after the budget was cut. ‘We probably have only six players from last season,’ explained Clarke. ‘But we have worked so hard to be where we are. This is a hard league, but I’m delighted with how we are going.’ Clarke's Rovers had a difficult start to the season but have now only lost once in the last 27 league matches . It was a slow start. Five points from the first five games caused some anxiety and, in November, following their first game against Alfreton, an angry fan tried to board the team bus. On Saturday, they face them again having lost once in the past 27 league games and with the highest average gates in the division. Clarke, at 37, has salvaged his own reputation. ‘We have had the best form in the table for months,’ Clarke said. ‘If we have to go to the play-offs, so be it. But let’s see what happens this weekend first.’ It might all end in tears again but there’s a fighting chance that they will be the right kind this time.","Bristol Rovers were relegated from the Football League last season .

"Amid a torrent of rumours surrounding Rafa Benitez and his managerial future, the Spaniard quietly continued a phenomenal career trend on Thursday with Napoli. He took the Serie A side into the Europa League semi-final with an emphatic 6-3 aggregate victory over Wolfsburg and the impending encounters against Dnipro will be Benitez's seventh major European semi-final in 12 seasons. Napoli are the fourth club he has taken to the latter stages of a European competition, following spells with Valencia, Liverpool and Chelsea.

Benitez (centre) has reached his seventh European semi-final in only 12 seasons with four teams . Benitez (right) guided Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005, his first season at the club . Benitez got Liverpool back to the final of the competition in 2007, where they were beaten 2-1 by AC Milan . 2004: UEFA Cup winner (Valencia) 2005: Champions League winner (Liverpool) 2007: Champions League finalist (Liverpool) 2008: Champions League semi (Liverpool) 2010: Europa League semi (Liverpool) 2013: Europa League winner (Chelsea) 2015: Europa League semi (Napoli) Benitez tasted continental success for the first time with Valencia in 2004, lifting what was then the UEFA Cup after beating a Marseille side spearheaded by Didier Drogba 2-0 in the final. That achievement, alongside the two La Liga titles he won during his three-year spell at the Mestalla, caught the eye of Liverpool, who swooped to bring the Spaniard in as Gerard Houllier's replacement. His first Premier League season was one of adjustment but in Europe, Benitez flourished. He recorded his most stunning glory to date, masterminding what on paper was a woefully uninspiring Liverpool team to Champions League glory, overcoming a star-studded AC Milan side that boasted the likes of Cafu, Paolo Maldini, Kaka and Andriy Shevchenko in the final. Benitez maneuvered Liverpool back to the Champions League final in 2007, eliminating Barcelona on the way with a win at the Nou Camp, only for Milan to avenge their defeat two years prior with a 2-1 victory. The Spaniard  manipulated another assault on Europe's elite trophy the following year but Liverpool were knocked out in the semi-final by Chelsea. Off-field ownership turmoil derailed Benitez's team and Liverpool have not even threatened to emerge as a challenger for club football's most prestigious competition since. They were eliminated in the group stage of the tournament in 2010, where a third-placed finish resulted in demotion to the Europa League. But Benitez guided Liverpool to the semi-finals of Europe's secondary competition, where a Diego Forlan strike in extra-time at Anfield sent Atletico Madrid to the final, where they beat Roy Hodgson's Fulham. The Spaniard was sacked as Liverpool manager at the end of the 2010 season and Hodgson replaced Benitez, who ended up at Chelsea as interim manager in 2012 via a short spell at Inter Milan. Benitez won the Europa League with Chelsea, beating Benfica in the final, but his stay at Stamford Bridge was always going to be a short one. Benitez often barbed Chelsea supporters while at Anfield and with Jose Mourinho's time at Real Madrid grinding to a halt, it was clear who Benitez was keeping the Chelsea hotseat warm for. Now at Napoli, Benitez finds his future at the club in question due to meandering domestic form. Napoli are currently fourth in Serie A, five points away from the top three (which equals Champions League qualification in Italy) with seven games remaining until the end of the season, when the Spaniard's contract expires. Benitez was not a popular choice at Chelsea but he still delivered silverware with the Europa League . Benitez first won the trophy with Valencia in 2004 shortly before moving to Liverpool . Benitez is out of contract at Napoli at the end of the season and has been linked with Manchester City . Benitez has been linked with a return to England with Manchester City, as Manuel Pellegrini has overseen a feeble attempt at defending their Premier League title, while some Liverpool fans even pine for him to return to Anfield. If Benitez does leave Napoli at the end of the season, he will surely have an array of suitors. He has 12 major honours to his name. Few coaches across Europe posses a record as imposing as his.","Rafa Benitez's contract at Napoli expires at the end of the season .

"Chelsea are set to follow Tottenham’s lead and take part in a post-season friendly Down Under in June. Jose Mourinho’s side could face Sydney  at the ANZ Stadium on June 2 - days after Spurs’ fixture against the same side. The Blues are holding ongoing talks with Sydney bosses and, should they agree terms, are expected to fly out on the Wednesday after the Premier League season ends. Chelsea are set to follow Tottenham’s lead and take part in a post-season friendly Down Under in June . Manager Jose Mourinho has been discussing post-season plans with the Chelsea board . The concept of fulfilling commercial obligations straight after a Premier League campaign is appealing to clubs, giving them room to manoeuvre during pre-season. Chelsea are expected to arrive in Australia as top-flight champions and the 83,000-seater arena would almost certainly sell out. The plan for a post-season tour has been discussed for a while, with Mourinho saying earlier this month: 'If we win the title, I think we’ll go on an after-season tour, play a couple of matches in some destination where people will be very enthusiastic to have the Premier League champions. 'It’s something we are thinking about, a good way to celebrate. Not a victory parade but a trip, a week where we play a couple of matches but, at the same time, can be together without the pressure of winning every match, without the pressure and tension of the last weeks of the Premier League. Harry Kane's whereabouts in June is undecided, although it appears he will play for England Under 21s . May 27: Chelsea expected to fly out to Australia . May 28: Sydney FC vs Tottenham . June 2: Sydney FC vs Chelsea (TBC) June 7: Republic of Ireland vs England . June 11: Copa America begins . 'We can also relax and go to holidays with that good feeling. But we still have nine matches to play. [The chairman] Bruce Buck and the board are talking with me about destinations. We want to go somewhere where people are enthusiastic to have a club like Chelsea.' Tottenham play on May 28 and a week before England's friendly away in Ireland, meaning international stars could forgo the trips. The whereabouts of Harry Kane remains up in the air that week after the very public indications he will be selected by England Under 21 boss Gareth Southgate for the European Championships in Czech Republic. The timing does raise questions as to whether or not Chelsea's South American contingent will join them, with the Copa America due to start on June 11. Filipe Luis, Ramires, Oscar and Willian are all expected to be selected by Dunga's Brazil, with Colombia to pick Juan Cuadrado. Chelsea are set for a hectic summer schedule. They are also expected to travel to the USA for two weeks in mid-July as part of the International Champions Cup and be back at Wembley in time for the FA Community Shield on August 1, should they win the Premier League. Mourinho said on Friday: 'The players that go to a tournament like Copa America have a certain number of days to go. Friendlies have a certain number of hours to go. 'Players who play qualifiers for the Euros, they have another number of hours. We are going to respect that as we did all season. No problems, for sure. When our players have to be here, they will be. That's for sure.' Chelsea will face Sydney FC at the ANZ Stadium days after Tottenham play the same opposition . Manchester United had looked primed to join the growing list of clubs participating in post-season jaunts, but instead announced they are to play in America in July. Manager Louis van Gaal expressed his disappointment at last year’s gruelling schedule before that deal was ratified. Liverpool and Manchester City will play in Australia in July ahead of the 2015/16 campaign.","Chelsea to face Sydney FC at the ANZ Stadium on June 2 .

"Warrington put a dampener on Kevin Sinfield's 500th appearance for Leeds as they completed a notable double over the Super League leaders in emphatic fashion at Headingley. Sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the Rhinos against Sheffield Eagles at Headingley in 1997 and he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion, with the Wolves running out 29-10 winners. The Rhinos were already trailing 20-4 when the former England skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half and it did not get much better as the Yorkshiremen came up with their worst performance of the season in front of a 17,430 crowd. Warrington Wolves forward Roy Asotasi crosses for one of his side's five tries on the night . Warrington had produced their best display in an 18-6 win over Leeds in March and they were again outstanding, with full-back Stefan Ratchford and second rower Ben Currie the pick of an impressive bunch. Leeds had an early chance when prop Adam Cuthbertson was held up over the line but then it was virtually all Warrington as they established a stranglehold on the game. Loose forward Ben Harrison was held up on his back before his back-row partner Currie produced a measured grubber kick on the last tackle to create a try for winger Gene Ormsby. Leeds Rhinos winger Kallum Watkins does brilliantly to touch down in the corner . It was then Harrison's turn to demonstrate his kicking skills to get his captain Joel Monaghan in for a second try, although there was a strong hint of a forward pass in the build-up. With scrum-half Richie Myler causing all sorts of problems for the Rhinos defence with his penetrative running, the visitors were good value for their 8-0 lead and it got even better for them on 23 minutes when prop Ashton Sims took hooker Mick Higham's pass near the line to go through a gaping hole for a third try. Ratchford was off target with his first two attempts at goal but it was third time lucky as he made it 14-0 and a Higham 40-20 kick enabled Warrington to maintain the momentum. Warrington forward Ben Harrison is tackled by Stevie Ward during a frantic contest at Headingley . Sinfield stayed on the bench throughout the first half but the introduction of forward Mitch Achurch helped perk up the Rhinos in the last 10 minutes and they pulled a try back in scintillating fashion when winger Kallum Watkins finished off a flowing move at the corner. The Leeds captain entered the action five minutes into the second half but his side were trailing 20-4 by then after a break by lively substitute Daryl Clark created the position for Ratchford to get Currie over for Warrington's fourth try. And there was no way back for Sinfield's men when Ormsby's neat offload enabled substitute prop Roy Asotasi to score his first try for more than 12 months. Leeds Rhinos veteran Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for the club on Friday night . Ratchford kicked his third goal to stretch his side's lead to 26-4 and increased it with a penalty on 63 minutes after Jamie Peacock was pulled up for a high tackle. The home side pulled a try back five minutes later through Achurch and Sinfield kicked the goal but it was little more than consolation and the Wolves had the final say when stand-off Declan Patton slotted a drop goal to open his account for the club on his third appearance.","Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for Leeds .

"Baseball may not have a reputation for being a violent as some of America's other sports, but the MLB witnessed scenes more suited to the Ice-Hockey rink or grid-iron field on Thursday night. In the seventh innings of a game between the Kansas City Royals and rivals Chicago White Sox both sets of players became embroiled in a mass brawl. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight at Chicago's US Cellular Field in Illinois. Scroll down for video . Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija, center, in the brawl with Royals players during Thursday's game . A heated exchange between Royals starter Yordano Ventura and White Sox outfielder Adam Eaton sparked the brawl which saw players from both dugouts and bullpens flood the field, reported New York Daily News. Several punches were thrown and  Ventura, along with fellow teammates Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez, was sent off along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija. Thursday's match began to get scrappy after the White Sox's Jose Abreu was hit in the arm by  Ventura's pitch in the fourth innings. The very next innings, Royals' Mike Moustakas was also hit in the arm, this time by a pitch from Chris Sale, leading to a warning for both teams. But things continued to escalate until Eaton hit a comebacker (a ball batted directly back to the pitcher) at Ventura in the seventh innings. The Royals starter picked up a ground ball but instead of throwing it to first for the out, he appeared to stop for a moment and stare at the pitcher. MLB.com . Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . The pair exchanged words, and Eaton is alleged to have shouted an expletive at Ventura, who was said to have shouted one back before he threw to first base to end the inning. Things quickly turned ugly and both players had to be kept apart by teammates and umpires. But the whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches. The fight was beginning to calm down and Moustakas was escorting Ventura back to the dugout when Samardzija charged at Cain. However, he missed knocked over coach Mike Jirschele instead. Ventura told ESPN Chicago he regretted the way he'd handled himself. 'It was a messy situation, I got the ground ball and was unable to control my emotions in that play, and it turned out ugly,' Ventura said. Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected . Both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches . '(Eaton) said something to me. I responded back to him,' he said. 'It wasn't my intention, but maybe he interpreted it from the way I fielded the ball, but it was a hard comebacker, kind of put me off-balance, at which point I took those steps that incited him and he responded back, clearly emotional.' Royals won the game 3-2 in 13 innings, which is the first of a four-game series. This is not the first time the Royals have had tensions with other teams. Last weekend, their clash with Oakland Athletics landed scrappy Ventura with a fine for his actions. He was also  involved in the team's disagreements with the Los Angeles Angels. In the three-game series against the Athletics, the teams clashed almost every match until five players and coaches were thrown out of the finale. They included Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera, who threw that fastball behind the head of Brett  Lawrie and pointed to his own head in a threatening manner. He received a five-game suspension.","Thursday's match between  two baseball heavyweights turned into a brawl .

Fury is the mandatory challenger to the long-reigning heavyweight champion and hopes to lure him to England in the autumn. Wladimir Klitschko  goes up against Bryant Jennings in New York on Saturday night . But Klitschko must first face the unbeaten Jennings in New York. ‘I believe Wladimir will beat Jennings and I want him to win because I want to be the one to beat him in England and put an end to his reign,’ said Fury. ‘We’ve been in discussions to get the fight on, hopefully at one of the big football stadiums in September. It’s something which I’ve left with my promoter and team and things are looking positive though it takes a very brave or stupid man to step in the ring with Tyson Fury. ‘I’m the heavyweight who is going to take over this division because I have everything that is needed.

Klitschko has held a portion of the world title since 2000 but Fury is convinced he is the man to beat him. ‘I’m mandatory for the WBO title and if Wladimir does defend it against me he won’t last more than eight rounds because I will be knocking him out after being involved in a bit of a brawl early on,’ he added. ‘I know his flaws and I know how to beat him – for once he will be picking on someone his own size. ‘A fight with Wladimir doesn’t concern me because I know I will beat him, it’s just a matter of how and what round I do the job in. I’m still not fully convinced he has the balls to step in the ring with me but if he does then I take my hat off to him because it will be the night the Klitschko era ends and the Tyson Fury one begins.’ Former heavyweight champions Evander Holyfield (left) and Lennox Lewis attend the official weigh-in .

"English football will stand still just before three o’clock on Saturday to mark the 30th anniversary of the Bradford fire. All fixtures in the Premier League and Football League will observe a minute’s silence for the 56 supporters who died in the devastating blaze. The inferno ripped through Valley Parade on May 11, 1985 during the first half of a game against Lincoln City, before which Bradford had received the Third Division title. A minute's silence will be held this weekend for the 56 supporters who lost their lives during the Bradford City fire disaster . Football League supporting efforts to raise £300,000 for the Plastic Surgery and Burns Research Unit at the University of Bradford . A blaze tore through Valley Parade's main stand during a Third Division match against Lincoln City on May 11, 1985 . Players, managers and fans will stand for a minute to mark the 30th anniversary of the disaster, which also left 265 injured . Supporters watch on as the fire rips through Bradford City's ground - and have had no definitive answers to questions they asked . Many fans were trapped in their seats and 265 people were injured as the fire engulfed the main stand within minutes. The top four tiers of the game will remember them this weekend. And the top four tiers of the game will mark their passing this weekend. The Football League will be supporting efforts to raise £300,000 for the Plastic Surgery and Burns Research Unit at the University of Bradford. Mark Lawn, the co-chairman of Bradford City, said: ‘I am personally delighted that the FA, the Football League and Premier League have got involved. I would like to remind people that the PSBRU is solely reliant on charitable donations by the public, charitable organisations and businesses, and has no funding from the Government. ‘I am extremely pleased that Bradford City has helped to fund the PSBRU through the supporters raising money. This has been enough over the years to help maintain and exceed the standards coming from the unit.’ There are harrowing stories of almost entire families passing away that day in Yorkshire and serious questions still remain as we head into a fourth decade since the tragedy. They are laid bare in Martin Fletcher’s new book, Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire, in which the author challenges accepted theories as to the cause. Nobody has been made accountable for events which saw Fletcher lose his brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63. Fletcher has been researching the fire for 15 years and believes the investigation’s findings are flawed. The inquiry asserted that the cause was, in all likelihood, down to a cigarette or a match dropped on to a pile of rubbish. He found that former chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who died in 1995 aged 61, had been connected with at least eight other business fires and insurance claims. John Helm, the man commentating on the game when fire broke out, was candid in Sportsmail last week . Thousands watched on horrified as the flames took control of the stand to devastating effect . The variance in theories suggests, as with Hillsborough, a new investigation would be vindicated, offering potential closure for the city . Martin Fletcher’s new book – Fifty-six – The Story of the Bradford Fire – challenges accepted theories as to the cause of the fire. There were many cases of heroism, with more than fifty people receiving police awards or commendations . John Helm, the man commentating on the game when fire broke out, was candid in Sportsmail last week and refuted Fletcher’s claims. ‘Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind — any bitterness would be understandable — but from everything I have been told there isn’t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately,’ he wrote. ‘On the contrary, I remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started. Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire. ‘This corroborates what I was told at the time by the coroner. He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man, visiting this country from Australia, but his name was never revealed. ‘Without making allegations against the club’s chairman at the time Stafford Heginbotham, there is inference by implication in the book — with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased Heginbotham. As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day, and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later, it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson.’ A solitary bottle of champagne stands on the terrace - Bradford had been celebrating winning the Third Division title earlier in the day .

The variance in theories suggests, as with Hillsborough, a new investigation would be vindicated, offering closure to a city that still has no definitive answer. This weekend will be the first time the whole of English football has come together and remembered the Bradford 56 in unison. And the club has only recently wanted to fully remember the victims publicly. The memorial at Valley Parade wasn’t erected until 2001 and years went by without the anniversary even getting a mention in programmes and there were no silences or black armbands. ‘I do feel we missed something of an opportunity in the aftermath of the fire,’ former chairman Jack Tordoff said in 2011, when Valley Parade celebrated its 125 years as a sporting venue. ‘I think we should have looked at starting from scratch in another location. This picture shows what damage the fire caused in such a short space of time, with an entrance completely obliterated .

The scene at Bradford's memorial service to mark the passing of supporters who died in the fire . Firemen survey the damage and put out any remains of the fire after bringing it under control . A policeman watches the forensic team pore through evidence on the terracing at Bradford . ‘The fire was, of course, a horrible time. Fifty-six people lost their lives and the effect on the city was huge, and probably something that can’t be put into words. You had to be in Bradford at that time to understand just what the city went through. ‘I had returned to the board in 1983 with Stafford (Heginbotham, City chairman at the time of the fire) to save the club. 'But then the fire happened...' The planned minute’s applause at last season’s FA Cup final between Arsenal and Hull was given a mixed reception by some Bradford supporters, who still maintain the loss is solely theirs. That, though, won’t stop hundreds of thousands paying their respects this weekend as the disaster is brought sharply back into public focus.

"Sydney-bound winger Joe Burgess scored his first Super League hat-trick as Wigan secured their first away win of the season, but they were made to work hard by struggling Wakefield in an error-strewn game at the Rapid Solicitors Stadium. Burgess, who is joining Sydney Roosters at the end of the year, scored three of the Warriors' seven tries in a 40-22 victory - their first Super League success in West Yorkshire for 18 months - to help his side climb above St Helens into second place in the table, at least for 24 hours. It was a third consecutive win for Shaun Wane's men and a fifth from their last six matches but their hard-to-please coach will be far from happy with their performance and his mood will have worsened by a hamstring injury to centre Anthony Gelling. Joe Burgess (left) was in fine form for Wigan with his first Super League hat-trick . It was a ninth successive defeat for the Wildcats, who remain rooted to the foot of the table, but a vast improvement on their 80-0 rout by Warrington in their previous league game. Still without seven senior players through injury, Wakefield gave a debut to Widnes loanee prop Ben Kavanagh, a first start to young loose forward Jordan Crowther and a first Super League outing for former Leeds prop Ian Kirke. And their problems worsened when Kirke sustained a broken thumb and loose forward Danny Washbrook damaged a rib to leave coach James Webster cursing his luck. Yet the Wildcats made the best possible start, with makeshift centre Matt Ryan breaking clear from his own half to create a try for full-back Craig Hall, who kicked the first of his three goals. Wigan looked to have gained control, however, when prop Dom Crosby took Michael McIlorum's pass to crash over for his first try for more than two years and scrum-half Matty Smith skipped through Wildcats defence for a solo score. Flying wingers Burgess and Dom Manfredi both produced clinical finishes to double the Warriors' try tally before half-time but the gritty Yorkshiremen would not lie down as the game opened up after Sam Powell (Wigan) and Tim Smith (Wakefield) were despatched to the sin bin following a skirmish. Daniel Smith got skipper Danny Kirmond through a chink in the visitors' defence for one try and stand-off Pita Godinet added another on the stroke of half-time, darting over from dummy half, as Wakefield eyed a repeat of last year's shock win over Wane's men. Burgess scorched over for his second try within two minutes of the re-start following more smart work from his centre partner Dan Sarginson as Wigan established a 12-point lead for the third time. But Godinet pounced on a stray pass from former Wigan's Wakefield forward Taulima Tautai to get winger Chris Riley over for a fourth Wildcats try to cut the deficit to 30-22. However, the game always looked to be within Wigan's grasp and they opened up a three-score lead on 57 minutes when prop Lee Mossop proved unstoppable from 10 metres out. Burgess was denied when referee Robert Hicks ruled a knock-on from George Williams' grubber kick but he duly completed his hat-trick on 63 minutes after accepting Williams' cut-out pass to cross at the corner.","Wigan secured their first away win of the Super League season .

"Toulon have announced the signing of Australia star Quade Cooper. In a statement on the official club website, Toulon said that 27-year-old Cooper had agreed a two-year deal and will move to France this summer. The Queensland Reds fly-half, who has won 53 caps, becomes the latest Australia international to move abroad, following players like Will Genia, James Horwill and Adam Ashley-Cooper. Quade Cooper played against England in the Autumn Internationals and will join Toulon this summer . Former Wallabies playmaker Matt Giteau has guided the Top 14 side to the European Champions Cup final . He is currently injured, though, and continuing his recovery from a broken shoulder-blade that he suffered playing for the Reds earlier this month. Bernard Foley is favourite to wear the Wallabies number 10 shirt for their World Cup campaign, which starts against Fiji in Cardiff on September 23. Cooper, meanwhile, will link up with former Wallabies playmaker Matt Giteau, who has been instrumental in guiding the French club to this season's European Champions Cup final.

With immediate effect, overseas-based Australia internationals who have played more than 60 Tests for the Wallabies and held a professional ARU contract for at least seven years will be available to head coach Michael Cheika. Previously, all overseas-based players were ineligible to be picked, and the move could now open the door to an international recall for players like Giteau and his Toulon colleague Drew Mitchell.","Quade Cooper has agreed to join Top 14 club Toulon until 2017 .

"Hudson Swafford shot a 6-under 66 for a share of the Zurich Classic lead with Boo Weekley when second-round play was suspended Friday because of the threat of severe weather. Swafford had an 11-under 133 total at TPC Louisiana. Weekley, the first-round leader after a 64, also was 11 under with three holes left. Jason Day, ranked sixth in the world, was 5 under for the round through 14 holes, pulling him into a five-way tie for third at 10 under with Brandon de Jonge, Cameron Tringale, former Zurich champion Jerry Kelly and Daniel Berger. Tringale had a 65, and de Jonge shot 70. Kelley was on the 18th green when play was stopped, and Berger had three holes left. Hudson Swafford watches his tee shot on the 18th hole on day two at the Zurich Classic . Boo Weekley tees off on the 5th hole at TPC Louisiana in Avondale on Friday . Second-round play was scheduled to resume Saturday at 8 a.m. CDT. The field remained tightly packed with birdies seemingly harder to come by Friday. Many players cited a combination of wind, soggy turf from recent rain and thick, swampy air as reasons for the course to play even longer than usual. Six players were tied for eighth, two shots off the lead. They were Chad Campbell, Morgan Hoffman, Steven Bowditch, Justin Thomas, Chris Stroud and David Hearn. Seven more players were at 8 under, including Marc Leishman, who returned to the PGA Tour this weekend after taking a month off from golf to tend to family when his wife became gravely ill. With his wife, recovering, Leishman came to New Orleans saying he just wanted to knock off some rust and was keeping expectations low. He did a lot better than that and is now in line for a nice pay-day, given officials were estimating the cut line at four under. Swafford chips on to the 17th green before ending the day tied for the lead on 11-under . Marc Leishman (right) takes a drop after hitting into the water on the 18th hole . Leishman was at 10 under through 17 holes, putting him in position to set a TPC Louisiana record with a birdie on the par-5 18th. But after a booming drive, Leishman gambled on an aggressive second shot, using his driver on the fairway. He pushed his ball right into the water. When play was stopped, he was on the fringe, lying four, needing to sink his next shot Saturday morning to tie the course record of 62. Swafford, in only his second season on the tour, had six birdies and no bogeys during his second round, putting him in position to contend for what would be his maiden PGA Tour victory. His best finish so far is tied for eighth at the Frys.com Open last October, though his most impressive outing may have been at last month's Arnold Palmer invitational at Bay Hill, where he tied for 11th. Weekley, meanwhile, continued to play well with new shafts that he credited for a strong first round after missing the cut in three of his previous four tournaments. England's Justin Rose is just four shots off the lead on 7-under, while Rickie Fowler is one shot off the projected cut as he finished the day on 3-under after his round was stopped at the 15th.

Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. GOALKEEPER: PETR CECH . Cech is the man for the big occasions and the big games. The last one was the (Champions League) final in Munich. Preparing a goalkeeper's station is like mathematics - nothing is like an accident. He is somebody in the dressing room with a big character and he's a leader as well. Florent Malouda picked Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech to start in between the sticks for his Fantasy XI . Malouda's Fantasy Football XI . RIGHT BACK: DAVID LUIZ . I know with this offensive mentality that I have in my team he won't be frustrated so I trust him to follow the manager's orders and stay in that right back position. He's funny, but when it comes to reason, he is a guy that steps in and takes big responsibility in a team. CENTRE BACK: LILIAN THURAM . He is a real defender with lots of experience. He is very, very solid when all the others will take the risk. I need two leaders. CENTRE BACK: JOHN TERRY . The second one is the captain. I pick a team with a lot of characters. I needed somebody to lead them and JT is a natural born leader. I need a player like him to make the team perform. LEFT BACK: ERIC ABIDAL . I wanted to pick Ashley Cole because we had a great time together and we had a great understanding, but I have to pick my close friend Eric Abidal. I started to play with him during my time at Lyon. He's a little bit like David Luiz in the dressing room always having fun and joking around. He has this faith and to sacrifice himself to help you be a better player. Malouda included Chelsea defender John Terry (far left, pictured in 2007) for his leadership qualities . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER: CLAUDE MAKELELE . He is a leader and for me a tactical genius. He was the kind of guy telling you, 'be cool and and just stay in that position'. MIDFIELDER: PATRICK VIEIRA . He is just a legend and makes things so simple. Playing with him was easy and that's the kind of guy when you train with them you learn a lot of things. He's a fighter and you need that fighting spirit because not every game will be easy. Former Arsenal and France midfielder, pictured with Malouda in 2006, starts in a three-man central midfield . RIGHT MIDFIELDER: FRANK LAMPARD . In my team you're going for goals and Lamps is a great professional and a great example to follow. Arriving in this league I remember Didier Drogba telling me, 'watch (him) because you have to learn'. I've seen so many times (Lampard) score winning goals. LEFT MIDFIELDER: ZINEDINE ZIDANE . I would give him the freedom. Everytime you are stressed, everything is in slow motion for him. My team will play with style and class with Zizou. Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry, who played alongside Malouda for the France national team, start in attack . STRIKER: THIERRY HENRY . I remember when I arrived in 2004 (in the national team), he welcomed me. I never even knew Thierry Henry even knew me. He loves the game so much and he's an Arsenal legend. STRIKER: DIDIER DROGBA . I met him when we first played together in the second division in France at Guingamp. Watching him get to the world class level when he scored that header coming out of nowhere in Munich. Then he had that opportunity with that last penalty. He gave us the Champions League which made me so, so happy. He's a striker for the big occasions and big games.

"When Andriy Shevchenko netted the winning penalty to condemn Juventus to defeat in the 2003 Champions League final, they surely would not have envisaged it would take them this long to get back to Europe's top table. That penalty shootout followed a 0-0 draw which saw AC Milan crowned European champions in the first all-Italian final. Now, after a long journey, Juve are back among the continent's elite. Another goalless draw, this time against Monaco on Wednesday night, was more successful for Turin's Old Lady as they reached the Champions League semi-finals with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona on the horizon. Gianluigi Buffon was celebrated reaching the Champions League semi-finals, 12 years after final heartbreak . Juventus' players salute their supporters after the final whistle in Monaco having made it to the last four . Juve have endured a tough few years but they are now back were they belong among the elite of Europe . The 12-year gap between now and that night at Old Trafford has been one of twists and turns: relegations, promotions, league titles, stripped league titles and European failure at the hands of relative minnows like Fulham and Bordeaux. Captain Gianluigi Buffon said on Wednesday: 'I thought I'd have to wait less when I was at this stage 12 years ago, but seeing the journey was very difficult, we can enjoy this result even more. 'We knew it was a great opportunity and after 12 years we wanted to honour the history of Juve.' Even this season, Bianconeri supporters thought they were as good as out of this tournament as early as late October. A shock defeat by Olympiacos in Athens had them on the brink of exit before they scrambled to a runner-up spot in Group A behind Atletico Madrid. Then Borussia Dortmund gave them a mighty scare in the last-16 before the narrow win over Monaco. Andriy Shevchenko sent Buffon the wrong way with the winning penalty in the Old Trafford final on 2003 . The Juventus players, including Alessandro Del Piero (centre) reflect on their defeat in the showpiece final . Back in 2010, Juventus were downed by Fulham in the Europa League, a side now in the Championship . Pajtim Kasami celebrates after leaving Juve on the brink of exit back in October, but they made it through . Looking back, their group-stage progression is not too dissimilar to the club's fortunes over the last decade. After finishing third in Serie A the season after the 2003 final, Juventus came back to win the league twice in a row - only to be stripped of them both amid Italy's match-fixing scandal that sent them into the second division. On promotion, they took four further years to reach the summit of Italy's top tier once again but piece-by-piece, the nation's most successful side has rebuilt. That hasn't come easy, particularly with their domestic division being overtaken by England's Barclays Premier League, Spain's La Liga and the German Bundesliga. Talent is hard to tempt to Italy - as shown by the failings of AC Milan, Inter Milan, Lazio and Roma. And when the talent does come, it is usually picked off by the big boys from abroad. The Italian champions were relegated to Serie B amid Italy's matchfixing scandal but soon rose back up . Juventus celebrate their second consecutive Serie A title last season, and they are on track for a fourth now . But not at Juventus. The side celebrating on the Stade Louis II pitch on Wednesday night included household names such as Buffon, Carlos Tevez and Arturo Vidal, while Paul Pogba - the most sought-after talent in Europe - is on his way back from injury. He could even be ready for the semi-finals, something any opponent would dread. They haven't conceded in their last three Champions League games - a hallmark of any great Italian side - and their comfortable domestic lead gives them all the time in the world to prepare for their final two or three matches in the competition. Buffon and Carlos Tevez hug on the pitch of the Stade Louis II, and they both have a point to prove . Arturo Vidal is one of the most sought-after midfielders in Europe but he has stuck with Juve until now . Paul Pogba could be back in time for their semi-final next month and will likely be a key player in any clash . Barca, Real and Bayern should beware: the oldest team left in it have a point to prove, and for some this could be their last shot at European glory. Tevez has been linked with a return to South America after nine years in Europe. Andrea Pirlo, Patrice Evra and Buffon are not far from the end of their careers, either. Combine that with the midfield prowess of Pogba and Claudio Marchisio, and the solid defence provided by Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci and they just might do it. Juve will be the team that everyone wants to draw but nobody will enjoy playing against. Roberto Pereyra, Andrea Pirlo, Tevez and  Fernando Llorente celebrate reaching Europe's final four . Pirlo, aged 35, might be facing his best chance of one last European title with the Bianconeri this season . Vidal had it about right after Wednesday's game when he said: 'I am not afraid of anyone. 'I think all four teams in the semi-finals have their qualities and on Friday we'll see who we face, but right now I think we're on a par with all of them. We play with our heads now and are a mature team, I'd say.' The European giants wearing the famous black and white stripes might finally have awoken.","Juventus reached semi-finals of the Champions League by beating Monaco .

"Those surprised at Yaya Toure's apparent desire to talk himself in to a transfer from Manchester City this week should not be. The Ivorian's CV tells the story of a player who has always placed pragmatism above sentiment when it comes to his choice of clubs. Toure, for example, left home as a teenager to play in the Belgian second division. Following that came some formative years playing for Metalurh Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. History also tells us that Toure, now almost 32, never stays in one place too long. Equally, though, Toure's rather clumsy statements of recent times should not be allowed to detract from his legacy at City and indeed in the Barclays Premier League. It looks likely Yaya Toure may leave Manchester City this summer but his legacy should be a positive one . Toure has struggled to impose himself upon games for City in the manner seen in previous seasons . Toure's time at City is defined as a success, bringing two Premier League titles to the Etihad . It looks extremely likely that he will leave England this summer. Toure has started to play and sound like an unhappy footballer, the social alliance he has formed with the Etihad's enfant terrible Samir Nasri hardly helping. If and when he does go, though, it is for his extraordinary contribution on the field – and not the unfortunate noise that has started to surround him - for which he should be remembered. At his club, Toure has been fundamental to City's transition from wealthy hopefuls to twice champions. Back in 2010, he arrived as a statement signing - a £24m fee and £1m a month – for a club determined to accelerate its own learning curve. It worked and, on a wider scale, he has simply been one of the most watchable footballers our league has ever seen in its modern form. I once asked a member of City's coaching staff if there was anybody quicker at the club than Micah Richards. He replied: 'Yes, Yaya. Not over the first few yards but when he gets going he is unstoppable. He's like a truck heading downhill without the brakes.' Premier League defenders would testify to that but there was always more to him. Toure possesses an intelligent football brain, the vision required of all top class central players and a sureness of touch. He has also had a demeanour that has allowed him the confidence to play just about anywhere on the field. This, remember, is a man who played as a central defender in a Champions League final against Manchester United. The first time he had ever played that position, he faced off with Cristiano Ronaldo as Barcelona won in Rome in 2009. 'We had a good team so it was not that hard for me that night,' Toure told this newspaper in December 2011. Toure (right) demonstrated his versatily by shackling Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2009 Champions League final . Midfield player Toure (left) signed for City for a fee of £24million from Barcelona in 2010 . Mark Hughes, the then City boss, begun a plan to sign Kolo Toure in an attempt to entice Yaya along . In that same interview, Toure admitted that he liked to listen to Whitney Houston in his car on the way to training. 'That other music makes my head hurt,' he laughed. A detail that had been leaked rather mischievously by his brother Kolo, it pointed to a relationship that went straight to the heart of Toure's presence at the Etihad Stadium. Though he didn't arrive at City until five summers ago, City's pursuit of Toure had actually started eighteen months earlier in the January window of 2009. Stunned by a home FA Cup defeat to Nottingham Forest, City's then manager Mark Hughes presented the club's board with a list of transfer targets. Toure, then in his Barcelona pomp, was on it and so, cleverly, was his brother. The plan was straight forward. Sign Kolo and maybe Yaya would follow. The two brothers – as close as could be – had always wanted to play together domestically and Kolo's subsequent recruitment from Arsenal in the summer of 2009 was the trigger for the arrival of Yaya a year later. Sadly for Hughes, sacked at Christmas later that year, he wasn't around to see his plan come together. Nevertheless, Yaya's arrival remains one of the pivotal moments in the development of the modern Manchester City. The plan worked, with both Ivory Coast players gradually signing, but Hughes had been sacked by then . Toure (left) is a quiet figure away from the field and refuted reports of a fall-out with Mario Balotelli . Toure (centre) led City to the Premier League title 2012 and inspired an important victory at Newcastle . Away from the field, the lumbering Toure has always been a relatively gentle soul. When he ordered a 50inch TV from a store in South Manchester soon after his arrival in the area, he was immediately told by wife Gineba to return it. It was simply too big – she said – which was interesting given that on the same day she had taken delivery of a dressing table with Swarovski diamonds embedded in the drawer handles. When, in April 2012, Toure was accused in print of arguing with Mario Balotelli during half-time of a game against Sunderland he invited Sportsmail to talk to him. 'I love Mario,' he said. 'I am going to take him on holiday to Africa.' That trip never took place but on the field Toure fulfilled the promises he made when he arrived. A winning goal in an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United in 2011 was followed by another, against Stoke City, in the final. City were up and running and when Toure scored from 30 yards at Newcastle a year later, a first Premier League title was on its way. For a while, he was almost unstoppable. Toure (left) also led City to FA Cup glory in 2011 with a decisive goal against United in the semi-final . Toure also scored City's winning goal against Stoke City in the FA Cup final in 2011 . Toure delivered the trophies that he was brought in to do and will be missed at City when he departs . This season, Toure has not been at his best. He has, at times, looked his age. His manager Manuel Pellegrini hasn't always helped by asking him to play as part of a holding two in midfield when it has been apparent for a while that he is now most effective as a modern day number ten, free of defensive obligations. City still win lots of games when Toure starts, though. They will miss him when he goes. The footprints he leaves behind will be deep ones.","Yaya Toure arrived at Manchester City in 2010 from Barcelona .

"Children should not be encouraged to play rugby at school because it is so dangerous, researchers have warned. They say as many as 1 in 8 will suffer injuries serious enough that they will need to miss at least seven training sessions or matches. These range from bruises and sprains to fractures, torn ligaments and at worst, concussion and damage to the brain and spinal cord. Scroll down for video . As many as 1 in 8 will suffer injuries serious enough that they will need to miss at least seven training sessions or matches. The Government wants rugby to be played more at school as part of plans to increase competitive sports, to curb rising levels of obesity. But Professor Allyson Pollock, an expert in Public Health at Queen Mary, University of London said these plans were ‘extremely worrying.’ The academic – whose son shattered his cheekbone playing rugby at school – said not enough was being done to monitor the number of injuries. Writing in the BMJ, she said the Government had a ‘duty to protect children from the risks of injury’ as part of a law enshrined by the United Nations. ‘Given that children are more susceptible to injuries such as concussion and often take longer to recover fully, the Government’s plan to increase funding of and participation in rugby in schools in the absence of a comprehensive system for injury surveillance and prevention is worrying.’ She added. ‘Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short and long term effects of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known. ‘Many countries, including the UK, have inadequate child injury surveillance systems. Under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child governments have a duty to protect children from risks of injury. Professor Allyson Pollock wants to see rugby made safer for children, with an end to scrums and tackles — where nearly all the injuries occur . ‘The UK government should ensure the safety and effectiveness of sports and that injury surveillance and prevention strategies are established before proceeding with its plans to target funding and increase participation in a high risk collision sport such as rugby.’ In New Zealand, the current holders of the Rugby World Cup, sports authorities monitor the number of rugby injuries compares to the population making it possible to work out how risky it is compared to other sports. She also pointed out that other countries such as New Zealand monitor the number of rugby injuries compares to the population. This makes it possible to work out how risky it is compared to other sports. Currently, rugby is mainly played at independent schools rather than state schools where the dominant sport for boys is football. But in 2012 the Government pledged to increase both girls’ and boys’ participation in rugby at school as part of a drive to boost competitive sports. Professor Pollock’s son Hugo suffered a shattered cheekbone playing rugby at school 11 years ago, when he was 14. In an article for the Mail, published in September, she described how his ‘face looked distorted’ and his ‘eye socket was hanging down’ She said: ‘I’m not calling for a ban on rugby at school. I’m calling for parents to be given information so they know the risks, and I want to see rugby made safer for children, with an end to scrums and tackles — where nearly all the injuries occur. ‘I’d like school rugby to become touch rugby, instead of contact rugby. All injuries should be recorded, and none should be acceptable or seen as ‘an act of God’. ‘Most of all, children should be safe at school.’ The Rugby Football Union – the professional body – has clear rules for school children and they are not allowed to tackle or form scrums until the age of ten. Even then, tackles are minimal and the referee will blow the whistle as soon as the player is brought to the ground. And a maximum of between three and five players from each team can take part in scrums – where they interlock over the ball – depending on their age. Currently, rugby is mainly played at independent schools rather than state schools where the dominant sport for boys is football . Children under 10 play touch rugby where they have to pass the ball to the other side as soon as an opponent makes contact with any part of their body. A spokesman for the RFU said: ‘We take player safety extremely seriously and this is at the core of all the training we deliver to coaches, referees and medics, at all levels of the game.‘We believe that rugby is a fantastic sport for children, and the physical and social benefits massively outweigh any potential drawbacks. ‘Among the many benefits rugby brings for children is an increase in confidence, self-esteem and self-discipline, as well as getting enjoyable physical exercise while working as part of a team, learning skills which help them in the wider world. ‘Teachers frequently comment on notable off pitch improvements when the sport is introduced in their schools.’","Injuries sustained in rugby can range from bruises to spinal cord damage .

"From blasting aliens and escaping charging warlocks to bluffing on poker sites, online gaming can be intense. Now there’s a mouse designed to let geeks continue their gaming adventures without working up a sweat – on their hands at least. A mouse called Ventus X has a built-in honeycomb grill to let the skin breathe and a rugged coating so sweaty gamers can continue to the accessory. No sweat: Now there’s a mouse designed to let geeks continue their gaming adventures without working up a sweat – on their hands at least. The Venus X (pictured) has a built-in honeycomb grill to let the skin breathe and a rugged coating so sweaty gamers can continue to the accessory . The mouse provides ‘enhanced modern technology and classic design that fits all gamers and bring style to gaming,’ according to the Taiwan-based firm that makes it. Some realistic combat and multiplayer games tap into the body’s flight or fight response, causing adrenaline to surge through gamers’ bodies and prepare the body for physical activity. While clicking violently may not qualify as a work out, gamers can get sweaty, and this can make their mouse slippery. Game on: Some realistic combat and multiplayer games tap into the body’s flight or fight response, causing adrenaline to surge through gamers’ bodies and prepare the body for physical activity, by sweating for example. Here,  gamer in Burma concentrates hard on a game of World of Warcraft . Instead of fitting a miniature fan like some of its rivals, ThermalTake, which produces cooling kit for computers, has designed a mouse with a matte coating or rough texture and rubber grips down its side (pictured) Instead of fitting a miniature fan like some of its rivals, Taiwan-based ThermalTake, which produces cooling kit for computers, has designed a mouse with a matte coating or rough texture and rubber grips down its side. ‘The new VENTUS X was designed with a new coating that gives full comfort while in gameplay,’ it says. This means that the tool retains its grip in the sweatiest situations, while ventilation is provided by a honeycomb grill where the hand rests on the mouse. The grille’s meant to help because sweat can evaporate faster than on a solid surface, when a user raises their hand or withdraws it, letting air to the area. Like many mice designed for serious gamers, it has a laser sensor so that sensitivity can be turned up high and programmable buttons. It costs $50 (£34) via gaming hardware websites. The grips mean that the tool doesn't get slippery in the sweatiest situations, while ventilation is provided by a honeycomb grill (pictured) where the hand rests on the mouse . A video game fan coughed up blood and dropped dead in a Chinese internet cafe last month after playing World Of Warcraft for 19 consecutive hours without a break. Wu Tai, 24, went to the unnamed internet cafe in Shanghai to play the latest installment of the role-playing fantasy game alongside other fans of the popular series. CCTV footage shows him sitting in front of the computer and suddenly turning to his left to cough violently, before slumping in his chair and dying in front of shocked fellow gamers. Concerned onlookers called an ambulance for Mr Wu, who is understood to have continued playing the video game while waiting for the paramedics, despite clearly being seriously ill. Horrified fellow gamer Hsin Lo, 20, said: 'I called for an ambulance while my friend went to get some help from staff. But while we waited he just died in front of us, and was nothing for the staff to do,' Mr Hsin said. When medical crews arrived they tried to resuscitate Mr Wu but he was already dead.","Ventus X mouse has a non-slip coating and honeycomb grill .

"Anyone who has witnessed a game of hockey or netball might disagree, but men really are more competitive than women, according to a new study. Researchers have discovered that male athletes are more driven by the desire to beat the competition than female athletes. Sportswomen tend to be more committed to aspects of their lives outside sport - such as their academic studies - than their male counterparts, the researchers say. The researchers found that male 5,000 metre runners are more competitive than women. Great Britain's Mo Farah is pictured above running to victory in the European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland . This may explain why boys are often seen as being more competitive. However, the researchers say that there can be a great deal of individual variability with some women actually showing greater competitive drive than most male athletes. Many reasons have been suggested to explain why women remain poorly represented in senior positions at large companies. Now, a new study may shed light on workplace dynamics, by claiming that while men enjoy competition in the office, women like to be part of a team. The results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues’ ability than women and were therefore more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work, rather than that of a team’s. Researchers from CNRS-GATE in Lyon and the University of California, analysed the behaviour of both sexes when the study participants were asked to choose between being paid on their individual performance or as part of a team. They found that less than 11 per cent of men opted for team payment, in comparison to 44 per cent of women. These individuals tend to be far less common in women's sport, they said. The study could have implications for other areas outside sport, such as in the workplace where greater gender diversity could bring advantages. Professor Robert Deaner, a psychologist at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, said they studied elite runners because it is a sport that is equally popular among men and women and there is no disparity in prize money. He said: 'Of course, we need to be careful not to assume that our running results will generalise to all sports or all domains outside of sports. 'Nevertheless, our findings do echo those from other studies, which show that even when men and women hold the same selective jobs, men are more likely to prioritize competing for recognition and status, while women have more communal orientations.' The researchers, whose study is published in the journal PeerJ, assessed the competitiveness of 1,147 long distance runners competing in the 5,000 metres in the US National Collegiate Athletic Association. They surveyed each runners motivation for participating, their training volume and their desire to compete at an elite level after college. US tennis player John McEnroe (above) was notorious for letting his competitiveness get the better of him . The study found that male long distance runners, like Mo Farrah (left), are more competitive than women, but there are some women, like Paula Radcliffe on the right, who are arguably more competitive than the men . They also compared runners who were competing NCAA's Division 1, Division 2 and Division 3. The researchers found that men were far more competitive at all levels than female runners. The sex difference in competitiveness was also just as large in the fastest runners in Division 1 compared to the slower ones in Division 3. Professor Deaner said: 'By social science standards, the difference we found - men and women differing by about half a standard deviation on competitiveness measures - is moderate to large. 'But this kind of a difference still means that many of the female runners are more competitive than many of the male runners.' Writing in the journal the researchers added: 'Women did report greater commitment than men to their academic studies, suggesting a sex difference in priorities. 'Therefore, policies aiming to provide men and women with equal opportunities to flourish should acknowledge that sex differences in some kinds of preferences and motivation may persist even in selective sub-populations.' Serena Williams is known for her intensely competitive attitude, playing through injury and destroying raquets .","Scientists at Grand Valley State University, Michigan, studied elite runners .

"After the launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, several new owners complained that the slim aluminium phones bent out of shape after being placed in tight pockets. So to avoid another ‘bend gate,’ Apple is rumoured to be planning on using stronger materials to construct its next generation smartphone. The forthcoming phone could feature the same 7000 series aluminium as its forthcoming Apple Watch Sport edition, which is reportedly also used in competition bicycles. Scroll down for videos . And to avoid another ‘bend gate’ Apple is rumoured to be planning on using stronger materials to construct its next generation smartphone. This image shows a bent iPhone 6S . The material would make the next iPhone 60 per cent harder than the iPhone 6, Taiwan-based Economic Daily News reported. The metal is the same as that used to make professional sports bikes but has been altered by Apple to make it lighter, according to Cult of Mac. The forthcoming phone could feature the same 7000 series aluminium as its forthcoming Apple Watch Sport edition (pictured), which is reportedly also used in competition bicycles . The Apple Watch Sport has a lightweight anodised aluminium case. Apple used a new alloy of 7000 Series aluminium that's 60 per cent stronger than standard alloys. The same alloy is used to make racing bikes. The display is protected by strengthened Ion-X glass. Together, the materials make the Sport edition 30 per cent lighter than the other Apple Watch models. Apple polishes the aluminium used in its Sports watch then anodises it to using tint zirconia beads to create a hard and scratch-proof outer layer. ‘We believe this aluminium alloy sets a new standard both in the way it performs and the way it looks,’ Apple’s Senior Vice President of Design Jony Ive said previously. The next generation iPhones, which are expected to be called the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, are expected to be unveiled in September and may include a A9 chip and Force Touch Feature, which also features in the Apple Watch. It’s also possible that the Californian tech giant will release a four-inch version of the phone called the iPhone 6C. Days after the launch of the iPhone 6, owners revealed they can be bent out of shape when stowed in a pocket. The handset is made from a combination of 6000 series anodised aluminium and stainless steel with titanium inserts, Forbes reported. Apple polishes the aluminium used in its Sports watch then anodises it to using tint zirconia beads to create a hard and scratch-proof outer layer . Addressing ‘bend gate’ after the phone’s launch, Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said: 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus.' Tests showed that the phone bent out of shape under 100lbs of pressure - the same as the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. But accusations of unintentionally bendy handsets have dogged Apple since 2012, when some users claimed the iPhone 5 and later the iPhone 5S had a similar weakness. The reason for the bend is due to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus being made out of aluminium. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so, if enough pressure is applied, it will bend and move. According to iMore, no part of either of the new iPhones has more than a quarter of an inch (0.64cm) of aluminium in any spot. This means that, in areas of the phones that are weakest, it’s possible it could be susceptible to bending. This is noticeable in images, with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the SIM card slot. These areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and SIM card, so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend. To stop the phone bending, users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone. For example, do not have it sideways in a pocket, as your pocket will push it against your leg, possibly causing bending. Putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect, so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option. Another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied.","Rumours suggest Apple will used 7000 series aluminium in the next iPhone .

"Arsene Wenger rejoiced when Didier Drogba left Chelsea for Shanghai Shenhua in 2012, with the Ivorian striker departing England with a formidable scoring record of 13 goals in 14 games against Arsenal. 'I don’t know how much Chelsea miss him but we don't miss him,' Wenger said of the man who averages a goal every 78 minutes and 20 seconds against his team. 'He did a lot of damage against us in every game.' But he might have celebrated too soon. Didier Drogba has 15 goals in 15 games for Chelsea against Arsenal, averaging one every 78 minutes . Drogba's first goals against came in the 2005 Community Shield, scoring both as Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-1 . Three weeks later, Drogba scored again against Arsenal, this time securing a 1-0 win in the Premier League . Drogba (right) scored both goals as Chelsea came from behind against Arsenal to win the League Cup 2-1 . Drogba (right) beat Philippe Senderos to head in Chelsea's second goal and secure the League Cup . Now back at Chelsea, Drogba is expected to overcome a knock and return to The Emirates on Sunday with Wenger's disesteemed foe Jose Mourinho, looking to increase his  overall record of 15 goals in 15 games against Arsenal and obliterate the north-London side's fading hope of catching the Stamford Bridge outfit at the summit of the Premier League. Having originally signed for Chelsea in 2004 for a fee of £24million from Marseille, Drogba took time to forge his redoubtable status against Wenger, his first two appearances ending goalless. It was the 2005 Community Shield when he first put Arsenal to the sword, lashing two goals past Jens Lehmann in a 2-1 victory at the Millennium Stadium before scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory in the Premier League three weeks later. In 2007, Drogba overturned the one-goal advantage Arsenal had in the 2007 League Cup final through Theo Walcott with another brace, again in Wales. And Drogba's third double against Arsenal was in similar circumstances on March 23, 2008. Bacary Sagna gave The Gunners the lead before Drogba struck twice in nine minutes at Stamford Bridge. The 2009 FA Cup semi-final allowed Drogba to break Arsenal's hearts again with silverware in sight, this time at Wembley. Like the 2007 League Cup final, Walcott put Arsenal ahead but Florent Malouda equalised before Drogba won the cup tie with a goal in the 84th minute. In the next two encounters between the London sides, Drogba netted a double in each game to lead Chelsea to a 3-0 and 2-0 victory respectively. On October 3 2010, he opened the scoring as Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-0 at Stamford Bridge which was his last goal against Arsenal in Chelsea colours.

But Drogba is synonymous with Mourinho's Chelsea. Wenger has not beaten the Portuguese manager in 12 attempts and with Diego Costa and Loic Remy likely to be unavailable, Mourinho is seemingly faced with no choice but to unleash Drogba to ensure it's an unlucky 13th encounter for the Arsenal manager.","Didier Drogba has 15 goals against Arsenal for Chelsea and Galatasaray .

"US aviation authorities have launched an investigation to find out whether a plane dumped toilet paper and plastic objects all over a neighbourhood in a Pennsylvania town. Several properties were littered with debris that appeared to fall out of the sky over the town of West Pittston in Luzerne County on Monday morning. Residents believe the rubbish came from the lavatory holding tank of a plane flying overhead, and have complained to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Paula Viccica believes the debris that landed on her property was expelled from a plane flying overhead . The bulk of the debris landed in the well-kept front garden and trees at the home of Paula Viccica. She told the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Times Leader that she saw pieces of white paper fluttering down from the sky for several minutes. She told the newspaper that local airport officials identified four planes flying overhead around the time she made the discovery. While no human waste was discovered, her 13-year-old daughter, Tori, said there was an odour to the debris after it landed in the garden. The homeowner complained to aviation authorities and wants assurance that it does not pose a danger . Paula told the Times Leader: ‘Beyond aesthetics, I’m concerned with safety. I want our property to be cleaned up and assurance that it does not pose a danger to anyone.’ Other residents in the neighbourhood, about 115 miles north of Philadelphia, were surprised to learn about the discovery. Resident Michael Reiher told Newswatch 16: ‘That’s nuts. I mean, a plane drops stuff out of the sky and onto a yard? The FAA said lavatory waste is contained in a holding tank that can only be opened from the outside . ‘That’s crazy. I have never seen something like that before.’ On its website, the FAA said it investigates all reports, but pointed out that it is ‘very rare for anything to fall from an aircraft’. It said lavatory waste is contained in a holding tank until a plane lands, and the apparatus to access the tank is located on the exterior of the plane. The FAA said that it’s ‘physically impossible’ for a pilot to dump a tank while in flight, as it is opened with an exterior lever.","Debris landed on Paula Viccica's property in West Pittston, Pennsylvania .

"This incredible video shows the moment a world freediving champion jumped into the world’s second deepest underwater sink hole. The dramatic footage shows Guillame Néry standing at the edge before jumping in - all without scuba gear and simply holding his breath. And in the video he seemingly reaches the bottom of the 660ft (200 metes) hole before swimming back to the surface. French free diver jumped into Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas. Guillame Néry is seen at the edge before taking the plunge (shown). The hole is 660ft (200 metres) deep, although he doesn't go to the bottom. Free divers are able to hold their breath for more than 20 minutes . The video was filmed in 2010 by the Frenchman's girlfriend and fellow freediver Julie Gautier. It takes place at Dean’s Blue Hole in the Bahamas, the deepest so-called ‘blue hole’ in the world with an underwater entrance. In order to stay alive, the brain is constantly telling the body to breathe. If you don’t obey its primitive urges, carbon dioxide soon starts building up in the body, prompting an overwhelming desire to take a gulp of air. To fight that instinct, a competitive breath-holder has to work hard at expanding his lung capacity with a regular series of intensive breathing exercises. They practise ‘static apnoea’ once or twice a week, as well as ‘dynamic apnoea’ - holding breath while swimming - once in a while for fun, and also general fitness training. He also follows a diet high in fruit and vegetables, as well as broccoli, cauliflower and fish oil. However, Néry revealed a few years ago that he didn’t really reach the bottom of the hole - it’s just filmed that way for artistic reasons. But the video is still incredibly impressive, as he holds his breath for minutes on end. Freediving is a form of underwater diving where no scuba gear or breathing apparatus is used. To breathe for minutes, free divers go through sophisticated mind-body control techniques to push self-induced apnoea - the science of not breathing - to the limits. Some free divers can hold their breath for more than 20 minutes. Stig Severinsen, for example - nicknamed The Man Who Doesn't Breathe - is the holder of multiple records in diving using his 'State of Zen' technique to control his breathing. In October 2012, Mr Severinsen broke the record for the longest time breath held voluntarily by a male by spending 22 minutes with his head submerged in a pool in London. The dive took place in 2010 at Dean’s Blue Hole in the Bahamas (marked), the deepest so-called ‘blue hole’ in the world with an underwater entrance . The video was filmed back in 2010 by the French free diver’s girlfriend and fellow freediver Julie Gautier.It takes place at Dean’s Blue Hole in the Bahamas (shown), the deepest so-called ‘blue hole’ in the world with an underwater entrance .","French free diver  jumped into Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas .

"This is one safety video you won't be able to take your eyes off. A dramatic virtual environment has been created using a headset that shows how passengers would survive a plane crash landing on water. The short film has been developed on an Oculus Rift - a virtual reality headset - by Italy's University of Udine's HCI Lab. It is hoped the simulation can make people aware of the correct processes to follow for a landing on water . The video is based on an actual event when, on January 15, 2009, U.S. Airways Flight 1549 was forced into a landing on water. Following a series of bird strikes, both engines failed, and the Airbus A320, piloted by Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger was forced to land in the Hudson River. Incredibly of the 155 on board, only one person was hospitalised ovenight, and the incident became known as 'Miracle on the Hudson.' With the dramatic background music, this video could well prove to be much more effective than a safety notice and demonstration. The scene begins by the passenger being welcomed onto the plane by the flight attendant, before a gentle walk to locate the seat. The start of the virtual reality programme starts casual enough as the passenger moves to their seat . A large bang is heard on the simulation before the plane starts to rapidly descend . Once seated the film jolts into action when a loud bang is heard, and the plane rocks from side to side. As the plane descends quickly and abruptly, the user is told that the 'goal is to come out unharmed from the aircraft by following safe procedures.' The first thing to do is inflate the life jacket. What follows is a jog down the cabin and to the emergency exit, where the flight attendant is beckoning you out of the door and onto the evacuation slide. The video pans to the passenger reaching into the overhead lockers for their luggage . But doing this results in putting yourself in immense danger of drowning in the incoming water . There are cries, screams and shouting, just what you would expect from the real thing. A chilling scene then appears telling you to beware of making mistakes - in this instance it is wasting time grabbing luggage. This is shown when, after grabbing the luggage, the passenger is overcome with water - this actually forces the man who has taken the simulation on to remove the headset and puff his cheeks. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Luca Chittaro, head of the project, said: 'The 'Emergency Water Landing VR' demo we have just released for the Oculus Rift was developed in the last year, and is just one of a series of aviation safety education games we are developing for all possible technological platforms, not just the Oculus Rift. 'Airlines are already using video safety briefings on-board some aircrafts and they do not seem to engage passenger's attention any more than conventional briefings. Of the simulation video, he added: 'It's a personalized, experiential way of learning, more engaging than passively watching a video or a safety briefing or reading a safety card.' This user made it as far as the 'what happens if you reach for your baggage' before the water overpowering him made him remove the headset . And it produces measurable results. 'In the study of our virtual water landing experience, we had one group of people study a traditional airline safety card and another group playing the virtual reality game,' added Chittaro. 'After one week, people who had studied the safety card suffered a significant loss of knowledge, while passengers who had played the game fully retained the safety knowledge gained. 'Considering that 'Emergency Water Landing VR' is the world's first prototype of an airliner water landing and evacuation experience, we are satisfied with the result.'","Simulation available on Oculus Rift shows  plane crashing on water .

"The future of travel will be virtual. Never again will you need to board a plane to be able to take in the world's most breathtaking locales, at least if Facebook has anything to say about it. In a recent Q&A on the social media site, CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, opened up about the future of travel and how virtual reality will play a key role. According to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, the future of travel lies in sharing virtual reality environments . 'It will be pretty wild,' Zuckerberg replied to a follower online, according to arynews.tv. 'Just like we capture photos and videos today and then share them on the Internet to let others experience them too, we'll be able to capture whole 3D scenes and create new environments and then share those with people as well.' Zuckerberg's views of the future of virtual travel are perhaps unsurprising, considering that the social media giant purchased virtual reality headset maker, Oculus, last year. And at a conference in San Francisco last month, Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, promised that virtual reality gaming would be coming 'this year.' Never again will you need to endure a long-haul flight to take in some of Thailand's best beaches . Thanks to the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, users will be able to see the world from multiple viewpoints . Facebook also announced plans to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed, meaning that users will be able to put on a VR headset and explore a location of their choosing. These videos are expected to be filmed with multiple cameras, so users will be able to change their viewpoints, allowing for even more in-depth exploration. Described as a 'first step,' it's also believed that even more immersive videos are on the horizon, including those which will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that straps over your eyes. 'VR is more than just another platform, it can create a whole range of human experiences,' said Michael Abrash, the Chief Scientist at Oculus. The Facebook founder isn't the first to predict virtual reality as the future of travel. Marriott hotels have already trialled Oculus Rift on a tour of hotels across America, allowing guests to sample different holiday destinations.","In recent Facebook Q&A, Zuckerberg discussed the future of travel .

"It can’t receive phone calls, track your exercise or let you send messages, but an old watch made by Apple is on sale via eBay for more than the brand’s latest offering. An analogue promotional watch from Apple with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a ‘buy it now’ price of $2,499.99 (£1,707.47) plus postage. For the same price as the 1997 timepiece, Apple fans could pre-order five of the cheapest Apple Watch Sport, which cost £299 in the UK and still have some change. An analogue promotional watch from Apple (pictured) with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a ‘buy it now’ price of $2,499.99 (£1,707.47) plus postage . However, it is still cheaper than the Apple Watch Edition, which costs upwards of £8,000 ($10,000). The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was made by Quartz and released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item’. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote on their eBay page. ‘A new battery has been installed and the watch is new, never used or worn.’ It is still in its original box and the seller claims to have two to offload, with 10 days to go. The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item. This image shows the listing on the auction website . Unlike Apple’s new Watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. Three versions of Apple's watch (pictured) are available to pre-order online and almost one million orders are thought to have been taken in the US on the first day alone . 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' Unlike Apple’s new smart watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. The International Business Times reported that the watch is almost 50 times more valuable – according to its seller – than it was a year ago, thanks to the launch of the new Apple Watch. It’s not known how many of the vintage watches Apple had made at the time, or how many still exist, but one sold on eBay in Match last year for $54 (£37). At the time of writing, two more of the watch model are listed online for $1,000 (£679) and $750 (£510), but neither have fetched that amount of money, suggesting sellers may just be trying their luck. It's thought that Apple sold almost one million Apple Watches in the US alone on the first day that the device could be pre-ordered. It goes on sale in shops in nine countries on April 24. Apple has not confirmed any sales figures, but Tim Cook, interviewed on cable television channel CNBC, said initial orders were 'great.' Slice Intelligence measured digital commerce by tracking consumer receipts to come up with its number of 957,000 American shoppers ordering Apple Watches on the first day that they could do so. Those ordering an Apple Watch Sport, the cheapest version, spent $382.83 per watch and those ordering the Apple Watch spent $707.04. 'As expected, most consumers – 62 percent – purchased the less-expensive Sport model,' said Jaimee Minney of Slice. The data also showed that most consumers opted for the larger 42 mm case. Apple predicted on Thursday that demand would exceed supply at product launch. Soon after online pre-orders opened on Friday, Apple's website listed shipping times in June for some models of the watch and four to six weeks for others. There was immediately brisk bidding on eBay for confirmed orders for watches, with hundreds of sellers looking to make a few hundred or even thousand dollars by passing on their watches, once received. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote.

"Point of view footage captured the terrifying moment a skier became caught up in an avalanche. Skiing with a friend in Revelstoke, Canada, Zach Birnie stands at the top of a mountain and films the surrounding scenery with a camera mounted to his helmet. After exhaling air, he begins to make his descent of the off-piste section of slope in a rather slow and cautious manner. Skiing off to the right, the man makes a controlled turn and begins heading back across the mountain – thick snow can be seen burying his skis. Suddenly he begins panic and while not entirely visible to the camera, a minor avalanche occurs behind him. Panicking, the man attempts to come to a stop, but the heavy snow continues to push him down the mountain. Zach Birnie stands at the top of a mountain with a friend and films the surrounding scenery with a camera mounted to his helmet . He begins shouting, which he later explains alongside the original upload of the video, was his way of making sure his friend knew what was happening. Suddenly the skier can be seen falling to the floor as heavy snow closes in around him and in a matter of moments he is completely submerged. What follows is hazy footage of a terrifying scuffle as the skier attempts to find the surface of the snow. Before too long the skier re-emerges – panting in shock as he catches his breath. The man begins skiing off to the right before making a controlled turn and heading back across the mountain . Suddenly the skier can be seen falling to the floor as heavy snow from the off-piste slope closes in around him . The skier, who was lucky to escape serious injury, later discussed the incident online. He wrote: ‘[I] pulled my shoulder slightly, lost a pole, best, worst case scenario for sure.’ Discussing the incident, Cornelia Accola from the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF spoke to MailOnline. She stated that while it is not easy to see why the avalanche occurred from the video, the amount of fresh snow and steep terrain could be to blame. In a matter of moments the skier, who shouts for his friend's assistance, is entirely trapped beneath the snow . Re-emerging not too long after disappearing, the skier pants in shock as he attempts to get his breath back . She also gave advice on what to do should you find yourself in a similar situations. 'If you are caught in such an avalanche then try to escape out of the avalanche area,' said Ms Accola. Let go of your ski poles, try to open your bindings, (rarely possible) pull your knees toward your chest and hold your arms in front of your face.'","Zach Birnie films his descent of mountain with a helmet-mounted camera .

"Sweden’s passport has been named the most powerful in the world, but it turns out it’s also one of the most highly sought-after travel documents on the black market. The latest research suggests Swedish passports are among the most frequently sold in underground trading, as there is no upper limit on the number of replacements available to the rightful holder. They can sell for as much as £6,000 each – far more than the £28 fee that Sweden’s government charges for new or renewed travel documents. Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . The findings are contained in a new GoEuro infographic which ranks the world’s most powerful passports and takes a look at quirky facts . When placed under an ultraviolet light a Canadian passport displays colourful images on its pages, including the Parliament building in Ottawa. The Finnish passport displays a walking moose when the pages are flipped, while the cover of Belgium’s passports offer three different sequences of languages, starting with Dutch, French or German. Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just £9, while Turkey has the most expensive at £166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries – the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US – but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just £28 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn’t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world – behind Sweden, Finland and Germany – with a fee of £73. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's £33 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport. In a recent poll 20 per cent of those surveyed said they would choose a UK passport if they could get an extra nationality in addition to their own, even though it is one of the most expensive in the world. It was followed by passports for the US (18 per cent), Switzerland (17 per cent), Germany (10 per cent) and Canada and Australia with nine per cent each.","A British passport allows for visa-free access to 174 countries .

"England's withdrawal from the historic Victory Shield for Under 16s has further worsened relations between the FA and the other home nations. Officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were unhappy to find out about the FA ditching a tournament that started in 1925 via a letter from chairman Greg Dyke, with no warning or consultation. This is seen as another example of FA ‘arrogance’ following the English telling FIFA that they want to send Great Britain football teams to the Rio Olympics without informing the other countries, who put the kybosh on the initiative. England's Riess Nelson (right) puts pressure on Scotland's Jack Adamson during the 2014 Victory Shield . England's withdrawal from the event, as told by FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), left the home nations fuming . And England’s desire to have more varied opposition for their Under 16 players is not going down well in Wales, the current holders of the Victory Shield. The FA say they have kept the tournament organisers in the loop and only revised their plans after Sky Sports cut their title sponsorship - which the TV station dispute - and wanted changes to the format. The remaining Victory Shield competitors are planning to invite another country from Europe to replace England. Meanwhile, there was some surprise that Dyke chose to go to the Premier League Under 21 cup final between Southampton and Blackburn last Monday rather than the FA Youth Cup final first leg between Manchester City and Chelsea at the Etihad academy.

On Tuesday, SpaceX came incredibly close to landing its Falcon 9 rocket booster on a barge in the middle of the Atlantic. Now, leaked footage reveals just how close Elon Musk's firm came to success, with a close-up view of the daring attempt shot on a GoPro camera . A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster caused by a gust of wind. The video, which appeared on Reddit, reveals how the rocket overcompensates for its extreme tilt. A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve designed to control the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster. Earlier this week SpaceX has released its own dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic. The video, taken from a plane , shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before exploding on impact. The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' The unverified video shows the rocket drifting into view in slow motion and floating onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over . Pictured is the moment of impact.  A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough . Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies today arrived at the ISS. The rocket was was due to take off on Monday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. The video, taken from a plane on Tuesday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side . On board the Dragon capsule was an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. 'We're very, very happy to have it here,' Cristoforetti radioed to mission controllers in Houston today. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. The booster managed to land on the barge but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment arrived today . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed second landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. While the booster landing didn't go to plane, the launch was successful. It took place at 4.10 ET from Florida under perfect conditions, after a attempt had to be scrubbed on Monday due to lightning .","On Tuesday, SpaceX made a third attempt to land booster on a barge .

"Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat has insisted it was not a difficult decision to include Adam Johnson in his squad for Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Stoke. Advocaat has confirmed the 27-year-old midfielder, who was charged with three offences of sexual activity with a child under 16 and one of grooming on Thursday, remains available for selection with the club reviewing the situation. For the time being at least, the Black Cats' position remains unchanged, and that means Johnson, who has been used as a substitute in the last three games, can play on as Sunderland battle relegation. Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station on Thursday after being charged . Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station on Thursday after learning of the charges against him . The 27-year-old has not been suspended by his club Sunderland despite the charges . Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat will not bow to pressure by dropping Johnson despite his charges . Asked if it was a difficult situation for a coach, Advocaat replied: 'No, because the club made a statement about it and I stay behind that, and we will wait and see what the future will bring. 'He still has to come in, but in principle if he feels okay, then he will be a member of the squad. If he's in the squad, then I will consider him for selection, otherwise he would not be in the squad.' Johnson has already been the target of unsavoury chants from fans of rival clubs, but Advocaat is confident that will not be an issue during the final weeks of the season. He said: 'No, I don't think so.' Advocaat's comments came after Sunderland released a statement outlining their position on the matter. It said: 'Following yesterday's statement from Durham Constabulary, the club recognises that the formal legal process must take its course and whilst our position remains unchanged, we will keep the matter under review. The club will not be making any further comment.' Johnson is due to appear at Peterlee Magistrates' Court on May 20 - the Black Cats face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium that evening - but in theory, should be available to play in the other five games Sunderland have in which to preserve their top-flight status. Advocaat's side currently sit 16th in the table, but just a point clear of the bottom three, and he has set them a target of at least six points to avoid the drop. Johnson will now appear at Peterlee Magistrates Court on May 20 - the same day Sunderland face Arsenal . Advocaat gives instructions to Sunderland winger Johnson during a Premier League match in March . In the circumstances, he needs all the players he can get, and especially a man who cost £10million when he arrived from Manchester City during the summer of 2012. Johnson's continued presence could prove all the more important after the Dutchman revealed that striker Steven Fletcher travelled to London on Friday to consult a specialist over a troublesome ankle injury. He returned to training under new boss Dick Advocaat and has featured as a substitute in their last three matches, including the 1-0 Tyne-Wear derby victory over Newcastle. Johnson stands accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are said to have taken place between December 30 last year and February 26. He has also been charged with meeting a child following sexual grooming under Section 15 of the same Act. Gerry Wareham, CPS Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North East, said he believes there is a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest for Johnson to be charged. The England international (right) was wearing a black tracksuit as he attended the hearing on Thursday .

"Sergio Ramos was the first man Carlo Ancelotti embraced at the final whistle of Real Madrid’s dramatic Champions League win over Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Asked after the game when it was that he had decided to move the defender forward into midfield to cover the absence of Luka Modric, he replied: ‘The minute after I found out Modric was injured’. The two kept it between themselves and it worked on the night. Ramos is one of those players for whom the old Liverpool song about Jamie Carragher ‘We all dream of a team of Carraghers’ would be appropriate. He could play in every single position on the pitch. Sergio Ramos (left) celebrates with Javier Hernandez (centre) and Pepe after Real's winning goal . Ramos gees up the crowd during another all-action display at the Santiago Bernabeu for Real Madrid . It was a fiery Madrid derby on Wednesday night, but Ramos (left) once again proved his worth to Real . He often fools around in goal at Spain training. He started his Real Madrid career as a right back and won the European Championship there for his country. He has filled in at left-back, can play across the midfield and actually started his youth football career as striker. Had he been born British he would probably have grown up as a box-to-box midfielder. In Spain midfielders who have pace and can head and tackle often end up at centre-back and that is where he has settled. On Wednesday when his team needed him he was pitched into midfield and he let no-one down. And that’s the thing about Ramos. He very rarely lets anyone down. He is Real Madrid’s Carles Puyol – the all-action hero who rises above everyone else in in the penalty area in the Champions League final and heads in a corner that equalises Atletico Madrid’s 1-0 lead in injury time, allowing Real to play out extra-time and score three more to lift the trophy. Ramos heads away from his own penalty area, but spent most of the game marshalling the midfield . The makeshift midfielder holds off Atletico Madrid's Koke during a superb display in the middle of the park . And when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against Bayern Munich in 2010 in the Champions League semi-final when he sent his kick – at least as far as Twitter was concerned – into outer space, he has the guts to take another one in the European Championship final a couple of months later, and not only score but dink it Panenka style over the keeper’s dive. He has been mocked in the past for his Colemanballs comments that usually amount to declaring himself ‘happy with the three points’ after a cup game or ‘looking forward to the second leg’ after a league game, but even those who have in the past mocked him have come to admire him. It always seemed that even Jose Mourinho during his fall-out with Iker Casillas could never really properly fall out with Casillas' ally Ramos because there was too much about him that he admired. Ramos too, while ultimately siding with Spain team-mate Casillas, always saw the worth of a bold and proactive manager. The Spanish centre-back celebrates his crucial, last-minute goal in last year's Champions League final . Ramos has shown character to bounce back from his errors, as his penalty for Spain in 2012 showed . His supporters believe he stands for a dignity that many feel is disappearing from the game. ‘I like managers to be nice guys but I also like them to have balls’ he said of Ancelotti’s decision to play him out of his usual position against Atletico. ‘We would both have never heard the end of it had we been knocked out’ he said after that 1-0 win with him deployed to win aerial duels with Mario Mandzukic who Ancelotti had noted dropped back into midfield to get on the end of Atletico keeper Jan Oblak’s drop kicks. Real now have nine games left if they reach the Champions League final. Ramos will play in all of them no doubt. He may even cover for Modric again with the midfielder not back for another five weeks; he will play as an auxiliary striker if Real Madrid need a late goal, and he’ll go in goal if the emergency presents itself. Someone really should teach Real Madrid supporters that song: ‘We all dream of a team of Sergios’","Sergio Ramos was superb in midfield during win over Atletico Madrid .

"Iker Casillas insists he will stay at Real Madrid even if David de Gea arrives to displace him as first choice keeper at the Bernabeu. The Spain international has spent his entire career at the Bernabeu but has come under increasing criticism in recent seasons, while Manchester United No 1 De Gea has been linked with a summer return to his homeland. However, the 33-year-old claims he is willing to fight for the jersey he went on to make his own after breaking in to the side as a 16-year-old in 1996 - before becoming the youngest Champions League keeper in 2000. Iker Casillas claims he will stay and fight for the No 1 jersey rather than leave Real Madrid in the summer . The Spanish keeper (left) has been at the Bernabeu since breaking into the team as a 16-year-old . The Spanish giants have repeatedly linked to a move for Manchester United's David de Gea . 'I hope to fulfil my contract and a commitment that is signed has to be signed until the end,' he told AS. 'But I have to earn it and train myself for it. I will strive and I will fight for the position. 'Now I am at an age at which things are seen in a different way, so if I am not the starter, I will have a commitment with the younger ones. 'Why wouldn't I continue at Madrid if I am not the starting goalkeeper?' Before the end of the season Casillas is determined concentrate on helping Real Madrid defend their Champions League title, having reached the semi-finals with a 1-0 aggregate victory over local rivals Atletico Madrid on Wednesday.

The glamour last four also comprises arch rivals Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus, although the Spaniard insists there is little to choose between  the sides.

"The parents of a sweet six-year-old are using adorable videos of their daughter dancing to help raise awareness about her rare disorder - and the moving and grooving clips have quickly turned the youngster into an online star. Audrey Nethery, from Kentucky, has Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a life-threatening bone marrow condition that impacts her body's ability to circulate oxygen. Since Audrey is unable to produce enough red blood cells, her parents told the Mirror, she has faced a host of health issues in her short life. But the condition doesn't stop Audrey from dancing, which she does incredibly well to Bruno Mars’ chart-topping hit Uptown Funk in a widely-watched video that her family posted on her Facebook page.

She was also born with a hole in her heart and a cleft palate, and she isn't growing as fast as her peers, partly because of the steroids she needs to take for her illness. But despite her hurdles, her father Scott told Daily Mail Online, she has plenty of energy and a positive outlook: 'Audrey is a happy, loving, smart, little girl who loves to dance, listen to music, and collect dolls and stuffed animals.

"The last two weeks have showcased all that is best about Lewis Hamilton. He has driven supremely well, gaining the congratulations of the man he hopes to emulate as a triple world champion, Sir Jackie Stewart. But seeing the two men on the podium – one as the winner of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the other conducting the post-race interviews – was a reminder of what differentiates them as individuals as well as what binds them together as exceptional grand prix drivers. Hamilton could do considerably worse than learn a few things from and about Sir Jackie. Lewis Hamilton is interviewed by three-time world champion Sir Jackie Stewart after the Bahrain Grand Prix . Hamilton crosses the line in Bahrain ahead of Kimi Raikkonen to claim his third win from four races this term . Lewis probably will not want to hear it, judging by how he has previously dismissed Stewart’s opinions, honestly given when sought as a pundit who speaks with all the authority of the most successful British Formula One driver in history. Hamilton said grouchily, that he was disappointed ex-drivers were not being more supportive, as if blind adoration was his birthright. Here are just a few reasons why Hamilton should listen to Sir Jackie. He drove in an era when a driver racing for five years had a two in three chance of dying. He changed that through tireless campaigning for safety measures to save not only drivers but spectators from preventable injuries. And then there is his charitable work for a children’s club in the east end of London, for mechanics fallen on hard times, and dyslexia societies. There is also his considerable contribution to British industry over more than 40 years. A perfectionist, he will quietly remove a hair of your lapel as he speaks to you. He is not without ego, but conducts himself with decorum. The 30-year-old Briton celebrates his second straight win in Bahrain to extend his lead in the championship . Hamilton finished ahead of Raikkonen (centre) and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in the Gulf Kingdom . I wish Hamilton could show a little bit humility towards the past. That he could see that Formula One history did not start with Ayrton Senna. If he could start to appreciate some of the wider picture he might find himself more widely liked. He might not spray champagne into the face of a girl on the podium as he did in China last week – hardly a hanging offence but, given that she could not respond, an inconsiderate act and an ungallant one. He might not gracelessly sulk, as he did most memorably at Monaco last year to Stewart’s stated chagrin, when he is beaten. He might not be as surly as he can be at press conferences. He might not turn up rudely late to engineering meetings. He might not shun advice freely given by greats of his sport who speak candidly and without malice. Bernie snaps up PR veteran . Bernie Ecclestone is hiring a public relations veteran to help promote Formula One, I can reveal. Norman Howell, a former journalist with the Sunday Times, is expected to return to the job he held a decade ago. Since then Howell’s groaning CV includes spells as publisher of the satirical paddock newspaper Red Bulletin, director of communications at the FIA and, briefly, spokesman for the European division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The FIA under the ultra-shy Jean Todt gave the cultured Howell little freedom to work. It remains to be seen how Ecclestone, a one-man quotes machine, will deploy Howell. F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone is pictured speaking to Nico Rosberg ahead of Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix . Rajab charged with 'false' claims . The usual, tedious political narrative accompanied the Bahrain Grand Prix. A starring role is always given to Nabeel Rajab. He is blithely hailed in many sections of the media as a human rights campaigner. The complaint is that he has been wrongly arrested by the Bahraini authorities, who are suppressing freedom of speech. But it is worth recording that he has been charged with falsely (according to the government) accusing coalition forces in Yemen – including Bahrain – of promoting ethnic cleansing by targeting women, children and religious structures. He passed off these claims with photographs that were not from Yemen at all, but of dead children in Gaza and a dead baby in Syria, both from last year. I say this to show that neither side in this complex country – not least the feted Rajab, an unlawful activist, who is trying to overthrow the government – has a monopoly on morality.","Lewis Hamilton roared to victory in Bahrain to extend his lead in title race .

"The wife of LA Angels player Josh Hamilton has revealed she was 'blindsided' by his decision to file for divorce and insists she has never been unfaithful. Real Housewives of Orange County star Katie said there was no 'big fight or blow up' which caused their marriage to end. Speaking to TMZ Sports she said 'nothing sparked it' and slammed reports she cheated on the slugger as 'entirely false'. 'I've always stood by him and I'll always stand by him,' she added. 'I support and love him now and down the road.' Hamilton filed for divorce from his wife two months ago - around the same time he admitted to an alcohol and drugs relapse, it has emerged. Scroll down for video . Split: Real Housewives of Orange County star Katie said there was no 'big fight or blow up' which caused her marriage to LA Angel Josh Hamilton to end. The filing comes after his self-reported relapse and just months after they celebrated 10 years together (pictured) 'She's my girl': Hamilton posted this image on Twitter alongside the message. Katie has insisted she will always lo . Loved up: When he shared the above photo in November, he gushed about how much he loved his wife . The divorce petition was filed in late February in Tarrant County, Texas, where Hamilton played five seasons with the Texas Rangers before moving to LA, the Dallas Morning News reported. Hamilton, 33, married his wife Katie in 2004. Katie, who will appear on the 10th season of The Real Housewives of Orange County when it airs this summer, has a daughter from a previous relationship and three more daughters with Hamilton. The petition doesn't detail the reasons for the split and only cites 'conflict'. In the petition, Hamilton outlined 34 requests. Among them, he called for his wife to be banned from using his Maserati and 1972 Chevrolet Blazer, the Dallas Morning News reported. He also requested she be prohibited from 'hiding' the children from him, from allowing men to stay the night while his children are home, and from making disparaging remarks about him or his family. But in March, Mrs Hamilton submitted a general denial to her husband's petition and this month, the couple agreed not to communicate with each other throughout the case. Hamilton is not allowed to see his children without supervision, according to court records. He is also banned from going to the couple's properties in Westlake Texas; Newport Coast, California; and Valley Mills, Texas. Last week, the couple's six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home in Newport Coast went on the market for $16.5 million. The property has ocean views, an eight-car garage and a pool and spa, according to the listing. Family: The couple has four daughters, including a 14-year-old (right) from Katie's former relationship. Hamilton is now not allowed to see the girls without supervision, according to court records .

She has custody of the couple's four daughters . The divorce petition comes just months after the couple celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary and Hamilton gushed about his wife on social media. '10 years ago today, I said ""I do"",' he wrote on his Twitter page on November 10 as he shared a photo of him and his wife. 'There are no words to describe how much I love and adore this lady.' Earlier this year, Hamilton, a former Major League Baseball Most Valued Player, underwent shoulder surgery before spring training for the LA Angels. He then self-reported that he had suffered a cocaine and alcohol relapse - the latest incident in his well-documented history of substance abuse. Hamilton was suspended for three seasons between 2003 and 2005 and was ordered to undergo regular drug testing when he was reinstated into baseball in 2005. After his recent relapse, Major League Baseball officials said Hamilton had violated his treatment program, but the players' association disagreed so an arbitrator was called to make a decision. Uncertain future: Hamilton, pictured in October 2014, signed with the LA Angels in 2012 but self-reported a substance abuse relapse earlier this year. He will not be disciplined but may not return to the team . Without divulging reasons, the arbitrator ruled that Hamilton did not violate terms of the agreement, and the player will not be disciplined for the relapse. After overcoming his early addiction problems, Hamilton played for the Texas Rangers between 2008 and 2012 and was named the AL MVP in 2010. During that time, he had two public relapses, including one before the 2012 season. In 2012, he signed a five-year, $125 million contract with the Angels, but owner Arte Moreno last week said he could not guarantee Hamilton will return to play for the team. He claimed that Hamilton's contract said the deal could be terminated if he relapsed. The Dallas Morning News reported that he was not assigned a locker during spring training and merchandise with his name on has been removed from the team's stadium store.","LA Angel Josh Hamilton filed for divorce from Katie two months ago .

The 16-year-old, son of seven-time F1 world champion Michael, looks relaxed at the Oschersleben circuit . Schumacher will need time to make his way as a driver, according to team manager Frits van Amersfoort . While this was the first time the public were able to check out Mick in action in his new car, his pre-season practice didn't quite go to plan as he was involved in a 100mph crash last month. However, German newspaper Bild reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured. His father, who is still recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven 91 races in Formula 1, and Mick's boss Frits van Amersfoort says the youngster will need time. 'Of course we know that his father is a seven time world champion,' he said. 'But I want to emphasise that Mick will take the time to learn the trade of the racing driver.' Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4 in March, and links up with team-mate Harrison Newey, the son of the Red Bull designer Adrian.

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff believes Nico Rosberg was back to his best in Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. Rosberg has again found himself playing second fiddle to Hamilton so far this season, which has led to many questioning his character and ability. Although Rosberg could only finish third behind Hamilton and Ferrari star Kimi Raikkonen at the Bahrain International Circuit, he proved over the course of the race he still has what it takes. Nico Rosberg duels for position with the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel during Sunday's race in Bahrain . Lewis Hamilton sprays Rosberg with champagne after the Briton secured his third win in four races this term . 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 93 . 2. Nico Rosberg (Germany) Mercedes 66 . 3. Sebastian Vettel (Germany) Ferrari 65 . 4. Kimi Raikkonen (Finland) Ferrari 42 . Rosberg conjured three superb overtaking manoeuvres, one on Raikkonen and two on the Finn's Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel. A delighted Wolff said: 'Everybody who ever doubted Nico saw Nico at his best, fighting hard and overtaking. 'We are four races into the season and there are another 15 left, so I have no doubt after his driving in Bahrain, which was exceptional, we will have a very strong Nico bouncing back in Barcelona (for the Spanish Grand Prix).' Rosberg is already 27 points adrift of Mercedes team-mate Hamilton in the battle for this season's title . Rosberg dices with Kimi Raikkonen . Asked as to what is required of Rosberg to overcome an in-form Hamilton, Wolff replied: 'To qualify on pole and control the race from there. 'We saw that Lewis qualifying on pole, running away and being in control of the race was similar to what we had in China. He was the key to scoring maximum points.' A concern for Wolff, however, is the brake failures of Hamilton and Rosberg over the final two laps. For Rosberg, in particular, the brake system in his car failed on the penultimate lap, allowing a charging Raikkonen an easy pass, although it is likely the Finn's pace at that stage would have resulted in him claiming second anyway. As for Hamilton, his brakes gave way on the final lap, but the 30-year-old was able to cross the line 3.3 seconds ahead of Raikkonen. 'We must be happy with one and three, no doubt about it,' added Wolff. 'But Nico losing second place because of a brake failure is a bit of a pity. 'We saw very hot brakes on Nico's car in traffic following Sebastian (Vettel) with lots of hard braking. We monitored that, but with the backmarkers and the lapping cars those brake temperatures went through the roof and we had a brake-by-wire failure on both cars in the same corner - Lewis on the last lap, Nico on the penultimate lap. 'Leading into the last lap it was under hard braking on the straight the temperatures went sky high. When that happens the brake-by-wire switches into a conventional system and then you are without weapons to defend.'","Nico Rosberg fought his way past Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel .

"An adorable fox cub trapped in a garden fence was set free by a wildlife expert named Simon Cowell. The rescue mission was captured on camera and features Mr Cowell, who runs the Wildlife Aid Foundation in Leatherhead, Surrey, travelling to the cub’s location in his car.

"A youngster has emulated Barcelona star Martin Montoya and scored an audacious 27-yard goal into a basketball hoop - twice. Schoolboy Frankie Franz watched the Spanish right-back pull off the staggering trick shot in a video recorded at Barcelona’s Ciutat Esportiva training ground earlier in the month. The viral clip shows the 23-year-old defender lifting the ball into the net to the sound of gasps from his team mates at the Catalonia club. Joking  that he could do the same with his mum and grandmother, nine-year-old Frankie, who is an academy player with Dagenham and Redbridge Football Club, took to the garden to have a go. He moved the basketball hoop into the middle of the goal and after a little run up sent the ball straight through the net first time. In the video he can be seen turning to face the camera looking absolutely gob-smacked as he places his hands behind his head. A slow motion look at the clip captures the trajectory of the ball, which bounces off the backboard and goes through the hoop below.

"Manchester United striker James Wilson has revealed that if he could take one quality from team-mate Wayne Rooney and add it to his own game, it would be the England captain's ability to take free-kicks. The 19-year-old, speaking during an interview in May's issue of Inside United, added that he would want Robin van Persie's movement and Radamel Falcao's instincts. The United starlet said earlier this season that he was using his opportunity training with the first team to learn from the three experienced forwards, who have scored more than 450 professional goals between them. James Wilson would take Wayne Rooney's free-kick-taking ability if he could have one of his qualities . Wilson says England captain Rooney practices his free kicks every day, and often hits the target . Wilson has scored one Premier League goal this season, against Queens Park Rangers . And it is Rooney's ability to strike a dead ball that Wilson most appreciates about his captain. 'I would take Wayne's free-kicks because he practices them every day and more often than not they go on target at least, if not in the top corner,' Wilson said. Of Van Persie, who Wilson played alongside for the Under 21s on Monday night, the youngster praised his ability to create space to receive the ball. 'I would take Robin's movement because he has done it for many years now, using opposite movements to get on the ball.'

"Lewis Hamilton has conceded to feeling more powerful now than at any stage in his F1 career. It is an ominous warning from a man who has won nine of the last 11 grands prix, been on pole at the last four, and who already holds a 27-point cushion in the drivers' standings. It is no wonder after winning in Bahrain, when Hamilton stepped out of his Mercedes, he immediately stood on top of it and pretended to smack an imaginary baseball out of the circuit. Lewis Hamilton stands on his Mercedes after winning the Bahrain Grand Prix . It was another 'home run' performance from Hamilton, a man who claims he is a perfectionist, and who appears to be driving as close to perfection as can possibly be achieved in the sport. It led to the suggestion that perhaps he was feeling unbeatable, to which he replied: 'I don't know what the feeling of being unbeatable is. 'I know I feel very powerful in this car with the package we have, and I feel I'm able to get everything from it. 'I also feel more comfortable in this car than I did in the one last year, and I feel within myself, with whatever approach I have, the power is greater than ever in terms of strength in the car. 'It's like 'yes'. I put the car there and it goes there, I get the exit. 'Naturally you always feel there are things you can still improve on, but it's hard to always pinpoint what those are and to tell the team what to focus on. Hamilton is congratulated by Ferrari rival Kimi Raikkonen on Sunday . 'That's what a team leader has to do, and, along with Nico (Rosberg), I'm trying to guide the team, to tell them where to go next.' So just how close to perfection does Hamilton feel? 'There are always areas. I'll look and think 'Could I have braked later for the pit entry? Could I have done a better outlap?' said the 30-year-old. 'I feel I'm doing the best I can, and I'm learning and improving at the same time, which is all I can ask for.' Yet do not dare to suggest to Hamilton that he does not work as hard off the track in terms of poring over every aspect of what is required to ensure he is at one with his car. In being compared with former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button in the past, or Rosberg at present, the feeling has generally been they are more studious than Hamilton, who simply just drives. 'Of course I analyse. You can't be a world champion without doing that,' Hamilton said. 'I remember speaking about this a long time ago and I don't know if people get a perception as to who you are as a driver, but I work as hard as any other driver. 'Just because I do things differently it doesn't mean I'm worse. Race winner Hamilton celebrates with the trophy on the podium in Bahrain . 'There was a point where people said Nico was a doctor of this or that; Jenson was a doctor of his tyres. 'I tick off all the boxes, and I've worked to do that. 'The results I get are not only from my raw ability because I study hard, I work hard to make notes about my tyres, about every single thing I do, which I've done since my days in Formula Three. 'Ultimately, I don't care what people think. I just do the job.' Hamilton certainly has Rosberg scratching his head as the German appears to have run out of ideas as to how to beat his main rival. Hamilton has now set a personal record run of 11 consecutive grands prix in the points - twice finishing second in addition to the nine wins. If you include the double points for the final race of last season, Hamilton has scored an astonishing 286 from a potential 300. It is not perfection, so perhaps there is a feeling of never being quite satisfied. 'That's natural for anyone who has the competitiveness I have,' said Hamilton. 'I know the potential I have, and whether or not I'm living up to it. 'I feel I am coming close to full potential - although who knows exactly what that is - but I do feel quite satisfied.'

"It seems to happen after every single World Cup that someone near to the top of English cricket gets the sack. Whether it be Duncan Fletcher, David Lloyd, whoever, someone always seems to pay the price for our abject failure to compete on the global one-day stage. Paul Downton is just the latest victim. It is high time that we looked at the entire structure of English cricket and the reasons we are incapable of producing the types of cricketer required to succeed in international one-day cricket. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Moores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference . The system is broken and it desperately needs fixing if England are ever going to compete in limited-overs cricket again. Make no mistake, sacking Paul Downton does not mean some magic wand has been waved and all will be well. There are deep systemic problems. Too many of the current selectors and coaches are from the old guard and have failed to keep pace with the dramatic changes that have occurred in one-day cricket in recent years. From Downton to coach Peter Moores, to selectors James Whitaker and Angus Fraser, these are players from a different era who have been painfully slow to react to situations. Downton (left) and Peter Moores (right) pose during a press conference at Lord's Cricket Ground . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . Even the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain was a slow and protracted affair. They should have acted sooner. Like so much of English sport, our cricket system seems afraid of the maverick player and that has to change. In my view there is still too much bad blood around for Kevin Pietersen to return, with the fall-out from the book causing untold damage to so many relationships that it just seems inconceivable for him to return. Nasser Hussain believes the sacking of Cook as one-day captain was a slow and protracted affair . I hate it when things become about one individual and believe me, everything that has gone wrong with English cricket has not been down to the handling of Kevin Pietersen; however badly that has been done. But what is does highlight is the continued fear of the maverick player. From David Gower to Kevin Pietersen, English cricket has shown distrust for anyone who does not conform or fit into a safe stereotype even though all the players who are thriving on the world stage are non-conformists who do things differently. You wouldn’t find Brendan McCullum or AB de Villiers audacious shot- making in an MCC coaching manual but you will not find two better strikers of a cricket ball on the planet. English cricket needs to learn to embrace the maverick. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in the hope of earning a place in the Ashes squad for England this summer . Hussain hopes whoever is appointed to replace Downton is close to the modern game and ahead of the curve . I have been asked if I would like to take on Downton’s job and the short answer is ‘no’. I will do anything I can to help the ECB and English cricket but there are far better candidates than me out there. Whether it be Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss or anyone else, I just hope whoever they appoint is close to the modern game and ahead of the curve. We have been behind it for far too long.Most importantly, it is time to wake up and look at the big picture. Stop finding individuals to scapegoat and carry the can and start looking at the system that is failing to produce the kind of cricketers we need.","Nasser Hussain believes it's time to look at the structure of English cricket .

"Sunderland are under pressure to suspend England star Adam Johnson after he was charged with grooming and three counts of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Johnson, 27, has been bailed to appear before Peterlee magistrates on May 20 — the same day Sunderland travel to Arsenal — where it is expected the case will be sent to the Crown Court. If found guilty, Johnson faces a lengthy prison term. Sunderland chiefs held talks on Thursday to decide Johnson’s future, knowing that if they suspend their top scorer he would miss the club’s remaining six games. They are just a point above the Barclays Premier League drop zone and travel to Stoke tomorrow. Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity . Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him . The 27-year-old looks on during Sunderland's 1-0 Premier League win against Newcastle earlier this month . Johnson was suspended by the club after his arrest on March 2 but that was lifted when his bail was extended by five weeks a fortnight later. He returned to training under new boss Dick Advocaat and has featured as a substitute in Sunderland’s last three matches, including the 1-0 derby win over Newcastle. The suspension could now be reimposed. Johnson is accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are alleged to have taken place between December 30 last year and February 26. Johnson has also been charged with meeting a child following sexual grooming under Section 15 of the same Act. Gerry Wareham, CPS chief Crown prosecutor for the North East, said: ‘Following an investigation by Durham Police, I have today authorised police to charge Adam Johnson, aged 27, with four offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Johnson will now appear at Peterlee Magistrates Court on May 20 . The England international (right) was wearing a black tracksuit as he attended the hearing in County Durham . Johnson was accompanied by his lawyer as the Sunderland winger arrived at the police station on Thursday . ‘The offences are alleged to have been committed on one girl aged 15 at the time. We have reviewed the available evidence in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and concluded that there is a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to charge Adam Johnson. ‘Durham Police have charged the defendant accordingly and he is due to appear before Peterlee Magistrates on May 20.

"Luis Suarez's wife Sofia has revealed that the Barcelona star told her he didn't bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup in Brazil - before admitting the truth 10 days later. The Uruguayan received a four-month ban for the incident and was condemned by world football but still completed a £75million move from Liverpool to the La Liga side. His wife admits that Suarez didn't believe that he had done anything but the television replays suggested otherwise and he then owned up.

The Uruguay striker bites down on the Italian's shoulder in front of the watching television cameras . Sofia told Canal 10: 'He told me he hadn’t done it. That is what he had in his head and even I began to believe it. But the television and radio spoke only about the bite and after 10 days of us being alone he told me the truth. 'On the day of the game I phoned him and asked what he had done. He responded with ‘what?’ The same had happened in England and I insisted: ‘Again?’ He replied: ‘I haven’t done anything. Are you not happy because Uruguay qualified?'

"Stan Collymore, talkSPORT lead football pundit who revels in laying down the law on the radio, astonished reporters with his behaviour during Aston Villa’s 3-3 Premier League draw with QPR on Tuesday night. Collymore, despite sitting in the Villa Park press box where media impartiality is taken for granted, was jumping up and down during the game like the most fanatical Villa fan, celebrating the goals with the home supporters. He even greeted QPR’s Joey Barton falling down to win a free-kick by clearly shouting at him: ‘You f****** rat.’ talkSport pundit Stan Collymore was in full fan mode as he celebrated Villa's 3-3 draw with QPR . The former Villa striker let loose with his wild, and sometimes expletive laden, comments from the press box . Villa fan Collymore believed such actions in the supposed neutral sanctuary of the press box were permissible as he wasn’t working for talkSPORT during the match. He tweeted: ‘With respect, on nights I go as a fan . . . I’m not being paid to do anything other than be a fan.’ And talkSPORT would not comment as they said Collymore wasn’t on duty, with reporter Nigel Pearson giving his rather more impartial verdict for the station. However Collymore did an interview with Adrian Durham and Darren Gough on talkSPORT before the match. Collymore called Joey Barton a 'f*****g rat' after he fell down to win a free-kick for QPR during the game . Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire’s highly-rated championship-winning coach also in charge of Big Bash team Adelaide Strikers, is hardly your archetypal red-meat-eating Aussie fast bowler. Gillespie, who would be first choice for England as well if Peter Moores fails in the West Indies, is preparing for new season by becoming a vegan. Meanwhile Lancashire’s supporters’ action group are questioning the value of having Sky Sports commentator Paul Allott on the club board after Peter Siddle, Lancashire’s overseas signing, was selected for Australia’s tours of the West Indies and England, ruling him out of any county involvement. Yorkshire's championship winning coach Jason Gillespie is preparing for the season with a new diet . Bookmakers Paddy Power, rabid publicists guaranteed to offend, have a new stunt showing Ruby Walsh supposedly preparing for the Grand National by jumping his horse over a speeding car. The YouTube video is plainly mocked up but, with sensitivities around animal welfare, it was crass of Walsh, jump racing’s pre-eminent jockey after AP McCoy’s forthcoming retirement, to involve himself in such a provocative spoof — even if he is a Paddy Power ambassador. Ruby Walsh and horse clear a car, claimed to be travelling at 40mph,  as part of the Grand National countdown . The split between FA chairman Greg Dyke and vice-chairman David Gill over homegrown players became very apparent during Wednesday's FA council meeting. After Dyke gave his well-received presentation, Manchester United director Gill, with his Premier League hat on, told council that Dyke should have said ‘I’ rather than ‘we’ as the issue had yet to be debated by the FA board. Gill wants the consultation period to be a proper process starting at board level — during which no doubt the Premier League will try to hijack it. So the big question is whether Dyke is willing to use the rulebook to force it through. FA chairman Greg Dyke still faces a challenge to convince everyone over plans to change homegrown quota . Gordon faces scrutiny . Michael Gordon, American representative on daily Liverpool business for the club’s Fenway Sports Group owners, likes to operate well away from the media spotlight. However Boston Red Sox baseball shareholder Gordon might soon have to explain his major involvement in a number of signings that haven’t worked out as well as current contract stand-offs if Liverpool’s season were to further unravel. It’s understood Gordon’s high opinion of Liverpool’s pulling power and ability to keep players might have been swayed rather too much by their brief presence in the Champions League. Michael Gordon may have to explain why several signings, such as Mario Balotelli, have not worked out . Channel 4 racing missing the start of an all-weather championship race at Lingfield last Friday because of an ad break could come back to haunt them. Arena Racing Company, the largest UK racing group are understood to have paid for the TV production costs as part of the Lingfield promotion that attracted a 9,000 crowd. Meanwhile ARC are looking to invite people supportive of their all-weather racing track at Newcastle for a celebratory launch when they receive the go-ahead for the plans discussed by the British Horseracing Authority board yesterday.

"Wladimir Klitschko has reached rare territory among heavyweight champions. Now, in his ninth year as champion, Klitschko is catching Joe Louis and Larry Holmes in successful defences. When Klitschko faces Bryant Jennings on April 25 at New York's Madison Square Garden, he will risk his heavyweight belt for the 18th time. A win over Jennings will place Klitschko within one successful defense of Holmes but he would still need six additional wins to match Louis' record of 25. Wladimir Klitschko works out in the ring in front of the media ahead of his fight against Bryant Jennings . Klitschko lands a right hand during a sparring session in front of the watching media in Florida . 'With all respect to Louis and Larry Holmes, they're icons for me, I don't want to be compared with them because they are fighters I always have looked up to,' Klitschko said. 'As an outsider (media) can observe the fights and title defenses, you keep track. I'm an insider.' Nonetheless, Klitschko has made deep inroads during his second heavyweight stint that began with a seventh-round technical knockout win over Chris Byrd for a sanctioning body title in April 2006. Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson never enjoyed a title run as long as the native of Ukraine and part-time Hollywood, Florida resident. 'My mind is in a tunnel; I'm getting ready for the next bout,' Klitschko said. 'And I'm excited about the challenge. I do not compare myself with the records of those guys - Joe Louis and Larry Holmes. I just enjoy my game.' Klitschko built the impressive streak of title defences at a time when American heavyweights have faded from contention. Until Deontay Wilder's victory over Bermane Stiverne on January 17, no American held a piece of the heavyweight title since 2006. Klitschko is closing in on the record number of defences of the heavyweight title set by Joe Louis . Victory for the Ukrainian will take him to within one win of Larry Holmes' 19 defences . Wilder looks for a lengthy reign while Jennings, of Philadelphia, seeks to tilt the division's power more toward to its once-dominant base. 'Every opponent is different and we will see how Bryant Jennings can hold the pressure,' Klitschko said. 'As my former coach, Emmanuel Steward said, `on fight night, when you step into the ring, welcome to big time boxing.' 'How is Bryant Jennings going to hold to big-time boxing and get along with that? We'll see.' Jennings earned the opportunity to face Klitschko after his split-decision victory over fellow contender Mike Perez last July. 'Bryant Jennings is going to bring a lot of excitement and a lot of energy into the ring,' Klitschko said. 'This fight is going to be nothing but exciting.' Jennings defends his unbeaten record when he takes on Klitschko later this month in New York . Klitschko is keen to face Deontay Wilder (left) in a unification clash later in his career . Klitschko believes boxing is enjoying a revival. Attention toward the sport has increased with the build-up to the mega-fight between welterweight champions Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao on May 2 in Las Vegas. And Klitschko also predicts a future unification bout between him and Wilder would be appealing to fight fans that distanced themselves from the heavyweight division after Tyson's retirement. 'The demand is shifting back and forth and during the time when boxing was less popular in the heavyweight division, because of the lack of good (American) prospects, it shifted to Europe,' said Klitschko, who will make his first US appearance in seven years. 'You cannot say boxing was dead or unpopular. The attention shifted to different continents. And now the demand for boxing is big and I'm really excited to be back in the States. 'I believe Deontay is an extremely talented athlete. We've sparred enough that we know each other well. I believe a unification fight is something the public wants.'","Wladimir Klitschko takes on Bryant Jennings in New York on April 23 .

"Adam Johnson has been charged with three offences of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl and one of grooming. The 27-year-old – who answered bail at Peterlee police station in County Durham on Thursday – will now appear at Peterlee Magistrates Court on May 20. A statement from Durham Police said: ‘Adam Johnson, a professional footballer aged 27 from Castle Eden, County Durham has this afternoon been charged with three offences of sexual activity with a child under 16 years old, plus one offence of grooming. Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity . Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him . Johnson will now appear at Peterlee Magistrates Court on May 20 . The 27-year-old looks on during Sunderland's 1-0 Premier League win against Newcastle earlier this month . ‘Johnson was initially arrested on Monday, 2nd March and was charged after he answered his police bail today (Thursday) at Peterlee police station. ‘He will appear at the magistrates court in Peterlee on the morning of Wednesday, May 20th.’ Gerry Wareham, CPS Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North East, said he believed there was a realistic prospect of conviction and it was in the public interest for him to be charged. 'Following an investigation by Durham Police, I have today authorised police to charge Adam Johnson, aged 27, with four offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are alleged to have been committed on one girl aged 15 at the time,' he said. 'Adam Johnson was arrested on 2 March this year.

The alleged offences date from 30 December 2014 to 26 February 2015. Johnson was accompanied by his lawyer as the Sunderland winger arrived at the police station on Thursday .

'Durham Police have charged the defendant accordingly and he is due to appear before Peterlee Magistrates on 20 May. 'May I remind all concerned that the defendant has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings. 'I would also remind people that the complainant in this case is entitled to lifelong anonymity under the law. For these reasons, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.' The former England international was suspended by Sunderland pending the outcome of the police investigation after he was initially arrested at his £1.85million mansion on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. However, his club suspension was lifted on March 18 following news that his bail had been extended by five weeks and he has featured as a substitute in Sunderland’s last three matches, including the 1-0 Tyne-Wear derby win over Newcastle. Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothes officers and a forensics team were seen at Johnson’s luxurious home, close to a quiet hamlet in County Durham, and he was questioned at Peterlee police station before being bailed until April 23. Sunderland-born Johnson, whose long-time girlfriend Stacey Flounders gave birth to daughter Ayla Sofia in January, signed for the club for £10m from Manchester City in 2012. He has scored 20 times in 116 games for the club, including the winner at Newcastle in this season’s Tyne-Wear derby. The £1.85million house in the North East where Johnson was arrested in March .

The Black Cats winger has made three Premier League appearances under new boss Dick Advocaat (right) As revealed by Sportsmail last month, police raided the dressing rooms at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland's training ground as part of their probe into Johnson. It is also understood that all Sunderland staff were called into meetings following Johnson's arrest and warned away from posting anything about it on social media and from speaking to the press. A source said: 'You don't expect to see police officers in a dressing room and quite a few people at the club were shocked by it. They were looking for things such as second mobile phones and notes, anything that would help them, really.' Changing rooms at the club's Academy of Light training ground were also scoured by local police . Johnson, seen here in action against France in 2010, has made 12 appearances for England . The winger played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . They added: 'All staff were called into meetings and told in no uncertain terms that they were not to put anything on things like Twitter and Facebook and not to talk to the press about it under any circumstances.' The 27-year-old had been training at home in a bid to keep fit after being suspended by Sunderland while the investigation continued. The Black Cats had been sending a fitness coach to Johnson’s two-acre woodland pad to oversee private workouts before the winger was put back into the first-team fold by Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat. Sunderland are yet to confirm if the player will not be available for selection in light of the charges. Johnson has scored 20 goals for the Black Cats since signing for the club in 2012 . Johnson in action for Middlesbrough in 2007 . Adam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a UEFA Cup game in 2005, aged just 17. Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal. In May, 2006, he scored his first goal for the club, a deflected effort in a 1-1 draw away to Bolton Wanderers and soon after signed a four-year contract extension. He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club. On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form and won the North East Football Writers' Young Player of the Year award after 11 goals in 29 Championship appearances. In February 2010, he made a £7million move to Manchester City. City boss Roberto Mancini said: 'Adam is a very good player with fantastic potential, and as a club we are always keen to sign British talent.' He made a bright start and was named man of the match in his first start. Johnson's first goal for City came against Sunderland, leading England manager Fabio Capello to publicly praising him. He was handed first England cap in a World Cup warm-up against Mexico at the age of 22 and named in provisional squad for tournament in South Africa. In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield. Johnson enjoyed a successful spell at Watford in the Championship, scoring five in 12 games . In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the winger made 97 appearances and won the Premier League . In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a £10million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham. He said after taking the match ball as a memento: ‘These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on. ‘This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.’ He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month. The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012. He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year.

"Eden Hazard needs to become more selfish if he wants to be considered alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, according to Manchester United legend Paul Scholes. The Chelsea playmaker is closing in on a first Premier League title after another impressive season, which has seen him emerge as favourite to pick up the PFA Player of the Year award. Despite scoring 13 goals and making eight assists in 32 appearances, Scholes believes the 24-year-old needs to be more ruthless to be compared with the world's best players. Eden Hazard celebrates scoring the winner against Manchester United as Chelsea close in on the title . The Chelsea playmaker is favourite to pick up the PFA Player of the Year award this season . Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Lionel Messi are recognised as the world's two best players - ahead of Hazard . 'One thing I do wonder with Hazard is whether he has that hunger to score goals that you see in Ronaldo, Messi and [Luis] Suarez,' Scholes wrote in The Independent. 'Those are players who have a ferocious appetite to put the ball in the net. They're unstoppable. Hazard seems to me to be a relatively gentle soul. One who is just as happy skipping past a couple of opponents and putting it on a plate for a team-mate. 'He does that very well, and I have no doubt he will deserve his accolade at the PFA awards. Playing the way he does, under pressure to score goals and make them, is not easy and he has been a big part of Chelsea's success. 'But in this modern age, if he wishes to challenge the achievements of Messi and Ronaldo then he will have to prove that he can match their relentless desire to score goals.' Chelsea fans show their appreciation for the Belgium international at Stamford Bridge . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes (right) believes Hazard needs to be more ruthless . Nonetheless, Scholes says he would vote for Hazard as PFA Player of the Year ahead of Tottenham striker Harry Kane - who has netted 30 goals in all competitions during his breakthrough season. Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho and Hazard's team-mate Diego Costa are also in the running. 'My vote would go to Hazard,' Scholes added. 'I prefer the attacking footballers – you wouldn't expect me to say otherwise – and Hazard has been the best in that regard. 'Not streets ahead of the likes of Harry Kane, and nothing like the wow-factor of those two big players at Barcelona and Real Madrid. But Hazard has made the difference in big games, like the one against Manchester United.'","Chelsea travel to Arsenal as they close in on the Premier League title .

The club's hierarchy have decided that the 27-year-old should be allowed to continue playing for the Black Cats until the outcome of his case has been decided. A club statement on Friday morning read: 'Following yesterday's statement from Durham Constabulary, the club recognises that the formal legal process must take its course and whilst our position remains unchanged, we will keep the matter under review. 'The club will not be making any further comment.' Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station on Thursday after being charged .

If found guilty, Johnson could face a lengthy prison term. In the meantime, he will be available to feature for relegation-threatened Sunderland, who are one point above the Premier League drop zone and travel to Stoke on Saturday. He was suspended by the club following his arrest on March 2 but that was lifted when his bail was extended by five weeks a fortnight later. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat supported the decision not to suspend Sunderland. Advocaat said: 'He still has to come in (to train). But, in principle, if he feels okay he will be part of the squad. 'It's not difficult to deal with. The club have made a statement and I stand behind that and I will see what the future will bring.'

Johnson stands accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are said to have taken place between December 30 last year and February 26. He has also been charged with meeting a child following sexual grooming under Section 15 of the same Act. Gerry Wareham, CPS Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North East, said he believes there is a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest for Johnson to be charged.

"Wladimir Klitschko will match Joe Louis in boxing's record books with his 27th heavyweight title fight on Saturday and could set more marks since he has no plans to retire anytime soon. The 39-year-old Ukrainian, speaking to reporters ahead of Saturday's fight against American Bryant Jennings at New York's Madison Square Garden, has dominated the heavyweight division for nearly a decade and shown no signs of slowing down. 'As long as I have motivation and health, I'll do it. I don't feel old, or bad, or slow,' said Klitschko, who has 17 successful defenses in a row since winning the crown for the second time in 2006.

Klitschko (left) and Jennings (right) square up to one another at the press conference ahead of their fight . 'What could be cooler, or better, than to be the best man on the planet and beating up people for a living?' The 6-foot-6 Ukrainian boasts a 63-3-0 record heading into the bout against Jennings, who is 19-0 since taking up boxing six years ago. But the 30-year-old challenger from Philadelphia is not impressed by Klitschko's accomplishments and plans on starting a new reign. 'My first edge is youth. Youth is always an edge that you can't deny. Speed. Speed is an edge. These are things that are obvious,' said Jennings. And Jennings wasn't alone in trying to bring the Ukrainian down. Maverick heavyweight Shannon Briggs made an appearance at the press conference and taunted Klitschko while taking his shirt off. Despite a three-inch height advantage in Klitschko's favor, Jennings enjoys the same edge in reach, which could help him keep the champion at bay with jabs. Youthful exuberance may go only so far against Klitschko though, who has shown himself a master technician during his long run.

Former heavyweight Champion Shannon Briggs taunts Klitschko during the press conference on Tuesday . Klitschko, who would also move within one of Larry Holmes's 19 consecutive title defenses with a win - second to the mark of 25 held by Joe Louis -said he was 'allergic' to comparisons with other greats. 'How long I've been champion, how many title defenses I've made ... I don't want to compare myself with any of the great heavyweights,' Klitschko, the 1996 Olympic champion said. 'I'm still looking up to those guys. They are still icons to me.' Jennings believes that age is on his side as he prepares to take on the experienced Klitschko on Saturday . Klitschko shows off his title belts ahead of the clash with Jennings at Madison Square Garden on Saturday . Should Klitschko conquer Jennings, other up-and-comers await including Britain's Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, who holds the WBC belt, the only one to elude the Ukrainian. 'I see the change of the generations is slowly coming, because I had all of those guys in my training camp coming up,' Klitschko said. 'They are very competitive, very young, very ambitious, very strong fighters that definitely are going to bring a lot of excitement in the ring.'","Wladimir Klitschko will match Joe Louis' record of 27 heavyweight bouts .

"Chris Gayle is not adverse to bowling spin, so it perhaps unsurprising that the batsman has tried his hands to get something to turn again - albeit if not on a cricket pitch. The 35-year-old is currently in India ahead of this year's IPL tournament which starts on Wednesday. And it appears the destructive batsman is enjoying himself before attempting to help Royal Challengers Bangalore be crowned IPL champions for the first time in their history. Chris Gayle (left) uploaded an Instagram picture behind the DJ decks ahead of the IPL season on Tuesday . Gayle, pictured in 2012, will be hoping to win Royal Challengers Bangalore's first-ever IPL crown this year . Accompanied with the caption: 'Current situation... Believe me, I'm on the work again... #USL #RCB,' Gayle posted a picture via his Instagram account on Tuesday of himself behind some DJ decks. It's not the first time that Gayle has tried his hand musically. Last month the West Indies opener posted 'I'm not leaving' alongside an Instagram video of himself singing along with an amused singer in Sydney after rejecting speculation that he will quit international cricket. Gayle, laughing while attempting to hit the high notes as the singer covers Sam Smith's 'Stay With Me', is no doubt referring to the picturesque Opera Bar on Sydney Harbour at which he was clearly enjoying himself. Despite his off-the-field pleasures, Gayle will be hoping that he and his Bangalore team-mates are signing from the same hymn sheet when they start their IPL campaign. The Challengers travel to the Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday looking to make amends for the past three years where they have missed out on the play-offs altogether. Possessing a potent batting order that includes Gayle, AB de Villers and Virat Kohli - the £1.17million purchase of Dinesh Karthik in addition could see them finally shake off their underachievers tag.

"AP McCoy will jump his final fence this weekend when the legendary jockey bows out at Sandown and to mark his retirement we've got some brilliant stats and little-known facts as we preview hisbig farewell. We've also got video footage of McCoy's most memorable wins and everything else you need to know about the man who has been champion jockey every year he's been a professional. AP McCoy won the Grand National in 2010 on Don't Push It . To kick off, how about this for a CV? Name: Anthony Peter McCoy OBE . Born: May 4, 1974 in Moneyglass, Country Antrim, Northern Ireland . Height: 5ft 10.5in . Weight: 10st 5Ibs (has ridden at 10st 3lbs in the past) McCoy, in the final furlong of a glittering career, winning on Capard King at Ayr last weekend . Achievements . For a man that has won pretty much everything there is to win in his sport, there are a few key highlights: . • 20 consecutive champion jump jockey titles . • 253 winners in the 1997-98 season, beating the previous record tally of jumps wins in a season of 221 held by Peter Scudamore. • 289 winners in the 2001-02 season, a British record and surpassing Sir Gordon Richards' previous record of 269 winners on the flat. • Became the most successful Jump jockey of all time when surpassing Richard Dunwoody's tally of 1,699 winners in August, 2002. McCoy won the Cheltenham Gold Cup for a second time when he steered Synchronised home in 2012 . • Rode his 4,000th winner on Mountain Tunes at Towcester on 7th November 2013. • Record-breaking 4,348 GB & IRE jumps winners as of 20th April 2015. • Beat former trainer Martin Pipe's total number of winners of 4,191 in July 2014. • Practically every major race to his name including 2 Cheltenham Gold Cups, three Champion Hurdles and the Grand National. • Awarded an MBE in the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours and an OBE in the 2010 Queen's Birthday Honours. • Voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2010, the first time an individual from racing has been recognised in this way. Was third in the 2013 poll. TEN THINGS YOU NEVER KNEW ABOUT AP McCOY . 1 AP spends between two and two-and-a-half hours in a sauna six days a week to ensure he is the correct weight for riding. That equates to almost two years of his life. 2 He loses between 2-4lb per session. In his 25-year amateur and professional career, he has lost the equivalent weight of two African elephants – the heaviest animal on Earth. 3 McCoy has chipped 14 teeth and broken 13 bones in his quest to be the best. 4 Whilst most involved in horse racing have a history with the sport, McCoy did not begin to work around horses until he was 13 – turning full-time at 15 when he left school. McCoy got a kiss from wife Chanelle after winning on Uxizandre at this year's Cheltenham Festival . This graphic shows how much of a battering McCoy has taken over the years . A look at how McCoy's dominance of his sport compares with other heavyweights of their trade . A lot has happened in the 20 years McCoy has been the champion jockey . 5 After time off following a broken leg, McCoy’s weight increased and resulted in him switching from flat racing to jumps racing. 6 McCoy has been Champion Jockey for 1,040 weeks whilst Roger Federer’s two spells at world No 1 equate to 302 weeks. Tiger Woods has spent 545 weeks as golf’s world No 1. 7 McCoy says he has fallen off a horse more than 1,000 times, which is equivalent to falling from the world’s largest building, the Burj Khalifa, twice. 8 After the running of the 2010 Grand National, which AP won aboard Don’t Push It, bookmakers reported a loss of around £50million. 9 AP’s breakfast consists of a cup of tea with two sugars and maybe a piece of toast, if he isn’t watching his weight too carefully for a ride later in the day. 10 In another move to control his weight, AP only eats four dinners per week. McCoy's memorable wins . Don’t Push It - John Smith’s Grand National (April 10, 2010) It was the race that had evaded McCoy for 14 years. In the past, he had been unseated, his horse had fallen, he had pulled up and was even forced out by a loose horse when in front one year. Yet, in true McCoy fashion, he never gave up hope of winning the world’s greatest race and at the 15th attempt, he took home the prize aboard Jonjo O’Neill’s Don’t Push It. With two fences remaining, McCoy laid down his challenge, edged ahead at the last and then drove clear to give racing one of its most famous wins. Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Wichita Lineman - William Hill Trophy (March 10, 2009) Never has a ride epitomised a jockey more than when McCoy dragged the 5-1 favourite past half the field to land the spoils in the final strides after a series of jumping mistakes. Having jumped the third last, Maljimar cruised into the lead and looked the likely winner, but McCoy refused to be beaten and forced a final rally from his tough partner to get up on the line and win by a neck. Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Synchronised - Cheltenham Gold Cup (March 16, 2012) Having won his first Gold Cup on Mr Mulligan in 1997, it would be 15 years before McCoy tasted success again in Cheltenham’s blue riband race. He had to see off strong competition in the form of defending champion Long Run and two-time winner Kauto Star to do so. A mistake at the first fence saw Synchronised outpaced for much of the race, but McCoy timed his run to perfection and made sure Synchronised legendary stamina paid in the final run in up The Hill. Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Edredon Bleu - Queen Mother Champion Chase (March 15, 2000) McCoy’s one and only Queen Mother Champion Chase title came courtesy of Edredon Blue, a horse on which he had won the Grand Annual two years previously. Having jumped the first fence at the front of the pack, McCoy led Edredon Bleu through an exhibition of fine jumping but had to show his trademark tenacity to repel Direct Route and Flagship Uberalles in an amazing three-way finish up The Hill. McCoy and his willing partner won it on the nod in one of the greatest Festival finishes of all time. Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Mr Mulligan - Cheltenham Gold Cup (March 13, 1997) McCoy’s first Cheltenham Gold Cup was won in some style on a 20-1 shot and at the age of just 22. Prominent throughout, he led after 13 fences and never looked back to win by nine lengths in just his second season as a professional. Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Brave Inca - Champion Hurdle (March 14, 2006) Brave Inca is often described as an equine version of his famous jockey who showed the same grit and determination to hold off the challenges of Macs Joy and two-time defending champion Hardy Eustace. That Barry Cash and Ruby Walsh both came up short in the preceding and following years respectively showed that McCoy and Brave Inca were one of those partnerships which just got along. Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Make A Stand - Champion Hurdle (March 11, 1997) Make A Stand had won four races in succession, including the ultra-competitive Tote Gold Trophy by nine lengths, when he turned up to Cheltenham in 1997 for the Champion Hurdle. Despite his record, he was sent off only fifth favourite. Oliver Sherwood’s Large Action and Jim Old’s Collier Bay headed the market, while Irish raiders I’m Supposin and Space Trucker were close in behind. None of them got a look in. McCoy sent Make A Stand to the front, and the duo were never headed. Three flights from home they were clear, and Make A stand galloped up the Cheltenham hill to win by five lengths. Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . 1st winner: Legal Steps, Thurles, March 26, 1992 . 1st winner in Britain: Chickabiddy, Exeter, September 7, 1994 . 1,000th Winner: Majadou, Cheltenham, December 11, 1999 . 2,000th Winner: Corporate Player, Wincanton,  January 17, 2004 . 3,000th Winner: Restless D'Artaix, Plumpton, February 9, 2009 . 4,000th Winner: Mountain Tunes, Towcester, November 7, 2013.","AP McCoy retires on Saturday after riding at Sandown .

"Paris Saint-Germain star David Luiz's 'joker' status in the dressing room at Chelsea was well documented, and he teamed up with Ezequiel Lavezzi to play a prank on birthday boy Zoumana Camara. The £50million centre back was part of a duo who conspired to dunk the 36-year-old's face into his cake on his special day as PSG prepare for their Ligue 1 trip to face Marseille on Sunday. Camara, a fringe member of the squad this season, had an unexpected dip into his cake that left him with a faceful of it.

But Luiz posted an 'after' shot following the dunking, with the message: 'Happy Bday to my happy friend @z.camara ! What a person! Love u my man! All the best! #Felizaniversariomano' The French champions are still in with a shout of an unprecedented treble, sitting top of Ligue 1 with eight games to go, in the semi-finals of the French Cup and having reached the last eight of the Champions League. Luiz was known for his wind-up merchant status at Chelsea and seems to have carried it on in Paris . Lavezzi was also involved in the prank ahead of PSG's trip to face Marseille in Ligue 1 on Sunday . Camara is a fringe player at PSG and is unlikely to feature in what will be the biggest game of the season . But their abilities are certain to be tested on Sunday night in a first vs third clash against Marseille at a packed 67,394-capacity Stade Velodrome. A difficult April schedule makes it important that PSG stay top of the table in Marseille, having struggled to maintain a title challenge for much of the season. And while Camara is unlikely to feature, both Luiz and Lavezzi could have key roles in the biggest game of the French season so far.","PSG defender Zoumana Camara was celebrating his birthday on Friday .

"UFC superstar Ronda Rousey left her trademark deadly glares and lethal arm bar at home for the Los Angeles premiere of blockbuster action film Fast & Furious 7. Rousey, the UFC’s bantamweight champion, appears in the latest movie in the franchise to be released on April 3 in the UK with her MMA skills used to full effect. She stepped out in a sleek black dress handmade by London designers House Of CB and a pair of Tania Spinelli heels for the event at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. UFC star Ronda Rousey poses in front of a fast car at the premiere of action film Fast & Furious 7 . The UFC bantamweight champion was all smiles at the Hollywood event at the TCL Chinese Theatre . The look impressed Rousey's mother Dr AnnMaria, a former world judo champion who used to wake her daughter up with arm bar holds, as she posted an image saying: 'My little pumpkin grew up.' The premiere follows Rousey’s acclaimed debut WWE appearance in WrestleMania 31, in which she paired up with her Furious co-star The Rock for the event’s crescendo. Fans definitely liked what they saw when Rousey helped The Rock take down The Authority, otherwise known as WWE co-owner Stephanie McMahon and Triple H (real name Paul Levesque), and chanted her name at Monday’s WWE Raw. A Twitter post from Rousey in which she says, ‘We're just gettin' started’ alongside a picture of herself and The Rock giving their sternest looks, fuelled speculation this could become a regular deal. Rousey's MMA skills are used to full effect in the seventh film of the franchise out on April 3 in the UK . Rousey wore a sleek black dress and heels, but  managed a steely glare usually reserved for her opponents . Rousey is a massive WWE fan - she chose her nickname ‘Rowdy’ after and with the blessing of Canadian wrestler Roddy Piper and has been in the crowd many times. But this was her first time as an official participant and her arm bar on McMahon was only bettered by her throwing Triple H, at 6ft 4in and 265 pounds, over her shoulder like a rag doll. However, Rousey’s agent Brad Slater told Ariel Helwani on Fox Sports’ UFC Tonight on Wednesday that it was a one-off and that her focus is on her next UFC fight against Brazilian Bethe Correia in the headline bout for UFC 190. Rousey puts her game face on to take down WWE co-owner Stephanie McMahon at Wrestlemania 31 . Rousey throws Triple H over her shoulder and into the canvas as The Rock watches on .

"Javier Hernandez scored the goal of his life on Wednesday night but Real Madrid are unlikely to take up their option to buy the player. The Mexico international broke down in tears after scoring the goal that beat rivals Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter final and was hailed as the golden boy of Real. Yet, once the emotions have settled, Real intend to find a striker who can offer a greater threat in reserve. They agreed an option with Manchester United last summer that would £7.5million of  a final sum of around £15million paid at the end of the season, but Real want to place their money elsewhere. Javier Hernandez wheels away after scoring against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final . The Mexico striker's late goal was enough to send Real Madrid through to the semi-finals . Despite his heroics, Real are unlikley to take up an option of making the Man United star's loan permanent . United have no shortage of interest in Hernandez who has one year left on contract and his exploits in the Bernabeu will only strengthen their hand. Orlando of the MLS have tried and failed to convince Hernandez to join them while Dinamo Moscow have made enquiries in the past fortnight. Lazio, who tried to sign him in January before realising he had already played for United this season, maintain an interest while Premier League sides such as Everton, Newcastle, West Ham and Stoke have also asked to be kept informed. Southampton may yet strike a deal involving Nathaniel Clyne going the other way while La Liga rivals Valencia are also among his admirers. The forward is not wanted at United, but has attracted interest from a number of clubs home and abroad . Real Madrid stars (L-R) Pepe, Critsiano Ronaldo, Dani Carvajal and Sergio Ramos celebrate victory . Hernandez has spoken of his frustration at Madrid this season, he has scored four goals in 421 minutes of La Liga football, averaging just under a goal per game and two more in cup competitions.

"Victor Wanyama took to social media on Thursday in a bid to dismiss rumours he was set to quit Southampton for Arsenal. 'To cut the story short have never spoken to Wenger,' Kenyam midfielder Wanyama wrote on Twitter, prompting an outpouring of praise from Southampton fans, and less enthusiastic responses from Gunners supporters. The Saints enforcer later followed those comments with a series of tweets, saying: 'The newspaper article does not say that I have spoken to Wenger or anyone else from Arsenal - and that's the truth.' Victor Wanyama's stock has risen in the Premier League since arriving at Southampton from Celtic . Saints midfielder claims that he has never spoken to Arsene Wenger over a move to the Emirates . The Sun linked the 23-year-old with Arsenal, quoting Wanyama as saying Wenger had been discussing him and had 'let it be known' he was interested in signing the former Celtic powerhouse. He was linked with the Gunners before moving from Celtic to Southampton for £12.5million in 2013 and his stock has risen in the Premier League after forging a midfield partnership with another reported Arsenal target  Morgan Schneiderlin. The Kenya international reportedly told The Sun that he is open to a move that would see him playing Champions League football next season after Wenger expressed interest in signing him. According to the paper, Wanyama said: 'Wenger has been talking about me, and he has let it be known he would like to sign me this summer, . 'Arsenal are a great club and I'd love to play Champions League football as I loved being on that stage with Celtic. 'But we've had a fantastic season at Saints and I want to stay focused on helping the club qualify for Europe. Then we'll see where I end up in the summer.' Southampton are expected to lose more players in the summer, including Morgan Schneiderlin . Wanyama has reportedly not ruled out a reunion with former Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham . The tough-tackling midfielder has also been linked with a reunion with former Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham and Wanyama has apparently not ruled out a move to the opposite end of north London. 'If I get the chance, maybe,' he reportedly told the Sun. 'You never know what will happen in the future. It's nice to be linked with other clubs as it means I'm playing well.' Despite surprising many with their positive performances this season, especially after losing star players including Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren, Ronald Koeman's side is expected to to lose the likes of Schneiderlin and Nathaniel Clyne at the end of the season.","Victor Wanyama has starred in the heart of Southampton's midfield .

"Chelsea have suffered a blow in their pursuit of Palermo's Paulo Dybala after the striker declared he 'would love to stay in Serie A'.

"Juventus have ruled out a move for Manchester United loan star Radamel Falcao after claiming the Colombia striker's wages are 'beyond their means'. Falcao has endured a difficult period at Old Trafford after arriving in an expensive loan deal from Monaco last summer. The 29-year-old is unlikely to remain at the club after scoring only four goals and failing to force his way into Louis van Gaal's starting XI. Juventus general manager Beppe Marotta has claimed that Falcao wanted to come to Turin last summer but the Serie A champions have now taken themselves out of the race to sign him. Radamel Falcao (right) has scored only four goals since arriving at Manchester United from Monaco . The Colombian is expected to leave in the summer, although Juventus claim they cannot afford him . 'Falcao is a Monaco player on loan at Manchester United and his wages are substantial and beyond our means,' Marotta told La Gazzetta dello Sport. 'It's utopian to imagine him in a Juventus shirt.' However, Marotta did claim the Italians, who reached the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Monaco on Wednesday, were interested in strike pair Paulo Dybala and Edinson Cavani. With former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez set to return to Boca Juniors at the end of the season, Juventus need to reinforce their forward line with Palermo's Dybala and Edinson of Paris Saint Germain at the top of their wishlist. The Serie A champions have expressed an interest in highly rated Palermo youngster Paulo Dybala . With Dybala rated at £35m, PSG's unsettled striker Edinson Cavani could be a cheaper alternative . 'We do like Dybala and he is one of our objectives,' Marotta said. 'I won't hide the fact that I have met with [Palermo president Maurizio] Zamparini -- even if I do go and deny it, he will only blurt it out anyway. 'He's a great player, but alongside him you need experienced players too. We're trying to find an agreement with Zamparini for this player who we like, but we're not the only ones who like him. Let's just see what happens.' Juventus players celebrate after beating Monaco to reach the Champions League semi-finals . The 21-year-old, who has scored 13 goals this term, is rated at £35million by his club - a fee that the Old Lady would not be prepared to meet, leading Marotta to also express his interest in Uruguay forward Cavani. 'We've not had any contact with Paris Saint-Germain for Cavani, but if he were to be placed on the market, then we would have a little chat,' Marotta said.","Monaco loanee Radamel Falcao is not expected to stay at Man Utd .

De Bruyne tussles with Schalke's Sead Kolasinac during Wolfsburg's 1-1 draw at the Volkswagen Arena . Speaking to The Guardian, De Koster said: 'For the moment, there are no formal discussions. Of course in the next few weeks I will be going around the world to talk about the situation with Kevin but this is just informal information. 'I will talk to everybody but Kevin is very, very happy with Wolfsburg and the way they have treated him since he arrived from Chelsea last year. 'There are still five games to play and hopefully they can make sure of a place in the Champions League next season so it is a little bit too early to be making any decisions.

"Not only does Gareth Bale definitely want to stay at Real Madrid beyond the end of this season but he is determined to win over some of the hardest to please supporters in football and become the best player in the world. Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid. Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United . Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters . Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final . He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's £86million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify. His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday . The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes . The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey . The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season . He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend. Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas . De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea . De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for £18million . All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season. Bale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid. It only remains to be seen just how much De Gea wants to join him in the Spanish capital.","Gareth Bale has been linked with a summer move to Manchester United .

"Arsenal must make a swift decision on Petr Cech this summer or risk losing out on the goalkeeper. The Chelsea shot-stopper looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season after losing the No 1 spot to Thibaut Courtois. Cech will hold talks with manager Jose Mourinho at the end of the season where the keeper will confirm his decision to leave west London. Arsenal must make a swift decision on Petr Cech this summer or risk losing out on the goalkeeper . The Chelsea stopper looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season after losing his No 1 spot . Arsene Wenger must be swift with a move for his top goalkeeping target to beat the competition to him . The Gunners are long-term admirers of Cech and are considering a move for the keeper ahead of next season. However, Arsenal will not be the only club interested in luring Cech when the transfer window reopens. Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain, Roma and Inter Milan are all showing an interest in the 32-year-old and Cech is understood to be keen on resolving his future as quickly as possible this summer. That means the Gunners could miss out on their primary goalkeeping target if they don't make an early move. However, there are some major obstacles Arsenal must overcome before landing Cech. The first is the goalkeeper's valuation. Despite the fact Cech enters the final year of his contract this summer, Chelsea will demand in excess of £10million for the custodian. Thibaut Courtois has become Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper after three years on loan at Atletico Madrid . Chelsea's stance over their players joining rivals weakened with the sale of Juan Mata to Manchester United . The Blues believe Cech can play for at least another eight seasons and that his next club will be signing a world class goalkeeper in his prime. His price will reflect that view. Likewise, the Gunners may find that Chelsea are reluctant to sell them Cech. In recent years, the Blues have shown a hesitancy in selling players to their Premier League rivals, though that stance weakened last season with Juan Mata's exit to Manchester United. Cech and Courtois have spent a season sharing the gloves at Chelsea, but the veteran will now move on . Signing Cech would significantly strengthen the Gunners next season, and Chelsea could yet refuse to sell the keeper to their London rivals. Cech would consider moving to the Emirates Stadium, despite spending over 10 years with Chelsea, and hopes his long period of service will allow him to make the final decision on his next destination.","Arsenal risk missing out of Chelsea's Petr Cech is they hesitate on move .

"Inter Milan target Yaya Toure has admitted that he is open to 'new challenges' and will not remain at Manchester City just to pick up his £220,000-a-week wages. The Premier League champions want to reshape their squad this summer after a disappointing season and they could look to offload the 31-year-old, who has struggled to hit top form. Toure, who is wanted by his former manager Roberto Mancini, appears open to a move away from the Etihad if the right opportunity presents itself at the end of the season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has hinted that he is open to leaving Manchester City this summer . Toure is challenged by West Ham's Mark Noble during City's 2-0 win at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon . Toure celebrates with Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas after the Argentine's goal against West Ham . Speaking to Foot Mercato, he said: 'No amount of wages will make me stay at a club if I feel that I no longer belong there or if no challenge exists for me. 'It would be unjust on my part. There comes a moment where numbers don't stop us, it goes beyond that, even if the English press seem more interested in the numbers than the sport itself. 'For the future, I don't know more than you do, because I will always go where I am offered new challenges. That is in my nature. 'When I arrived at City, [Manuel] Pellegrini was not the coach. Just like the players, managers arrive and leave. As I have said before, I owe it to the City fans to fight until the end of my career at this club. 'My decisions will not be affected by changes in management, but more by the challenges that will be offered to me.'

Toure's form has been disappointing this season and City are likely to try and sell him this summer . Whether Manuel Pellegrini remains manager or is sacked this summer will not affect Toure's decision . Some of Toure's performances have been heavily criticised but the Ivorian remains defiant. 'When things are not necessarily going well in a club, the key players take the fall,' he added. 'I am not the only one to have been attacked even if there is tendency to be harsher with me.

"Manchester United have ramped up their efforts to sign PSV Eindhoven star Memphis Depay by making an official approach for the 21-year-old. The Eredivisie champions have confirmed that the Red Devils have made a move over the Holland international - with United manager Louis van Gaal keen to make him one of his first  signings this summer. Van Gaal is already familiar with the qualities of Depay having named him in his 23-man World Cup squad last year as Holland finished third in Brazil.

Depay (right) was often used from the substitutes bench by Van Gaal as Holland finished third in Brazil . Premier League rivals Tottenham were keen on signing Depay last summer but saw their £15million offer rebuffed by PSV. And now it appears United are in pole position to land the signature of the Dutch giants' No 7 - despite competition from some of Europe's biggest club's including Paris-Saint Germain. 'That was last summer. Now Depay is worth more than that,' PSV technical director Marcel Brands said of Tottenham's bid nearly 12 months ago. 'It's true there has been contact with Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain and a third, big European club. 'But this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money.' Depay is enjoying a prolific season at the Philips Stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season.

Depay (right) celebrates the Dutch giants' success with manager Phillip Cocu after the match . Early years and PSV Eindhoven . Born in 1994, Depay started out at hometown club VV Moordrecht - a Dutch amateur side in south Holland - at the age of six before joining Sparta Rotterdam three years later. The son of a Ghanaian father and Dutch mother, Depay moved to PSV at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in September 2011 having impressed during a trial. Depay signed his first professional contract in June 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the Dutch giants. Playing style . Pacy, with neat close control, Depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire Eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign. Adding more goals to his game this season, the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot. Often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside, Depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents. However, still at a young age and learning the game, the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long. Talent to one day match Arjen Robben... and already better than a young Cristiano Ronaldo? While Depay has been tipped to become as good as Dutch star Arjen Robben by PSV manager Phillip Cocu, one man believes the Holland youngster could one day rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age. Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better. 'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.' Meanwhile, former Holland midfielder Cocu said of Depay: 'Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben? I think so. 'They are different players, but they are both fast and have a good shot. And both always have the urge to learn. 'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn.' Depay's PSV team-mate Stijn Schaars is also a fan and told Helden Online: 'He's doing everything to reach the top. 'He has a body of a true athlete, power and flair. I'm not afraid of him losing his head. His drive is huge. I like him a lot.' International star and World Cup goalscorer . Depay was handed his first Oranje call-up by Louis van Gaal in 2013 and was selected for Holland's World Cup squad a year later. The energetic frontman scored the winning goal in Holland's 3-2 victory over Australia, before coming off the bench to net against Chile and help Van Gaal's men seal top spot in Group B. Having impressed in Brazil, Depay was nominated for the tournament's 'Best Young Player' award but lost out to France midfielder Paul Pogba.

"Manchester City are preparing bids for English trio Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley and Jay Rodriguez as part of a summer Anglification of their squad. The club are well aware of a lack of homegrown talent at senior level with the departure of Frank Lampard and uncertainty over James Milner's future exacerbating the problem. Etihad Stadium chiefs have moved to address the situation and are expected to lodge offers for Liverpool winger Sterling, Everton midfielder Barkley and Southampton striker Rodriguez. Raheem Sterling would cost in region of £50million but the forward could buy out the final year of his contract . Everton midfielder Ross Barkley has been inconsistent this season but would command a hefty fee . Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez has not played this season but City are monitoring his return from injury . Club bosses believe the young pair on Merseyside, aged 20 and 21, can not only make an impact at fist-team level but can inject youth into an ageing squad. Sterling has refused to sign a new £100,000-a-week contract at Anfield, with the player and his advisers believing they can get £150,000 elsewhere. The England flyer is valued at £50m. However, he can buy out the final year of his contract for £1.7m, which may force Liverpool to accept an effectively half-priced bid of £25m. Barkley has had an inconsistent season, summed up by his penalty miss in Saturday's 1-0 win over Burnley, but is still expected to command a hefty fee. City are long-term admirers of Rodriguez, 25, and have been monitoring his comeback from a injury. The Lancashire lad suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury against City and Saints boss Ronald Koeman revealed he could return to action in the final game of the season against the same side. Frank Lampard was one of six homegrown players on their squad list this season, but will leave in the summer . Premier League rules state that clubs must have eight homegrown players in squads of 25. To achieve homegrown status, players born outside the UK can qualify as long as they have been at a club's academy for three years before their 21st birthday. If clubs cannot find eight they have to reduce their squads accordingly. City's list featured six homegrown players this term including Lampard, who will join sister club New York City FC in July and Milner who is still pondering his future. Their contract offer to former Aston Villa and Newcastle United man Milner remains on the table, however, there is interest from Premier League rivals Liverpool and Arsenal and a host of clubs from Italy and Spain. Despite rumours to the contrary, the 29-year-old Yorkshireman is yet to decide where his future lies. England international James Milner is out of contract in the summer and is considering his options . Milner can now speak Spanish after enlisting the help of a private tutor and regularly tests his newly-attained skill out on the likes of Pablo Zabaleta and David Silva, although the arrival of a baby daughter last summer may keep him on home soil. After a poor run of form City, whose Under 18s take on Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup Final on Monday night, will not retain their Premier League title and securing a Champions League place is paramount to their plans. Should they fail to do so an under-pressure Pellegrini will face the axe. Despite intense speculation linking outgoing Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp with the post, Pellegrini is expected to see out the final year of his contract should his side finish in the top four.","Manchester City will make a concerted effort to sign English players .

"Juventus striker Carlos Tevez has refuted claims suggesting he will rejoin Boca Juniors in the summer by insisting he is yet to make a decision on his future. Tevez has said throughout his career that he wanted to end his career at his boyhood club but it appears the Argentine outfit will have to wait for his signature.

However Tevez has thrown cold water over the 'chicken dance' interpretation by telling Sky Sport Italia: 'That game [against River] does not come into it. 'I celebrated like that because I promised my people that I would and I will do the same if I score against Monaco [on Wednesday]. 'As for my future, enough! It's not right to speak about me.

"Hearts have confirmed that captain Danny Wilson will leave the club this summer after the defender activated a clause in his contract. Despite having a further year left on his current deal at Tynecastle, the 23-year-old has decided to look for a new challenge in the wake of leading the Gorgie outfit to Championship title success.

Sam Nicholson (centre) celebrates after scoring the opener in Hearts 2-1 defeat of Raith at the weekend . ‘Danny’s probably seen it all in the two and a half years that he’s been here, and probably had good cause to leave sooner if he had wished to do so. ‘He took a pay cut during the bad times and was instrumental in helping to keep spirits up when things looked bleak; buying season tickets and donating them to club charity Big Hearts, and donating several raffle prizes for club events and then buying them back. ‘He had options to go at the start of this season but he stayed because he wanted to see the job through and get us back to the top flight so for that I can’t thank him enough. Celtic manager Ronny Deila has been linked with a move for the former Rangers player . ‘We’ll miss him on and off the park and he’s been a great captain but that’s football; players join and players leave and we’re no different here at Hearts. ‘We’ll continue to work hard to assemble a squad that can challenge for a top-half spot in the Premiership.’ Wilson is suspended for this weekend’s clash with Cowdenbeath but is set to lift the Championship trophy on May 2 as Hearts wrap up the campaign at home to Rangers.","Scottish Championship winners Hearts are set to lose Danny Wilson .

'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements.

Cavani has not been as instrumental to the club's fortunes this season as he was last year but came off the bench to score twice against Bastia in Saturday's League Cup final win. PSG are thought to have doubts about the future of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and should he leave they would certainly want to keep Cavani. The Uruguayan joined the French champions in a £50million deal from Napoli in the summer of 2013.

"Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri this summer as the Barclays Premier League champions look to repair the damage of a disastrous title defence. City manager Manuel Pellegrini is under intense scrutiny following Sunday’s 4-2 defeat by neighbours Manchester United. But as the City board refuse to give up on their manager just yet the decision has been made to jettison high-profile players who the club believe have failed them. Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure this summer . The Premier League champions are also open to allowing Samir Nasri leave the Etihad Stadium . Toure will be made available before his value in the market dwindles. Nasri, meanwhile, has barely played since his lame showing in the Champions League at Barcelona. Defender Aleksandar Kolarov and striker Edin Dzeko are also short of admirers within the club, while midfielder James Milner is out of contract this summer. Toure may be difficult to sell as he earns in excess of £1million a month. Pellegrini is vulnerable but may be saved by a relatively undemanding fixture list up to the end of the season and by the fact that City’s No 1 choice to replace him, Pep Guardiola, is contracted to Bayern Munich for another year. However, City fear captain Vincent Kompany will miss a few weeks of the run-in with a thigh injury.","Manchester City were beaten 4-2 by their rivals United at Old Trafford .

"A Labour politician who stood against Britain’s first elected Muslim mayor has won a High Court battle over claims that he was a ‘wife beater’. Helal Abbas, 55, lost his bid to become the mayor of Tower Hamlets in East London days after the claim appeared in an ethnic freesheet. The race was won by Lutfur Rahman, 50, a controversial figure who has been accused in a separate High Court case of rigging his re-election victory last year. Mr Rahman denies those charges. Helal Abbas, 55, lost his bid to become the mayor of Tower Hamlets in East London days after the claim appeared in an ethnic freesheet . During the 2010 campaign, the London Bangla ran an advert accusing Mr Abbas of assaulting his ex-wife. An article accompanying the advert was headlined A Right Mayoral Punch-Up. The weekly freesheet – written in Bengali and English – was a fierce supporter of Mr Rahman and was distributed outside mosques in the area. Mr Abbas lost the election by 12,000 votes. The victory by Mr Rahman – a former Labour councillor who stood as an independent after he was thrown out of the party over alleged links to Islamists – was seen as an embarrassment for Ed Miliband. The race was won by Lutfur Rahman, 50, a controversial figure who has been accused in a separate High Court case of rigging his re-election victory last year . Mr Abbas started court proceedings against London Bangla’s editor, Shah Yousuf, 35, soon after the election. After a four-year legal battle, Mr Yousuf has admitted there was ‘no truth to the allegation’ and has agreed to pay damages and legal costs. When The Mail on Sunday contacted Mr Yousuf, he asked for all questions to be emailed to him, which we did. However, he then refused to answer them.","Labour politician Helal Abbas lost bid to become mayor of Tower Hamlets .

"Incredible footage of a Sydney train station flooding during the storm of a decade on Wednesday has been captured on CCTV. A time lapse video, filmed from the platform over a 45 minute period at 11am, shows the water creeping along the tracks at Bardwell Park in Sydney's south forcing the partial closure of the T2 Airport line. At one point a worker in a high-vis jacket appears to look at the rising water to take a photo. The murky flood water eventually submerges the train line and begins moving like a river past the platform. Sydney's two-day total rainfall  totalled about 225mm by 9am Wednesday – the most fall for almost 17 years. A time lapse video, filmed from the platform between 11am and 11.45am, shows storm water creeping along the tracks at Bardwell Park in Sydney's south . Although the storm had passed by Thursday, about 80 sets of traffic lights are still out across the city, and a number of main roads remain closed due to flooding. Twelve local government areas have been declared natural disaster zones, from Sydney's northern beaches to the Hunter Valley. Meanwhile, thousands of people remain stranded in parts of New South Wales as emergency services begin to clean up after devastating weather smashed the state over three days. On Thursday morning, the NSW State Emergency Service said about 2000 people in the Hunter Region - including the Macdonald Valley, Webbs Creek Valley and Colo Valley - are expected to be isolated for days.

"A coroner has warned of the dangers of bedside cots after a seven-week-old baby choked to death. Grace Joy Roseman died after she managed to manoeuvre herself over the edge of her crib and a ‘safety ridge’ cut off the oxygen to her brain. West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield yesterday issued a report expressing concern over the Bednest Bedside cot, which was endorsed by the charity National Children’s Trust, saying urgent action must be taken to prevent future deaths. Tragic: Seven-week-old Grace Joy Roseman died after she managed to move over the edge of her adjustable cot and a 'safety' ridge cut off oxygen supply to her brain, West Sussex Coroner's Court heard . Concerns: The webpage of the luxury cot which has been linked with her death. A coroner has called for the 'dangerous' cot to be pulled from the shelves after the newborn baby girl was strangled . Grace’s mother Esther put her down for a nap at around 8.30am on April 9. The cot – which is designed to be placed next to a parent’s bed – has a moveable panel on one side which can be folded down, leaving a ridge just 7cm high. Mrs Roseman returned about 90 minutes later to find Grace unresponsive, lying with her head over the edge of the cot. The provisional cause of death was given as asphyxia, caused by the ridge cutting off the oxygen supply from Grace’s windpipe. In her report, Mrs Schofield listed a number of concerns surrounding the cot. She said: ‘In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths ... should another baby be placed in the prone position and left with the side incompletely lowered again in one of these cots, another death could occur. 'If the cot’s side is not safe to be incompletely lowered or for the cot to be tilted more than 5cms then it should be questioned as to whether these should be options available at all.’ Grace’s father Gideon, who lives with his wife in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, said: ‘There are no words that can describe how we feel about the loss of our beautiful little Gracie. Grace's parents told the inquest 'We are eternally grateful to the doctors and nurses at the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath (pictured), who did everything possible to try and save our little Gracie' ‘She was just starting to develop her own little personality and was always smiling. We would not wish any parent to have to go through such a devastating loss.’ The National Children’s Trust has pulled the cot from sale and stopped all pending orders going out. Susie Parsons, interim chief executive of the charity, said: ‘This is a tragedy and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the Roseman family at this time. ‘We have immediately suspended all sales and despatches of the Bednest crib until the completion of the inquiry and we will also undertake our own detailed and thorough review.’ Bednest, which is based in Stratford-upon-Avon, is still selling the cribs on their website from £249. The page boasts an endorsement from Jools Oliver, the wife of celebrity chef Jamie. Mrs Oliver writes: ‘We love the Bednest ... I love the way it is so close to our bed the sides are really easy to pull down. ‘Easy and definitely eliminates the fear of falling asleep with them in your bed and suffocating them as they lay safe next to you but in their own safe little cosy bed.’ A spokesman for Bednest told MailOnline: ‘We are greatly saddened and extend our heartfelt condolences to Grace’s parents. ‘We are doubly upset to hear this news, since the concept behind Bednest’s design is first and foremost about baby health and safety and came originally from highly experienced neo-natal nurses. ‘It is not the case that the coroner has called the cot “dangerous” and asked for it to be withdrawn. ‘The coroner has highlighted that all safety guidelines for the correct use of the crib are laid out in the instruction manual, but due to a growing second-hand market for our Bednest cribs, these instruction manuals may not be passed on. This may be, sadly, what happened with Grace’s crib. ‘We are now considering displaying basic instructions on the side of the crib itself.’","Seven-week-old Grace Roseman died in adjustable Bednest Bed Side crib .

"Ronny Deila insisted on Friday night that Scottish football would benefit if referees gave a public explanation of their decisions after matches. The Celtic manager stressed he still had a positive view of officiating in this country despite the Josh Meekings handball debacle that helped kill his Treble dream last weekend. But Deila has called for similar transparency as in his Norwegian homeland, arguing that referees facing the media would help quell long-running furores and improve relationships. Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaks to the officials after his side's Scottish Cup semi-final loss to Inverness . Celtic wrote to the SFA in the aftermath of last weekend's defeat to Inverness, seeking 'to understand' how Steven McLean and his assistants failed to act on the Meekings incident. 'When my team has a bad performance, I have to stand in front of newspapers and everybody,' said Deila. 'If it's good, it's good. If it's bad, it's bad, but I have to stand up to it. 'I can't understand what the problem is with the referees doing it as well. 'They could say: 'I made a bad mistake, I'm so sorry, I'm irritated at myself, I should have done it better, I should learn from this.' What could you say after that? 'It's not important for me to speak with the referee. It's the Press. If the Press has a question for me and I say no comment, it never stops. If I say what I think, then you move on. 'It would be good for referees. We all know they will make mistakes in the future and do good and bad things. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . 'We will do the same, but just to be open and honest gets you much more respect. You have to be able to handle it through good times and bad times. 'If they shut themselves away, you don't get answers and that's why we are writing a letter to them just asking what happened. 'If not, we don't need to do that. They tell it to television. What's the problem? More and more in Norway, the referees go to speak to the media after the match.' Speaking in December, Deila said that Scottish referees had been 'fantastic' since he came to Celtic and that he had encountered more problems in European matches. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . 'I haven't changed my mind,' he insisted. 'You see mistakes all over Europe and I think the referees here have been good, I have no problems with that. 'It's just afterwards there are a lot of things. So many meetings, appeals, I can't understand that system. But that's not up to me, it's up to others.' Referees have performances evaluated by assessors but Deila feels it would be better if they came under a more public disciplinary system similar to managers and players. 'I think it is strange that we have to do it and not the referees,' he added. 'We are all one unit – football. 'I think it should be the same rules for everybody. If my players are not performing well then I talk with them. And the solution might be that they are out of the team. 'How do you punish a referee? You could give another referee a chance instead, give someone a break. 'In Norway referees get banned as well. They get told they have to go down to the first division for a couple of matches or have a week off and then come back again.

"Alan Pardew will target a marquee signing this summer so his Crystal Palace side are taken seriously next season. Pardew has transformed Palace into relegation candidates to a club pushing for a top-half finish since taking charge in January. He will be active in the transfer market come the end of the season in an attempt to take the club to the next level and is keen to bring in a big name to declare the club’s intentions. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is keen on bringing in a star name to boost the club's profile . Eagles boss Pardew slapped a '40 to 60 million pounds' price-tag on Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie . ‘That is a solution to not just give us a better media standing than we have, but to also give everybody else here the recognition in terms of their value that we could attract a player of that type,’ Pardew said. ‘That is something I have thought about.’ Pardew is prepared to let star winger Yannick Bolasie leave for ‘between 40 and 60 million pounds’ and would use the money to build a formidable squad. But even if that does not happen, Pardew, whose side host relegation strugglers Hull City on Saturday, is adamant that he will be backed by chairman Steve Parish. The former Newcastle boss was able to make five permanent signings in January and will look to add several more when the transfer window re-opens. Pardew added: ’To be honest, the chairman is as much banging on my door as I am his. The most important thing is we get good value.’ While Palace may seek to break the £7million club transfer record set with the September 2014 arrival of James McArthur from Wigan, Pardew is loath to do so lightly. Palace broke their club transfer record in September 2014 when they splashed out £7m on James McArthur . 'It isn't just about the money and isn't just about the figure that you pay,' said Pardew. 'It really is about are they better than what you have. 'Therefore what is their value? And that is what you have to gauge. 'I have to say this club has done very well in the transfer market prior to me coming in. I think in that window just passed we bought really well, but really we haven't seen them. 'I haven't had to lean on Shola Ameobi, Jordon Mutch, Chungy (Lee Chung-yong) too much really. 'And I really did think, particularly in Shola, that he was going to be a massive player for us if it got close. 'In a way the team have taken that equation away.' Pardew has guided Palace out of the relegation mire since his January arrival, with the Eagles fifth in the Premier League standings on 2015's fixtures alone. Victory over Hull in Saturday's Selhurst Park clash would rubber-stamp Palace's top-flight safety, and Pardew admitted he is eager to make what experiments he can with next term in mind. 'There could be an opportunity to look for next year and that is what I am going to do between now and the end of the year,' he said. 'I will try and keep our professionalism together, but also look at Chungy and Jordon Mutch and how they are going to impact on what is a good team at the moment. 'We still have some big games though, so I have to look at that and can't be experimenting in some. 'It is about making sure whatever team goes out there is every bit as good as the team that has played in the last few weeks.'

"Lorient climbed clear of the Ligue 1 relegation zone with a remarkable 5-3 win at Marseille as the home side's alarming slump continued at the Stade Velodrome. Three successive defeats had destroyed Marseille's hopes of landing the Ligue 1 title and they had not won at home since January 31, but the odds were still stacked against visitors Lorient who knew nothing other than victory would take them out of the bottom three. Florian Thauvin might have given Marseille a sixth-minute lead after combining with Andre-Pierre Gignac but the Breton side were 2-0 ahead inside 13 minutes through Jordan Ayew and Francois Bellugou. Lorient's Jordan Ayew celebrates with team mates after scoring against Marseille in a 5-3 away victory . Pierre-Andre Gignac looks as if he cannot believe it as early title contenders Marseille's season falls apart . Ayew punished his former club with a fine volley after nine minutes following Lamine Gassama's cross and Romain Philippoteaux's clever back heel into his path. Four minutes later Yann Jouffre's free-kick saw Ayew beat Jeremy Morel in the air and Bellugou's powerful header did the rest. Dimitri Payet's pace offered Marseille hope of a comeback as the first half ended and Marcelo Bielsa's side were level halfway through the second period. Ayew's brother Andre halved the deficit with a 59th-minute backheel flick after Payet's 35-metre free-kick had come back off a post and then Morel powered home a header eight minutes later from 12 yards. Both Andre (left) and Jordan (right) Ayew scored in the game, but the latter made the difference with a brace . The Lorient players celebrate a famous victory, and it was their first win in a poor run of five games . But - a minute later - Philippoteaux put Lorient ahead again with a run through the static home defence, only for Belgian substitute Michy Batshuayi to equalise with 14 minutes remaining after racing onto a long ball from Alaixys Romao. But Marseille capitulated in the final six minutes as Jordan Ayew scored his second from a fine solo run before Mathias Autret secured Lorient's first win in five games after home goalkeeper Steve Mandanda had parried his first effort.","Lorient made it out of the Ligue 1 relegation zone by beating Marseille .

"The Josh Meekings’ saga took a new twist on Friday when it emerged the SFA judicial panel had decided it was not entitled to apply retrospective punishment in his case. On Thursday, the Inverness defender was cleared to play in the Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk on May 30 after a charge of deliberate handball to deny Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths in last Sunday’s semi-final was thrown out. In the aftermath of the 3-2 extra-time win, Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . His admission – backed by manager John Hughes – preceded the player being cited by the SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan. That unprecedented move following a game in which a handball incident had gone unpunished, brought a warning from Jim Boyce, head of FIFA’s referees committee, that a successful prosecution would open up a can of worms. Although such a scenario was avoided with the charge being kicked out, the furore surrounding the issue prompted the SFA go public on Friday with the tribunal panel’s reasons. And it seems they accepted the preliminary argument of Inverness’ legal representative that they weren’t entitled to take the matter further. A statement read: ‘Further to the judicial panel hearing on Friday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings’ solicitor. ‘In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . ‘The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. ‘It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.’ The explanation raises questions as to whether McGlennan ought to have cited Meekings in the first place. Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded against Celtic . However, legal sources have told Sportsmail that the SFA’s prosecutor is entitled to cite players even in such instances when officials have seen an ‘incident’ but have failed to spot an ‘offence’. Yet it appears that in Meekings’ case, the panel concurred with his solicitor’s argument that they were not entitled to take the matter further as the match officials had seen the incident. The matter is further confused by the fact that former Hearts striker Ryan Stevenson and ex-Motherwell keeper Darren Randolph were previously banned retrospectively for serious foul play as the referees in question had seen the ‘incidents’ but missed the ‘offences’ in question.","Josh Meekings deliberately handled the ball during Inverness's 3-2 Scottish Cup semi-final victory against Celtic .

"Ronald Koeman has promised not leave Southampton this summer, even if Barcelona were to come calling. Eyebrows were raised by some last summer when the Dutch great took the reins of what many expected to be a sinking ship. Koeman, though, has been revelation in his first season in English football, not only steering Saints to calmer waters but new heights. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has promised not leave Southampton this summer for a bigger club . Barcelona and the likes of Neymar (top) are not of interest to Koeman after his successful season . Even managing Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid does not appeal over England's south coast for Koeman . Only a point is needed to break the record Premier League points tally set last season under Mauricio Pochettino, who returns to St Mary's for the first time since leaving last summer when Tottenham arrive on Saturday. The former Saints boss is unlikely to receive a particularly warm welcome at St Mary's after jumping ship - something Koeman has told fans he would not do this summer. Asked this week at a Barclays Q&A event what he would do if Real Madrid came calling this summer, the Dutchman said: 'Oh, Real Madrid? No, no, no. Not with Real Madrid. Never, never. You can trust me.' When asked what he would say if former club Barcelona came calling, Koeman said laughing: 'Oh, you make it more difficult. No, I stay. Koeman's Southampton only need a point to break their record Premier League points tally set last season . Saints were tipped by many for relegation in pre-season but they have a chance of European qualification . 'I am still young for the manager role. It is good to stay and to be the manager of Southampton. 'It is a very nice experience to be part of the Premier League.

"Follow your heart. That's the advice of Carl Jenkinson to Jack Grealish as the young Aston Villa star weighs up his international future. The West Ham defender, on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season, knows the predicament that faces the teenager torn between representing the Republic of Ireland or England. Jenkinson has experienced an identical international limbo before. Carl Jenkinson (left) says Jack Grealish should follow his heart when choosing Ireland or England . In 2012, a year after his big move from Charlton to the club he supported as a boy - Arsenal - the Essex-born full-back chose the Three Lions despite having played for Finland, the nation of his mother, at Under 18 and Under 21 level. It wasn't a decision Jenkinson took lightly, but it is one he firmly believes was the right decision. And now the Hammers star, 23, is advising boy-of-the-moment Grealish to also do what feels right for him. 'You’ve got to follow your heart,' he said, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail. 'Follow where you feel like you belong and play for them. That would be my advice. 'That’s what I did with the whole England-Finland situation. Finland were great to me when I was younger and I really enjoyed playing for them. The Aston Villa midfielder (centre right) has been an instant hit since breaking into the first team . 'It was a great experience at the time because I was playing against some of the best teams in the world. I was only in the Charlton reserves yet I was going off to be against all these different countries. It was fantastic for me and I really enjoyed it. 'But then it came to a crunch time where I had to pick and I had to ask myself: ""What do I feel – English or Finnish?"" The answer was English. I was born in England and I feel English, so that was the decision I made. 'I don’t know Jack but my advice to him would be to follow what feels right. I’m sure he will.' The clock is ticking for Grealish to make up his mind with Ireland boss Martin O'Neill understood to be keen to include him in his plans for the friendly against Roy Hodgson's England in Dublin this summer. The young winger played for Ireland at youth level but can still play for the England senior side . Jenkinson's superb form at West Ham this season has propelled him back into the international reckoning, meanwhile. An established fixture in the Under 21s set-up, the towering defender has earned calls to reclaim a place in the senior side. He is patient, however, despite his burning desire to add to the one cap he collected against Sweden almost three years ago when he came on as a substitute. Jenkinson harbours an ambition to lead his country to glory at this summer's Under 21s European Championships in Czech Republic, hoping to catch Hodgson's eye with next year's senior Euros not far away. Jenkinson was in the same predicament as Grealish when he had to choose between Finland and England . 'It is a massive opportunity for us,' he said. 'I think Roy Hodgson will be watching all the games and having a keen look at all the players. The senior Euros are a year after, so this will be a great chance for us to go and impress. 'When I speak to the lads, because I stay in touch with quite a few of them, everyone can’t wait for it. 'It’s a massive stage and something that we’ve worked hard for. We’re confident in ourselves. We feel that we can go there and really give it a good go. Roy Hodgson and his staff are believed to be fans of the young winger and want him to commit to England . 'We’ve shown in the friendlies we’ve played recently, like against Germany and Czech Republic, and we’ve beaten them. We know we can do it. It’s just about going there this summer and reproducing it. 'Obviously that’s something in the past that we’ve struggled with as a nation. But what a better time to change it and what a great thing it would be to go and win it.' For now, Jenkinson is focused on revitalising West Ham's season. Having started so impressively, reaching the top four at Christmas, the wheels have fallen off since the turn of the New Year. Jenkinson took part in a short film for Betway promoting #HammersAtTheArrers competition . In their past 11 Premier League games, the Hammers have won only once - and that was courtesy of a last minute winner at home to struggling Sunderland a month ago. The Hammers play QPR at Loftus Road on Saturday, their London rivals who are fighting for their lives at the foot of the table. Jenkinson expects it won't be a pretty affair but is confident Sam Allardyce's side can produce the goods to kickstart their charge for an eighth place finish. Manager Sam Allardyce also took part and he can be seen preparing to throw a dart . Joey O'Brien (from left), Winston Reid and Kevin Nolan laugh at their team-mates attempts . 'Team like QPR are probably even harder than playing teams who are in the top half at this stage. It’s always the same towards the end of the season,' he said. 'They all pick up points because they’re fighting for their lives at the end of the day – now we’ve got to be aware of that and we need to be ready for that. 'It’s going to be a proper scrap at the weekend. But we’ll have to dig in if we want to get a result. Diego Poyet looks on as he attempts to score high in the Betway darts competition at the training ground . Jenkinson showed he's not just a bad footballer with some impressive dart scoring . 'I think Swansea are only four points ahead of us. They’re in eighth. That would be a fantastic season if we could finish in eighth. 'Of course, you just want to finish in the top half. Anything below that would be a disappointment, especially considering how we started and I think everyone would agree with that. 'That eighth place is within reach.’ Jenkinson's club future remains uncertain beyond this season but he appears to be happy at the Hammers. He took part in the club's darts competition, organised by the club's sponsors Betway, who also front the Premier League Darts, earlier this week - and you can watch the footage exclusively at Sportsmail, here. Carl Jenkinson was speaking exclusively to MailOnline at the launch of Betway’s #HammersAtTheArrers competition.

"After West Ham announced a vast reduction in season ticket prices earlier this week, manager Sam Allardyce has labelled the move the best business by any Premier League club in a long time. Ahead of their relocation to the Olympic Stadium in a year’s time, the Hammers became the first club to drop the price of their season tickets off the back of the Premier League’s record three-year, £5.13bn television deal, which comes into effect at the start of the 2016-17 season. West Ham’s cheapest adult season ticket for that campaign will cost £289 – a considerable saving on the £620 equivalent this season. And Allardyce feels this is a shrewd business decision by the club, as maintaining a capacity crowd at their new 54,000-seat Stratford home will be important for West Ham. Manager Sam Allardyce has said that filling the stadium is the most important thing for any football club . West Ham became the first Premier League club to reduce season ticket prices for fans . ‘What we’ve announced has to be the best piece of business, for me, seen in the Premier League for a long, long time,’ Allardyce said. ‘The most important thing at a football club is to fill the stadium. ‘Obviously it’s not from a revenue base like it used to be. The revenue base for a football club used to be the sustainability of the club in my years before the Premier League and before Sky made it a worldwide brand. West Ham's season tickets will cost as little as £289 when the club move to the Olympic Stadium next year . An artist's impression of what the Olympic Stadium will look like during a West Ham match . 'It’s about creating the atmosphere in a stadium that thrills not only the fans there, but the players who respond to that. ‘I think we keep demanding too much financially from the fan. And I think, when you look at where the country has come from since 2008, people are working harder and longer for less. ‘We have to take in mind where they are, and while our money has increased from a revenue point of view, it would be very light-heartening to see that benefit going back to the actual fans who come and watch.’","West Ham became first Premier League club to drop prices since TV deal .

"The Pittsburgh Steelers ended last season without Le'Veon Bell and it seems they'll start the new one without their stud running back too. Bell will miss the first three games for abusing the league's substance abuse policy and he will also be fined a game cheque.

LeGarrette Blount will miss the first game of the new season after being charged with marijuana possession . Former Steeler LeGarrette Blount and a female passenger were also in the car and the pair were charged with marijuana possession. Bell was also charged with a DUI. Blount - who was waived by Pittsburgh, joined the Patriots in November and went on to win the Super Bowl - was banned for the first game of the season earlier this week. Bell plans to appeal the decision, says ESPN's Adam Schefter who broke the story. Bell had 2,215 all-purpose yards, 11 touchdowns and made the All-Pro team last season.

"Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. The bold design of the new £400million stadium, due to be completed for the start of the 2018-19 season, could involve a ‘slide-out’ grass football pitch with an NFL-style synthetic surface housed underneath. The option of extra-large changing rooms, to accommodate NFL squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game, is also being explored by architects. Tottenham are considering sharing their new £400m stadium with an NFL franchise . A spokesman for the north London club did not rule out the possibility this week, confirming that they are ‘looking at options’ in order to ‘future-proof the design’. The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at Wembley this autumn, with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the USA and ready to play again. The clash between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 will kick-off at 1.30pm while the New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins game on October 4 and Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs contest on November 1 will both begin at 2.30pm. As well as allowing the NFL to experiment with a live game on TV at breakfast time in the States (9.30am Eastern time), teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on American soil by Sunday night. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their £757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year’s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: ‘The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.’","Tottenham's new £400m stadium due to be completed for 2018-19 season .

"There was uproar on the south coast when Nicola Cortese sacked local hero Nigel Adkins and replaced him with the relatively unknown Argentine, on English shores at least, Mauricio Pochettino. Adkins had led Southampton to back-to-back promotions into the Barclays Premier League and was fighting valiantly to keep them in it. But Cortese’s decision proved to be an astute one and Pochettino took them to the next level. He increased intensity in training and in matches, altered their style of play, continued their already excellent emphasis on youth and made some shrewd signings. Mauricio Pochettino spent 16 months as Southampton manager before departing to Tottenham . The Argentine manager (right) embraces Ronald Koeman (left) as he took on his former side in October . So much so that 16 months later Daniel Levy saw him as the ideal man to take Tottenham on, too. As Pochettino prepares to return to St Mary’s for the first time since he left, Sportsmail takes a look at how his two tenures compare. YOU DON’T WIN ANYTHING WITH KIDS… . Pochettino came to England with a reputation for bringing through young players - at Espanyol he handed 25 of their youth products a debut. At Southampton he continued to show no fear in throwing them in, giving Premier League debuts to Calum Chambers, who then moved to Arsenal for £16million and has now won senior England caps, and James Ward-Prowse, who is a first-team regular, star of England Under 21s and set for a call up by Roy Hodgson. Pochettino has maintained that approach at Tottenham. He was the first, of many managers who came before, to give Ryan Mason a proper run in the team and this season the player earned a first England cap for his displays. Calum Chambers (left) and James Ward-Prowse (right) both rose to prominence under Pochettino . Harry Kane has flourished under him, too, already around the first team before his arrival albeit, but excelling under Pochettino’s guidance and scoring a sensational 31 goals in all competitions already this season. Nabil Bentaleb is another who has progressed under Pochettino after Tim Sherwood gave him a chance last season, while Pochettino also gave Harry Winks, a 19-year-old midfielder, his first appearance from the bench in the Europa League. Harry Kane has been in sensational form under the former Saints boss this season - scoring 31 times . 2011-12 : 4th (Harry Redknapp as manager) 2012-13 : 5th (Andre Villas-Boas as manager) 2013-14: 6th (Tim Sherwood as manager) 2014-15 *currently 7th (Mauricio Pochettino) LUNG-BUSTING TRAINING . Training sessions under Pochettino have become almost mythical. Speak to any player who has worked under him and they all recall gruelling double and triple sessions, all throughout pre-season and maintained regularly during the campaign. At Southampton when he first arrived he took the team to a Portuguese boot camp and made the players, leading himself by example, walk over hot coals. Not satisfied by their fitness levels, during that first pre-season there would be frequent triple sessions, from 10am-midday, from 2pm-4pm and from 6pm-8pm. During the season, in a typical week he would insist on hard sessions on Tuesdays and Wednesday - often double or triple. On the pitch, it got results. Mauricio Pochettino (left) has deployed strict and grueling training methods at both Spurs and Southampton . It appears there is more of the same at Spurs. ‘There’s not been a good moment in pre-season, if I’m honest,’ Harry Kane said earlier this season. ‘There were double sessions, times when you were pushing yourself to the limit, but you’re doing it for a reason. This is the reason that you’re seeing now.’ Team-mate Moussa Dembele echoed that sentiment, adding: ‘The training sessions are hard, we feel already that we have become more and more fit and that’s very good for us.’ PASSING AND PRESSING PHILOSOPHY . Like many managers, Pochettino has a certain philosophy and is relentlessly demanding that it is reflected on the pitch. At goal kicks the centre halves drop wide around the penalty area, the full backs push 40 yards up the pitch and one of the two central midfielders moves to the edge of the box, giving the goalkeeper options to pass everywhere. A passing and pressing philosophy has been deployed by Pochettino throughout his managerial career . When they are not in possession, pressing is expected high up the pitch - hence the punishing pursuit of supreme fitness levels in training. Tottenham players have taken a while to get used to it, longer than it took Southampton players when Pochettino was first in charge. But there have been signs, when they were beaten once in 10 games and were challenging for the Champions League, that it can work there. ENHANCING INDIVIDUALS . In Pochettino’s role as ‘head coach’ as opposed to all-round manager he has more time to work with individuals, if they go to him desiring to improve their game. Two of Southampton’s current stars, Jay Rodriguez and Nathaniel Clyne, credit the 43-year-old for their progression. ‘He brought the best out of me and gave me self-belief,’ Rodriguez said after his departure. ‘To work with him was brilliant, it was hard work but the lads loved it and we got results. Nathaniel Clyne (left) has credited Pochettino for his development while he was in charge . Jay Rodriguez says Pochettino gave him the 'self belief' to develop as a player . ‘His tactical awareness gave you confidence, you wanted to go out for him because he’s such a great guy. You can talk to him. The players respected him so much.’ Clyne said: ‘He’d have us pressing high, keeping a high line, receiving the ball in difficult situations, keeping possession and basically having the confidence to play football rather than being afraid. 'The understanding in our defence was down to our training. Personally, it took my game to another level.’ UNPROVEN TRANSFER RECORD . The transfer success-rate at both clubs has been similar; solid but not outstanding. At Southampton he made very few - Dejan Lovren proved a snip at £8.5m and was sold on for double that. Victor Wanyama seemed pricey at £12.5m but is one of their most consistent performers and will turn a profit if he moves on soon. Dani Osvaldo cost £15m and ended up attacking a team-mate. Victor Wanyama was a big-money signing from Pochettino, but has turned out to be a success . Equally, at Spurs Eric Dier at £4m looks like a future England international, whereas Ben Davies for £10m could prove too much. Teenager Dele Alli is likely to be a steal at £5m. The others - Michel Vorm, Deandre Yedlin, Federico Fazio and Benjamin Stambouli - are yet to shine. BROKEN ENGLISH . Pochettino would barely ever speak to the press - in TV, radio or to print journalists - in English while he was at Southampton. They employed translator David Salas. Yet occasionally when he was talking after pre-match press conferences, with the cameras and microphones off, he would talk in perfectly understandable English. At Tottenham from the very start he conducted entire press conferences in English and has trusted assistant Jesus Perez to occasionally turn to for help with any misunderstanding. The Spurs boss has spoken in English in his entire press conferences at Tottenham .","Mauricio Pochettino returns to former side Southampton for the first time since leaving last summer .

"Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was found guilty on Wednesday of first-degree murder in a deadly late-night shooting, sealing the downfall of an athlete who once had a $40million contract and a standout career ahead of him. Hernandez, 25, looked to his right and pursed his lips after the jury forewoman read the verdict. The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole in the slaying of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old landscaper and amateur weekend football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez’s fiancee. Hernandez’s mother, Terri, and his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, cried and gasped when they heard the verdict. Shayanna Jenkins wept on his mother’s shoulder. Hernandez later mouthed to them: 'Be strong. Be strong.' Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been found guilty on of first-degree murder . The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole . The conviction sealed the downfall of an athlete who once had a $40million contract and a standout career . The former football pro was also found guilty on firearm and ammunition charges. For reasons that were never made clear to the jury, Lloyd was shot six times in the middle of the night on June 17, 2013, in a deserted industrial park near Hernandez’s home. Police almost immediately zeroed in on Hernandez because they found in Lloyd’s pocket the key to a car the NFL player had rented. Within hours of Hernandez’s arrest, the Patriots cut the former Pro Bowl athlete, who was considered one of the top tight ends in the game. Prosecutors presented a wealth of evidence that Hernandez was with Lloyd at the time he was killed, including home security video from Hernandez’s mansion, witness testimony and cellphone records that tracked Lloyd’s movements. Hernandez’s lawyer, James Sultan, acknowledged for the first time during closing arguments that Hernandez was there when Lloyd was killed. Terri Hernandez clutches her son's fianceé Shayanna as the jury returned a guilty on all counts . Ursula Ward, mother of the victim, reacts to the guilty verdict for former NFL player  Hernandez . Hernandez was pictured posing with a Glock handgun when he was a student in 2009 . Odin Lloyd has been identified as the man who was found dead less than a mile away from the $1.3million mansion of New England Patriots player Hernandez . But the attorney pinned the shooting on two of Hernandez’s friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, saying his client was a '23-year-old kid' who witnessed a shocking crime and didn’t know what to do. Wallace and Ortiz will stand trial later. Prosecutors have suggested Lloyd may have been killed because he knew too much about Hernandez’s alleged involvement in a deadly 2012 drive-by shooting in Boston. But they were not allowed to tell the jury that because the judge said it was speculation. As a result, they never offered a motive beyond saying Hernandez appeared angry with Lloyd at a nightclub two nights before the killing. Hernandez faces further legal trouble: He is awaiting trial on murder charges in the drive-by shooting. He is accused of gunning down two men over a spilled drink at a nightclub. In the Lloyd killing, the defense argued that investigators fixated on Hernandez because of his celebrity and conducted a shoddy investigation in their zeal to confirm their suspicions. A court officer places handcuffs on the wrists Hernandez after the guilty verdict was read during . Shaneah Jenkins, left, girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd, comforts a cousin of Lloyd in the courtroom . THE EVIDENCE . Prosecutors produced neither a murder weapon nor a witness to Lloyd's shooting in a North Attleborough industrial park. Their case hinged on other elements: cellphone records showing Hernandez and two friends communicating with Lloyd around the time of the slaying; Lloyd's phone pinging cell towers between Boston and North Attleborough; surveillance video at Hernandez's home showing him holding a black item that appeared to be a gun minutes after workers at the industrial park heard gunshots; a joint found near Lloyd's body with Hernandez's and Lloyd's DNA on it. THE DEFENSE . During closing arguments, Hernandez lawyer James Sultan for the first time acknowledged what evidence pointed to: Hernandez was there when Lloyd was killed. But he described Hernandez as a witness, a 23-year-old kid who didn't know what to do after seeing a shocking crime. Sultan pinned it on Hernandez's two co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, both of whom have pleaded not guilty and will be tried later. JURY'S ROAD TRIP . Midway through the trial, jurors boarded a bus to tour key spots in the case, including Hernandez's home, the street where the victim lived and the spot where his body was found. State police stood guard as the jury inspected the street in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood where Lloyd lived with his mother and sisters. Jurors also trekked out in the cold to the snow-covered gravel lot where Lloyd's bullet-ridden body was found and toured Hernandez's mansion a mile from the crime scene. TEARS FOR A SON . Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, wept quietly at times during the trial. Overcome with emotion, she would sometimes leave the courtroom in tears when jurors were shown graphic photos of her 27-year-old son's body. Before Ward testified, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ordered her not to cry on the stand. Ward remained stoic. When photos of Lloyd's body in the morgue were shown, she mouthed the words, 'My baby, my baby.' HERNANDEZ'S FIANCEE . Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, was compelled to testify after she was granted immunity from prosecution. Wearing her large diamond engagement ring, Jenkins testified that Hernandez had told her in the days following the shooting that he was not involved. Jenkins testified she removed a box from their basement at his request the day after the slaying but never looked inside before she dumped it in a random trash bin. Prosecutors said the box may have held evidence including the murder weapon. Jenkins, who has a 2-year-old daughter with Hernandez, avoided looking at him during her testimony. THE SISTERS . Jenkins and her younger sister, Shaneah, both attended the trial at times but sat on opposite sides of the courtroom. Shayanna sat behind Hernandez and could be seen joking with him, several times exchanging whispered 'I love yous' when she attended. Shaneah would sit with Lloyd's family. Before he was killed, she and Lloyd had made plans to move in together while she attended law school in Boston. Both sisters testified while the other sat in the audience, watching and sometimes seeming annoyed. THE VERDICT . After Wednesday's verdict was read, Jenkins and Hernandez's mother clutched each other and cried. Hernandez mouthed to them the words, 'Be strong. Be strong.' The verdict came early on the seventh day of jury deliberations. He was automatically sentenced to life in prison without parole. Prosecutors said Hernandez organized the killing, summoned his two friends to help carry it out, and drove Lloyd and the others to the secluded spot in the industrial park. During closing arguments, prosecutors also accused Hernandez of pulling the trigger, though under the law it was not necessary to prove who fired the shots to convict him. Security video from inside Hernandez’s home showed him holding what appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd was killed. The surveillance system also captured Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz relaxing at his home hours after Lloyd was shot, hanging out in the basement “man cave,” lounging by the pool and cuddling Hernandez’s baby daughter. Hernandez was an All-American out of the University of Florida who was drafted by the Patriots in the fourth round in 2010.

"Some see the addition of Jimmy Graham to the Seattle Seahawks' offense as one of the best moves of free agency, but Michael Bennett still thinks he's overrated. Bennett labelled the tight end 'soft' and 'overrated', not to mention adding that 'he didn't like him as a person or a player', after Seattle's playoff win over the Saints two years ago. And now that Graham's on board to seemingly add a genuine red zone threat to Darrell Bevell's predominantly ground and pound offense, the defensive end had some choice words for his new team-mate. 'I still feel the same way,' Bennett told 710 ESPN Seattle. Michael Bennett rides a policeman's bike after the Seahawks' famous NFC Championship win over Green Bay . Bennett tackles Eddie Lacy as the Seahawks bounced back from 16-7 with just over two minutes remaining . Jimmy Graham signed a deal with Seattle which gives Russell Wilson a 6ft 7in target to aim at . 'Just because he's on my team I don't stop feeling that way. Obviously I'm going to be a better team-mate to him because he's on my team. I can't do the things I was doing to him when we were playing him.' Bennett did soften a little, adding: 'Obviously, I'm going to be a better team-mate to him because he's on my team. I can't do the things I was doing to him when we were playing him. 'When he comes to our team, he's a part of our team. We have a different philosophy than they have with the Saints so the things that he was expected to do [with] the Saints are going to be different when he comes here. Obviously, we're a running team, so he's going to have to block and do all those things. 'I don't feel as harsh as I did at the time because he's my team-mate now, but at the time he was on the opposite team, a team that we played that was pretty good and we battled with them a couple times, and I didn't really like that team.' Bennett came on the airwaves to address rumours that he had asked for a trade to join former defensive co-ordinator Dan Quinn at the Atlanta Falcons. 'I never asked for it. I didn't come to them asking for a trade. I'm still trying to figure out how a guy from Dallas make up a story about me. I'm living in Seattle, I'm like, ""How does that happen?""' 'I'm in Hawaii surfing, got the kids surfing in the ocean and they are talking about something else. The story was broken by Clarence Hill of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and it appeared to vex the ebullient Bennett, who added: 'Man, like I said, they made rumours about Jesus, they'll make rumours about anybody.' Bennett will come face-to-face with Graham on April 20 when the Seahawks begin their official off-season training programme.","Bennett slated Graham after the Seahawks beat the Saints in the playoffs two years ago .

"Charles Tillman has concluded his storied 12-year career with the Chicago Bears. The veteran cornerback has agreed a deal with the Carolina Panthers with the two-time Pro Bowler opting to link-up with Ron Rivera. At the age of 34 and after another injury-hit season, the new Bears hierarchy did not express an interest in keeping Tillman on the roster. But he leaves Chicago with his achievements on the field matched by those off it. Charles Tillman has ended his Chicago career but remains a favourite for  his work on and off the field . Drafted in the second round from Louisiana Lafeyette in 2003, Tillman became a staple of Lovie Smith's stingy defense, which propelled the Bears to Super Bowl XLI. A franchise record holder for defensive touchdowns and interception returns for touchdowns, the forced fumble specialist lies third on the all-time list for interceptions with 36. He started 152 of 156 games, but finished the past two seasons on injured reserve after tearing his right triceps. Tillman said the chance to work with Rivera - a former Bears player who worked as defensive co-ordinator from 2004-6 - was too good to turn down. Tillman holds several Bears defensive accolades and was a stalwart of their defense during his 12 years . 'I think Coach Rivera was one of the main reasons why I wanted to be here,' Tillman said. 'He's a guy that I had a lot of respect for when I was in Chicago. I love his leadership and his qualities as a coach, and he's done a good job with the Panthers. There's a good group of guys here like Thomas Davis, Greg Olsen, Luke Kuechly and Cam Newton. I got a good vibe here.' 'This is a similar defense, and Steve Wilks and (defensive line coach) Eric Washington were also in Chicago, so there is familiarity.' Since setting up the Cornerstone Foundation a decade ago, Tillman's charity has impacted over a million needy children and their families in the Chicago area. His work with the foundation was honoured with the Walter Payton Man of the Year award in 2014. In a quirk of fate, the Panthers also have the 2015 recipient of the award, Thomas Davis, on their roster.","Tillman spent 12 years in Chicago but the new team management did not declare an interest to retain his services .

"Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy has been suspended without pay for 10 games for conduct detrimental to the National Football League. The decision to ban Hardy, who last played for the Carolina Panthers, followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February. Hardy was informed in a letter by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy has been suspended without pay for 10 games . Domestic violence charges against Hardy, who signed with Dallas last month, were abruptly dropped in February after his accuser could not be found to testify. The jury trial for Hardy had been set to begin in Charlotte after he was accused of assaulting his former girlfriend, Nicole Holder, and threatening to kill her. The league's probe, which involved numerous interviews with witnesses and experts, concluded that Hardy violated the NFL's personal conduct policy by using physical force against Holder in at least four instances. 'The net effect of these acts was that Ms. Holder was severely traumatized and sustained a range of injuries, including bruises and scratches on her neck, shoulders, upper chest, back, arms and feet,' Goodell wrote. 'The use of physical force under the circumstances present here, against a woman substantially smaller than you and in the presence of powerful, military-style assault weapons, constitutes a significant act of violence in violation of the Personal Conduct Policy.' Hardy arrives at Mecklenburg County jail on the first day of his domestic violence appeal trail . Hardy, a 2013 Pro Bowler who played only one game for the Panthers before being suspended last season, was accused of assaulting Holder last May, sending her to the hospital emergency room. The five-year NFL veteran was found guilty by a district court judge in July but appealed the verdict and was allowed to have a jury trial. Prosecutors said when Holder last spoke with them in November, she told them that she 'did not want to participate in another trial.' Holder had already reached a civil settlement with Hardy, prosecutors said. Hardy may appeal the NFL's decision within three days. 'You must have no further adverse involvement with law enforcement and must not commit any additional violations of league policies,' Goodell wrote. 'In that respect, you should understand that another violation of this nature may result in your banishment from the NFL.'

"The New York Jets have added another former Patriot to their roster in the shape of running back Stevan Ridley. The 26-year-old has signed a one-year deal after suffering a tear to his right ACL last season. He played just six games as the Patriots won their sixth straight AFC East title and went on to win the Super Bowl. 'Sending love to all my day one fans, and every team-mate I've had the pleasure to take the field with,' Ridley posted on Instagram. Stevan Ridley (right) became the 15th player to join the Jets in a frantic free agency . Ridley (right) celebrates the Patriots Super Bowl win during their victory parade in Boston . 'We all know it's a business, yet it's also a blessing. So either way you see it, you'll never understand. 'Love New England, Love my former team-mates and I'm truly thankful for the opportunity the Patriots organisation has blessed me with. However it's #ontotheJETS.' The Jets will hope Ridley reproduces the kind of form he showed in 2012, where he rushed for 1,263 yards and 12 touchdowns. He joins Chris Ivory and Bilal Powell at running back in a revamped Jets offense, which features fellow free agent acquisitions Brandon Marshall and Ryan Fitzpatrick. New head coach Todd Bowles has also taken Darrelle Revis back from the Patriots and Antonio Cromartie to bolster an already dominant defense. 'He's excited for the opportunity and his rehab is going strong at this point,' added his agent Andy Simms.","Ridley stays in the AFC East after signing a one-year deal with the Jets .

"The NFL has its first full-time female game official. Sarah Thomas, who has worked exhibition games, will be a line judge for the 2015 season, the league announced on Wednesday. The 41-year-old was in the league's officiating development program in 2013-14 and worked some team minicamps last year. She's already broken ground in the officiating field as the first woman to work college games in 2007. She was the first female official on the FBS level and the first to officiate a bowl game, the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl in Detroit. Sarah Thomas is the NFL's first full-time female referee and will be a line judge during the upcoming season . Thomas poses during the pre-season game between the Seahawks and the Chargers last year . 'I am a female, but I don't look at myself as just a female,' Thomas said last June while working a Cleveland Browns minicamp. 'I look at myself as an official.' Shannon Eastin worked regular-season NFL games in 2012 as a replacement official, making her the first female to do so in any capacity. She also was a line judge. Thomas, a former college basketball player, was inspired to become an official in the 1990s when she attended a meeting with her brother, Lea. In 1996, Thomas became the first female to officiate in a Division 1-A high school football game in Mississippi. Just under a decade later, she began officiating college games when she was hired by Conference USA, working as a line judge and head linesman. She also has worked the Senior Bowl, the Fight Hunger Bowl, the Medal of Honor Bowl, and the Conference USA Championship game in 2010 and 2014. Thomas officiated two seasons in the United Football League, which is now out of business. Off the field, she's a pharmaceutical representative. She said last June her two sons and one daughter see nothing extraordinary about her football job. 'They just know mom officiates and it's nothing foreign to them or pioneering or anything,' she said. 'I do this.'","Thomas will be a line judge for the 2015 season .

"LeSean McCoy's acrimony with Chip Kelly continues to rumble on, with the Buffalo Bills running back taking another swipe at the Eagles head coach. McCoy was shipped to the Bills in exchange for linebacker Kiko Alonso and says Kelly's team has a college feel and that he doesn't like star talent. 'I don’t think he likes or respects the stars. I’m being honest. I think he likes the fact that it’s ""Chip Kelly and the Eagles"",' he told the Philadephia Enquirer. LeSean McCoy warms up as he takes part in a voluntary offseason conditioning session with the Bills . McCoy clearly has a chip on his shoulder about the trade, but slated Philadelphia's 'college feel' 'It was ""DeSean Jackson – a high-flying, take-off-the-top-of-the-defense receiver"". Or ""the quick, elusive LeSean McCoy"". I don’t think [Kelly] likes that.' Since arriving at Rex Ryan's Bills last month, McCoy says he's already at ease with his surroundings before launching another swipe at Kelly. 'Here is more of a NFL type of feel,' McCoy told NFL's Total Access. 'Being with Coach [Andy] Reid for so long... you get used to that. A player's coach. An NFL type of atmosphere in the locker room and around the facility. And for two years in Philly it wasn't like that as much. Not in a negative way, but it was different. It was more like a college feel.' McCoy ran for 1,000 yards in four of six seasons with the Eagles and still spoke of his surprise at the move. 'Now you put my numbers up. You put my [numbers] up and you’ll see it. It tells you it. In any system – Andy [Reid] or Chip. So I’m not going to go there, back and forth with that. I just feel like the only thing I didn’t like was the respect. For so many years I gave you all what you wanted. You know? And then for how it went down, it was like a surprise. I’m thinking, ""Does everybody look at it how I look at it?"".' As well as their trip to Wembley this year to face the Jaguars, Buffalo also travel to Philadelphia in what already promises to be something of a grudge match.","McCoy laid into his former coach, saying he doesn't respect star talent .
