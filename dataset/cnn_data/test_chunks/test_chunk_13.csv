"Raheem Sterling will escape a club punishment after the Liverpool forward was caught on video inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide. The England international is expected to meet Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers on Thursday and he will be reminded of his professional responsibilities and warned about the consequences of taking a drug that has been called ‘hippy crack’. Rodgers questioned Sterling’s professionalism on Monday after footage emerged of the 20-year-old unconscious in his house in Southport having taken nitrous oxide with two unnamed friends. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . It has been a chastening week for Sterling. Pictures were published on Sunday of him smoking a shisha pipe and a different set of images surfaced on Tuesday of Sterling and team-mate Jordon Ibe at a shisha cafe in London. The pictures are believed to have been taken last September. Liverpool offered no comment on those photos. The club maintain the matter will be dealt with internally but he is not going to be fined. Sterling enraged Liverpool after saying in a BBC interview that he was ‘flattered’ to be linked with Arsenal. It is understood, however, that Arsenal have gone cold on Sterling, who scored in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday. All talks about his future have been put on hold until the end of the campaign but Ian Ayre, Liverpool’s chief executive, issued a strong line yesterday, insisting that Sterling — who has turned down a contract in the region of £100,000 per week — would be at Anfield for a ‘long time’. Ayre said: ‘Raheem’s agent has asked that we park all discussions regarding his future until the summer. We respect that. Raheem is a Liverpool player and has two years left on his contract. We expect Raheem Sterling to be here for a long time.’ It appears that Sterling and Ibe have a shisha pipe apiece and are also drinking Fanta .

"Sir Bradley Wiggins will bid for cycling's hour record on June 7 at London's Olympic Velodrome. The four-time Olympic champion and 2012 Tour de France winner, who is 35 on April 28, will attempt to add to his accomplishments by riding the furthest distance in 60 minutes at the Lee Valley VeloPark. 'The Hour Record is a holy grail for cyclists,' Wiggins said. Four-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins will bid to break cycling's hour record in June .

The current Hour record is 52.491km, set by Australian Rohan Dennis in February after the UCI, cycling's world governing body, reformed regulations, reigniting interest in the event. German Jens Voigt was the first to make an attempt last September, recording 51.115km, a mark which stood for six weeks before Austria's Matthias Brandle rode 51.852km, while Jack Bobridge was the first to fall short in his attempt. Dennis' mark will come under threat from Briton Alex Dowsett, who will make his attempt on May 2 in Manchester having had to postpone it previously after suffering a broken collarbone.

"Barcelona threw away a two-goal lead against Sevilla thanks to individual errors by Claudio Bravo and Gerard Pique, which leaves them just two points ahead of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. It was a cruel twist of fate for Bravo and Pique, both of whom have been outstanding in the second half of the season and the effort on Sevilla's part was momentous. A year ago Barcelona travelled to Andalusia to face Granada and left a beaten side, their title challenge hitting an iceberg. This was not as brutal a blow, but Enrique’s team will need to right themselves quickly ahead of a testing fortnight. Lionel Messi (left) celebrates scoring the opening goal with Neymar . Sevilla: Sergio Rico, Coke, Carrico, Pareja, Tremoulinas, Krychowiak, Banega, Iborra (Mbia 70), Aleix Vidal, Bacca (Gameiro 75), Vitolo (Reyes 70). Subs not used: David Soria, Navarro, Diogo, D Suarez. Goals: Banega 37, Gameiro 83. Booked: Iborra, Reyes, Mbia, Krychowiak, Banega. Barcelona: Bravo, Alves, Pique, Mathieu, Alba, Busquets, Rakitic, Iniesta (Pedro 85), Messi, Suarez, Neymar (Xavi 73). Subs not used: Ter Stegen, Xavi, Pedro, Rafinha, Mascherano, Bartra, Adriano. Goals: Messi 14, Neymar 31. Booked: Busquets, Pique. Ref: Juan Martinez Munuera. Goals from Lionel Messi and Neymar looked to have ended Sevilla’s amazing 14-month unbeaten home record in La Liga, but Unai Emery’s men showed why they are so hard to beat with a momentous comeback. Gerard Deulofeu was dropped from Sevilla's squad and Denis Suarez started on the bench. To be able to leave out two Barcelona loanees shows the strength in depth that the coach has. It also shows how Sevilla won the Europa League last season and why they are aiming to reach the Champions League this year. A big part of their European triumph last season was down to their captain Ivan Rakitic. Enough, in fact, that Barcelona decided to pluck him from Emery's ranks and give him a bigger stage to shine on. Rakitic says he still holds Sevilla in his heart, thanks to his four season spell in Andalusia. Perhaps his history confused him early on, with the Croat playing a terrible ball back towards his own box which didn’t cost Barcelona, thanks to the referee deciding he was fouled after releasing it. Messi curled home a trademark left-footed shot against Sevilla . Real Madrid had already done their part on Saturday afternoon, seeing off Eibar at the Santiago Bernabeu and then desperately hoped Sevilla would be able to do theirs. Something had to give at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, whether it was Sevilla's streak, or Barcelona's nine-game winning run. It was Barcelona who last did the damage here in February 2014, but they could not do it again. Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets and Neymar were brought back into the Barcelona side after missing Wednesday's win against Almeria, through injury, suspension and rotation respectively. The latter had a point to prove after a run of fruitless games, where he’s been more likely to cause a fight than score a goal. That wasn’t the case here. Neymar hit a beautifully struck free-kick from the left, to double Barcelona’s lead after half-an-hour. Messi had opened the scoring, with a goal similar to his strike in mid-week. Neymar fed the ball into the Argentine on the right-hand side of the box, who took a touch to work some space and then curled the ball sweetly around the outstretched arm of Sergio Rico and into the top left corner. The Argentine forward took his season's tally to 34 goals in La Liga . Sevilla are good opponents for Messi, who has scored more goals against them than any other side, bar Atletico Madrid. And it was Sevilla he hit a hat-trick against at the Camp Nou earlier this season, the game where he overtook Telmo Zarra’s all-time record of 251 goals. When the big games have come around this season, Barcelona have brought their big game. Dani Alves, for example, has not had a good season, but when the chips are down he’s dug deep. This could be the last time he plays against Sevilla, his former side, and he evoked memories of his former self, charging up the right but getting back when needed as well. However, Sevilla got themselves back in the game before the break with a long-range drive from Ever Banega, the Argentine midfielder who has been reinvigorated under Emery’s watchful eye. Netmar doubled Barcelona's lead with a curling free kick into the top corner . On a day of goalkeeping errors in Spain you suspected it would be third-choice Sevilla stopper Sergio Rico adding to the list, rather than Barcelona’s Claudio Bravo, but that was not the case. The latter is on course to beat Thibaut Courtois’ Zamora Trophy winning 20 clean sheets from last season, with 17 so far, but could not add to his tally here. Bravo got a hand to Banega’s strike but only succeeded in tipping it in off the post, rather than around it. Barcelona had chances to extend their lead, with Messi seeing a free kick tipped over, and Luis Suarez culpable of missing two huge opportunities. He blazed both over the crossbar, either side of the half-time interval. The first he was off-balance for and the angle was tricky, but the second was a golden chance. Andres Iniesta saw his shot saved by Rico, but Suarez couldn’t find the empty net with the rebound. But the Catalan side weren’t creating chances at will; this was hard work against durable, cunning opponents. Krychowiak made a quite phenomenal tackle on Messi which typified the sprit Sevilla showed both in this encounter and throughout the season. With the No 10 running at Sevilla's defence, the Pole fought back, eventually committing himself to a sliding challenge, from which he emerged with the ball, and started a break. Luis Suarez (left) shoots past Sevilla midfielder Daniel Carrico . Carlos Bacca – Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar aside, La Liga’s most proflific forward this season – went close when he whistled a strike over the top of Bravo’s goal, while Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets were both booked for stopping lightning-quick attacks. It wasn’t enough. Emery undid Barcelona with three substitutions, all of which paid dividends. Jose Antonio Reyes played a big part in the equaliser, which was converted by another substitute, Kevin Gameiro. Gerard Pique gave the ball away and Reyes combined with Vitolo, before Gameiro side-footed home a low, scuttled cross at the far post, to ignite the stadium. What makes things worse for Barcelona is that this game is just the start of a brutal fortnight. Enrique’s side travel to Paris to play PSG on Wednesday, before hosting high-flying Valencia on Saturday. Then it’s PSG again three days later, before a Catalan derby at Espanyol. By that time, they may even be playing catch-up. One crumb of comfort for Enrique though. Real Madrid still have to come to the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan and to a man, Barcelona’s side will testify to the difficulty of emerging with three points.

"Derby County season ticket holders from the 2010-11 campaign might struggle to believe it but Alberto Bueno prepares to face his former club Real Madrid on Wednesday as the highest-scoring Spanish-national in La Liga with a big money move to Porto waiting for him at the end of the season. Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but with just five goals in 29 games he looked anything like Champions League material. After returning to Valladolid he moved to Rayo Vallecano and at the club with one of the lowest budgets in Spanish football he has had the season of his life. Now Champions League quarter-finalists Porto, coached by Spaniard Julen Lopetegui, are ready to poach him.

Seventeen of the 35 goals that Rayo have scored this season have come from Bueno. He hit four in one game earlier this year against Levante and will be gunning for his old club on Wednesday night. Bueno came through at Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season when then manager Fabio Capello fast-tracked him from the C-team to train with David Beckham, Luis Figo and Raul. He eventually made his full debut in both La Liga and the Champions League two seasons later but like so many strikers from Real Madrid’s youth system before him he was going to have to leave to really launch his career. Following in the footsteps of Alvaro Negredo and Roberto Soldado he left the club in 2009 signing for Valladolid from where he spent a season at Derby before ending up back in Spain. Negredo and Soldado both made it into the Spain squad after they succeeded away from Madrid and national team boss Vicente Del Bosque will be watching on Wednesday when Bueno goes up against Sergio Ramos as Rayo Vallecano look to take the scalp of Real Madrid in their rickety atmosphere-charged three-sided Vallecas stadium.","Alberto Bueno ha scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season .

"Inter Milan are set to turn to Lucas Leiva and Alex Song if their pursuit of Manchester City pair Stevan Jovetic and Yaya Toure fails. Roberto Mancini has Liverpool midfielder Leiva and Barcelona's Song, currently on loan at West Ham, on his list of alternatives if Jovetic and Toure prove too costly. Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio told Sky Italia: 'Dreams are beautiful, I'm trying to prepare something and I hope my dreams come true. Lucas Leiva (left) is believed to be a target for Inter Milan and could leave Liverpool in the summer . Alex Song has impressed during his loan spell at West Ham United and would be available for a transfer . 'Jovetic? In the past there was something, especially last summer. We had gone quite a bit forward in the negotiations, we were hoping to conclude the deal but then Negredo became injured and Manchester City changed their minds. 'He is a great player, he fits the profile of the player we are looking for. He is not very young but he is fully mature and still has a lot to give. He is a very talented player but the English club buys very often but seldom sells.' Jovetic looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer after being omitted from the club's Champions League squad earlier this season to make room for January signing Wilfried Bony. The Premier League champions rejected several bids from Inter last summer, while Juventus showed interest in the Montenegro star during the last transfer window.

'It won’t be easy, but he’s a player with incredible technique and character. Would Inter be his first choice?

"There was no glorious Team Sky send-off for Sir Bradley Wiggins despite a terrific effort from the Briton in the Paris-Roubaix. The 2012 Tour de France winner is quitting the team in order to ride for his own squad, 'Wiggins', before a return to the track ahead of the Rio Olympics, and wanted to sign off from what he called a 'golden era' with a win in one of the sport's most prestigious races. But it was not to be as Germany's John Degenkolb produced the perfect race to cross the line first at the end of a gruelling 151-mile trek which took in 27 tortuous cobbled spells. Bradley Wiggins sits on the floor after failing to win his final race with Team Sky in the Parsi-Roubaix . Wiggins left everything on the road as he attempted to bow out in glorious fashion, but was unable to hold on . German John Degenkolb celebrates as he crosses the line, winning the race ahead of Wiggins in 18th . Wiggins did his best, breaking away with 32 kilometres left to shake things up at the head of the peloton, while he also made a late push, but in the end he had to settle for a place down the line in 18th as Degenkolb took the glory. In the process he became the first rider to take first in the Milan San Remo and Paris-Roubaix in the same year since Sean Kelly back in 1986. One of the sport's classic races, the one-day slog did not fail to disappoint, but the drama almost got out of hand at one stage as some of the riders had a lucky escape when a train sped through the tracks they were due to cross. Some of the field slipped across despite the safety barriers being down, while others were held at the gate before being able to resume. Degenkolb celebrates his win alongside Zdenek Stybar (left) and Greg van Avermaet (right) Wiggins led a breakaway with 32 kilometres remaining, but was unable to maintain his lead to win . After that interlude the drama returned to the saddle, although Sky's in-form Geraint Thomas was unable to play a part. Amongst the early front-runners he was unseated when he ran into a curb, while he also suffered injuries on the way which eventually reduced him to a participant. For Wiggins it was always going to be a case of leaving nothing on the road ahead of his next phase, which is to include a ride at the Tour de Yorkshire. He first made himself known in the race when he moved to the head of the peloton with 45 kilometres to go and, with 32 remaining he ditched the pack in a bid to reel in the leaders. The peloton drew him back but his intent was clear and he held pace with them until Greg van Avermaet and Yves Lampaert went for it on their own. Luke Rowe (right) finished ahead of Wiggins in the end, coming in eighth, Team Sky's best performance . The pair were joined by Degenkolb and then Zdenek Stybar and at this point it was clear Wiggins' race was run. He found some extra power to go it alone again but the top prize was no longer on the table for him and he was amongst the rest as Degenkolb won the race in two laps of the Roubaix Velodrome. In the end Luke Rowe was Sky's first man home in eighth, while Stybar and Van Avermaet took second and third respectively.","Bradley Wiggins finished 18th in the Paris-Roubaix .

"Daniel Sturridge faces a fight to be fit for Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Sunday after being left out of their game against Newcastle United with an injury problem.

And now manager Brendan Rodgers has admitted that his star striker, who has missed much of the season through injury, will have his fitness monitored ahead of the Wembley clash on Sunday. Daniel Sturridge faces a fight to be fit for Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Sunday . Liverpool striker Sturridge was left out of the squad entirely on Monday after being taken off at Blackburn . When asked about why Sturridge was absent from his squad, Rodgers said: 'He got injured at Blackburn. '(He is) obviously unavailable fitness-wise for tonight, so we'll see how he goes for the rest of the week for the semi-final at the weekend.'

Sunday's 4-2 defeat for City by Manchester United put Liverpool in a position to move within four points of the fourth-placed side, and Rodgers said his side can still make it into next season's Champions League. 'There’s still 21 points to work hard for and get,' he said on Sky Sports. 'It’s clear that it’s still open but there’s a lot of work to do and ahead of us, obviously, is a difficult game tonight.'

"Former Holland forward Dirk Kuyt is returning to Feyenoord next season, aiming to end his professional playing days at the club that was a launching pad for nine years at Liverpool and Fenerbahce, the Rotterdam club announced Friday. Kuyt signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord, who are currently third in the top-flight Eredivisie, but said his stay will likely be longer. Kuyt grew into a favorite among Feyenoord's fanatical fans during his first stint with the club from 2003-2006, after transferring from Utrecht. He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in the 2004-2005 season and was named Dutch footballer of the year in 2006. Dirk Kuyt (left) is returning to Feyenoord, nine years after leaving the Dutch Eredivsie club for Liverpool . Kuyt retired from international football in October after finishing third with the Netherlands at last year's World Cup - a tournament where he underscored his versatility by playing on the wing and at left back. He made 104 appearances for the Netherlands and scored 24 goals. He also was part of the team that finished second in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, losing to Spain in the final. The 34-year-old said now is a good time to return to Rotterdam as ""I'm fit and have a great drive to make a success of my time at De Kuip,"" Feyenoord's stadium. Feyenoord director Martin van Geel said that although Kuyt signed only a one-year deal both he and the club intend his stay in Rotterdam to be longer. ""Dirk can keep going for years,"" Van Geel said. ""As far as he's concerned, he can become the Ryan Giggs of Feyenoord and we will add many more years. This will be music to the ears of all Feyenoord fans."" The forward has had a successful career for Liverpool, Fenerbache and playing for his country .","Dirk Kuyt agrees one-year-deal to move back to former club Feyenoord .

"Valencia turned up the heat on Atletico Madrid in the fight for third place in La Liga when a 3-0 derby victory at home to Levante on Monday lifted the Singapore-owned club to within a point of the champions with seven games left. Paco Alcacer nodded Valencia in front from a Dani Parejo centre in the 16th minute at the Mestalla before Lucas Orban crossed for Sofiane Feghouli to head a second for the home side nine minutes before the break. Valencia forward Paco Alcacer celebrates his goal against Levante . Substitute Alvaro Negredo completed a resounding victory when he crashed a shot into the top corner in the third minute of added time. Valencia, who missed out on a place in continental competition last season, are fourth on 65 points, with Atletico, who drew 2-2 at Malaga on Saturday, on 66 in third. Feghouli told Spanish television Valencia, who play at leaders Barcelona on Saturday, had been itching to get back to winning ways after consecutive draws against Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao. Valencia defender Shkodran Mustafi has a shot on goal on Monday night . 'I think we controlled the game pretty well against a team who sits back and defends and we tried to attack down the wings,' added the Algeria forward. 'We are going to try make things difficult for Barca and all we are thinking about is winning the next game.' Barca lead on 75 points after they squandered a 2-0 lead and drew 2-2 at fifth-placed Sevilla on Saturday, two ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, 3-0 winners at home to Eibar. Valencia's Paco Alcacer takes on Levante defender Loukas Vyntra at the Mestalla . The top three places carry a berth in the Champions League group stage, while fourth earns a spot in qualifying for Europe's elite club competition. Valencia last won La Liga in 2004 under Rafa Benitez and backed by a new owner, Singapore billionaire Peter Lim, current coach Nuno has begun the process of turning the club back into contenders in Spain and Europe. They reached the Champions League final in 2000 and 2001, losing to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively, but subsequent financial problems forced them to cash in on top players, including David Villa, David Silva and Juan Mata. Levante, Valencia's second club, are flirting with relegation and Monday's defeat left them third from bottom on 28 points.","Valencia claimed a 3-0 derby victory at home to Levante on Monday .

"The days of soft old Arsenal not liking it up 'em when they get north of Watford are long gone. A first-half strike by the outstanding Aaron Ramsey was enough to see off Burnley at an intimidating Turf Moor and record an eighth win in a row by Arsene Wenger's side, the best run since The Invincibles team managed it in 2004. Arsenal have won at Sunderland, Newcastle, Manchester City and now Burnley, and picked up points at Liverpool and Everton, besides beating Manchester United in the FA Cup at Old Trafford. The only exception was a 3-2 defeat at Stoke and even then they nearly clawed back a 3-0 deficit.

CLICK HERE to see more from our brilliant Match Zone service . The new-found resolution, built on a base of Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker at the back and Francis Coquelin holding in midfield, has enabled Arsenal to mount a surprising late run for the title. It is still unlikely given Chelsea are four points ahead and hold two games in hand. But should Jose Mourinho's men slip up in the first of them on Sunday at QPR, Arsenal will be waiting. After next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley, The Gunners host Chelsea at The Emirates. Wenger seemed as pleased with his side's narrow win in Lancashire as he had done after dismantling Liverpool 4-1 at The Emirates the previous weekend. 'It was more of a fighting performance and many people question us on that side of things so I am pleased,' said the Arsenal manager, whose side also had to contend with a swirling wind in the first half. 'Coquelin contributes to the balance of the team. He can do things that other players aren't able to.' Burnley's Kieran Trippier (left) was unable to pull his side level with a 25-yard free-kick shortly after Ramsey's goal . Alexis Sanchez looks confused after a decision from referee Mike Dean as the Chilean star believes he was fouled . Mesut Ozil is surrounded by three Burnley players as the German star attacks inside Burnley's half . To pip his old enemy Mourinho, Wenger knows his side must equal the winning run of his last legendary title-winning team, and then go beyond it. 'We need a perfect run and we a need a non-perfect run from Chelsea. We can not master that, only our attitude. 'We have won 15 of the last 17 games so we are consistent. We want to keep winning of course. It is a challenge for the team.' An early goal always helps and Arsenal went ahead after 12 minutes. Mesut Ozil's shot was saved by Tom Heaton, Alexis Sanchez's rebound hit Michael Duff in the face and at the third time of asking Ramsey fired into the roof of the net for his ninth goal of the season. 'An awful goal to concede,' said Dyche, whose side are still in the bottom three but not without hope of beating the drop. Ramsey was the outsanding performer of the first half appearing to have almost limitless energy. One passage of play summed it up, one moment he was in the Arsenal wall blocking a David Jones free-kick, the next he was in the Burnley penalty area ready to try and score a second. Burnley clearly tried to rough Arsenal up a bit. Ben Mee and Michael Duff were booked, Ashley Barnes sent Hector Bellerin flying in the air. The home fans thought referee Mike Dean was being a bit soft towards the visitors but Wenger clearly didn't bear Burnley grudges, saying afterwards he hoped The Clarets would stay up. Gunners midfielder Santi Cazorla (left) is beaten by Burnley's Scott Airfield during the first 45 minutes . Sam Vokes and Laurent Koscielny take a tumble as the two sides battled it out on Saturday afternoon . Four thousand Arsenal fans were enjoying themselves and even had the temerity to sing “This is a library” as the normally voiceferous home support were stunned into temporarily silence. Arsenal's traditional soft-centre has hardened up too. Laurent Koscielny went crashing into Ashley Barnes when danger threatened though the Frenchman was relieved to see Ospina dive to his right to beat away Kieran Trippier's free-kick. Burnley left-back Ben Mee then became the game's first booking when he pushed his hand into Ramsey's face to stop the rampant No16. Santi Carzola then was close to scoring on his 100th Premier League appearance when he went close with a trademark free-kick. Among the watching spectators was Roy Hodgson though with Arsenal not having a single Englishman in their starting line-up, one hopes he made the journey north to check on Burnley's England under-21 striker Danny Ings. Arsenal ended the first half in control. Burnley's repeated fouling gave them a flurry of free-kicks and though the home crowd berated Mike Dean, it was difficult to see what else the official could have done.

Danny Ings goes close with an acrobatic effort which was easily saved by Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina . Ashley Barnes has a shot as Cazorla looks to block during a rare sight at goal for the Burnley striker . If Ramsey was the key man of the first half, Coquelin impressed in the second as Burnley belatedly chased an equaliser. He broke up most things but on the rare occasions he was breached, Burnley fluffed their lines in front of goal. Scotland international George Boyd, who scored a famous winner against Manchester City last month, miskicked when a cross from Ben Mee from the left found him in front of goal. England under-21 international Danny Ings then connected with an overhead kick that was saved by David Ospina with his bright orange kit in goal. At least the Ings effort was something for England manager Roy Hodgson to note down. He'd travelled to Lancashire to find Arsenal hadn't included a single Englishman in their starting line-up and Danny Welbeck was only given eight minutes at the end . Ospina also saved from Barnes while Welbeck missed a late chance to add to Arsenal's win when he shot wide from Mesut Ozil's pass.

It is something we have found all season,' said Dyche, who had some consolation by defeats earlier in the day for relegation rivals Hull City and Sunderland. Burnley have six matches left and among their fixtures are games against fellow strugglers Leicester City, Hull and Aston Villa. 'In the second half we got on the front foot, went right after them. And apart from the goal we conceded, I thought we defended really well. 'There wasn't a lot in the game and it was close against Manchester City and Chelsea too. Arsene would have spoken to his players about what to expect here. 'Make no mistake, they have a fine side. They are bringing on a Danny Welbeck as a £16million substitute, that's not bad. 'Now we have got six different kinds of games left, edgy games. There is a less expectation on us than other teams around us so we can play with a bit more freedom. There is a lot of belief from us going into those games. We want to be effective enough to win them.' David Jones looks to get the better of Sanchez during a difficult second half for the Gunners .

"Momentarily, he looked his age. Having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin, Jordan Spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green. History was assured. He wasn’t going to three-putt from there, so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the Masters. He wanted it to be more than that, though. The best it could be. The exuberance of youth was kicking in. Spieth missed. For the first time around Augusta, he made a mild mis-step. He wheeled away, hopped a little, almost coltish in his frustration. He marched back to his ball, prepared to tap it in. Except it wasn’t a real tap-in. There was a bit still to do. And at that point, Spieth checked. He stepped away. He marked his ball. He let Henrik Stenson play. He did the sensible thing. Spieth always does the sensible thing. That is part of his wonder. Jordan Spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14-under 130 . Spieth leads Charley Hoffman by five strokes, matching the largest halfway lead in Masters history . Some might think that makes him boring. It doesn’t make him boring. To shoot 14 under, the lowest two-round score at Augusta, and equal to the best 36-hole score recorded at a major championship, isn’t boring. We may be watching a sporting phenomenon. A performance as breathtaking as Tiger Woods’s arrival in 1997. There will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole. If Spieth repeats his achievement at the Hero World Challenge in Florida last year, perhaps, when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. Those numbers are unlikely though. As the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery, his scores are bound to fall. Against that, it will be a lot harder to chase Spieth’s total than just maintain it. Modern courses have, of course, been Tiger-proofed before — but in the short term Augusta may need to be Spieth-proofed, too, if his scoring stays stable. This was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. He has been in the top three players in five of those six, too. ‘I was a bit out of my comfort zone, at the moment on the 18th,’ Spieth confirmed. ‘I was going to have to work around Henrik’s line — and I just thought if I step away I am definitely going to make this putt, so that was the only way I could miss. ‘I have to work to control those things the next two days. If I can shoot 14 under then a lot of other players could shoot 14 under, so I have to be ready for that and to match their scores now. The stress levels can get pretty high. Still, it’s pretty cool any time you can lead the Masters and to set a record is awesome.’ Spieth broke Raymond Floyd's 36-hole scoring record by a stroke and blitzed the first 36 holes . At the age of 21 and playing in his second Masters, Spieth looks in complete control . Billy Horschel, Spieth’s playing partner, had wished for an imaginary tape recorder at the end of the first day. Horschel deadpanned that he needed a device that replayed the message ‘Nice hole, Jordan’ as they stood on every tee. Nothing changed overnight. Many had Augusta pegged as the venue where Rory McIlroy would complete his personal grand slam in 2015; instead, this Masters may go down as the moment where he was placed in the threatening shadow of a young Texan gunslinger, now in the vanguard of an American revival. Up ahead of Spieth, Ernie Els laboured valiantly to stay in touch. It was a salutary reminder of the need for good timing in any sporting career. At the age of 25, as McIlroy is now, Els won his first major, the 1994 US Open. He was considered capable of dominating the sport for the next decade, and he won it again in 1997. By that time, however, a 21-year-old called Tiger Woods had announced his arrival at the 1997 Masters. The era of Els never materialised. McIlroy may have achieved more and younger than Els, and Spieth may not be the ice-cold winning machine Woods was at his age — but he has done a damn good impression of one over the first two days. Already in the record books, Spieth has many more landmarks in sight these next two days. The record for birdies here stands at 25 from Phil Mickelson; Spieth already has 15. His course management was outstanding. Spieth took Augusta on, yet remained entirely in control. It helps that he is exceptional, yet strangely unspectacular. As Graeme McDowell pointed out recently there are better drivers, better chippers, better putters — and the statistics bear this out — but none who do all three as well as Spieth. He might not have the best game; but he has the most complete. There were tiny aberrations — he found the pine straw twice on the back nine — but they were rare. Most of the time, he was consistency personified, picking out the best line, the best lie, the most advantageous position on the green. When he dallied with a bunker on the par-five eighth, his third shot was so perfect that he sunk a two-foot putt for birdie. Spieth made 15 birdies through two rounds as he blazed his way around the Augusta fairways and greens . The young Texan pumps a fist to celebrate a birdie on the 13th during his sensational round . ‘That was special, even for you,’ said Horschel’s caddie Micah Fugitt. It was a masterful display, the work of a wise head not a callow college boy. It isn’t just that Spieth doesn’t think like a 21-year-old. At the 15th, a par five and a good birdie opportunity, he sensibly laid up, and then made four. Even when he missed, he missed cute. He has absorbed a lot from his mentor Ben Crenshaw, a fellow Texan and Augusta expert. Asked about ‘Ben’s advice’ on Thursday, Spieth sweetly replied: ‘Do you mean Mr Crenshaw?’ There wasn’t a hint of irony in his response. Had he stayed in school, he would be studying for his finals right now. Instead he is fast approaching £10m in career earnings and on the brink of a first major. The next Tiger? That is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders. The idea that McIlroy is without a serious challenger has been truly debunked. When Spieth shot 63 to win the Australian Open at Royal Sydney, the conditions were windy and inhospitable. McIlroy said he could have played the course a hundred times in those circumstances and not made Spieth’s score. Geoff Ogilvy claimed it may well have been the finest 18 holes of golf seen in Australia. Where do Spieth’s first 36 holes stand in the annals at Augusta? Ray Floyd played the previous best 36 holes — 13 under par — in 1976. Spieth now has that record, as well as that of the youngest player to hold the 18-hole lead. Like McIlroy’s US Open victory at Congressional in 2011 this could see a grand rewriting of the record books. He has barely put a foot wrong. Nice hole, Jordan? Seriously, dude, name one that wasn’t. Spieth recovers from among the trees at 13, and his caddie Michael Greller has to hand it to him (below)","Spieth set a new Masters scoring record with a 14-under 130 through two rounds at Augusta National .

"Just another history-making day at this wonderful 79th Masters saw Dustin Johnson become the first man ever to have three eagles in one round and yet still he couldn’t lay a finger on Jordan Spieth. Following one stunning round with another happens about as often at Augusta National as pieces of litter drifting across the property. Here, the youngest first-round leader in Masters history followed his 64 with a 66 to set a new 36-hole record total of 14 under par, beating the old mark of 13 under set by Ray Floyd way back in 1976. It also tied the lowest 36-hole total seen in a major, set by three others, including Sir Nick Faldo at The Open. Jordan Spieth chips on the 17th hole during the second round of the Masters on Friday . Spieth watches his tee shot from the 16th in front of a packed crowd at Augusta . The 21-year-old walks past the scoreboard on the 18th hole following his sensational performance . Dustin Johnson eyes up a putt no the 18th green during his record-breaking display on Friday . Johnson started with a double bogey but positively pillaged the course’s scoreable par fives to devastating effect. He had eagles at the second and the 8th, birdied the 13th, before striking a wondrous blow to the 15th that pulled up 12 inches from the flag. The difference between him and Spieth is he makes far more errors and one at the last meant he had to settle for a 67. Johnson will start the third round seven behind his fellow American with game chorus line member Charley Hoffman two strokes nearer the lead following a creditable 68. Gutsy Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey are on the same mark as Johnson, with the former weighing in with a fine recovery of his own. Rose was three over par after four holes but rallied strongly after drawing a line on his scorecard, like you’d draw a line in the sand. He played the last 14 holes in a plucky five under for a 70, while Casey underlined he is a man reborn with a terrific bogey-free 68. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68, one shot ahead of Ernie Els (72), while Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69, his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors, and his first here since 2011. He is still no fewer than 12 shots behind, mind. What of the world No 1, Rory McIlroy? Alas, if it’s Friday it must be time for one of those freaky nine holes that just kill him at the Masters every time. Ernie Els hits a shot off the fourth tee during his second day of action . Last year it was on the back nine and this time the outward half, as he followed a bogey at the 7th with a double at the 9th to turn in 40 strokes. It’s the sixth year in a row the Northern Irishman has thrown in a horrific nine like this and until he addresses the problem, he simply cannot win a green jacket. At least on the back nine he showed the pride of a current double major champion and the improvement he has made mentally from the days when his shoulders used to slump. One shot outside the projected halfway cut mark, he birdied the 10th and then, at the 13th, the hole that has given him so much trouble in the past, he hit his second shot to 3ft for a tap-in eagle three. McIlroy missed from 3ft at the 14th for a par but, in a rousing finish, birdied the 15th, 17th and the 18th. To the accompaniment of loud rumbles of thunder in the distance, McIlroy came home in just 31 shots to stand alongside Woods on two under. Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69; his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors . Woods's girlfriend Lindsey Vonn watches on from the crowd during the second day of action . Texas golfers have a long and proud history of coming up with prodigious feats that stun the sporting world. Byron Nelson once won 11 events in a row on the PGA Tour in 1945. Ben Hogan won three major championships in succession in 1953 and probably would have won the fourth as well but for the fact The Open clashed that year with the USPGA. Now here comes Spieth, who to this point has turned this Masters into his very own ‘hello, world’ moment with an awesome demonstration of dominance the like of which we haven’t seen since another 21-year-old named Tiger walked away with the 1997 edition. All this on the day another Lone Star legend, Ben Crenshaw, waved goodbye to the Masters. It’s tempting to talk about a passing of the Texas torch, except Spieth is destined for a level of greatness twice Masters champion Crenshaw could only dream about. Think Hogan rather than Gentle Ben. Rory McIlroy reacts to a poor second shot on the fifth hole in what was a frustrating day for the World No 1 . Paul Casey tries to clear out of a bunker on the eighth hole . As for Tiger, his first round 73 was actually an awful lot better than his score and the reviews suggested. It was, in fact, the most encouraging signs we’ve seen for him for well over a year. His short game was back to its best and his task on Friday was to instil some rhythm in his long game. That is exactly what happened. The rare sight of him finding the first fairway was encouraging and even better was the laser iron that followed. It finished 10ft away and the birdie putt found the middle of the hole. For 15 minutes, it was like watching Tiger at his best. The rest of the round was also heartening. He reached the turn in 34 to be one under for the event and inside the top 20. Justin Rose flips his club into the air after the English golfer cleared a sand trap on the 13th green . Ben Crenshaw closed out his Masters career with two mediocre rounds at Augusta . A birdie at the 11th and he was on the fringes of the top ten. How he does over the final two rounds is one more fascinating question during a weekend featuring many. Els was trying to build on the small miracle of his opening 67. The South African finished eighth on his Augusta National debut in 1994. Two months later, at the age of 25, he claimed the United States Open. Everyone looked at his languid grace off the tee and gossamer touch around the greens and wondered how many green jackets he would win. Twenty years on, he’s still waiting for his first. But he’s still in there trying. Depending on your viewpoint, his 72 leaves him perfectly placed to take advantage if Spieth feels the pressure over the weekend; or well in the mix to notch his third runner-up finish at the Masters. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68 just one shot ahead of Els .","Jordan Spieth is the youngest first-round leader in Masters history .

"Derry Mathews will take on Venezuelan knockout artist Ismael Barroso for the interim WBA world title after Richar Abril pulled out of their April 18 date. Abril has been elevated to ‘champion in recess’ with Darleys Perez declared the full champion of the lightweight division. Abril was initially forced to withdraw from his title defence against Mathews in March after coming down with dengue fever from a mosquito bite and he withdrew again this week as he is still reeling from the after-effects of the virus that has left him unable to train. Liverpool's Derry Mathews (left) will go head-to-head with Ismael Barroso for the interim WBA world title . Derry was set to fight Cuban WBA champion Richar Abril but will instead face Barroso on the April 18 date . Mathews expressed his disappointment at losing out on a title shot with Abril, who was twice forced to withdraw through illness . Southpaw Barroso, a frightening puncher from El Tigre, has recorded 16 knockouts from 17 wins in his 19 fights (two draws), with 11 quick wins coming inside the first three rounds. Although Liverpool ace Mathews is disappointed that he won't be facing the champion Abril for the belt, the main consolation for him is that he will still challenge for a version of the world title. And Mathews believes that his higher level of experience: 48 fights over 15 years; 18 championship title fights; 264 career rounds and 20 knockouts from 37 wins, vastly outweighs Barroso’s and will give him the vital edge over the South American hitman. ‘It’s unfortunate that Abril’s pulled out again, but things in life happen for a reason and I’m delighted to still be fighting for a version of the WBA world title and I’m headlining the Echo Arena in front of my home fans,’ he said. In his absence WBA lightweight champion Abril (right) has been elevated to ‘champion in recess’ ‘I’ve seen some footage of him, he’s strong, with big right hands and left hooks and and can take you clean out, but I’m not going to be in a position to let him do that to me. ‘Barroso’s a very dangerous fighter and a massive, massive, puncher. Just look at his record, he’s banging people out left, right and centre and it makes frightening reading, but when I saw it I said straight away I’ll have this guy because I know that I can beat him. ‘I’ve been in this sport for over ten years; I’ve had more knockouts than he’s had fights; twice as many fights as him, and three times as many championship fights, in terms of experience he’s not on my level and I can use all of my experience to my advantage. ‘Even with the change of opponent at this stage, plus the change from Abril’s orthodox style to Barrosa’s southpaw style, we still have some time to study him and my trainer Danny Vaughn is confident we can come up with the plan to beat him. I’ll beat anyone at the moment with the way I’m feeling. ‘I’m in with a massive puncher, but I can punch a bit myself so the crowd will be in for an exciting fight and I can see me flattening him. If the opportunity comes to take him out early I’ll take it, but I know I’ve got to be smart in there.’","Derry Mathews will fight Ismael Barroso for the interim WBA world title .

"While having six toes on the same foot would have once guaranteed you a place in a travelling circus, it seems polydactylism does have its bonuses in the sporting arena. Unbeaten boxer Danny Garcia, who defeated Amir Khan in four rounds in 2012, revealed he will carry an unusual advantage when he steps into the ring to face Lamont Peterson on Saturday. When asked by entertainment channel TMZ to reveal something embarrassing about himself, the US boxer explained he has an extra toe on his right foot before promptly removing his sock to show off his secret weapon.

"He may be a noted team man but Xabi Alonso admits he has his sights on some personal glory as Bayern Munich prepare for the next phase of their bid for the Champions League. Victory this season with Bayern, who face Porto in the quarter-finals starting Wednesday night at the Dragao, would make Alonso only the second player to win European football's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid. 'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso admitted to The Telegraph. Xabi Alonso lines up for Bayern Munich on Wednesday night against Porto at the Dragao Stadium . The Champions League first leg quarter-final is the next step in his quest to win the title with three clubs . 'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' Alonso said. Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to be a pundit rather than a player for the final win over Atletico Madrid. Alonso trains under the watchful eye of manager Pep Guardiola who is keen to add to his Barcelona victories . Seedorf won the title a total of four times in his illustrious career - in 1995 with Ajax, 1998 with Real Madrid and twice with AC Milan, in 2003 and 2007. At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola, Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf's total achievement. But first his side must overcome Porto, who are the only unbeaten side in the competition this year. And they will have to do it for the first leg at least with a host of stars including Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger, along with David Alaba, Medhi Benatia, Javi Martínez and Tom Starke.

"One of Diego Simeone’s many managerial mantras – and there are already enough to fill a volume that would rival Louis van Gaal’s Biographie & Vision – is: ‘I always think that tomorrow I could be sacked’. It perfectly illustrates his work ethic and his obsession with guarding against complacency but even he must know that right now no-one is further from the chop than the 44-year-old coach who took Atletico Madrid to the title last season and leads them into the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid on Tuesday night. There was a communal sigh let-out across several boardrooms of top European football clubs two weeks ago when he put pen to paper on a new deal that ties him to the club until 2019. Diego Simeone shows off his playing skills as he prepare Atletico Madrid for their Champions League clash . Simeone talks to his squad ahead of Real Madrid's visit on Tuesday night in the quarter final first leg . Sporting directors from Manchester to Milan were watching his situation carefully and the new four year contract with the option of a fifth season appears to have ended his chances of arriving in Italy or England this summer. Back home in Madrid the Atletico supporters were delirious at the news. Never mind that last year’s title will not be repeated this season. The fans have long enough memories to remember how bad things were back in December 2011, before his appointment. Current Chelsea striker Diego Costa would also remember that period well. He was just about to return from a cruciate ligament injury that had sidelined him for three months. The Argentinian manager has imposed his incredible work ethic on his players since joining Atletico . Simeone has turned Atletico around since joining in December 2011, and recently extended his deal . His Atletico Madrid team-mates were stagnating under coach Gregorio Manzano and had just been knocked out of the Cup by a third division side, Albacete. Costa had previously been out on loan at Albacete and had the good grace to go into their dressing-room after the game and congratulate his former team-mates on their giantkilling scalp. Back in his own dressing room the mood was bleak. The team were closer to the relegation zone than the European places and Manzano was soon sacked and replaced by Simeone. Sceptics said his inexperience as a coach in Europe would prevent him succeeding. Romantics said the former captain and double winner at Atletico would bring back the glory days. The romantics were right. Without Costa, who was at first loaned out to Rayo Vallecano, Simeone’s Atletico won the Europa League and the European Super Cup. Costa returned to help them win the Copa del Rey and the league as well as making last season’s Champions League final. That final in Lisbon seemed to put Real back on top in the Spanish capital but Simeone’s noisy neighbours have refused to pipe-down. In the six subsequent matches between the two sides they have not let Real win a single game. In the two-legged Spanish Super Cup at the start of the season Atletico drew 1-1 in the Bernabeu and beat Real 1-0 in the Calderon. They then went to the Bernabeu in the league and won 2-1. Saul scores a brilliant bicycle kick during the 4-0 win over Real at the Vicente Calderon earlier this season . Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale were unable to do anything to prevent Atletico's dominance in February . And when the two teams were drawn against each other in the Copa del Rey Atletico won the first leg 2-0 and then drew the second. Worse was to come for Real Madrid in the League in February when they lost the away fixture 4-0. This season Atletico Madrid are not going to win the league but no one is ruling out another tilt at the prize they were seconds from winning last season – leading from Diego Godin’s goal until the last minute when Sergio Ramos scored to take the match to extra time. Atletico players had told anyone who would listen throughout last season that while they didn’t give themselves much of a chance in La Liga up against the stronger squads of Real Madrid and Barcelona, they did fancy themselves in the Champions League – ‘we can beat anyone over two legs’ was the message and that still stands. They showed tremendous resilience to come through against Bayer Leverkusen in the last round with Fernando Torres scoring the last penalty of the shoot-out. Ronaldo scored the fourth goal in Real Madrid's win over their rivals in last year's Champions League final . Simeone's players watch on after losing out in Lisbon, but are determined to bounce back this year . He put through his own net at the weekend in the league typifying that faltering league form and will probably make way for Mario Mandzukic Tuesday. The battering-ram bought from Bayern in the summer to replace Costa has not always met Simeone’s demands for constant pressing of the opposition’s defence this season. After a fall-out with Simone, who in one recent match was visibly furious with his striker, a fragile truce has been called although the likes of PSG’s Edinson Cavani and Villarreal’s Luciano Vietto are being looked at as replacements for next season. Mandzukic told his manager recently that he had regularly played through injury and wanted resting. He was obliged, and now looks set to be brought back in to face Pepe and Sergio Ramos. Former Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic (behind) is set to start alongside Antoine Griezmann . Mandzukic has patched up his relationship with Simeone and will play ahead of Fernando Torres on Tuesday . Tuesday night may well be as much about keeping a clean sheet as scoring. Ronaldo returns the scene of Madrid’s biggest crime this season – that 4-0 defeat in the league on the day he celebrated his 30th birthday. Sometimes in training Simeone likes to play a very special game of attack against defence. He lines up a first team back seven against 14 youth teamers. He’s proud of the first-team defences’ ability to keep the ball out of their goal despite being outnumbered two to one. Whether 14 youth team players amounts to more or less than Gareth Bale, Ronaldo and Karim Benzema is open to debate. But then again those three were all on the pitch back in February for the 4-0 Atletico win and they never got anywhere near a goal. Tuesday night is a chance for Real Madrid to avenge that defeat, but it’ s also another chance for Simeone to show once again that in the Spanish capital he is the boss.","Real Madrid face Atletico in Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday .

"Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has reignited his feud with Arsene Wenger by claiming Champions League quarter-final opponents Juventus are by far the better team. Jardim and Wenger fell out at the Emirates when the Arsenal manager refused to shake the hand of the Monaco coach after their stunning 3-1 victory in the second round first leg tie. Arsenal have won their last eight games in the Barclays Premier League and there appears to be a growing feeling in the game that they could mount a title challenge next season. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim believes are Juventus are a better team than Arsenal . The Ligue 1 boss leads his team out at Juventus Stadium ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger upset Jardim by refusing to shake hands during Champions League exit . The Monaco coach claimed Wenger was ‘disrespectul’ in the first leg and he could not resist mentioning their victory over Arsenal ahead of their clash with Juve in Turin. Jardim said: ‘Juventus are a better team than Arsenal. They are in the quarter-final of the Champions League and deserve to be there. ‘Juve are a better team, it’s not complicated. They are top of their league. Monaco players take a light warm-up after arriving in Turin for the first-leg of their quarter-final .

The Monaco coach claimed Wenger was disrespectful in London after goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia, Dimitar Berbatov and Yannick Ferreira Carrasco secured a 3-1 win. Monaco eventually went through on away goals after drawing 3-3 on aggregate, which prompted another outburst from Jardim.

"He may be a warrior in the ring, but Manny Pacquaio showed his humble side outside of it once more with his latest Instagram post. The 36-year-old is gearing up for his $300million welterweight showdown with Floyd Mayweather on May 2 - in what is set to become the richest bout in boxing history. But the Philipine star took time out of his preparation to thank American film director Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for their support so far. Manny Pacquiao took to Instagram to thank Spike Lee and Tito Mikey ahead of his bout vs Floyd Mayweather . The 36-year-old also posted a photo thanking NBA legend Karl Malone (centre left) for visiting him at the gym . 'Hello to all my fans in New York and thank you to Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for supporting Team Pacquiao,' Pacquaio said via Instagram on Thursday. 'I hope to see you soon. God bless.' The duo are just the latest to show their support for the 'Pac-man' ahead of his fight against Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas next month. Former two-time NBA MVP and 14-time All-Star Karl Malone is another who appears to be behind the camp of the southpaw boxer. Later on Thursday, Pacquaio took to Instagram again to post a picture with the 51-year-old at his Wild Card gym base in Los Angeles. Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, believes his man is ready to beat Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2 . Accompanied with the caption: 'Thank you Karl Malone for visiting me today. God Bless you and your family,' the pair are all smiles alongside trainer Freddie Roach. And speaking earlier in the week, Roach believes that his fighter has a better chance of beating Mayweather now than he did in 2010. Asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of Pacquiao would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten Mayweather, Roach told boxingscene.com : 'That is an interesting question because there are obviously trade-offs between the two versions of Manny. But I am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons. 'Back in 2010, Manny was still growing into a welterweight. His first two welterweight fights were against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 and Miguel Cotto in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively, and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight Ricky Hatton. 'Floyd has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against De La Hoya so that might have given Floyd an advantage. I still like Manny's chances in that fight but I think the Manny of today has a lot more in his favour. Pacquiao is better equipped to beat Mayweather now than he was in 2010, according to his trainer Roach . Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . 'In 2010 the two-year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either, but that's not true today. Floyd at 38 is doing things he didn't do in the past. Floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years. Mayweather remains the bookmakers' favourite for the $300million mega-fight next month but Roach is adamant that Pacquiao is primed to cause an upset. 'The 2015 version of Manny is more mature, smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version,' said Roach. 'He will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating Floyd's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening. 'I have all the confidence in the world that Manny is going to knock Floyd out on May 2.' The pair will go head-to-head in a $300million mega-fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 .","Manny Pacquiao fights Floyd Mayweather at the MGM Grand on May 2 .

Juve are already on course for the Serie A title, 12 points clear of nearest rivals Lazio ahead of their meeting in the league this weekend. First though, Massimiliano Allegri’s team must find a way to beat Monaco, to secure a decent first-leg lead against the surprise quarter-finalists before the return in the Stade Louis II. At 31 Tevez appears to be enjoying his football again, helping Juventus to the title last season and leading the assault on the Champions League this term. Massimiliano Allegri is hoping to end 19 years of Champions League hurt by taking Juventus to glory . Monaco stand in Juventus' way; they were adventurous and audacious in their win over Arsenal in the last 16 . It is easy to knock Italian football, to place it behind England, Spain and Germany, but to do that would do a great disservice to this Juventus team. There are some formidable talents in there, with Gianluigi Buffon protected in his goal by the tough, uncompromising presence of Giorgio Chiellini, Andrea Barzagli and Leonardo Bonucci in their three-man defence. The prolonged absence of Andrea Pirlo, who has made five appearances in this season’s competition, has given others a chance to excel in the centre of this Juve midfield. Paul Pogba, one of the summer targets for Manchester United, is missing but Arturo Vidal, Roberto Pereyra and Claudio Marchisio all have pedigree. Tevez admits he feels free at Juventus, back to the days when he was playing for Boca Juniors (pictured) Monaco players train at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on the eve of their Champions League quarter-final . It has been 12 years since they last reached the Champions League final, when they were beaten by Milan on penalties during a dreadful stalemate that finished 0-0 at Old Trafford. For supporters of Juve it has been too long, with the shootout victory over Ajax in 1996 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome a distant memory. They have won the European Cup twice and would dearly love a third. Standing in their way of a semi-final appearance is Monaco, the surprise team to make it through after their remarkable win over Arsenal in the previous round. At the Emirates, Leonardo Jardim’s team were adventurous and audacious, surprising Arsenal with their breathtaking approach to the game. They are not to be underestimated. Gianluca Vialli lifts the Champions League for Juventus in 1996 - the last time the Bianconeri were victorious . In 2003, Juventus suffered heartbreak in the Champions League final, losing to AC Milan in a penalty shootout . Despite the big, high-profile exits of James Rodriguez to Real Madrid and Radamel Falcao’s season-long loan to Manchester United, they are difficult to beat. Joao Moutinho is a classy player in the centre of their midfield and the France international Jeremy Toulalan can always pick out a pass. Up front is Dimitar Berbatov, one of the scorers at the Emirates on the night of that incredible and climactic 3-1 victory in the first leg. Dimitar Berbatov is one of the men standing in Juventus' way in their Champions League quarter-final . Tevez is adored by Juventus supporters and they will hope he is the man to help them to European glory . It was after that game when Arsene Wenger headed straight for the tunnel, failing to shake the hand of Monaco’s Portuguese coach following Arsenal’s defeat. When Monaco scraped through on away goals, Jardim made a point of calling Wenger ‘disrespectful’ for his behaviour, which is familiar to all English football fans, on the touchline. Here in Turin, the Monaco coach talked of being worthy of their place in the quarter-final, good enough to live with the very best teams left in the tournament. Now, inside this magnificent new stadium, they get to meet one of them.","Juventus face Monaco in UEFA Champions League quarters on Tuesday .

"Parma pulled off the biggest surprise of the season as the crisis-hit club beat runaway leaders Juventus 1-0 in Serie A, inflicting what was only the second defeat of the campaign for Massimiliano Allegri's side. Jose Mauri scored the only goal of the game on the hour mark, while a string of fine saves from Parma goalkeeper Antonio Mirante also helped Roberto Donadoni's side to a memorable win. Parma were declared bankrupt last month and the players have not been paid all season, but they has now strung a series of positive results together, with a 1-0 victory over Udinese midweek and last weekend's 1-1 draw at Inter Milan. Jose Mauri (centre) scored the only goal of the game as crisis-hit club Parma beat Juventus 1-0 on Saturday . Mauri is mobbed by his Parma team-mates after breaking the deadlock on the hour mark . However, they are still in last place, 10 points from safety, with nine matches remaining. Juventus, which hosts Monaco in the Champions League on Tuesday, has a 14-point lead over Roma, which visits Torino on Sunday. Elsewhere in Italy, Genoa beat relegation-threatened Cagliari 2-0. It was top against bottom at the Stadio Ennio Tardini, with 57 points separating the two teams. Juventus rested several players inclduing the league's leading scorer Carlos Tevez and Andrea Barzagli ahead of the Champions League quarter final in midweek.

Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini vies for the ball with Parma's Ishak Belfodil during the match . Juventus laid siege to Parma's goal in the first half with Mirante pulling off several good stops to deny Roberto Pereyra, Arturo Vidal and Kingsley Coman. Parma did not have a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes and their best chance was Ishak Belfodil's effort on the counter which flew inches past the far top corner. However, they took a surprise lead when Belfodil raced down the right and crossed for Mauri to sidefoot into the roof of the net from just inside the area. Juventus failed to create a decent scoring opportunity after going behind. Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal (left) tries to get his side back into the match against Parma .

The Sardinian side hit the woodwork for a third time in the 21st minute when Paul-Jose M'Poku's effort crashed off the crossbar. M'Baye Niang broke the deadlock seven minutes after the break when he turned in Facundo Roncaglia's low cross from close range and Iago Falque doubled Genoa's advantage minutes later after good work from Diego Perotti.

In the evening game, Inter Milan beat Verona 3-0 to end a seven-match winless run in all competitions. Roberto Mancini's side are now joint eighth in Serie A alongside AC Milan and Genoa with 41 points. Mauro Icardi gave Inter an 11th minute lead, tapping in Rodrigo Palacio's low cross for his 16th Serie A goal of the season as the home defence appeared to be distracted by an apparent injury to Panagiotis Tachtsidis, who quickly recovered. Palacio extended Inter's lead after halftime before their goalkeeper Samir Handanovic continued his remarkable run of penalty saves by denying Luca Toni from the spot. The Slovenian has saved seven of the last eight penalties against him. An unlucky own goal by Vangelis Moras in stoppage time completed Inter's win.","Jose Mauri scores only goal of the game for bottom of the league Parma .

Our objective is not to beat Atletico, but to dream of winning the Champions League. 'Every match presents its own problem. Every match has its idea. Every defeat was different.

'Bale is fine. I have the whole squad available and they are very fresh. If one doesn’t play, another will. But Bale is at 100 per cent.' ‘Bale had a fantastic season last time and scored in both finals. We hope to play more finals over the coming months and he will be important, like last year,' he added.

"Former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez believes it is harder to score goals in Serie A than the Premier League. The Argentine, who has scored 36 goals in the Italian league since arriving at Juventus in the summer of 2013 blasted Premier League midfields as 'non-existent', and suggested defending is better on the continent. After sitting out Juve's defeat to bottom of the table Parma, ahead of a Champions League quarter-final against Monaco on Tuesday, Tevez who has scored 25 times for the Old Lady this season, insisted his task was now 'much more difficult'. Carlos Tevez, in action against Empoli in Serie A, says it is harder to score goals in Italy than England . The striker has 36 league goals in the Italian top flight since leaving England for Juventus in 2013 . 'It's much easier to score in the Premier League, where the ball doesn't stop moving, the action is everywhere and the midfield is non-existent,' the striker, who scored 84 Premier League goals and won three titles, told Italian paper La Repubblica. 'Here you see a striker up against five defenders, it's much more difficult than in England. The Italian league is of a high standard.' The striker, who won the Champions League with Manchester United in 2008, believes his Juventus team are more rounded than that side, and can repeat the success. 'That was a different situation,' he added. 'There were some amazing examples: Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes. 'I think that now there is a team instead. We are very hard to beat.' The Argentine striker scored 84 Premier League goals and won three titles with Manchester United and City .

"Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri is expecting a 'boring' match against AS Monaco in the Champions League on Tuesday, believing that both sides will adopt a cautious approach. 'Our target is to get through this round and reach the semi-finals, and if we qualify 1-0 or 1-1 (on aggregate), that's all the same to me,' said Allegri, whose side are at home in the quarter-final first leg on Tuesday. 'It could be a boring game, the important thing is not to concede a goal at home.' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri strolls in to his pre-match press conference on Monday . The Juventus squad look relaxed as they are put through their paces in sunny Turin . Allegri warned that Monaco, who have conceded only four goals in eight games on their way to the quarter-finals, would be a completely different proposition to Borussia Dortmund, who Juventus beat 5-1 on aggregate in the last 16. 'The tie against Monaco is much more complicated than the one against Dortmund,' he said. 'They are two very different teams, the French side concede few goals and it's always more complicated to play against a team that doesn't go forward very often. Veteran midfielder Andrea Pirlo has returned to training after a calf injury . Claudio Marchisio looks focused as he engages in a training drill on Monday . Arturo Vidal (left) and Fernando Llorente will both be hoping to start in the Champions League quarter-final . 'It's tempting to go forward ourselves and there is the risk of leaving spaces for them. We need patience, humility and intelligence, and to realise that we are not going to settle qualification in Turin. 'I think they (Monaco) have richly deserved to get to the quarter finals,' added Allegri. 'They conceded one goal in six games during the group stage, eliminating Benfica and Zenit St Petersburg. In Ligue 1, they have the best defence with 22 goals conceded (in 32 games). These figures do not come by chance.' Experienced defender Giorgio Chiellini smiles as he talks to the media on Monday afternoon . Allegri said that playmaker Andrea Pirlo had been included in the squad after recovering from a calf muscle injury, and he now had to decide whether the 35-year-old could be plunged into the tie after a seven-week lay-off. 'Pirlo hasn't played for more than 40 days, I'll decide after the last training session,' he said.","Juventus take on Monaco in Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday .

"Blackburn should brace themselves for interest in their players from top-flight clubs following their run to the FA Cup quarter-finals, manager Gary Bowyer has said. Sky Bet Championship side Rovers were eliminated from the competition on Wednesday night by Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool, who booked a semi-final date at Wembley at the second time of asking thanks to Philippe Coutinho's angled 70th-minute finish in an Ewood Park replay. It ended a memorable FA Cup journey for Rovers that had included resounding home victories over Barclays Premier League sides Swansea and Stoke in previous rounds. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer believes the club should brace themselves for interest in their players . The manner in which they dispatched those two, coupled with the fact they frustrated Liverpool for the majority of the 180 minutes, is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by bigger clubs plotting their summer spending. Bowyer is no stranger to staving off interest in his prized assets, having rejected advances for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede in the past two transfer windows, and the Rovers boss expects overtures for more of his men in a few months' time. 'What the players have done is they've put themselves on a platform and shown that they can play in the Premier League,' he said. 'They've got to maintain that over the next six games and show the Premier League big boys. That's obviously the nature of the game that we're in, I'm not going to kid myself. 'It's the nature of business. If you look at all the clubs now, everybody sells. Liverpool sold (Luis) Suarez in the summer. 'You've seen over the two games against Liverpool and in previous games against Swansea and Stoke that we've got some very good young players. They're developing, they're growing and getting some real experience under their belts.' Blackburn strikers Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede have both attrackted in the last two transfer windows . Blackburn's owners Venky's have previously adopted a strong stance on possible outgoings, telling Hull and Crystal Palace that Rhodes and Gestede would be remaining in east Lancashire. However, that position may have to soften if Rovers are to bring their mounting debts down as they look to adhere to the Financial Fair Play regulations. Their recent failure to do so caused the Football League to place them under a transfer embargo which Bowyer knows has left him restricted when injuries have hit. 'You always want to keep your players and we want to be in a position to add to it,' he added. 'We've got to try and do as much as we can with this embargo. The embargo's just caught up with us because we haven't been able to bring enough bodies in.' Bowyer shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers ahead of Wednesday's FA Cup replay . Indeed, Bowyer's options are so stretched at the minute that he joked he is considering starting goalkeeper Simon Eastwood in attack against Reading this Saturday. The stopper almost produced a moment for the FA Cup annals on Wednesday when, after coming up for a Tommy Spurr long throw, his swivel and shot deep into stoppage time almost beat Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal. 'We sent Easty up, more in hope than anything, we didn't know he had that football ability in him to turn and hit it on the spin,' Bowyer admitted. 'He's put himself forward for centre forward on Saturday!' Goalkeeper Simon Eastwood almost scored a late equaliser beyond Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet .","Blackburn's Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede have both attracted interest .

"Rangers top scorer Nicky Law has emerged as a £500,000 target for a trio of English Championship clubs. Sportsmail understands Law's representatives have fielded calls from no fewer than ten English clubs. But Brighton, Birmingham and Reading are showing the strongest interest in a player who also the target of January interest from Bolton boss Neil Lennon and Huddersfield Town. Rangers Nicky Law (right) scores one of his two goals against Raith Rovers on Sunday . Law scored twice in Sunday's 4-0 rout of Raith Rovers to take his tally for the season to 12 and has been a rejuvenated figure under interim manager Stuart McCall, his former Motherwell boss. McCall has been in charge for seven games, winning four, and would like to keep Law - but has yet to discover if he will be handed the Rangers job on a permanent basis. Pushing for promotion to the Premiership via the play-offs the Ibrox club face Livingston tomorrow night with final decisions yet to be reached a dozen players out of contract in the summer. Law (left) celebrates after scoring for Rangers in their 4-0 win against the Kirkcaldy club at Ibrox . Midfielder Ian Black is one of those likely to leave and is attracting interest from new Wigan boss Gary Caldwell. Veteran striker Kenny Miller, in his third spell at the club, remains non-committal saying: 'I can only speak for myself but I have put talks about contracts and the likes on hold because it's more important we get back to where we belong – which is the Premiership. 'I'm not really worried or thinking about it too much because a big part of it will come down to whether or not we are successful. 'After that, if we've done that, then there is probably a better chance of people getting contracts.' Rangers pair Ian Black (left) and Kris Boyd take part in a training session at Ibrox last week . Meanwhile, former Rangers starlet Lewis Macleod will almost certainly not kick a ball for Brentford this season after his £850,000 January move. The Scotland Under 21 star was expected to make a big impact as the Griffin Park side battled for a shock place in the English Premier League for the first time. Macleod suffered a hamstring injury in his final game for Rangers at Alloa's Indodrill Stadium in December. He's suffered further setbacks at the London club and has so far only managed to play 45 minutes for Brentford reserves since his move. Kenny Millar (right) challenges Raith Rovers' Martin Scott for the ball during the Championship clash . Now Brentford manager Mark Warburton - who is leaving the club at the end of the season - has admitted he doesn't want to risk the 20-year-old and may not even get to see the youngster play this season. He explained: 'He's coming along. We have to be fair to the player. I want him to be involved. 'He's been out for three or four months and he's got to be comfortable that he can commit 100 per cent. 'The last thing you want to do is put a player on with a doubt in his mind with regards to a sprint, challenge, jump or tackle. He's very close but we have to be fair to the player.' Macleod missed most of last season too after taking an adverse reaction to a viral infection affected the muscles around his heart.

"Bournemouth moved four points clear at the top of the Championship with a win against Brighton as manager Eddie Howe set club records tumbling. They scored with their first shot on target in the 70th minute, well worth the wait when Yann Kermorgant hit a wonderful 25-yard free-kick which wrong-footed Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale and flew into the left of goal. With only their second accurate effort, in the 81st minute, Callum Wilson extended their lead by running on to Kermorgant’s ball over the top and twice turned Greg Halford before finishing.

In doing so they set a club record 106 goals in all competitions, beating 104 from the 1956-57 and 1928-29 seasons. And Wilson’s strike was their 89th league goal of the season, moving clear of the previous record 88 they scored in the Division Three South in the 1956-57 season. Prior to the goals they had not looked like the typically fluent Bournemouth that has made them league leaders for the majority of the campaign. The passes were hit that little bit too long, the crosses went out for goal kicks and the through balls were slightly mistimed. Brighton’s Leon Best got in behind their defence in the 58th minute and shaped to bend an effort into the right of goal but his shot was woeful, weak and straight at Artur Boruc. Four minutes later, Mustafa Carayol made a driving run through the middle and got a powerful shot away from the edge of the box but Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick dived in front to block. But Bournemouth showed they can win ugly and when the game is not going their way, as well as dominating teams with their passing. Howe is well aware that nerves will come into play with his players as they battle for promotion to the Premier League for the first time in their history. Yet his side are starting to demonstrate that they can handle the pressure. Four more games remain, against Reading, Sheffield Wednesday, Bolton and Charlton - a run of fixtures which they should deal with comfortably.

"It's all Pep Guardiola's fault; him and the good folk of Scotland or, at least, St Andrews. It is a simplification, of course, but perhaps a useful way of understanding why, as we survey the Champions League quarter finals, there are no Premier League clubs troubling the scorers. Bayern Munich take on Porto on Wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben among others you might anticipate a sixth Champions League semi-final for Guardiola in his six years of management. Of course Guardiola isn't alone responsible for the decline of the Premier League in Europe; nor is it really down to St Andrews, though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental Europe overhauling the English clubs. Pep Guardiola prepares his side for their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Porto . The Bayern boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a training session on Tuesday . Something happened back in 2008 when Guardiola took over at Barcelona and it wasn't that the Barcelona team changed. Frank Rijkaard had virtually the same players but Guardiola managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them. What happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in St Andrews, where the Barcelona team spent their first pre season under Guardiola. There Messi was a distracted individual, sometimes sneering at Guardiola's insistence on organisation and pressing, according to Guillem Balague's account in his biographies of Messi and Guardiola. But a breakthrough came when Guardiola stuck up for Messi in his battle with the club to play for Argentina in the Beijing Olympics. The new manager took the young Argentinian under his wing, sidling up to him after training, putting his arm round him to assure him of his support. Guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth Champions League semi-final in his six years as a manager . Guardiola got Messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent Argentina at the Beijing Olympics . Messi, the precocious star, suddenly felt he had an ally in Guardiola. And, as a result, he began to buy into Guardiola's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football, which was already a template at Barcelona. For tiki taka is not what made Guardiola’s team great. 'I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It's rubbish and has no purpose.' It sounds like Sam Allardyce, but those are the words of the great high priest of possession football as reported by Marti Perarnau in his book Pep Confidential. What Guardiola added to Barcelona’s game was the intensity, drive and sheer energy which had wilted under Rijkaard and then moulded it with overwhelming possession. Sometimes, when assessing the English problem in Europe, it helps to reverse the question. So, rather than ask 'Why are we so bad now?' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005-2009?' Guardiola led Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011 (pictured) The former Barcelona manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success . For Chelsea fans pointing to the 2012 triumph, that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of English clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier, bucking the established trend. Between 2005-2009 the Premier League provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the Champions League; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24. Even asking that question is revealing as what English clubs were really good at during that period was making the semi finals and the final rather than winning the trophy. Only Liverpool and Manchester United actually achieved that in the five-year period of English ascendancy, though, of course, Chelsea did so improbably in 2012. What was different about English clubs in that period was the injection of some of the finest tactical minds in the game to the Premier League. Jose Mourinho may never have won the trophy with Chelsea but he transformed their approach and arguably provided the foundations for the 2008 final and the remarkable 2012 win. Rafael Benitez was an extraordinary force, the Diego Simeone of that era, regularly out-witting Mourinho and taking a relatively normal Liverpool team to two finals. Guus Hiddink engineered a fine run to the semi finals building on the work of Mourinho. Manchester United won the Champions League in 2008 when English clubs were dominating the latter stages . Chelsea were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds . Rising to the challenge of Mourinho and Benitez, Sir Alex Ferguson was tactically at his peak in that period, playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before Guardiola and others made it fashionable. English teams had always had an intensity with which continental teams had sometimes struggled to cope. What they had lacked often was organisation and tactical nous. Benitez, Mourinho, Hiddink provided that and Ferguson responded. Put all that together and you have a cultural melting pot which, allied to the commercial success of the Premier League, was pushing players and teams to new heights. The Premier League’s TV money of course brought in good, technical foreign players which helped but that does not seem to be the key reason for its success. The money is bigger now and those players still come but it hasn't helped Manchester City. At the zenith of the Premier League's dominance, the 2008 Moscow final, ten English players started the game. Manchester City were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of Barcelona . Chelsea exited at the same stage as England have no representatives in the quarter-finals . When Jurgen Klinsmann spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in Germany in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich - he explicitly referenced the Premier League and its pace. He recognised that continental Europe had fallen behind. It was new tactical ideas meeting the traditional attributes of the English game which helped the Premier League dominate Europe. Conversely, it was Guardiola - and others, such as Jurgen Klopp, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the Premier League. Clubs such as Barca, Bayern, Dortmund have retained their technical superiority over English clubs but they are now likely to out-run them and out-press them. In reality there is no one man responsible for that change. And, Guardiola's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for South American football and especially Marcelo Bielsa, rather than the Premier League. But when that change took place, the Premier League lost its competitive edge. And when Guardiola put his arm around Messi at St Andrews back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game, European football changed forever.","Bayern Munich take on Porto in the Champions League quarter-final .

"Steven Gerrard and Phil Jagielka stood shoulder-to-shoulder and paid a poignant tribute by releasing 96 red balloons in memory of Liverpool fans who died at Hillsborough. Wednesday marked the 26th anniversary of the disaster that unfolded during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and the annual memorial service was typically poignant and emotional. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, chief executive Ian Ayre and the entire Liverpool squad attended, along with a host of former players including Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Phil Thompson, Robbie Fowler, John Aldridge - who gave the second reading - and Jamie Carragher. There was also significant representation from Everton, with manager Roberto Martinez joining his captain Jagielka and club ambassador Graham Stuart, who also gave a reading.

"Liverpool FC are set to take action against a fan who said that two Muslim men praying at the club's stadium were a 'disgrace'. Stephen Dodd caused outrage when he posted a photograph online showing solicitors Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula worshipping during half-time of a FA Cup game. Now club authorities say they will 'take appropriate action' against the supporter, which could include banning him from matches. Fury: Stephen Dodd took this photograph of Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying at Anfield last month . Dodd took a photograph of the two men during a match against Blackburn Rovers last month, with the caption: 'Muslims praying at half time at the match yesterday #DISGRACE.' After facing a huge online backlash he continued to defend himself - saying that he had the right to criticise the men because he is a long-standing Liverpool supporter. Police investigated the incident after receiving complaints from furious web users, but have now passed on the case to the club to investigate. Liverpool FC said in a statement: 'Last month, Liverpool Football Club received complaints of a tweet showing an image of Muslim fans praying during half-time at Anfield accompanied by comments that were offensive to the complainants. 'The club reported the tweet, which was posted online on Sunday, March 8, 2015, to Merseyside Police. Backlash: Dodd tried to defend himself by saying that he was a long-standing fan of Liverpool . 'Merseyside Police investigated the matter and has referred this to LFC to take appropriate action against the individual involved. The club is currently in the process of determining the appropriate action to take and a further update statement will be made in due course. 'Liverpool Football Club would like to remind its supporters that it does not tolerate any form of discrimination and is committed to ensuring that the club and Anfield provides a welcoming and safe environment for all fans regardless of race, religion, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation.' Mr Bodi, 46, from Preston, whose eight-year-old son Ayman can also be seen in Dodd's photo, told the Liverpool Echo: 'My little boy said at the time, ""Someone is taking a picture of us,"" and I thought maybe it was someone who hadn't seen prayers before. 'I certainly didn't expect to be called a disgrace for doing it. But the support since has been very nice and I'm thankful.' Match: The incident took place when Liverpool were playing Blackburn Rovers at Anfield in March . He added: 'We have a small window in which to pray, a bit like the transfer window in football. Once that closes the chance has gone. 'That day, the time came for prayer and the window would have closed before the game finished so we did it at half-time. 'Most people are absolutely fine with it and the stewards at Anfield are wonderful, but it only takes one or two people to react in the wrong way and you could have a nasty situation.' Mr Bhula, 37, who has known Mr Bodi since childhood, offered to meet with Dodd to explain the importance of prayers in Islam. He said: 'We've had a lot of nice comments since and I appreciate that. We weren't harming anybody. 'Education is key to stopping things like this from happening. Maybe the man who took the photo has not come across Muslims before who have explained the significance of prayer. 'I would be quite happy to meet with him to explain why we pray and when it needs to be done.'","Stephen Dodd photographed Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying during half-time at Anfield last month .

"Police say they have no objections to the late afternoon kick-off for Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford. With plenty at stake for both United and City – both sides are challenging for a top-four spot in the Premier League – some may feel that the 4pm start could be unwise as it allows supporters more time in the pub. However, the man in charge of patrolling the sell-out clash has no such fears. Police say they have no objections to Sunday's Manchester derby taking place in the late afternoon . Chief Superintendent John O'Hare says the kick-off was agreed by all parties and revealed that the decision is down to good behaviour from supporters of each side. 'We have not objected to the 4pm kick-off time at all,' he told Sportsmail. 'That 4pm has been agreed is testament to the excellent behaviour of the overwhelming majority of fans who have attended previous derby fixtures. 'It is the positive behaviour of both sets of fans at previous derby fixtures that means we feel confident this Sunday’s fixture will continue that tradition of the fixture being a safe and enjoyable one.' Rio Ferdinand was hit by an object thrown from the crowd during the Manchester derby in December 2012 . In February, Merseyside Police launched a legal challenge after the Everton v Liverpool match, which was also televised, was chosen for a 5.30pm start although they later withdrew their objection. Police in Manchester have met representatives from supporters groups representing each club and agreed a series of measures. Inside the ground fans in and close to the away end will be limited to two drinks every time they visit the bar. No street drinking will be allowed while police will also be searching supporters and keeping an eye out for pyrotechnics. GMP also say they have no intention to hold back City supporters at the final whistle but add that this could be reviewed on the day.

"Barcelona took a major step towards qualification for the last four of the Champions League after they dismantled Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night. Sportsmail's ADAM CRAFTON takes a look at five things we learned from Barcelona's emphatic  victory. Super Suarez . It feels rather strange now but there was a time last summer when we were all wondering whether Luis Suarez - with his penchant for a human-based snack during football matches - was worth all that money for Barcelona. There can be no question anymore. It is now 17 goals for the season and Barcelona's front three, spearheaded by Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar is the most in-form in world football. They are a frightening prospect and Suarez, after three goals in his first 12 games for Barcelona, has hit the high notes at the right time. He has scored 10 in his last 11 games - including two crucial goals away at Manchester City - and his understanding with his strike partners has elevated this Barcelona side to a new level. Luis Suarez scores his second of the night to give Barcelona a 3-0 lead in their tie at Paris Saint-Germain . The former Liverpool forward is mobbed by his Barcelona team-mates after doubling his tally for the evening . PSG yearn for Zlatan's quality . Prior to this game, PSG were unbeaten so far this season when playing without Zlatan Ibrahimovic, winning 11 and drawing 5 of the 16 games. It had developed a view - nourished by that inspiring performance when Ibrahbimovic was sent off at Chelsea - that PSG may be a stronger collective unit without the Swede. Yet on the grandest occasions, you still require that moment of world-class quality and Laurent Blanc really needed Edinson Cavani to stand tall here. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, pictured in action on Saturday, missed the game against Barcelona through suspension . Edinson Cavani failed to deliver the goods for PSG and looked out-of-sorts against Barcelona on Wednesday . Once more, though, the Uruguayan failed to deliver on the biggest stage. PSG fans still wince at the memory of his miss against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last season and so often, he leaves you wanting more in these pivotal games. He was brilliantly denied by a Javier Mascherano challenge in the first half but you sensed he lacked the conviction to really make the most of the opportunity. He does some wonderful things, moving with pace and intelligence but when faced with a guilt-edged opening, he too often loses that defining ability to remain cool and detached when faced by a goalkeeper and the roar of the crowd. When bearing down on Mascherano in the first half, he was like a pianist whose timing has deserted him, hesitating and pontificating. It is now only four goals in 15 games and you can perhaps understand why PSG may be tempted to cash in on him. Neymar back in form . After a run of three goals in 10 games, the Brazilian had begun to fade into the shadows a little, particularly when placed against the the brilliance of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. The local rumour mill had begun swirling and there were suggestions - not without foundation - in the Catalan media that Neymar is unhappy with how often he is substituted by his manager. This was a good response. He remains such a talent and the opening goal tonight was clinically dispatched and marked his 28th goal of an excellent season. Messi was pulling the strings as ever but Neymar was the most eye-catching Barcelona forward in the first-half. Neymar was Barcelona's most eye-catching forward in the first half of their victory against PSG . Neymar celebrates with Luis Suarez after the Uruguayan scored his first of two goals against PSG . PSG's Euro home run comes to an end . This victory for Barcelona brought a shuddering end to PSG's proud unbeaten run at the Parc de Princes in European competition. Barcelona are the first team to win here in either the Europa League or Champions League since Hapoel Tel-Aviv in 2006 - an undefeated streak that had lasted nine years, yielding 22 wins and 11 draws. In truth, the victory was rarely in doubt from the first whistle, such was Barcelona's composure and quality on the ball. Sir Alex Ferguson once described the experience of facing Barcelona's passing game as like being on a 'carousel'. PSG started brightly and for a few moments, it looked like the carousel might have malfunctioned. But it was no more than a glitch. PSG hopped on and when the referee finally called time, they staggered off across the fairground, most probably feeling rather sick. Marquinhos and Yohan Cabaye reflect on PSG's defeat... their first at home in European football since 2006 . Busquets is the midfield maestro . We have marvelled for years at the gifts of Xavi and Andres Iniesta and while the shielding work of Sergio Busquets has also been appreciated, it does seem as though he has become even more prominent under Luis Enrique. He reads the game with such intelligence, stepping in with poise and composure to mop up the danger. Those around him - Iniesta, Rakitic and Xavi add the decoration - but Busquets' consistent brilliance forms the foundations of this Barcelona midfield. Every team is grateful to its 'water-carriers', as Eric Cantona once dubbed Didier Deschamps, but with Busquets in this form, Barcelona could be heading towards the champagne come the end of the season.

"Between the bad behaviour and the bad advice, Raheem Sterling is not exactly endearing himself to potential suitors right now. Hippy crack and shisha pipes, mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject Liverpool’s offer of close to £100,000-a-week, might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running. After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world’s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the £40million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The recent images of Sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with £40million to sign the star . Luis Suarez secured a move to Barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch . English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — Gareth Bale even — requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow. It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool’s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide — unlike Tottenham’s Kyle Walker, for instance. But Rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20-year-old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place. Ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with Sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass Liverpool . It appears that Liverpool stars Sterling and Ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking Fanta . Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Becoming as good as Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) requires  more than just ability alone . He should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble, like Jack Wilshere and Ravel Morrison. Of course, it will not be the first time Rodgers has questioned Sterling over the company he keeps. He has publicly criticised the player’s agent for his role in the England international’s ongoing contract saga — and with some justification given how badly things have been handled. But Rodgers’ criticism of Aidy Ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who, at times, has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems. Ward is credited to some extent with the fact that Sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work. He is said to be polite and courteous to the staff, is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Ibe and Sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. For all the uncertainty over his future, Rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship. The relationship between Ward and Sterling is more personal than the typical agent-player dynamic. They appear to be business partners judging by the company details of Trinity Goals Limited. While Ward has 80 per cent of the equity, the remaining 20 per cent is divided between Sterling and Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But Ward has an almost paternal relationship with Sterling, with the player affectionately addressing him as ‘Uncle Aidy’. Clearly, Sterling needs that kind of guidance. His team-mates might joke that he has ‘more kids than caps’ when he admits to one daughter — he occasionally brings two-year-old Melody Rose into training — but denies a second child. But Sterling’s own childhood was a difficult one. Born in Jamaica and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of Kingston, he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north London in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Back in Jamaica, when he was still only nine, the father he claims never to have known was murdered, reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush. In London, Sterling had to leave his primary school to attend Vernon House, a school in Neasden for children with behavioural problems. ‘As a young kid I had anger issues,’ Sterling admitted in a recent interview, although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him. While Chris Beschi once had to warn Sterling he could end up ‘in prison’ if he failed to change his ways, he remembers someone who was ‘amazingly intelligent in so many ways; a brilliant thinker’. Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Beschi told the Mail on Sunday two years ago that he would walk Sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new Wembley. It proved a source of inspiration, with QPR recruiting him when he was 10. Steve Gallen, academy director during Sterling’s time at QPR, remembers a young player whose ‘mentality’ was ‘his strongest attribute’. He also described him as ‘a coach’s dream’. Gallen also praised Sterling’s mother — Nadine is a nurse — for her positive influence. When Sterling moved to Liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his ‘house parents’. Eventually, however, Nadine moved to Merseyside, living with her son until around a year ago. Judging by recent events, she might need to move back in. Ward should think very carefully before he makes his next move, because the last few weeks have amounted to a PR disaster. Sterling acknowledges young QPR supporters - the Liverpool star joined the Loftus Road club at the age of 10 . There is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player. Particularly when Ward can point to the fact that, right now, a player of Sterling’s value to Liverpool is earning roughly £6m-a- year less than Daniel Sturridge; £35,000-a-week compared with £150,000-a-week. There was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in Sterling’s contract, which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances. By the end of last year, Liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of £100,000-a-week. And if Sterling looks at Sturridge and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall, he probably has a point. Such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal. Managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door. Sterling has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer. The academy staff at Liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club’s system and Rodgers has described him as the finest young player in Europe. Roy Hodgson was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, aged just 19. It is simply the way Ward and Sterling have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable. The unauthorised interview with the BBC; an article in the Sunday Times magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song ‘from the Kop’. The Kop duly obliged on Monday night against Newcastle, informing the scorer of their opening goal that his ‘agent is a ****’. Sterling says it is not about the money, that it is about playing Champions League football and winning trophies. But don’t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal. Don’t take the dispute into the public arena if it’s not a pay rise you’re after, but a transfer. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday's Premier League match at Anfield against Newcastle . Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . If Ward’s intention is to take Sterling away from Liverpool this summer, the player is not making his job easy right now. Alarmed by recent events, Arsenal are already thought to be going cold on the idea. The agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs, that Sterling is a good Christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely, if ever, touches alcohol. He drives a Range Rover; an expensive but sensible car. He was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a ‘beautiful house’ back in Jamaica. Ward might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20-year-old. Trouble is, Sterling is not like any other 20-year-old. He is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions. Does he want to be the best? And if so, is he prepared to make the sacrifices?","New pictures show Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe with shisha pipes .

PSG are also bidding to become the first French side to lift all three domestic trophies in a single season and will face Ligue 2 club and four-times winners Auxerre in the final at the Stade de France on May 30. They take on Bastia in the League Cup final on Saturday and are top of the Ligue 1 table, one point ahead of Olympique Lyonnais, with seven games left. Ibrahimovic opened the scoring at the Parc des Princes from the penalty spot with his 100th goal for the club on 21 minutes following a Francois Clerc foul on Ezequiel Lavezzi. Romain Hamouma levelled for the visitors five minutes later with a powerful header from a rare chance for St Etienne, who were outclassed throughout.

Lavezzi made it 2-1 in the 59th minute from an excellent Javier Pastore cross, before Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted his second with eight minutes remaining after rounding goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier. He completed his hat-trick for the eight-times winners with a powerful low strike in added time. The Sweden striker is now PSG's second highest all-time scorer on 102 goals, behind former Portugal forward Pauleta. 'It's tough but we were vulnerable and we missed too many easy chances,' Saint-Etienne captain Loic Perrin said. 'It's not normal to lose 4-1. We know they're a good team but we should do better than that.' League leader PSG, who are one point ahead of Lyon in the title race, remains on course for a unique quadruple, and plays Bastia in the League Cup on Sunday before facing Barcelona in the first leg of the Champions league quarter finals four days later. On Tuesday, second tier club Auxerre stunned holders Guingamp 1-0 at home thanks to Frederic Sammaritano's first-half goal.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a hat trick and Ezequiel Lavezzi added fourth .

"Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after video footage emerged appearing to show him fighting and aiming a headbutt at stewards after a defeat by Bayern Munich on Wednesday night. Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the Germany's DFB-Pokal at the quarter-final stage, losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the BayArena. But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands. Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards . After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game . Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down . Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final . The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.  Spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour. A Bayer spokesman said: 'It is clear that there has been a physical dispute after the final whistle. We will review the incident and try to clarify now who was there and why they were there.' In the video Spahic, wearing a red club top, is at first restrained by two stewards as members of his group clash with the stadium staff. Spahic is seen breaking away from the clutches of two stewards to assist his friends in the melee . Footage shows Spahic seeming to throw his hands into the faces of some of the yellow-jacketed staff . After breaking free, the 34-year-old joins the melee and appears to throw his hands into the faces of multiple stewards before aiming a headbutt at another even when the brawl dies down. Spahic is expected to miss his side's trip to face Mainz in the Bundesliga on Saturday through injury but he could be in line for a longer spell on the sidelines if action is taken after the incident on Wednesday night. Bayer are fourth in the Bundesliga, two points behind Borussia Monchengladbach in the race for a Champions League place and trailing runaway leaders Bayern by 19 points. Spahic tackles Muller on Wednesday, and he has been one of Bayer's star performers so far this season .

"It is not often you hear this said but the goalkeeper really should have scored. Deep in injury time, with Blackburn’s FA Cup journey about to end, Simon Eastwood appeared for a corner and found the ball at his feet as it dropped from a jumble of players 12 yards out. Eastwood, oddly, had time and, even more strangely given the melee in the area, he had space, too. He had the whole goal to aim at. He should have scored. As it happened, his right-foot shot on the turn was struck well enough but it was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who managed to parry the ball and then grab it as it threatened to spin over the line. We do not blame Eastwood, of course. He is a goalkeeper. But he will wake this morning knowing that a peculiar and romantic part in FA Cup folklore could have been his. Liverpool celebrated a place in the FA Cup semi-finals after beating Blackburn, setting up a Wembley encounter with Aston Villa . Philippe Coutinho scored the decisive goal for Liverpool with 20 minutes to play in their quarter-final replay at Ewood Park .

Blackburn players look dejected while Liverpool celebrate their progression after a hard-fought quarter-final replay . Blackburn goalkeeper Simon Eastwood almost scored a dramatic late equaliser when he went up for a stoppage-time corner . Blackburn defender Matt Kilgallon sinks to the floor at the final whistle after Blackburn's elimination . Blackburn: Eastwood, Henley, Baptiste, Kilgallon, Olsson, Evans, Williamson, Conway (Gestede 65), Cairney, Marshall, Rhodes. Subs not used: Nyambe, Spurr, Songo'o, Lenihan, Steele, Mahoney. Booked: Evans. Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Lovren, Sakho (Toure 28), Moreno, Henderson, Lucas, Allen, Sterling, Sturridge (Lambert 85), Coutinho. Subs not used: Jones, Manquillo, Borini, Brannagan, Markovic. Goals: Coutinho 70. Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire). Attendance: 28,415. Blackburn may not have gone on to win. They were losing 1-0 at the time and a goal so late on would only have taken them in to extra-time. Nevertheless, Liverpool will go on to a semi-final date with Aston Villa knowing that they were almost part of one of the great cup stories — and not in a good way. Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer had looked ready to celebrate the unlikeliest of goals. He said: ‘I think it was more shock that he managed to do that and turn. It was an unbelievable turn from him, a last roll of the dice. To have pushed Liverpool like that over two games and still have a chance like that means there’s nothing but praise for my players.’ Over the course of the piece, Liverpool deserved their win. They were not wholly convincing and will need to improve markedly if they are to win this competition or make another desperate late dart towards the Champions League places. Nevertheless, they dominated the majority of the possession and defended manfully when they had to. Without their two best defenders — the suspended pair Emre Can and Martin Skrtel — Liverpool reverted to a back four and then lost Mamadou Sakho to injury. However, the makeshift pair of Dejan Lovren and Kolo Toure stepped up and deserve credit. Toure was wretched in the Barclays Premier League defeat at Arsenal at the weekend but was excellent here. At times, experience counts for much. So does timing, of course, and Philippe Countinho’s was excellent on Wednesday. With 20 minutes to go, this was a game that looked as though it may be about to swing towards Blackburn.

(Both ties to be played at Wembley) Having just thrown on their big forward Rudy Gestede — a player who had caused Liverpool so much trouble in the first game a month ago — the Championship team were beginning to seriously trouble their opponents. Within a minute of his arrival, Gestede outmuscled Jordan Henderson in the middle of the field and released Tom Cairney, who had to be tackled desperately by Toure. Then, from the ensuing corner, Mignolet was forced to come and palm the ball away rather desperately under pressure. For Bowyer and his team, it looked as though the perfect storm was brewing. Liverpool had enjoyed huge swathes of possession but had most of their approach play floundered against Blackburn’s defensive barricades manned by the exceptional Matt Kilgallon and Alex Baptiste. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet makes a save onto the post to deny Marshall giving Blackburn the lead . Blackburn's Tom Cairney is clipped by Liverpool defender Alberto Moreno after evading the Spaniard's challenge . Now, with the last quarter of the game upon them, Blackburn were scenting blood only for Coutinho to draw their sting with one of the few moments of stardust quality Liverpool managed all night. Seeing a 70th minute corner come back to him from a defender, Coutinho had the awareness to lay the ball off to Henderson and then make a move towards the return. It was this that created the space and the rest — the control and shot across goal in to the corner — was down purely to confidence, touch and purpose. These three qualities had been missing from much of Liverpool’s play. Daniel Sturridge, for example, was wretched. For him every second touch was a tackle and young Raheem Sterling did not do an awful lot better. Liverpool's Brazilian midfielder  Coutinho tries to unlock the Blackburn defence as Kilgallon stands him up . Toure watches on after Blackburn goalkeeper Eastwood makes a save during the first half at Ewood Park . Jordan Rhodes attempts a shot at goal in the second half, but it was blocked by Liverpool defender Toure . Liverpool goalkeeper Mignolet punches the ball clear as Blackburn's Rudy Gestede attempts to head the ball . Liverpool, though, do have players of high class and when people like Coutinho are around the keys to the jail cell are never far from reach. Afterwards, Blackburn manager Bowyer did have a complaint to make. At the start of the second half, Mignolet made a diving save from Cairney and then, from the corner, an even better one from a Ben Marshall header. Replays showed that the ball may have brushed Joe Allen’s arm before it reached the Liverpool goalkeeper. If it did, though, it did not deviate. There is no way that referee Kevin Friend could have spotted it. It would have taken cricket’s Hot Spot to reveal the thinnest of outside edges and as such it was hard to feel too much empathy with Bowyer. Cairney steps away from a challenge from Liverpool midfielder  Allen during the quarter-final replay . Liverpool manager Rodgers and Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer talk in the technical area . Ewood Park was sold out for the quarter-final replay after the initial tie at Anfield last month ended goalless . On the whole, his team were excellent. So, too, were the home crowd who have rather criminally been deprived of nights like this since their club’s ownership changed hands four-and-half years ago. Just as they did in the first game, Blackburn struggled for prolonged possession but still scared Liverpool at times. Jordan Rhodes, for example, should have scored with a header in the first half. Liverpool, for their part, lived on half chances. They are not fluent at the moment. They are in the last four, though. Had the goalkeeper taken better aim, it may have been different.","Philippe Coutinho scored in the 70th minute for Liverpool at Ewood Park .

"Carl Hayman has admitted Toulon 'have a lot of work to do' to secure an unprecedented third consecutive European title, despite reaching the Champions Cup semi-finals. Toulon captain Hayman admitted Bernard Laporte's men were distinctly underwhelmed by their performance levels in Sunday's 32-18 quarter-final victory over Wasps. The Cote d'Azur outfit had Frederic Michalak's unerring boot and Ali Williams' late try to thank for a victory littered with error and inaccuracy. Guy Thompson is tackled by Ali Williams during the European Rugby Champions Cup quarter final match . Toulon will host Leinster at Marseille's Stade Velodrome on Sunday, April 19 in the last four, with Hayman conceding vast improvements are required to lift the inaugural Champions Cup. 'If we want to be in London for the final we've got a lot of work to do,' said Hayman. 'If we're honest with ourselves that was nowhere near what we expect against Wasps, and we're going to have to make big improvements quickly. Alex Lozowski  passes the ball during the European Rugby Champions Cup quarter final match . 'It's great to get through of course, and winning is what counts ultimately, but there were far too many mistakes.' Toulon won back-to-back European crowns to signal the end of the Heineken Cup era, and president Mourad Boudjellal's expensively-assembled cast of stars are out to make continental history this term. No side has ever won three European titles on the trot, though Leicester and Munster have also previously registered back-to-back triumphs. Williams celebrates a try with his Toulon teammate Delon Armitage at the Felix Mayol Stadium . In Sunday's unstructured and sloppy attempts at swashbuckling, Toulon clearly craved the hard-nosed and direct influence of a certain Jonny Wilkinson. England's World Cup-winner's summer retirement leaves a clear void at Stade Mayol, especially when Matt Giteau is missing through injury. The former Australia pivot returned via the bench at the weekend, leaving Michalak to lead an at times befuddled line. Williams dives over to score a last minute try during the  quarter final match between Toulon and Wasps . New Zealand tighthead Hayman believes Giteau's return to fitness will offer a timely extra level of focus to Toulon's approach. Hayman is set to retire at the end of the season, with the 35-year-old currently completing coaching courses in France with a view to launching an off-field career in Europe. The 45-cap All Black admitted: 'I won't burn my boots' at the end of the season however - keeping himself available in the autumn just in case New Zealand suffer a front-row injury crisis at the World Cup in England. Drew Mitchell  is tackled by Alapati Leiua during the match between Toulon and Wasps at Felix Mayol Stadium . Armitage  is tackled by James Haskell  and Matt Mullan during the game at the Felix Mayol Stadium . 'We always try to look for width on the ball and balance that with our power game, so we'll look to continue that, but we've got to make better decisions on the field,' said Hayman. 'Little mistakes, penalties at the scrum, they cost us, and that hurt us. 'Take those out of the game and we're in a far better position at half-time. 'It's great to have Matt Giteau coming back: having guys of that experience to come back into the 10-12 area is going to be invaluable. Matt Giteau breaks with the ball but is tackled by Andy Goode at the Felix Mayol Stadium . 'Michalak played well but you can't underestimate what a difference it makes to have another guy in there to organise the team and give us another voice on the field. 'Having him back especially is going to make a big difference for us. 'Obviously it would be fantastic to go out on a high, Jonny (Wilkinson) was able to do that last year when we won the double and he fully deserved it. 'But like I said, there's a fair bit of work in front of us before we start thinking too much about any of that.'","Toulon reached the Champions Cup semi finals with win against Wasps .

"Will Stevens is hoping for third time lucky this weekend in his bid to finally compete in a grand prix weekend with Manor. Stevens has yet to turn a wheel in anger for his new team in either qualifying or the race in the opening two Formula One events of the year in Australia and Malaysia. Manor have naturally had their teething problems since being rescued from administration, notably in Melbourne where Stevens and team-mate Roberto Merhi failed to make it out on track for a single lap due to the rebuild of their IT infrastructure. Manor driver Will Stevens is hoping to compete in the Chinese Grand Prix this weekend . At Sepang, after taking part in the two Friday practice sessions, Stevens frustratingly missed final practice and qualifying due to a fuel system issue. The 23-year-old, speaking ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix, said: 'Clearly Malaysia was a tough weekend for me. 'It started pretty well, I felt comfortable in the car straight away, and the pace we had in P1 and P2 would have got us easily inside 107 per cent for qualifying, so that was a positive. 'To then miss qualifying and the race was disappointing, but then we came into this year knowing the first few races would be difficult. 'I want to be out in quali and racing, and if I'm not then I'm going to be disappointed and frustrated because my job is to race. Stevens, pictured driving during a practice session in Malaysia, is yet to compete in qualifying this season . 'But I understand everything that has gone on. It's great the team are back (in F1) and I understand the effort that has gone into that. 'It's not as if I'm sitting here not understanding what everyone has had to go through. 'I'm part of the team and I need to understand everything that is going on. As I do, it makes problems easier to get through. 'So third time lucky and I hope this weekend will be good. 'Coming here we're in a much better position again and I'd like to think I'll be racing.' Stevens is confident the problem that struck in Malaysia will not reoccur at the Shanghai International Circuit. Stevens walks alongside his Manor team-mate Roberto Merhi at Sepang Circuit late last month . 'It's about working our way through everything we've got to get through,' said Stevens. 'Gremlins creep up and you have to figure out what they are and move on from there. 'That's what we've done and we're as sure as we can be this weekend we should be running smoothly. 'Roberto saw the flag in Malaysia, which was great for the team he did. It was good data and mileage.

"British taekwondo fighter Aaron Cook has confirmed he plans to compete for Moldova at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Dorset-born Cook, 24, who was overlooked for the Great Britain taekwondo squad at London 2012, applied for citizenship after receiving funding from Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici and has now received his passport from the small eastern European state. 'I will soon begin a new journey representing the Republic of Moldova at all International competitions and hopefully the Rio Olympic games and beyond, should I qualify,' Cook wrote on his Facebook page. Three time European champion Aaron Cook (right) has refused to fight for Great Britain  since May 2012 . The British taekwondo star has been granted citizenship by Moldova and plans to fight for them in Rio 2016 . 'Although I am upset and disappointed I will not represent my country of birth at another major championships, I felt I had no other option. 'I am a fighter at heart and I am not going to throw away 20 years of dedication because of bureaucracy.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, felt he was overlooked for London 2012 - when Lutalo Muhammad, who was selected instead, won bronze - because he decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Cook is aggrieved at being overlooked in favour of Lutalo Muhammad, who won bronze at London 2012 . GB Taekwondo has always denied this, but Cook has refused to compete under the British flag since May 2012 and has fought for the Isle of Man since early 2013. 'It has been an amazing couple of years full of memories, and I would have loved to continue competing under the Isle of Man banner,' Cook said. 'Unfortunately that was never going to be possible as it was made clear to me in May of last year, after winning the European Championships for the third consecutive time, that it would not be possible for me to be selected for Team GB, regardless of my world ranking or performances. Cook competes against Mauro Sarmiento at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 . 'Having received no funding or support from the GB system and financing myself since June 2011, this was not a situation that was acceptable to me and I did not want to put myself, family, friends, supporters or sport through the same situation we were forced to endure at the London 2012 Olympic Games.' Cook hopes to represent Moldova for the first time at the inaugural Baku European Games in June having served the mandatory three-year period since representing a previous country. However, the British Olympic Association could yet block the move and Sportsmail understands it is still in talks over the matter.","Aaron Cook was overlooked by Team GB for the London Olympics .

"Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’","Nathan Hughes accidentally knocked out George North during Northampton's 52-30 victory against Wasps on March 27 .

"Michael Phelps is to return to competition following the end of his six-month ban for drink-driving. The 29-year-old American - the most decorated Olympian in history with 22 medals, 18 of them golds - will compete at the Arena Pro Swim Series event in Mesa, Arizona, from April 15-18. Phelps was suspended by USA swimming following his drink-driving arrest in September when police caught him travelling at 84mph in a 45mph zone in Baltimore, Maryland. Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic medals, 18 golds, but was banned from swimming in September . Having served his six month suspension the American will return to the pool in Arizona next week . 'My suspension is finally up! Time to get back in the pool and race again! Looking forward to #mesa !!,' Phelps wrote on his official Twitter account. The Arizona meeting is the same one at which Phelps returned to last year after a 20-month retirement from competitive swimming. Phelps is still serving the 18 months of probation he received from a Baltimore District Court judge after he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in December. The drink-driving arrest was Phelps' second in 10 years, and he responded by seeking treatment for alcohol abuse at an in-patient centre in Arizona. Phelps has been training in Baltimore and performed will in an exhibition race last month . Phelps has since returned to Baltimore where he has been training with long-time coach Bob Bowman and he swam impressively in a March exhibition race. As part of his punishment from USA Swimming, Phelps was also removed from the US team for the FINA World Championships to be held in Russia this summer. But USA Swimming executive director Chuck Wielgus said last month there was a chance Phelps could be restored to the team ahead of what would be his fourth Olympic Games at Rio in 2016.","Michael Phelps is the most successful ever Olympian with 18 gold medals .

"Wasps made an honourable and defiant exit from the Champions Cup on Sunday as they took the holders to the wire and may have clinched a seismic upset, but for a glaring official oversight. Dai Young’s side became the third of four English challengers to be dispatched from Europe’s premier event over a punishing weekend, but this was no meek capitulation. Despite the chronic inconvenience of losing Nathan Hughes to a contentious ban and Christian Wade to an untimely injury, the visitors raged gallantly against the dying of the light.

Penalties: Lozowski (2) Referee: George Clancy (Ireland) Toulon are back-to-back continental champions, awash with Test talent, but they were given a scare by their tenacious opponents — and even forced to adopt sly, illegal tactics to survive a second-half fightback. Seven minutes from full-time amid a cacophony at Stade Felix Mayol, Wasps launched a daring raid from their own 22 which eventually culminated in a second try for Will Helu, but it also featured a miscarriage of justice. Former All Black lock Ali Williams pulled back Elliot Daly off the ball as he ran clear in support of Joe Simpson. It was surely one of the most obvious offences of its type ever committed in the sport, yet Williams not only avoided a yellow card, but he was on hand to touch down three minutes from time for the try which distorted the final scoreline. Wasps were left battered and beaten, but richly deserving of the ovations from their pockets of supporters around the ground. Captain James Haskell’s work-load was worthy of three men and Andrea Masi also gave body and soul to the cause, while Simpson and Daly were outstanding.

Young was delighted with how his side had performed, once they stopped being so deferential. ‘I’m really proud of the effort and the commitment,’ he said. ‘There was real frustration in the first half, because we gave them a bit too much respect in the first 30 minutes. We were a little bit frantic, a little bit panicky, but we will learn from that and I thought we played some really good stuff on occasions. I’m pleased that we were in it right to the end.’ Wasps defence descend on Toulon's Guilhem Guirado at the Felix Mayol Stadium on Sunday .

The Top 14 leaders went into the break 22-6 up, but Wasps turned the tables as Daly scorched down the right to tee up Helu’s first try. Michalak’s sixth penalty appeared to settle the holders, but Helu touched down for the second time after another crucial intervention by the outstanding Daly. When Williams went over to quell the uprising moments later, it secured Toulon a semi-final against Leinster in Marseille, and left Wasps to head home craving another shot at this tournament next season.","Toulon beat Wasps in their European Rugby Champions Cup quarter-final .

Clarke, a winner as player and coach at Chelsea, has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion, with progression the only objective. 'I think when you go through to semi-finals, the only way to enjoy it is to win the game,' the Reading manager said. 'You can't go to Wembley and play the occasion. It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal. 'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch. The Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley . 'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run. 'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.' Clarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith. One bookmaker has them at 14/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins. It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup . 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.' Reading have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final, with Pavel Pogrebnyak fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of Tuesday's 1-0 loss to table-topping Bournemouth. Steve Clarke was appointed Reading manager in December 2014 to replace Nigel Adkins . Clarke felt defeat was harsh on his side, stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter-final replay against Bradford. 'Cup competitions, one-off games, we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom, a little less nervousness, if you like,' the Royals boss said. 'I think the league campaign has been disappointing. There is sort of a feeling of doom and gloom around the league campaign this year which is never nice. Reading have struggled in the Championship but have brought FA Cup euphoria to the town with their great run . 'I think that is reflected in the game (against Bournemouth), when we are knocking at the door in the last 10 minutes and knocking on the door very, very much. 'Bournemouth, because they're on a winning run, know how to get over the line and win at the moment. 'We're struggling in the league a little bit to find a way to win games, whereas in the cup we've been good. 'We've known how to win the cup games so hopefully that continues on Saturday.'","Reading face  Arsenal in FA Cup semi-final on Saturday at Wembley .

"At the start of the year the prospect of Manchester United leading rivals Manchester City going into April's derby at Old Trafford looked extremely unlikely. But Louis van Gaal's side have hit form at the right time, while the current Premier League champions seem to have blown their chances of retaining their title after crushing defeats at Burnley and Crystal Palace. Since City beat United 1-0 last November, plenty of players have improved, some have faded, while both Van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini have tinkered with their systems. Here, Sportsmail looks at how a composite XI of the sides might take shape, choosing the 4-2-3-1 formation both teams seem to favour. The Manchester United and Manchester City composite Xi ahead of the derby - selected by Sportsmail . Louis van Gaal (l) and Manuel Pellegrini's (r) sides are in contrasting form going into the Old Trafford clash . Goalkeeper - David de Gea . Just gets the gloves ahead of Joe Hart. A very close call, especially given the Englishman's form over recent weeks, but the athletic Spaniard edges it. David de Gea edges out Joe Hart for the goalkeeper slot and has been in fine form at Old Trafford this season . Right back - Pablo Zabaleta . Form has been patchy this term but is the best right back either club can boast. Manuel Pellegrini may opt for the more defensive Bacary Sagna, but he should not do so if only so we can see Zabaleta renew acquaintances with Marouane Fellaini, who elbowed him in the face last season. Pablo Zabaleta hasn't been at his best but is the best right back either club can boast at the moment . Centre back - Vincent Kompany . Like Zabaleta, not had the best of seasons but remains far above anything United currently have at centre-half. Should be coming into his best years but appears to be going backwards. That said, would be some dip in form to see him miss the cut. Vincent Kompany - pictured looking dejected after the defeat by Crrytal Palace - is still the No 1 choice . Centre back - Chris Smalling . Impressive in recent weeks before illness, keeping the likes of Harry Kane and Daniel Sturridge quiet. Deserves his chance to rectify his derby disaster, when he was red-carded at the Etihad in November. Chris Smalling was sent off in the last Manchester Derby in November and will be looking to make amends . Left Back - Gael Clichy . Both clubs may strengthen at left back in the summer although United will want more from Luke Shaw. Clichy has done well to keep out Aleksandar Kolarov for long periods and is a better left back than Daley Blind, despite the versatile Dutchman's sterling performances there recently. Both United and City will be looking to strengthen at left back this summer but for now Gael Clichy is best fit . Sport analysts BSports are predicting Manchester City are likely to win the derby at Old Trafford . Centre midfield - Michael Carrick . Finally getting the recognition he deserves outside of Old Trafford. At 33 he is excelling at the back of midfield in a quarterback role and has been at the heart of United's revival. Michael Carrick has been at the heart of Man United's revival - playing in a quarterback position in midfield . Centre midfield - Ander Herrera . United's man-of-the-moment finally appears to be on the right side of Van Gaal after a sluggish start. The box-to-box Spaniard is evidence of the Dutchman's claims that given time to adapt to his methods, his players will succeed. Ander Herrera is Louis van Gaal's man of the moment and seems to be flourishing in the manager's system . Attacking midfield - Juan Mata . March's player of the month is another to flourish after a sluggish opening. His two goals at Liverpool and understanding with Ander Herrera have helped United launch what looked for a long time like an unlikely assault on second place. Juan Mata has a fine understanding with Herrera and scored this stunning goal against Liverpool last month . Attacking midfield - David Silva . Arguably City's greatest player of all time, the nimble-footed magician drifts effortlessly into the side. Has remained superb despite the slump and continues to create chances for his suddenly-wasteful team-mates. David Silva has remained superb despite City's slum and continues to create chances for his team-mates . Attacking midfield - Wayne Rooney . The Scouser who loves the Manchester derby. Has scored 11 times against City and has more goals than anyone else in the long history of this fixture. Wayne Rooney has scored more goals than anyone in the Manchester Derby and is in good form up front . Striker - Sergio Aguero . Another underperformer who should be doing better for City, the Argentine has not scored in his last six matches. That said, few would bet against him ending that run on enemy territory. Sergio Aguero is another City underperformer but could end his six-game run without a goal against United . PLAYER TALLY . MANCHESTER UNITED - 6 . MANCHESTER CITY - 5 .","Manchester United lead Manchester City in Premier League ahead of derby .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal says he has been dreaming of beating rivals City in Sunday's derby at Old Trafford but will have to do so without Robin van Persie. Van Persie said he was fit to feature in the game against City on Sunday after ankle trouble but Van Gaal has ruled him out. 'Most of the players are fit but being fit for me is different,' Van Gaal said. Robin van Persie will not return to the fray for Manchester United  against Manchester City on Sunday . Louis van Gaal explained at his press conference on Friday that Van Persie is not yet fit enough to play . United players train in the sunshine ahead of their game against local rivals City on Sunday . 'Robin is not fit enough to play.' With City rocking after defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday, Van Gaal and his players have an opportunity to finish as high as second or third  and avoid a Champions League qualifying fixture later in the summer. The United boss wants his side to move towards that target by taking all three points against City. Van Gaal said: ' I dream of it. Every player should dream of the victory. 'Of course I want to win because it's a big step up the table also. If we win then third place is available. Van Gaal watches on as he prepares his side for his first Manchester derby at Old Trafford . Manager Van Gaal (left) oversees the training while captain Wayne Rooney runs with the ball .

'If we win then the position in the table is good as we would then almost certainly be qualified for the top four. And if we are third it's better than the goal we set in pre-season.' Van Gaal acknowledged that City will provide a stern challenge to his team and played down the idea he will be motivated by revenge, after losing the away fixture earlier in the campaign. 'We have lost 1-0, that is my history, the last game,' Van Gaal said. 'I say always in such games, always, you have to control your aggression. 'We did not do that at that time. So I hope we have learned from that moment. I cannot say because we lost that game that we have to win this game. 'In my opinion, you can lose to Man City two times. That is possible.' The United boss also ruled out a potential return for Luke Shaw. Like Van Persie, Van Gaal does not yet consider him fit enough to feature. 'I don’t think Shaw is fit enough to play,' Van Gaal said. 'But I cannot say they are not fit, but in my opinion they are not fit to play. That is a different question.'

"Louis van Gaal says the prospect of facing Aston Villa scared him more than the idea of taking on Manchester City at Old Trafford. United will be looking to end a run of four successive Manchester derby defeats on Sunday when City make the short trip across town. Van Gaal lost his first encounter with United's closest rivals last November, when Sergio Aguero struck the only goal in a 1-0 win for the Blues. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal insists he is not worried about the prospect of his side facing Man City . Van Gaal, pictured with Juan Mata on Friday, believes Man City will not be as defensive-minded as Aston Villa . Manchester United are currently one point ahead of local rivals Manchester City . But Van Gaal is confident of victory this weekend, stating that he thinks City's attacking tendencies will work in United's favour. Van Gaal believes teams that come to Old Trafford looking to scrap for a point are much harder to beat. Van Gaal is so sure of that theory that he spent less time fretting about Sunday's opposition than he did last week when relegation-threatened Villa came to Old Trafford. 'I had more fear of Aston Villa than Manchester City,' the United manager said, before adding: 'Aston Villa was more defensive. 'I don't expect Manchester City shall play so defensive as Aston Villa. Then you need a lot of focus and concentration on our defence. 'A long ball is very difficult to defend. But (against) Manchester City, I don't expect very much long balls. 'It's another game and that's why I have less fear against Manchester City in spite of losing 1-0 against them in the last game.' Ander Herrera scored two goals as Manchester United picked up all three points against Aston Villa . Sergio Aguero scored the only goal of the match during this season's previous Manchester derby . That is not to say he would not cherish his first win over City. 'I dream of it, every player shall dream of the victory,' the United boss said. During his nine months in charge, assistant manager Ryan Giggs and club chef Mike Donnelly have taught the Dutchman about United's rivalries. But if he needed a reminder of the enmity between City and United, he got it this week from his wife Truus, whose hairdresser is a blue. 'I'm not so often in the city, but when I am there, the people are talking about the derby and even when I come home my wife is saying the things they have told her about this derby,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'My wife's hairdresser is a Manchester City fan so there is a lot of discussion between these two women. 'I like it. You play football for the fans and I hope we can give our fans the victory.' Bragging rights are not the only thing at stake. Victory would strengthen United's grip on third place as they would then be four points clear of their 'noisy neighbours'. A third-placed finish would guarantee direct entry into the Champions League and that is what Van Gaal is aiming for. 'When you win, third place is then reachable and a month ago nobody was thinking about that, besides me, of course,' Van Gaal said. 'Third is good because you are certainly qualified for the Champions League and then we do better than the goal that was set in pre-season.' Chris Smalling was sent off during his side's defeat at the Etihad Stadium back in November . Smalling is heckled by Manchester City supporters as he makes his way off the field . The fact that United and City are effectively battling for third position shows how disappointing their seasons have been. But Van Gaal has warned he will be setting out to land the top prize next year, after making a few additions to his squad. 'I want to improve my selection for the next season. Then we can make a bigger step,' he said. 'Sir Alex Ferguson has done it before. Jose Mourinho is doing it now. 'Last season he didn't win anything. Now he is winning the title, now I try to do that also.' United's run of five straight league victories has moved them above City, who have won just two of their last seven games in all competitions. The fact that City have had the edge on their rivals recently does not seem to bother the Dutchman though. 'That's not my history,' he said. 'The last game we played against them and we had a red card in the 39th minute - that is my history.' Chris Smalling was the man who was dismissed at the Etihad Stadium. The defender earned his first booking for blocking Joe Hart as he went to kick the ball out of his hands, and he was cautioned for a second time for clumsily hacking down James Milner. Van Gaal will remind his players they must stay on the pitch this weekend. He said: 'In such games always you have to control your aggression and we did not do that then, so I hope we have learned from that moment. 'We have had five red cards this year. It's a record in my career as a manager and that's not good.'","Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is not concerned about Man City .

"Manuel Pellegrini has insisted he is not impressed by United's rise up the table. Asked for his thoughts about his team's great rivals surging past them in the Barclays Premier League, the Manchester City boss said: 'Not impressed, no, because I think Louis van Gaal has a career as a manager where his teams are always offensive teams, teams that win titles everywhere.

Pellegrini feels that Juan Mata (left) and Ander Herrera are top players and central to United's run of form . Pellegrini has also singled out United's Dutch defender Daley Blind (right) as a key part of United's team . 'For me, the strange thing was why they didn't do it before, earlier in the season. 'But it's not a surprise how they are playing in this moment.' City have lost five of their last seven games in all competitions and have not won away since mid-February. That run has seen them slide off Chelsea's shoulder at the top of the league and down to fourth place. Pellegrini reiterated his stance that he is not fearful about losing his job but admitted his team have extra motivation ahead of Sunday's game. 'I think the first motivation is always to win,' he said. 'Being a derby against a team like United that dominated the league for so many years, it's more. 'At one time Sir Alex Ferguson said the neighbours were disturbing them a little bit more, so I say that's double motivation for us.'

"It is not a match to decide the title, as has been the case in earlier seasons. But the Manchester derby this Sunday still holds great significance for both clubs, managers and, of course, supporters. City have won the last four contests between the sides, as well as the previous three at Old Trafford. A number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time. Here Sportsmail assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers. Can Manuel Pellegrini survive a derby loss? The word is the Chilean’s future will be decided come May when the dust on a creaking season has settled. Defeat to cross-town rivals would push chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though. It would leave City trailing United by four points and likely to finish fourth, needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to Champions League – the very minimum requirement. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) is a man under-pressure at City and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable . Who needs the win more? To that end you would probably have to say City. A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation, and reignite ambitions to finish second, possible saving Pellegrini from the axe. United look set to finish in the top four regardless, the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory. But they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours. United have never lost five in a row to City before. Three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed. Glenn Murray (right) tormented City at Selhurst Park as they dropped out of the Premier League title race . Would victory dispel any lingering doubts about Louis Van Gaal? Quite likely. Three successive wins on the bounce against opposition the stature of Tottenham, Liverpool and City would underline Van Gaal’s ability to rise to the big matches and suggest that, after a season of trial, error, and turnstile selections, the plan is coming together. Those uncertainties around the Dutchman would resurface just as swiftly with defeat of course. Louis van Gaal has had his critics this season but Manchester United's performances are proving them wrong . Should Vincent Kompany remain in the City side? It would be a big call for a game of such size, but the sense that City may be better off without their captain cannot be disregarded. These should be the 29-year-old’s peak years but injuries seem to have affected his body and mind. The Belgian is increasingly prone to errors of judgement. Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala do not provide the most robust competition but Kompany’s appearance in seven losses in 12 games speaks volumes. Mangala, on the bench against Crystal Palace, has experienced three losses in 24 matches all season. Vincent Kompany (left) has struggled for form this campaign and could lose his place for the derby . Where does this rank in English football’s biggest games? Manchester has become a powerhouse of English football through City’s ascent. The city has been home to the Premier League title for the past four seasons, oscillating between Old Trafford and the Etihad. That will not be the case this year but the rivalry still burns and allied to the global scale of these clubs the match ranks as high as any other, perhaps only beaten by Liverpool-United. Mario Balotelli (centre) produced one of the most iconic derby moments when he scored at Old Trafford . Who is the better player right now: Wayne Rooney or Sergio Aguero? No doubt Aguero is the better striker, his movement, angles for shooting, and goal-scoring record stands testament to that. But since being shifted to his preferred centre-forward role, Rooney is displaying form that would see him into any side. He has been approaching his all-action peak and scored seven goals in ten games for club and country, taking his overall season tally to 21. Aguero has 23 for the campaign, but has failed to find the net in his last six games, a run stretching back to February 24. At the moment you would have to go for Rooney. These two love the Manchester derby. Rooney holds the record for most all-time goals with 11, while Aguero has six in seven. Wayne Rooney (left) and Sergio Aguero are two of the best forwards in the current Premier League . How crucial might Michael Carrick be? His return to the United lineup in the fulcrum role in front of defence has lifted the side considerably. He has not enjoyed the best returns facing City in recent seasons – and in the corresponding fixture was asked to play centre-back as a first-half substitute – but will get more space in his deeper midfield role. It is unlikely Pellegrini will task anyone with marshalling Carrick, which is how he likes it. Michael Carrick (left) has become a key player for United over the years and is pivotal for Van Gaal . Will the real Yaya Toure show up? You would hope so. Yaya at the height of his powers in an awesome sight and could prove the difference. But those flashes have been all too fleeting this season. Now would be a good time to step up. Like Kompany, Yaya Toure's form is patchy but he scored a stunning goal against Crystal Palace on Monday . Will United solve the problem of Angel di Maria? The team looks balanced right now, with Ashley Young doing nothing to lose his place. United’s record signing has been coming on and providing assists, so Van Gaal is probably inclined to repeat the pattern. Ultimately, Di Maria must provide more, and will want to, but at this moment he should start on the bench. Why is kick-off at 4pm? Police saw no dangers of the late afternoon kick-off time on a Sunday, and have cited previous good behaviour between sets of supporters. As ever, television dictates the preference and the 4pm slot is prime for viewers. Angel di Maria hasn't quite settled in Manchester but recently has done well when coming off the bench .","The Manchester derby is crucial in the race for the Premier League top two .

"Dick Advocaat says Jermain Defoe’s wonder goal has set Sunderland on their way to Premier League survival – but Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul has been criticised for appearing to congratulate the derby match-winner. The Holland international waited in the tunnel for Defoe at half-time, seconds after he had smashed the stunning 20-yard volley which decided yesterday’s Tyne-Wear clash. Krul smiled and exchanged a fist pump with Defoe, although he later defended his actions. Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher claimed Newcastle keeper Tim Krul made a mistake after congratulating Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe on his goal before half-time . Krul smiles at Defoe shortly after the striker's goal gave the Black Cats the lead in the Wear-Tyne derby . Carragher criticised Krul for his half-time actions while speaking on Sky Sports after the game . However, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was not impressed, as he said: ‘When you watch Newcastle, Tim Krul does look like one of the leaders of the team, but what he did was a mistake. ‘I wouldn't want to see one of my own team doing it. It's not good sportsmanship. Someone without passion for the game might say it is. When you play a derby game, you don't just play on the day, there is a build-up in the week and everyone is on edge. ‘You build yourself into a frenzy where you despise the opposition. At the end of the game you shake hands with everyone, you wouldn't smile.’ Carragher was backed up by his ex-Liverpool team-mate Danny Murphy, who said: 'He shouldn't have done that, you do that at the end of the game. That was out of order.' But Krul countered: 'What I actually thought, I probably can't repeat because it wasn't nice. 'It was a fantastic goal and everyone accepts that, but what I actually thought was more in the region of “what a lucky guy he is”, but with a bit more venom behind it. ‘I've been at this club for 10 years and I'm as hurt as anybody else, so whoever wants to put this negative light on me, it's not justified. 'I'm a Geordie. I've been here 10 years and I'm going home with a lot of pain in my heart. To see those travelling fans going back to Newcastle without a win again, it hurts me as much as them.' Defoe (left) hit a stunning volley on the cusp of half-time to give Sunderland the lead against Newcastle . Defoe celebrates his strike which helped the Black Cats to victory in the Wear-Tyne derby . Sunderland’s victory was their fifth on the spin in this fixture and moved them three points clear of the relegation zone. New boss Advocaat believes it has gone a long way to ensuring their safety. ‘I have always said we will survive, but we had to win today,’ said the 67-year-old, who will leave at the end of the season regardless of which division Sunderland are in. ‘There was a lot of pressure on the team but I got a great feeling when we arrived here on the bus. That was something special and the players felt that. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat congratulates Defoe as he sends on Adam Johnson to replace the striker during the Wear-Tyne derby victory . Advocaat smiles as he looks on from his technical area at the Stadium of Light . The win is Sunderland's first under Advocaat and lifts them three points clear of the bottom three . Sunderland's victory took them above Aston Villa and Hull City in the Barclays Premier League table . ‘The league table looks better now, but the most important thing is May 24. It will look better if we’re here then. ‘I’m proud of the team and I’m proud of our fans.’ Meanwhile, an emotional Defoe hailed his strike as one of his finest. ‘It's one of my best - with my left foot as well,’ said the 32-year-old, ‘but even a tap-in would be massive in a game like this. ‘As the ball was dropping I was just concentrating on the strike. During the week I've done a lot of shooting and as soon as it left my foot I knew it was in. ‘It was an unbelievable feeling when it went in. I was very emotional for some reason, as everyone wanted the three points so badly.’","Jermain Defoe scored stunning volley as Sunderland beat Newcastle 1-0 .

"Jermain Defoe says his stunning Wear-Tyne derby winner is justification for his decision to quit MLS and return to the Premier League. The former FC Toronto striker had scored just twice for struggling Sunderland since arriving on £80,000-per-week wages in January. But Defoe was the hero on Sunday as his 20-yard volley proved enough to secure a fifth straight victory for the Black Cats over Newcastle. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe believes his stunning volley against Newcastle has proven his worth . Defoe's superb first-half strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Wear-Tyne derby . Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was completely helpless as Defoe's shot found its way into the top corner . The 32-year-old was overcome with emotion in the wake of his brilliant blast, and admits the joy it brought to a sold-out Stadium of Light was too much to take in. 'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy. I was just thinking, 'Why me?'. 'As the whistle went for half-time and as I was walking down the tunnel I thought, 'I'm crying and I'm on the telly', but I didn't care. For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The victory was the first of Dick Advocaat's reign and moved Sunderland up to 15th. Defoe has compared the feeling of scoring the winner against Newcastle to scoring at the World Cup . Defoe added: 'The manager said to use beforehand that we were lucky to be playing in a game like this. 'There are so many young kids who wish they could play in a game like this. To be blessed enough and to score the winner is amazing. 'Going on the bus towards the game and seeing everyone outside the hotel, wanting autographs and pictures, there were so many fans there that I felt, 'Wow, this is a massive game'. 'When I scored I got that same feeling as when I scored in the World Cup. I missed the World Cup in 2006 when I felt in my heart I should have gone. 'It hurt me when I didn't go but I went to the next one and when I got the goal (against Slovenia) I was emotional. 'That was scoring in a World Cup for your country. It was the same on Sunday.' Defoe joined Sunderland from MLS side FC Toronoto and feels glad to be back in the Premier League .","Jermain Defoe scored a superb dipping volley against Newcastle to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Wear-Tyne derby .

"Amid the frenetic chaos of a North East derby low on sustained quality came a goal as memorable as any scored in this fixture over the years. Sunderland were the better team here. They were superior in terms of energy and creativity against a Newcastle side rather inexcusably playing — to use the term their manager hates — with their ‘flip-flops on’ once again. Nothing Dick Advocaat’s home team did, however, was anywhere near as exquisite as the goal that won this contest for them. It was a goal seemingly taken from another day and dropped haphazardly right into the middle of a match that didn’t really deserve it.

Only seconds remained in the first half when Sunderland’s earnest but limited centre forward Steven Fletcher leapt to head a long pass from his own goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon towards Jermain Defoe. Still 25 yards out, the former England striker must have thought about bringing the ball under control. He had players arriving in support on either side. It would have been the sensible thing to do. True goalscorers have a mindset that is always switched to ‘glory’, though, and instead of taking the pragmatic route, Defoe decided to buy a ticket for the raffle. Moments after swinging his left foot at the ball he looked up to see it sail over Tim Krul in the Newcastle goal. All of a sudden, he was holding the winning ticket. On a weekend of sensational goals, this was another born of perfect technique, ambition and courage. It deserved to win a game that Sunderland deserved to win and it is up to the rest of Advocaat’s players to ensure it contributes to a run of results that keeps them in the Barclays Premier League.

Just what is it that eats the modern Newcastle? Dressed in grey, they didn’t even look like a Newcastle team. Did they play like one? Sadly, they did. Newcastle have been churning out rubbish like this for far too long now and it is depressing to report that it is becoming the norm. Sunderland were much improved, unrecognisable from the side who conceded four in the first half here against Aston Villa recently. That day, half of the Sunderland supporters were back in their cars by half-time. Here, under a new manager, Sunderland were comfortably better than local opposition who seem to head into derby games expecting to lose.

Krul (left) seems to share a joke with Defoe shortly after the Black Cats forward beat him with a wonderful volley . It was difficult to understand for long periods what Newcastle were actually trying to do. If they were trying to suffocate the game then for a while it worked. Once they got caught, though, they seemed to possess neither the wit nor the willpower to find a way back. Sunderland were not always convincing early on. They earned possession and territory off the back of hard work but didn’t do much with the ball. A Billy Jones cut-back from a corner to the far post was cut out by Jonas Gutierrez in the 10th minute,, while Jordi Gomez struck a low free-kick at Krul and Connor Wickham’s header was deflected wide by Moussa Sissoko, the Newcastle captain. Prior to the goal, however, Sunderland’s play in the final third had been rather unconvincing. Had Newcastle possessed any forward thrust at all, they might have found a way into the game. But once Defoe’s left foot brought the Stadium of Light to its feet, Sunderland rarely appeared in any danger. Another goal would have settled their nerves and they had opportunities. Indeed, they looked more dangerous in the second half. Former Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback (right) fouls Wickham during a ferocious second half display . Sammy Ameobi (right) is closed down by Sebastian Larsson and Billy Jones during the Premier League clash . Sunderland's Steven Fletcher (centre) is beaten in the air by Newcastle midfielder Jonas Gutierrez . Fletcher, though, has never been a goalscorer who has scored many goals — spot the contradiction? — and twice he failed here. A header on the hour needed more power to beat Krul and then another chance, provided by Defoe’s low cross, was spurned on the back of a decision to pivot away from goal and shoot on the turn rather than drive towards goal on his right side. We should not be too hard on Fletcher. He works as hard as any. The difference between a journeyman and an international of standing was evident, though, and Advocaat will be glad that predecessor Gus Poyet at least left him with a striker of pedigree before he was run out of town last month.Sebastian Larsson also failed in front of goal as the clock ticked on while, belatedly, Newcastle found a little something. Pantilimon was finally asked to work when Remy Cabella shot from 18 yards in the 78th minute before Ayoze Perez volleyed over from a corner at the death. That, in truth, was a real chance. A draw, though, would have been a joke. Newcastle manager John Carver admitted afterwards that his team had embarrassed him and it’s not the first time. When the final whistle blew, Defoe — substituted with 12 minutes left — wore a smile as wide as the river and with good reason. His thunderbolt strike, like the Easter sunshine, has lit a flame in Wearside’s season of gloom. They will remember it for a while.

"Head coach John Carver admitted he was 'embarrassed' by Newcastle's capitulation at Sunderland after seeing his side slip to a fifth successive derby defeat. Jermain Defoe's stunning strike was enough to secure a 1-0 victory for the Black Cats, who eased their relegation fears with just a third Barclays Premier League win of the season at the Stadium of Light. The Magpies were desperately poor before the break and only marginally better after it to leave Geordie Carver red-faced. John Carver was left embarrassed after Newcastle United's 1-0 loss at Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby . Carver admitted Newcastle were second best in every department during a fifth straight derby defeat . Jermain Defoe scored a stunning volley for Sunderland to secure a vital win . He said: 'I am sitting here - do you think I'm embarrassed? I am absolutely embarrassed, yes I am. I am embarrassed to be part of it, yes, but I am a part of it and I have to deal with it. 'In the first-half, we were dreadful. I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not closing people down, not working hard enough and I think I was wrong. 'We were second-best in every department, certainly the midfield areas and the front three. 'But what I will say is with a makeshift back four, they stuck by their guns, along with the goalkeeper, and actually kept us in the game because without those guys, we would have been in big trouble. 'If we'd have got to half-time at 0-0, I actually would have been doing somersaults in the dressing room. That's how poor we were.' Defoe smashed home his superb volley in first-half stoppage time to secure Sunderland's victory . And Defoe's goals sparked delirious scenes at the Stadium of Light as Sunderland claimed a massive win . The victory over Newcastle moved Sunderland three points clear of the Premier League relegation zone . Defoe's superb volley in first-half stoppage time won the day for the Black Cats, who remained outside the relegation zone only by virtue of goal difference after Burnley's goalless draw with Tottenham earlier in the day. Defoe blasted the ball past stranded keeper Tim Krul after Steven Fletcher had headed down keeper Costel Pantilimon's long free-kick, but while Dick Advocaat's men enjoyed the better of the game throughout, they were unable to extend their lead. They had to endure a tense conclusion during which Newcastle striker Ayoze Perez volleyed over from close range.

'And then Defoe came and I said, 'Do I have to say something to you or not?', and he said, 'No, I know what I have to do'. 'It's a great boost for everybody.

"The family of murdered Australian baseball player Chris Lane broke down in court as they listened to an emergency call revealing the distressing final moments of his life. The 22-year-old, from Melbourne, was jogging along a street in the rural southern Oklahoma city of Duncan in August 2013, when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past.

Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing.

Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him.

"To mark the point at which Manchester United's season really began to turn around, you have to go back further than the win against Tottenham last month. The truth is that a dark, cold night at Preston North End in mid-February is more significant. United were poor that night in the FA Cup at Deepdale, coming from behind to win. That, however, was the night Wayne Rooney was restored to a centre-forward position, the night Louis van Gaal finally began to realise the best place from which his best player and captain should lead was from the front. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been returned to his preferred position up front . The 29-year-old had previously been deployed in midfield this season and United had struggled . Now, manager Louis van Gaal (left) looks set to unleash an in-form Rooney on Manchester City on Sunday . United actually lost their next game at Swansea but have subsequently won their next five in the league, with Rooney scoring four times. Incredibly, given the pattern of this season, they head into Sunday's derby game with Manchester City as slight favourites. Prior to that night in Lancashire, Rooney was on the verge of knocking on his manager's door to ask for an explanation about his deployment in the centre of midfield. It seemed as though Van Gaal was about to experience his first very real problem at Old Trafford. Whether he sniffed something in the air, we will never know. But Van Gaal performed a sharp volte face at just the right time and Rooney has gone on to become the most significant figure in United's return to relevance. At Old Trafford, just as he has since Cristiano Ronaldo left for Real Madrid almost six years ago, Rooney represents the most serious threat to City's prospects. Prior to the win over Tottenham, Rooney stood before his team-mates in Manchester's Lowry Hotel and delivered an impassioned call to arms. He is once more the central figure at his club, in more ways than one. 'I think some people mix up scoring goals with form,' said Van Gaal yesterday. 'For us Wayne is very important as a player, as a captain and because he can score goals. But he can do that from midfield, too. The last goal he scored — against Aston Villa — came when he was playing in midfield.' Van Gaal's mid-season deployment of Rooney in midfield remains a sensitive subject. No coach likes to admit he may have been wrong. All that matters now, though, is the 29-year-old's current trajectory, which is undoubtedly upwards. His name is written right through recent derby history of course. He is the fixture's record goalscorer and the scorer of one of its most spectacular goals, that remarkable overhead kick back in 2011 that some City supporters, rather oddly, still maintain came off his shin. Previously there had been the transfer saga of autumn 2010. Courted heavily by City as he prevaricated over a new United contract, Rooney most definitely had his head turned. To this day, rumours persist of meetings in an underground car park at the Etihad Stadium — that one has always seemed a little fanciful — and promises of a salary in excess of £300,000 per week. Rooney scores his side's second goal during United's 3-1 Premier League victory over Aston Villa . What we do know is that there was a point when City and their manager Roberto Mancini thought the transfer was about to happen. So, too, did many United fans. 'Join City and You're Dead' warned graffiti on a city-centre poster carrying his image at the time. Had it done so then these fixtures would probably never have been the same again. As it is, derby day now finds Rooney even more fired up and motivated than ever. City have won the last four and one only has to scroll through the tapes to watch the England centre forward's body language, especially during last season's 4-1 reverse at the Etihad, to see exactly how that has gone down. Rooney may be a Liverpudlian but he understands the City rivalry better than most at his club. In Stretford, Rooney has the opportunity to ease United clear of Manuel Pellegrini's team. When asked yesterday if he has a leader of the United captain's ilk in his squad the City manager was less than convincing. 'Every squad has different kinds of personalities, different players,' said Pellegrini. 'All of them have different options to motivate in different ways. 'I don't think it's good to analyse the personality of our captain. In a squad you must have not just one leader, not just the captain.' City captain Vincent Kompany has been struggling with a hamstring injury but is expected to play against United, albeit with discomfort. He has admitted Rooney's volley of 2011 stayed with him for some time and it's little wonder. It remains a stand-out memory of recent fixtures and Rooney now finds himself in the perfect position to contribute some more.

She was told how the youngster had to have 13 teeth taken out two years ago, when an NHS fact sheet says most children have a full set of 20 teeth. The judge said the boy's parents, who are Latvian, had accepted that their son had suffered from 'poor dental hygiene' due to a diet high in sugar, which had caused tooth decay. She explained that the child had been taken into interim foster care in the summer of 2013, a few months after having the teeth extracted. Judge Owens the ruled that the boy should remain with his foster carers and had been asked to make decisions about his long-term future by local authority social service officials. She said that a number of other concerns had also been raised about the little boy's welfare, including his parents' misuse of alcohol and exposure to domestic violence. The boy's parents were not named, not was the local authority involved. The judge said the boy's parents, who are Latvian, had accepted that their son had suffered from 'poor dental hygiene' due to a diet high in sugar, which had caused tooth decay (file picture) Figures last year by the NHS showed that nearly 500 children a week were being admitted to hospital with tooth decay. It is now the main reason for youngsters needing hospital treatment and dentists say the culprits are fruit juice and fizzy drinks. According to experts, most children need between four and eight of their baby teeth extracted.","The boy, who cannot be named, must stay in the care of the local authority .

"Derby hero Jermain Defoe was lost for words as he tried to describe the emotion of scoring his stunning winner against Newcastle admitting he even had to question that it was even happening. The Sunderland hitman smashed home a missile of a left-footed volley in Sunday's 1-0 win at the Stadium of Light to ease the Black Cats three points clear of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone and send Wearside into ecstasy. It was just the club's third home league win of the season, but a fifth successive victory over the Magpies, and January signing Defoe will have good reason to remember it long after he has finally hung up his boots. Jermain Defoe (centre) connects beautifully with a left-footed volley to fire Sunderland into a 1-0 lead . Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was unable to do anything about Defoe's 45th-minute strike . The 32-year-old said: 'It just happened so quickly, but as soon as it left my foot, I knew. It's one of those moments when you think, ""Wow! Is this even happening?"". The stadium just erupted and I got emotional, it was crazy. 'The feeling, it's hard to even find words to describe that sort of feeling. It's special. 'It's up there, to be honest - and with my weaker foot, it's definitely up there, top five easily easily. 'It's definitely up there - top two, actually. The feeling, why I got emotional, that feeling was unbelievable.' 'I remember a long ball, and Fletch was unbelievable because he played the number nine role up there on his own and me and Connor (Wickham) were just beside him. The 32-year-old watches on as the strike- his third for Sunderland - flies over Krul in the Magpies goal . The striker wheels away in celebration of his brilliant strike just before the half-time whistle was blown . 'Even from when I was young and you do finishing, I have always practised on my left foot because in games, sometimes you get chances and sometimes it comes on your left foot, so I have always practised over the years from when I was very young so I feel comfortable that when a chance comes, I can not even think about it, I can just hit it like I did. 'But to score a goal like that in a game like this, it's a dream come true.' Sunderland might have increased their lead as the game opened up with the visitors launching a desperate late attempt to salvage a point, but in the end, a single goal was enough to leave Defoe marvelling at his first experience of the Wear-Tyne rivalry. He said: The lads said, 'Just wait', but wow! Even in the warm-up, the noise, and coming down the tunnel, I had goosebumps. Defoe seemed overcome with emotion as he fell to the turf shortly after putting Sunderland into a 1-0 lead . The 32-year-old frontman looked close to tears as both teams left the Stadium of Light pitch at half-time . 'But even travelling to the stadium and seeing all the fans in the streets, seeing all the kids with their shirts on, it was just crazy.' The victory ended a seven-game wait for a three-point haul, and it could hardly have been better timed after new head coach Dick Advocaat took over the reins and left his players in no doubt about the fact that they faced nine cup finals. That process will continue next weekend when Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace head for the Stadium of Light - Pardew, of course, was Newcastle boss for the first four of those five defeats - and Defoe is hoping he and his team-mates can use their derby success as a springboard. He said: 'You win a game like this and the lads have got to enjoy it. Everyone will enjoy it, the fans. 'But at the end of the day, the season hasn't finished and we have massive games coming up. It's important that we just concentrate on the next game, be professional and win that.'","Sunderland beat Newcastle 1-0 at the Stadium of Light on Sunday .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admits he was 'surprised and shocked' by the online racist abuse targeted at the club's striker Mario Balotelli. Anti-discrimination body Kick It Out revealed on Thursday night that Italy international Balotelli had been subjected to more than 4,000 racist messages on social media this season. Balotelli's Liverpool team-mate Daniel Sturridge and Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck have also each received more than a thousand discriminatory messages according to research carried out by Tempero, a social media management agency, and analytics firm Brandwatch. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli (centre) has been the subject of thousands of racists posts on social media . The Italy international (right) performs a back-heel during a training session at Melwood on Friday . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he is 'shocked' at the level of online abuse aimed at Balotelli . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (left) has also been targeted by racists on the internet this season . Balotelli's Liverpool team-mate Daniel Sturridge (centre) is another player to be harassed online this term . Kick It Out estimates there have been 134,000 discriminatory posts this season with 39,000 of them directed towards Premier League players, and Rodgers says the issue must be addressed. 'I was aware of the findings and I was surprised and shocked,' Rodgers said. 'I think one message is one too many to be honest. We support all the relevant organisations who are working to stamp all of this out. 'In the modern world and modern football it is something which is very much there, but we need to eradicate all of it out of social life and professional sport. 'I think it is the responsibility of us all to help all the various organisations stamp it out.' Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet takes a philosophical attitude to the online abuse of footballers and believes players must learn to handle the situation. 'I think that is normal in the world we live in,' Mignolet said. 'Social media is something worldwide and you can't control it yourself really but you have to accept it. 'The spotlight is on you so you have to deal with those sort of things.' But Stoke manager Mark Hughes said he would welcome tougher sanctions against individuals who indulge in online abuse, believing they are safe behind the cloak of anonymity. 'The internet is difficult to police as we well know, but anything racist, homophobic - even just in general life - it should be rooted out and stamped on,' Hughes said. 'It is not acceptable. The fact people can hide behind their computers on the internet makes it more difficult to manage and stop. Stoke City boss Mark Hughes has called for a crackdown on racism and an end to online anonymity . 'But there needs to be a will and if there is a way of stopping this happening, then that should be encouraged.' More than 8,000 abusive messages were directed towards Balotelli, over half of which were racist. Welbeck received 1,700, of which half were racist, and Sturridge 1,600, of which 60 per cent were based on sexual orientation. The sheer volume of racist and other abuse on social media has prompted Kick It Out to form an expert group to tackle football-related hate crime across social media, working with football, the main social media platforms, organisations dealing with internet safety and the police. Kick It Out director Roisin Wood said: 'It is really shocking. We knew there was an issue but even we were shocked by how many the players have received. 'For one player to have received over 8,000 abusive messages is phenomenally awful. 'You cannot accept players getting that level of abuse so we want to bring this expert group together to see how we can address this. 'We don't see the problem going away. Some of the perpetrators are young people and they need educating that you cannot sit in your room and abuse people like this.' Balotelli scores for Liverpool from the penalty spot during a Champions League game against Besiktas . Kick It Out only started receiving complaints of social media abuse during the 2012-13 season and has since started reporting the incidents to True Vision - a national reporting facility which had been developed to deal with hate crime online. The research showed the Premier League clubs receiving the highest volume of discriminatory posts were Chelsea (20,000), Liverpool (19,000), Arsenal (12,000), Manchester United (11,000) and Manchester City (11,000). Twitter was the most common platform for abuse with 88 per cent of messages coming in the form of tweets. Kick It Out has launched several t-shirt campaigns to help combat the concerning level of racism in football .","Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has been racially abused online .

"Britain's Adam Peaty has broken the men's 100 metres breast stroke world record with a time of 57.92 seconds at the London Aquatic Centre. The 20-year-old from Uttoxeter's gold-winning time on Friday beat the previous record of 58.46 set by South African Cameron van der Burgh in the same venue at the 2012 Olympics. A tweet from British Swimming's account read: 'WORLD RECORD time for @adam-peaty he hits the wall in 57.92!!!!' British swimmer Adam Peaty is all smiles after setting a new world record for the 100m breast stroke . His time of 57.92 seconds has beaten the previous record of 58.46 set by Cameron van der Burgh in 2012 . Peaty has spoken of his delight that his hard work and training have paid off and is thrilled with the win . After becoming the first man in history to break through the 58-second barrier in the discipline, Peaty said: 'I can't believe it, coming in earlier I thought I could get a really good time, maybe a 58.5. 'Before that race I just thought I've done all the training for a 57, and it all paid off in the end. 'The crowd were great and they really carried me home at the end, because that was a hell of a pain train. There must be something in that lane four when it really matters.' Scotland's Ross Murdoch fought hard but was left trailing in Peaty's wake with a time of 59.12 - still inside the World Championship qualification standard - while James Wilby of Loughborough took bronze with a 1:00.31. Ben Proud topped the podium in the men's 50m freestyle by coming home in 21.99, with his fellow Plymouth swimmer Thomas Fannon taking silver in 22.48 from Andrew Weatheritt (22.50). In the women's competition, Fran Halsall stormed to victory in the open 50m freestyle. The 25-year-old claimed her 10th consecutive title with a time of 24.37 and said afterwards: 'It's pretty good to be able to come in 10 years in a row and be the best in Britain. 'I didn't have the ideal preparation coming into this meet, I got sent home from the World Championships in December and it took a lot longer than expected to get back into full training. 'Last year I went a 24.5 at this meet then on to a 23.9 in the summer, so to come here and already be two tenths up on that is a great sign.' Lauren Quigley of Stockport Metro hit 25.22 for silver ahead of Rebecca Guy, who clocked in at 25.49. In the morning Rachael Kelly had defended her British Championship title with a time of 57.72 in the open 100m butterfly final.

"The petite Thai woman sitting by Sir John Madejski presents herself initially as a typical grandmother. She is also co-chairman of Reading Football Club with Madejski. Lady Sasima Srivikorn is in her 70s with an endearing laugh and a royal blue scarf she has knitted especially for Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal at Wembley. Like 73-year-old Madejski, Lady Sasima is something of an eccentric. Educated at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama in the 1950s, she has been a singer and composer who wrote the theme song for the Asian Games. 'It was called Reach For The Stars,' she says proudly before talking enthusiastically about her involvement with the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra and her autobiography, A Life By Chance. Reading co-owners Lady Sasima Srivikorn and Sir John Madejski spoke to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton . The Championship club will swap the Madejski Stadium for Wembley on Saturday in the FA Cup semi-final . But then she offers a chilling insight into what it is to be one of Thailand's most powerful women, a super-rich Harvard Business School graduate who became the first female on the Thai Airways board. Madejski listens intently as the woman he credits with rescuing Reading last September talks about the night in 2014 when three men armed with M16 automatic weapons fired on her house in north-east Thailand. She believes the incident was provoked by the political activities of her daughter and son-in-law. The previous day they had instigated a peaceful public demonstration after seeing the former wife of Thaksin Shinawatra — ex-Thai prime minister and one-time owner of Manchester City — in a Bangkok shopping mall. Shinawatra was removed from power in 2006 in a military coup after allegations of corruption. Jamie Mackie celebrates after scoring Reading's third goal against Bradford to secure their victory . Reading beat Bradford 3-0 in a quarter-final reply at the Madejski to secure their Wembley semi-final . Lady Sasima says her daughter was still angry about the corruption, explaining: 'The next day I am with friends at my house. We had been playing cards until about 2am. We had just gone to bed. And I had 100 bullets from an M16 shot at my house. 'They didn't mean to kill. They just wanted to scare, to threaten, but bullets hit my bathroom. The windows in my bedroom.' Presumably she now goes everywhere under armed guard? 'No,' she says. 'There's no use having security. If someone really wants to kill me, they can kill me any time. It's funny, when I realised it was a machine gun I thought it was the moment when I was about to die but I was very calm, not frightened at all.' 'This is one hell of a wise lady — and very modest too,' says Madejski admiringly. When I first saw Lady Sasima at the hotel at the Madejski Stadium, she was seated at the head of a table having breakfast with five Thai gentlemen. One was Pairoj Piempongsant, who brokered the deal when Shinawatra bought City in 2007 and is now senior adviser to the four-strong Thai consortium that purchased Reading last year. 'In business I'm probably more comfortable with men. I find them more straight-forward,' she explains now she is in the Lady Sasima Suite that boasts a perfect view of the pitch. Reading players mob goalscorer Garath McCleary during their 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final win over Bradford . Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives the lowdown on Reading's players to watch ahead of the Arsenal match . 'The people you saw me having breakfast with are involved in politics. And you may have recognised Pairoj Piempongsant. He is a very nice man who has the knowledge and contacts we need.' As the owner of a 25 per cent stake in Reading, Lady Sasima is clearly not about to let Piempongsant run the show, however. 'I started in business when I was 25,' she says. 'My late husband's parents passed away and we had some money. We started with a school — which one of my daughters now runs — and then we had a hotel — but my biggest passion is land. I like real estate. I like to create things. It allows me to use my imagination.' She appears to be thinking along these lines with Reading. The consortium has already invested heavily in the club's academy, building 13 pitches. She says she is also in discussion with Reading Council and talks of a vision of 'a second London' along the M4 corridor. 'I love this town,' she says. For Reading FC the longer-term vision is clear. A club that has twice before been promoted to the Barclays Premier League want to return under manager Steve Clarke. 'That is the ambition,' she says and Madejski nods in agreement. Arsenal, pictured in training on Friday, will provide a tough test for Steve Clarke's Reading on Saturday . Madejski and Lady Sasima pose for a photo at the Madejski Stadium during their chat with Sportsmail . Madejski sees the Thai consortium as Reading's saviours, given the financial difficulties the club endured after selling to Anton Zingarevich. The cash the Russian was expected to invest when he bought Reading in 2012 never materialised and after a period Madejski described as the 'most stressful of my life', Lady Sasima and her colleagues stepped in. 'They have been like a breath of fresh air. I can't tell you how excited I am about the future,' he says. By his own admission Madejski needed to sell. He did a remarkable job with his hometown club, building the stadium as well as overseeing their rise to the top flight for the first time. But reports have suggested he lost the best part of £300million between 2008 and 2014 and he does not deny it. 'I'm not sure it was quite that much,' he says, 'but I lost a heck of a lot of dosh.' 'Not on football?' Lady Sasima asks, a little nervously. 'No, no,' says Madejski, with a laugh. 'An entrepreneur's life is cyclical. I'm just pleased we can now look forward in a positive way.' Reading man Hal Robson-Kanu battles with Bournemouth's Andrew Surman in the Royals' last game . Lady Sasima and Madejski are excited about Saturday and have a long-term ambition to get to the top flight . When it comes to Saturday evening's match, Reading's first FA Cup semi-final since 1927, this pair of septuagenarians — possibly the oddest couple in sport — are giddy with excitement. Lady Sasima talks of the 'honour' of playing Arsenal and the thrill of taking family, friends and business associates to Wembley. A man who has been defined by triumph over adversity, Madejski loves the fact that his team are underdogs. In 12 previous attempts they have never beaten Arsenal. Madejski talks movingly about being in foster care after his mother was ostracised by her family for a wartime fling that led to his arrival. 'Being illegitimate wasn't the most ennobling start,' he says. 'I feel sorry for my mother. She never really got over the fact of me. The pair are desperate to take their club back to the promised land of the Premier League . Reading boss Clarke has a tough test to come through on Saturday when his side face Arsenal at Wembley . 'I found out who my father was only 10 years ago. I never met him but his name was William Adshead. Quite ironic really when you think I became an ""ads head"" with the Auto Trader business. He was from Liverpool which is probably why I get on well with Cilla Black.' Now Lady Sasima is the one listening intently. 'I didn't know Sir John's story until after we bought the club,' she says, 'but he is a real gentleman. When my sons heard about me buying Reading they were all shocked. The first question they asked me was ""where is your business model?"" 'I said there isn't one. I don't think there can be in football. You just have to be passionate, dedicated and perhaps lucky. 'Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Everyone asks why? Why football? Why now? But you have this team that wins and loses. It's woken me up. Made me feel more alert.' Madejski gives her a squeeze. 'And it's fun,' he says.","Lady Sasima Srivikorn and Sir John Madejski are co-owners of Reading .

"Every woman surveyed in Paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city’s public transport. Half of them were assaulted before they were 18 years old. The poll led to calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains. The survey found that “every female user of mass transit has been a victim” of “gender harassment or sexual assault” – even though some are “unaware” of this because they have been conditioned to accept low-level abuse. Every woman surveyed in Paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city’s public transport . The poll of 600 women from the area around Paris found that half of those interviewed said they had first suffered harassment under the age of 18. Harassment can range from “insults to other intimidating behaviour (insistent flirting, whistling, comments on appearance), to sex attacks or rape,” it said. The problem meant that six out of ten women were afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men. Often “invisible” because unreported, these physical and verbal attacks limit “the freedom of women, because they are often obligated to alter their daily lives: changing their routes, modes of transportation, schedules, attitudes and clothing in order to avoid confrontation,” the report handed to the French women’s rights ministry this week, claimed. The result was to “exclude women from the public arena”, it said. Pascale Boisard, president of the high council for gender equality, which compiled the report, told Le Parisien she had not realised that “the problem was quite this widespread”. The poll led to calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains. Pictured: The Haussmann-Saint-Lazare railway station in Paris . “Women must be able to move about and occupy the public space without being placed in danger or threatened. It’s a fundamental freedom,” she said. Ernestine Ronai, also on the council, said: “Attackers are the impression they can act with total impunity, notably by making use of a crowd to hide and flee. “Women don’t necessarily know how to put words on what they go through in public transport. It should be reiterated that putting your hand on someone’s backside is sexual assault punishable by a five-year prison term and a €75,000 fine.” She said women needed to be better “educated that what they’re going through is not normal”, and that the message must reach “aggressors and witnesses”.","The poll surveyed 600 women from the area in and around Paris .

"Dion Dublin made his presenting debut on Monday morning as the former footballer co-hosted BBC television show Homes Under The Hammer. The former Aston Villa frontman joined regular hosts Martin Roberts and Lucy Alexander for the popular property renovation series as he looked to help a brother and sister-in-law put some life into a three bedroom semi-detached house in Dartford. 'Great to be here. And as you know property can be incredibly rewarding but can throw up some unexpected surprises and we've seen many of those on Home under the Hammer,' said Dublin following his introduction. Dion Dublin made his Home Under The Hammer debut as a co-host on Monday morning . The former footballer seemed to be in his element as he discusses property renovation . Homes Under the Hammer airs weekdays on BBC1 at 10am. Hosts Lucy, Martin and Dion follow house buyers from the auction room, through the troublesome process of renovating the houses they have bought. The presenters meet the buyers and make suggestions on how best to improve the property. But, ultimately, let the buyers make their own decisions. Later, they return to the property to meet the buyers and find out how improvement works have progressed. Finally a selection of local estate agents visit the property, value it and the buyers discover if they have made themselves a profit. The 45-year-old certainly seemed to know his stuff as he pointed the way around the run-down property and was brimming with ideas for first-time property developers Mike and Lucia. 'The kitchen needs an overhaul. It's all a bit 80s and needs a refurbishment. 'You could knock through the dividing wall and give yourself a kitchen diner,' expressed the retired striker as he crouched down inside the lounge. 'You could even put this wall back in to give yourself a separate lounge and you could put a table and chairs in here. I can watch the football in here and be undisturbed.' Mike and Lucia bought the Dartford property at auction for £215,000 and gave themselves a budget of just £10,000 with an original plan to replace the windows and doors. Dublin talks with first time property developers Mike and Lucia, who had purchased the semi-detached house . A before shot of the three bedroom semi-detached house in Dartford . Mike and Lucia bought the property for £215,000 and hoped to sell it on for close to £270,000 . Unfortunately the semi-detached house needed more work than originally thought as Mike revealed the pair had to spend between £25,000 and £35,000 leaving them with a total spend of £245,000. 'Oh dear,' said Dublin, before claiming the pair had made the right decision and could be set for a profit of around £25,000 if the property is re-sold for it's new estimated value of between £260,000 and £280,000. Dublin - who has a long-held interest in the property market from his football career- received plenty of plaudits from viewers via social media including high praise from IBF World Super Bantamweight champion Carl Frampton. The 45-year-old was full of ideas when it came to how the property should be renovated . Dublin received plenty of plaudits from viewers via social media including high praise from Carl Frampton . He tweeted: 'Hold the phone! @DionDublinsDube is presenting Homes Under the Hammer!!! The best show on TV just got better'.

'I have a passion for property and look forward to meeting people on the show who share that passion.' After retiring in May 2008, Dublin has gone on to forge a career in television and radio punditry as well as launching his own percussion instrument, 'The Dube'.

"With the helpless animals clutched tightly under his arms, this is the moment a suspected dog thief made off with two beloved family pets. Pekingese Marley and Mitzy had been left to play in the front garden by their owners Adele and Steven Worgan. But they were snatched when the couple weren’t looking – and neighbours believe they have caught the culprit on CCTV. Caught on camera: This is the suspected dog-napper seen on CCTV footage with what appears to be two animals under his arms . ‘We just want them back,’ said Mrs Worgan, 49. ‘It’s devastating. None of us have been able to sleep or eat since.’ Mr Worgan was inside the house in Doncaster at around midday when he heard a yelp from the garden. He rushed outside in time to see a man get into a van with Marley and Mitzy and drive off. Springing into action, the 56-year-old gave chase around midday on Saturday – but was unable to keep up as the van sped away. Now, the couple’s neighbours believe that they have captured the alleged thief on CCTV.

Marley, the younger of the pair, should be easily identifiable because he only has one eye.

"It took Louis van Gaal less than a minute of his weekly press conference to burst Manchester United's bubble and re-open some of the more troubling issues of his time in charge at Old Trafford. The Dutchman wasted no time in revealing that Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo will miss the much-anticipated clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge through injury. Four players capable of filling two key positions. 'The worst scenario,' Van Gaal called it. Wayne Rooney arrives in London ahead of the Chelsea clash while Ashley Young (right) poses with a fan .

United boss Louis van Gaal (left) and assistant Ryan Giggs (right) carry their luggage on Friday . Van Gaal puts his arm around Rooney during a training session earlier this week ahead of Saturday's game . The uplifting victory in last weekend's Manchester derby has come at a price. All of a sudden, United's chances of extending an impressive run of six straight Premier League wins by becoming the first top-flight team to win away at Chelsea this season look decidedly slimmer. Van Gaal must take on his old apprentice Jose Mourinho without either of his two first-choice holding midfielders, Carrick and Blind, and two senior centre-backs in Jones and Rojo. Blind was hurt in the Manchester derby by a challenge from City skipper Vincent Kompany. It means that captain Wayne Rooney is likely to be asked to sacrifice himself for the team once again by dropping into midfield — an issue that both player and manager must have hoped was behind them. With Robin van Persie not ready to return from injury, that in turn raises the old question about whether Radamel Falcao has the necessary match sharpness to replace Rooney and lead United's attack having not started a game since February. United striker Robin van Persie has not yet been passed fit enough to return to first-team action . There remain doubts over Radamel Falcao's ability to fill the void in United's attack against Chelsea . Luke Shaw is set to take over from Blind at left back despite fitness concerns that have plagued him since his £28million move from Southampton last summer and led to him being hooked at half-time in the FA Cup defeat by Arsenal last month, not to be seen since. And then there's the likely choice of replacement for Rojo between Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair, two young defenders who have not featured since January and February respectively. Both figured more prominently in the first half of the season when persistent injury problems and experimental formations slowed Van Gaal's progress. We were back on familiar ground on Friday, the fragility of United's squad all too apparent. Was he concerned by the lack of playing time among the players he may turn to? The United boss answered with one of his Dutch sayings. 'Yes, but that's also a truth like a cow,' he said. 'It means a rhetorical question. You know the answer already. 'There is more balance in the team because I have played the same line-up more. Luke Shaw (left) looks set to return to the United first-team, while Rooney will drop into midfield . 'I didn't have injuries anymore and now, coincidentally, we have four in two positions where we don't have any other players. That's difficult. 'It's the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Jonny Evans is suspended so we don't have many choices. 'Luke Shaw has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don't like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough. 'Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don't have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot.' With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over United, Van Gaal is experienced enough to know that even victory is unlikely to make any difference in the title race. 'It's still possible, I've said that before, but it is not logical,' he added. 'It's more when and if, and I don't believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. 'But, all right, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea's shoulders. You never know, you've seen it in previous Premier League seasons. 'They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw.' United midfielder Mata (right) gets ready to play a pass during a club training session on Friday . Van Gaal, meanwhile, will be satisfied if United hold on to third place and fulfil his primary aim of qualification for the Champions League. But he made it clear that first place is ultimately all that matters and what drives him on at the age of 63 when financial security is no longer an issue. 'We live for these titles,' he said. 'We are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. 'When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed and you have your name on it. That's why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. 'To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is why I'm still a manager because I don't have to work any more — you can count on that.'","Manchester United are missing four players in key positions ahead of the crucial Premier League game with title rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge .

"The Oyston family served to form a further wedge between themselves and Blackpool’s fans after a pensioner was forced to pay a staggering £20,000 in damages for allegations made online. Frank Knight, a lifelong supporter of the Seasiders, was ordered to make a public apology after posting a disparaging status on his Facebook page this time last year. Knight currently has 34 friends on his private account and this is the third instance in a matter of months whereby a fan of the club has settled before court proceedings with owner Owen Oyston and his son, chairman Karl. Blackpool fans vent their disgust at the Oyston family, who own the club, last week . Supporters have been protesting against the Oystons before matches and then not attending the games . Another supporter is awaiting a court date with the Oystons after making defamatory remarks online. Karl Oyston is to soon find out his fate for branding a fan a ‘retard’ before Christmas, telling him to ‘enjoy your special needs day out’ and claiming he was banned from the ground because he was a ‘p****’. Blackpool’s recent history has been entrenched in bitter disputes off the pitch, with paying customers regularly protesting at the ownership of their club. That was compounded last week when Lee Clark and his team’s relegation to League One was confirmed. Dozens pelted the Bloomfield Road reception with eggs and flares before their draw against Reading last Tuesday. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston speaks on his mobile phone during Tuesday's draw with Reading . Owner Owen Oyston watches the match huddled under a blanket in the stands . Blackpool fan Frank Knight posted an apology on a supporters' messageboard on Thursday . A group also travelled to the Oyston home near Waddington, Lancashire on Sunday to vent their fury. Members of the family stood within the grounds and watched as they protested in front of the gates. And Knight’s apology will only serve to exasperate the problem further. Posting on a fans’ messageboard, the pensioner said: ‘I now regret making these allegations, I fully accept that they are false and I wish to sincerely apologise for them and also for the harm, distress and financial losses my comments have caused both BFC and the Oystons and I wish to unreservedly withdraw them. ‘I accept that my publication of the allegations on Facebook and in a manner which is readily accessible to users constitutes a very serious libel. It has injured the reputation of the Oystons and has caused them considerable embarrassment and distress. Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Broken eggs on the floor outside Bloomfield Road . ‘It has damaged their reputation in business and it is considered to be grossly defamatory of the position of the Oystons within the Club, within the football hierarchy and within the football community in general, as well as within the local community for it to be even suggested that either or both of the Oystons were not only aware of such alleged activities but also that either or both of the Oystons actually condoned them. ‘In recognition of this, I have agreed with their suggestion that I should pay to BFC, by way of damages, costs, disbursements and interest and in full and final settlement of all matters in issue between myself and BFC and the Oystons, the sum of £20,000.00. ‘After a frank discussion with the Oystons, I acknowledge that they are both genuine fans of BFC and they and their families have only the best interests of BFC at heart. I recognise that BFC is now in a significantly healthier situation than when the Oyston family first became involved in it. I note that the combined net assets value at cost of Segesta and BFC were £32 million as at May 2014, compared with -£42,000 as at May 1987, when the Oystons took over BFC. I accept the Oyston family’s main objective is and always has been, for the financial stability and success for and of BFC.’ Blackpool and Mr Knight offered no comment when contacted by Sportsmail.","Lifelong Blackpool fan Frank Knight forced to pay £20,000 in damages .

"They've steamrolled past top-four rivals Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City in their current six-game Premier League winning streak, and Manchester United are looking to make it seventh heaven when they travel to table-toppers Chelsea on Saturday. Ahead of the blockbuster clash at Stamford Bridge, the United squad were pictured travelling down to London on Friday afternoon. Led by captain Wayne Rooney the Red Devils' contingent commuted via Stockport Railway Station to the English capital.

Radamel Falcao (left) or Robin van Persie (right) could start up front for United vs Chelsea on Saturday . United boss Louis van Gaal  faces a number of selection dilemmas ahead of their clash against the Blues . It was earlier revealed that the 29-year-old striker may have to revert to a midfield role against the Blues after Michael Carrick and Daley Blind were two of four  United players ruled out of the clash due to injury. However, Van Gaal is able to call upon the services of in-form midfielder Juan Mata who is returning to the home of his former club for the first time on Saturday. Mata, who won three trophies in two-and-a-half successful seasons at the Bridge, posted a picture via his Instagram account as the United players boarded the train on Friday afternoon. Accompanied with the caption: 'I got back to London a few times, but this one it's different... Big game, lots of memories, great day of football!... #CFC vs #MUFC' United's No 8 was all smiles as he gears up for what promises to be emotional return to west London. Alongside the injuries of Carrick and Blind, United duo Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo were also absent from the train ride - with the quartet all suffering injuries following United's 4-2 win over bitter rivals Manchester City on April 12. The club's injury setback means that Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao could both be recalled against Jose Mourinho’s side. And the latter was all smiles alongside Victor Valdes as they travelled down to London on Friday. Falcao is one of several selection dilemmas that Van Gaal and assistant boss Ryan Giggs have to make for the trip against Chelsea; in what the Dutchman described  as ‘the worst scenario’. Michael Carrick (left) limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo picked up an injury soon after . Van Gaal also revealed in his pre-match press conference that Daley Blind (left) and Phil Jones are out .

Van Gaal (left) has revealed that Rooney may play in holding midfield role against Chelsea . 4-1-4-1: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Blackett, Shaw; Rooney; Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Young; Falcao . ‘I have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that’s not so good for us,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it’s not like that. Carrick is out and Rojo is out, but also Blind and Jones,' the 63-year-old said at United's pre-match press conference on Friday. ‘That’s the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Evans is suspended so we don’t have many choices. Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don’t have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow. ‘Other players can take profit of the momentum now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team. ‘You have seen that I took Jones off pitch (against Manchester City) because of injury, you have seen that Carrick was off the pitch, you have seen the tackle of Kompany against Blind. Only Rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match. ‘It’s because of the distance between the matches. Blind and Jones were very close to playing but it was not enough. ‘Other players can take profit of the moment now. It’s always like that.

Fellaini (centre right) is embraced by his team-mates after scoring against rivals Manchester City last week . Sports analysts BSports predict that a Chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at Stamford Bridge . Asked if Shaw could return for the first time since being substituted in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal last month amid concerns over his fitness, Van Gaal replied: ‘Maybe you shall see tomorrow [Saturday]. You never know. Luke is fit enough I think. He has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don’t like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough.’ With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over third-placed United, Van Gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title. He also claimed that Mourinho will be happy with a draw. ‘It’s still possible, I’ve said that before,’ he added. ‘It is not logical but it is possible. It’s more when and if, and I don’t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. ‘But, alright, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea’s shoulders. You never know, you’ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons. So I cannot say it is not possible, but it is not logical. ‘They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw. Of course they will want to beat Manchester United and we want to beat them, the question is how long players can play in the discipline. Robin van Persie (back right) has only been training with United for a week but may return to feature . ‘We live for these titles, we are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it. That’s why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. ‘To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is also a goal of mine. That is why I’m still a manager because I don’t have to work anymore – you can count on that. I like to work with young people and help them in their career.’ Van Gaal gave a young Mourinho his break in coaching at Barcelona. Asked to compare the Portuguese with his current assistant Ryan Giggs, the United boss admitted that he has been surprised by the Old Trafford legend’s work ethic. He said: ‘It’s always difficult. People compare with each other because Jose Mourinho was not the world-class player that Ryan Giggs was. So that’s the same thing with me. I was not as world-class as, for example, Johann Cruyff yet our ambition is maybe then higher. ‘But I have to admit that I could not imagine when I spoke with him (Giggs) in May or June to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it, that he works very hard. As an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker, and he reads the game very well like Jose. But to manage a group you have to work, and what I can see is that he’s learning quickly.’ Chris Smalling celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at Old Trafford .","Manchester United travel to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday .

"Luke Shaw thought he had done OK as he walked off the Old Trafford pitch at half-time during Manchester United’s FA Cup tie against Arsenal last month. Steady, nothing special, but he felt invigorated all the same. The score was 1-1 and Shaw, returning to the team for the first time since United’s defeat at Swansea City in February, had kept Arsenal flyer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain reasonably quiet. Shaw was growing into that famous red shirt, getting stronger down the left flank as this fiery sixth-round tie against Arsene Wenger’s team wore on. Luke Shaw thought he had done OK against Arsenal in the FA Cup but he was substituted at half time . Louis van Gaal substituted the £28million defender, telling Shaw that he was not fit enough to play for United . Shaw has not played since and was withdrawn from the recent England squad as he struggles at United . Shaw's stats for the season show how he has struggled to hold down a regular place at left back with United . What happened next will ultimately shape his career as a United player. Louis van Gaal substituted the £28million defender, telling Shaw that he was not fit enough to play for United, and replaced him with Phil Jones for the second half. Arsenal went on to win 2-1 and getting dragged off at half-time was another blow to Shaw’s fragile self-esteem. He has not played since, withdrawn by Van Gaal from the England squad for games against Lithuania and Italy because of question marks over his fitness. His position at United has been taken by Daley Blind, shuffled across from the centre of midfield as United went on a winning run against Tottenham, Aston Villa, Liverpool and Manchester City. Shaw is struggling to come to terms with his new life, turning to United’s psychologist to declutter his mind and reboot just nine months into his career at Old Trafford. Shaw is struggling to come to terms with his new life and has turned to United's psychologist of late . Shaw had kept  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain reasonably quiet in the FA Cup clash but Van Gaal was unimpressed . There are serious concerns, particularly because his parents have spoken to the club about a lack of structure and support for their teenage son. They have every right to do so. Cash is king in football and we sometimes forget to look beyond the £28m fee United paid Southampton (£15m up front) and a five-year contract worth an eye-watering £90,000 a week. Shaw was 19 in July, returning from England’s disastrous World Cup in Brazil, where he started the final group game against Costa Rica, to meet up with his new United team-mates. Initially he lived in the Lowry Hotel, joined by his parents as he began a period of adaptation in a new city. He has since moved into a house in the suburbs. Earlier this week he hinted at some of the difficulties he has faced, awarding himself a C minus for his first season during an interview with Match of the Day magazine. At United, Shaw has found a manager in Van Gaal who has very specific and exacting demands of his players . Van Gaal has led United up the table and they crowned the recent good form with a win over Manchester City . He was assigned a dietitian and given nutritional advice as he adjusted to life as the most expensive teenage footballer in the history of the game. At Southampton he had been ordered to eschew the glasses of cola and sticky food, told to mature into his physique as he grew into a man’s body. He needs discipline and constant, caring reminders from the coaches. Those close to him explain that Shaw needs pastoral advice, that he responds positively when he feels close to the coaches and playing staff. At the age of 16, when Chelsea made an official offer for Shaw in his breakthrough season at Saints, his head was so scrambled by the prospect of joining his boyhood team that he had to be taken out of the Southampton line-up. In the dog-eat-dog world of United, where it is a constant fight for survival after last season’s disappointing finish, he has yet to establish those strong bonds. Last season he often spent time in Mauricio Pochettino’s office after training, sitting with the former Southampton manager as they discussed different areas of their lives. Mauricio Pochettino spent a lot of time with Shaw to help make him feel at home at Southampton last season . Pochettino teased the best out of a player who went on to make his England debut at the age of 18 . The club worked out that he was travelling back to his parents’ home near Cobham, Surrey, by monitoring his Twitter account and looking at the times he posted messages on social media. With Pochettino there was a real, almost paternal warmth to their relationship as the manager teased the best out of a player who went on to make his England debut at the age of 18. To put Shaw’s extraordinary rise into perspective, Kenny Sansom, perhaps England’s classiest and finest left back, had to wait until he was 20 to make his debut for the national team. Shaw’s life has changed, moving away from the bosom of his family in Surrey for the demands and challenges at a club where the spotlight is intense. He is a sensitive young man. It had been hoped that Van Gaal would show some patience with Shaw when his appointment at United was confirmed, particularly after his Champions League success at Ajax in 1995. Marc Overmars (22), Michael Reiziger (22) and Clarence Seedorf (19) all started the 1-0 victory over Milan in the final in Vienna, with striker Patrick Kluivert (18) named on the bench. Van Gaal's Champions League success at Ajax in 1995 saw him include young players in his starting XI . At the 2014 World Cup with Holland, Van Gaal had notable success with 20-year-old Memphis Depay . More recently, at the 2014 World Cup with Holland, Van Gaal had notable success with 20-year-old Memphis Depay, who was named on the three-man shortlist for the best young player at the tournament. But what Shaw found at United was a manager who has very specific and exacting demands. Before Van Gaal conceded defeat and reverted to a back four, Shaw had been playing in the unfamiliar role of wing back. The transition has many similar characteristics to Gareth Bale’s first couple of seasons with Spurs. Both are real home boys. Shaw's position at United has been taken by Daley Blind, shuffled across from the centre of midfield . The former Southampton man is learning to deal with the attention at one of the biggest football clubs around . Shaw longs for the days when he could stay behind after training with Pochettino, where the Argentinian coach would team up with one of the other young players for a light-hearted game of head tennis. It was at Southampton, under the guidance of Pochettino and the former executive chairman Nicola Cortese, where Shaw’s career flourished. The well-being of the boy was top priority. He is a United player now, learning to deal with the attention at one of the biggest football clubs in the world. At such a young age, he needs all the help he can get.","Manchester United paid almost £30million to sign Luke Shaw last summer .

"John Carver has insisted he is enjoying the task of trying to turn Newcastle's season around despite all appearances. The 50-year-old has suffered a torrid time since replacing Alan Pardew as head coach at St James' Park until at least the end of the season. Pardew's former assistant has managed just two wins in 14 games in all competitions to date and has seen his side lose their last five Barclays Premier League fixtures, a run which has allowed the chasing pack to close and threaten to drag the club into a shock relegation fight. John Carver says that he's enjoying his role at Newcastle and believes he's getting the best out of the players . That, coupled with fury over owner Mike Ashley's recruitment policy, has sparked calls for a mass boycott of Sunday's home clash with Tottenham, but Carver remains upbeat. He said with a smile: 'I'm enjoying it - you might think it's strange to say that. 'The hardest thing is to pick yourself up after a defeat because you take it personally. But we are professionals and have to get on with it. I'm quite a positive guy inside my head and I know I can do the job. I just need the tools. 'We've had setbacks, but you have got to deal with setbacks. It would be interesting to see if any manger or head coach had had this sort of situation in their career. It has been difficult, the facts are there. Newcastle have won just two games under Carver and fans are desperate for him not to be named manager . 'But I'm not a moaner and not making excuses. It's a test of management how you deal with it. I think I'm getting the best out of the group of players we have.' Carver's final comment may cause more than a few raised eyebrows with Manchester United, Everton, Arsenal, Sunderland and Liverpool each having emerged from their recent meetings with Newcastle having banked three points. Injuries and ill-discipline - Papiss Cisse and Moussa Sissoko are currently serving bans while skipper Fabricio Coloccini is available at the weekend after having to sit out the last three games - have severely depleted a team which has been marooned on 35 points since the victory over Aston Villa on February 28. Carver said: 'You can't afford to ease off in the Premier League. This is a difficult league and it's difficult to win matches. You can win five in a row, lose five in a row - and we have to stop that.'

"Newport County have sacked Chris Zebroski after the striker was jailed for four years and four months for robbery, attempted robbery and assault. The 28-year-old played for the League Two side as recently as Tuesday but now faces an uncertain future in football after admitting four charges relating to two incidents at Swindon Crown Court.

"A hat-trick of tries from teenage winger Ash Handley helped Leeds to a handsome 41-16 win over reigning champions St Helens that takes them six points clear at the top of Super League. The 19-year-old Handley got his big chance due to an injury to England winger Tom Briscoe and how he has seized it, with six tries in just six Super League appearances. The Rhinos simply oozed confidence on the back of their five-match winning run while Saints looked fragile as the one-time leaders crashed to a fourth defeat in their last five matches. Leeds veteran Danny McGuire crossed for one of his side's seven tries against St Helens on Friday night .

Handley's first try came against the run of play as he plucked out of the air Josh Jones' pass intended for debutant winger Matty Fleming of the air and sprinted 90 metres to the other end of the pitch. Handling errors by Mark Flanagan and Adam Swift ensured Saints remained on the back foot and they fell further behind on 15 minutes when hugely-impressive prop Adam Cuthbertson kept the ball alive on the last tackle and centre Joel Moon produced a delightful one-handed pass out of the back of his hands to get Handley over again. Stand-off Liam Sutclife, preferred to skipper Kevin Sinfield in Leeds' starting team, justified his selection with a superb break to create a try for full-back Zak Hardaker and his third conversion made it 18-0 in as many minutes. It got even better for the visitors when makeshift centre Carl Ablett split open the Saints defence to get veteran half-back Danny McGuire sprinting over from halfway for a fourth try and this time Sinfield, starting as a substitute for the first time for nearly 12 years, added the goal. Inspired by the never-say-die efforts of England hooker James Roby, St Helens produced their best spell of the match and pulled a try back in fortuitous circumstances when full-back Tom Makinson touched down Jon Wilkin's kick when for all it looked like a knock-on and Travis Burns added the goal. That score suddenly brought the game to life but the Rhinos struck a devastating blow to the champions deep into first-half stoppage time when a break out of defence by Kallum Watkins created the position for Sutcliffe to gift-wrap a third try for Handley courtesy of a pin-point kick to the corner. At 28-6, it looked a hopeless task for the home side but the belated introduction of Australian scrum-half Luke Walsh added a new dimension to their attack and, within four minutes of the restart, he produced a jinking run through the heart of the Leeds defence to create a try for Jordan Turner. The champions were fired up by the score and props Alex Walmsley and Mose Masoe were both held up over the line as they sought to further close the gap. The pressure finally paid off on the hour when Walsh's high kick bounced kindly for Turner to score his second try and Burns' second conversion cut the gap to 12 points. But the comeback was snuffed on 66 minutes when another Cuthbertson offload caused havoc in the Saints defence and Sinfield sent Sutcliffe on a jinking run to the line for the match-winning try. Siinfield put over a drop goal and wrapped up the scoring by converting Moon's last-minute try.","Ash Handley has now scored six tries in six appearances for Leeds .
The Rhinos are now six points clear at the top of Super League .

"Mesut Ozil is playing the best football since he joined Arsenal in the summer of 2013, after leading the Gunners to second in the Premier League table. Ozil was off the pace at the beginning of this season, but says he is now back to his best since returning to fitness in January. And the German star says his injury has actually helped him, claiming that it 'worked in my favour' after a busy schedule. Mesut Ozil trains ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi final against Reading on Saturday . The German star says he is now playing his best football since joining the Gunners in the summer of 2013 . Ozil said 10 years of playing football had taken their toll, but he has come to terms with the Premier League . Mesut Ozil is interviewed in this week's Sport . 'At the moment I am pleased with the consistency of my game,' Ozil told Sport magazine. 'I feel I am now playing my best football since joining Arsenal.' The playmaker was a big part of Germany's World Cup win over the summer, playing every game as Joachim Low's side lifted the trophy in Brazil, and the process took a lot out of him. 'I was exhausted at the start of the season,' he confesses. 'I started playing professional football at the age of 16 and had never really suffered many serious injuries. ' I guess 10 years of consistently playing football took its toll. I was also struggling with the physicality of this league.' However, Ozil has bounced back in the second half of this season, his excellent form coinciding with a winning run that has seen the Gunners climb the table. And the 26-year-old midfielder has attributed his success, in part, to the injury that kept him out for three months this winter. Ozil celebrates scoring a goal in the convincing win against Liverpool, when he was in excellent form . Ozil has put his improved performances down to the strength training he went through after being injured . 'The injury worked in my favour in a way, as it gave me time to recover, to assess and to work on what was required to compete in this league,' he added. 'The football here is far more physical, it is played at a faster tempo and you have to adapt to the sheer number of games. 'I have had to work a lot harder and adjust my game accordingly. I used my time out with injury to work on my strength. I'm continuing to do extra sessions after training now.'

"SeaWorld has released an almost five-year-old video that shows an ex-trainer repeatedly using the N-word - following the trainer's release of a book criticizing the company's treatment of animals. The recorded cell phone conversation, which the company released to reporters, shows John Hargrove using the N-word seven times while talking on the phone with a female friend. In the five-minute video, Hargrove discusses an incident in which  five black men allegedly threw a rock at the woman speaking on the other line that she said hit the back of her head. Hargrove, who also featured prominently in the CNN documentary Blackfish, says SeaWorld is mounting a smear campaign against him in an attempt to distract from his message. Scroll down for video . SeaWorld has released an almost five-year-old video depicting ex-trainer John Hargrove repeatedly using the N-word, just days after his book criticizing the company's treatment of animals launched . The recorded cell phone conversation, which the company released to reporters, shows Hargrove using the N-word seven times while talking on the phone with a female friend . 'You know you were mad, cause you whipped around and you said that, you did, ""What are you n****rs doing throwing them rocks?""', he can be heard saying, a glass of wine in front of him. 'Didn't you think it was risky to say that to those five n****rs?', he asks the girl, who denies during the conversation that she spoke those words. 'How much did you drink tonight, my god,' she then says. Three bottles of wine can be seen on the table during the video. During the video Hargrove, who was a trainer at SeaWorld for 14 years, tells his friend 'I've been drinking so much,' as he and the person behind the camera continue to laugh hysterically at their friend on the phone. SeaWorld spokesman Fred Jacobs said the company was given the video by an 'internal whistle-blower' last weekend and that his employment would have been terminated 'immediately' if they had known 'he engaged in this kind of behavior.' 'We are offended by John's behavior and language. The video is particularly reprehensible since John Hargrove is wearing a SeaWorld shirt,' Jacobs said in an email. Hargrove was a trainer at SeaWorld for 14 years and spoke out against the company in the highly critical documentary Blackfish . SeaWorld has also publicly claimed that Hargrove quit the company after he was disciplined for a 'severe safety violation involving the park's killer whales'. Hargrove spoke out against SeaWorld in the highly critical documentary Blackfish, which has left the company reeling with declining revenue and attendance. And last week he released a book detailing his long career with the once-popular park, titled Beneath The Surface. Hargrove quickly struck back after the video was released, saying SeaWorld was digging up dirt to make him 'look like this awful person'. 'What's so amazing, they're not addressing the issues at hand,' he told the Orlando Sentinel. 'This is about killer whales in captivity.' Hargrove told U-T San Diego that he had never seen the video and did not remember the incident. He also said he had been with another SeaWorld employee that night and 'had a lot to drink'. 'These are all just personal attacks to try to slander me and my character,' he said. 'These are petty, childish attempts to discredit somebody.' The NAACP issued a statement following the video's release and said Hargrove's repeated use of the N-word 'calls into question his judgement and his credibility'. 'It is difficult to accept his authority on animal welfare issues if he does not treat fellow humans with dignity and respect,' it states. The video's release also caused one San Diego bookstore to cancel Hargrove's book signing after the store received an email from SeaWorld with a link to the clip. None of Hargrove's other scheduled appearances have been canceled. Hargrove is currently on tour promoting Beneath The Surface, which recounts the 'devastating effects of captivity' he said he saw while working with killer whales as he became higher-ranked within the company, the ex-trainer told NPR. Hargrove struck back after the video was released, and said SeaWorld was trying to make him 'look like this awful person'. He also said he had 'a lot to drink' when the video was recorded and did not recall the incident . In the book, Hargrove said he was especially affected after seeing SeaWorld separate 19 mother killer whales from their calves, which he claims is done through trickery. He also claims he saw trainers hold back food from the whales. Hargrove  also fought back at SeaWorld's claim that he violated the company's safety rules. He said he was disciplined because he waited a day to inform his supervisors that another employee had improperly locked a gate at Shamu Stadium, even though he had immediately pointed out the mistake. Hargrove said he was 'punished' and was temporarily moved to the sea-lion stadium, but he then immediately went on medical leave for knee injuries before quitting the company entirely. SeaWorld's fight against Hargrove comes just a week after the company launched a new advertising campaign in attempts to fight the backlash it has received since the premiere of Blackfish. The company claimed the advertisement's close timing with the release of Hargrove's book was unrelated. The campaign focuses on the park's efforts of caring for animals in captivity and in the wild, while 'setting the record straight on false accusations by activists who oppose whales and other animals in zoological settings', the company stated. Print advertisements will appear in the likes of The New York Times, The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. Last week SeaWorld also launched its 'Meet the Animals' YouTube campaign, which introduces individual animals in the company's various parks.","Video shows John Hargrove, who appeared in Blackfish, using the N-word seven times as he talks to a friend on the phone .

"The former chairman of Bradford City was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze that killed 56, a new book has claimed. Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating fire was not an accident and has revealed a sequence of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time. After an inquiry, high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell said the fire was not started deliberately and was caused by a discarded cigarette. West Yorkshire police today said in a statement that they would review any fresh evidence surrounding the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Then-Bradford chairman Heginbotham (left) was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze, it has been claimed . Fletcher, a survivor of the blaze, spent 15 years researching the disaster in which his brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were all killed. He was 12 at the time and after painstaking investigation of public documents has published his findings in his book: 'Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire', serialised in The Guardian. The fire broke out near half-time of Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985, and was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. Within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. The fire was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand .

Devastating: The deadly fire broke out near half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985 . A police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the burning stand . His research includes claims that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to other fires at business premises over a period of the previous 18 years, which resulted in large insurance claims. The book, published on Thursday, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was noticed at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' wrote Mr Fletcher. 'From standing around with a bunch of kids and onlookers on a Sunday afternoon in May 1967, as his former foam-cushion business went up in flames, to standing on the pitch at Valley Parade 18 years later, making noises about smoke bombs while 56 people perished behind him.'

The release of the book coincides with the 30th anniversary of the disaster, with English football set for a minute's silence ahead of all games on April 25, which will be Bradford's closest home fixture to the date and is bound to cause much consternation in the West Yorkshire city. 1: May 1967: fire in Stafford Heginbotham's factory at Cutler Heights Lane . 2: April 1968: fire at Genefoam Ltd, managing director is Heginbotham . 3: August 1970: store-room explosion at Matgoods, founded by Heginbotham . 4: Dec 1971: tenant fire at Castle Mills, Cleckheaton, owned by Heginbotham . 5: August 1977: fire at Yorkshire Knitting Mills, in Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills building . 6: Dec 1977: fire at Coronet Marketing factory. Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . No-one sought accountability for the fire once the official Popplewell Inquiry had recorded its findings following a series of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. But Mr Fletcher started to investigate nine years after the disaster, scouring back-copies of the local paper, The Telegraph and Argus for information. Sir Olive Popplewell told Sky News today that he was not aware of the previous links to fires in 1985. He said they were a 'remarkable coincidence' but that it did not alter his ruling that the tragedy was an 'accident exacerbated by negligence'. He added: 'If we had been aware of these fires at the time of course they would have demanded further investigation, but I am not sure what they would have revealed.' Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said today that the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry in to the disaster. Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident.

The remains of the stand at Bradford's ground after the disaster on Saturday May 11, 1985 at Valley Parade . His many businesses included toy company Tebro Toys. He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around £30,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. Mr Sutcliffe told Press Association Sport: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. Mr Fletcher started to investigate after a conversation with his mother nine years after the disaster, when she told him it had not been Heginbotham's first fire . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Heginbotham's son, James, 47, told the Daily Mirror today: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. It was a shock hearing this today, it was such a long time ago. 'He's no longer here to defend himself. It's a real shame it has come to this. 'He devoted his entire life to that club. He saved the club on two separate occasions. 'I have never seen anybody more passionate about anything than he was about that club.' According to the Independent, it would be up to Home Secretary Theresa May to order a new inquiry but this would not be unlikely to happen before the election next month.","Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating blaze was not an accident .

"Authorities have said an underground electrical fire is blamed for a explosion that sent a manhole cover flying more than 200 feet above a Buffalo street in a blast that was captured by a television news photographer. The fire began around 11:30 a.m. Sunday on Tupper Street in downtown Buffalo, WGRZ reported. Police evacuated two buildings as smoke came out of manholes, according to the television station.

Decided: The jury that voted Wednesday to send former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez to prison for life sat down for a group interview on Thursday with CNN's Anderson Cooper . Guilty: Hernandez was found guilty Wednesday of murdering Odin Lloyd in 2013. Pictured in court on Wednesday on the left, when the verdict was read. On the right, seen in a Patriots uniform before his arrest . When asked if they knew who Hernandez was before the trial started, most raised their hands. However, they maintained that Hernandez's notoriety didn't have an impact on their decision. 'It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you make. We're all people, and we're all equal, and we all deserve the same fair trial, and that's what we wanted to make sure we gave him,' juror Jon Carlson said. Only one juror, Rosalie Oliver, didn't know of the tight end who had a $40million contract with the local NFL team. On the other side of the spectrum is juror Kelly Dorsey - a lifelong Patriots fan, who watches the team every Sunday during football season. While most of the group said that they had no interaction with Hernandez during the trial, Dorsey says she locked eyes with him on Wednesday as the verdict was being read. Familiar: When asked if they knew Hernandez before the trial, most of the jury raised their hands . Gripping moment: Jury member Kelly Dorsey says she locked eyes with Hernandez as the verdict was being read on Wednesday . 'He was shaking his head and he mouthed something - and I didn't know what he mouthed - but he was shaking his head just staring and I thought 'You need to look back at the judge. Just look back at the judge.""'' Dorsey recalled. Sentencing Hernandez was no easy decision to come to for the jury who heard from 130 witnesses and reviewed 400 pieces of evidence since the trial started at the end of January. The group deliberated for 35 hours over the course of a week, and decided that certain aspects of victim Odin Lloyd's killing warranted a life in prison without the possibility of parole sentence - the highest sentence possible in the state of Massachusetts where the death penalty is outlawed. Many of the jurors pointed to the fact that Lloyd had been shot six times as evidence of the callousness of the crime. At the time of his death, Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianceé. 'You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There's no need for that and there's no need to use a gun. Period,' jury foreman Lesa Strachan said. Other jurors were shocked by Hernandez's casual behavior, sunbathing with friends just a few hours after Lloyd is suspected to have been murdered. Directly after court on Wednesday, Hernandez was taken to a prison just two miles from Gillette Stadium, where he traded his  $1.3million mansion for a small cell and a pair of gray scrubs. The jurors will now be allowed to return to their day jobs, but they say the time they spent on the jury will stay with them forever. Oliver and other jurors say friends have been calling them up to congratulate them after the verdict - something that has left them speechless. 'Who won? Odin Lloyd didn't win. (His mother) didn't bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he's 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that's never going to see her father again?' Oliver said.","The Aaron Hernandez jury and alternate jurors sat down as a group with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday .

"Europe’s oldest lar gibbon is enjoying celebrity status after a video of it strutting through a wildlife park went viral. Brian the lar gibbon, who is 50-years-old, was videoed by Amanda Dorman from South Lanarkshire, Scotland, who captured the critter’s creepy walk on a visit to the Lake District Wildlife Park near Keswick. The seven-second video, which is accompanied by Ms Dorman giggling throughout, shows the lar gibbon sneaking across in its enclosure while looking back and forth at the filmmaker. It was then shared over 130,000 times before The Lad Bible page picked it up and added the caption: ‘Running across the landing naked when you forget your towel.’ This resulted in the video being viewed over nine million times. Richard Robinson, Park Manager at the Lake District Wildlife Park spoke about the video on the park’s website, he said: ‘Brian is the oldest lar gibbon in Europe, and is very fortunate to be here. The hilarious video was captured by a visitor to Lake District Wildlife Park and shows the 50-year-old primate sneaking across a feild . ‘His records begin in 1965 at Chester Zoo and he joined us in 2000. Brian, his lifetime partner Sooty and their youngsters have been entertaining our guests for years. ‘They love swinging through the trees, walking round, grooming and sunbathing. There are hundreds of pictures and videos of the whole family, but none have caught the imagination like this video. ‘The caption just goes to highlight how we interpret their actions as being very human like – it’s this that makes them so endearing.’ The video has been compared to running across the landing naked when you forget your towel . Ms Dorman wrote on Facebook: ‘I’m glad Brian has done so well with my video. Hopefully loads of people go to visit him.’ The lar gibbon also known as the white-handed gibbon, is a primate in the gibbon family. They are strictly monogamous mammals and form strong family ties, as demonstrated by Brian, who has fathered a number of young – three of which still live at the park – with Sooty.","Brian the lar gibbon was captured strutting at the Lake District Wildlife Park .

"Grandparents have pleaded for the safe return to Australia of two young children whose mother took them from Melbourne to the Islamic State capital in Syria. Former Melbourne woman Dullel Kassab fled to Raqqa in Syria with her children last year, and she regularly boasts on Twitter that her four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son sleep with toy guns next to their beds and her daughter likes watching IS videos of 'Muslims killing bad ppl.' The children's paternal grandparents say they are worried Kassab, 28, is 'brainwashing' the children, after their father was killed near the Syria-Turkey border last year, The Herald Sun reported. Former Melbourne woman Dullel Kassab fled to Raqqa in Syria from Melbourne with her children last year . Kassab posts pictures to Twitter of airstrikes hitting blocks away from their Raqqa apartment . 'We miss the children a lot. Their safety and religion has been compromised and we are deeply worried but unable to do anything about it,' a family spokesman told the Herald Sun. 'We pray they come back but it does not look good.' Kassab's Twitter paints a picture of their life in the city the terrorist group IS have made their headquarters, where the children cannot go to school and airstrikes hit blocks away from their apartment. The 28-year-old has a new husband, as the Islamic State does not permit unmarried foreign women to stay in Raqqa. In social media posts she boasts about her children's distaste for Kuffar (non-believers).

"An ancient statue of the wife of China's first ruler is damaged - after tourists kept rubbing the woman's exposed breast. Officials have complained the bronze sculpture of Yu The Great's wife has been worn down and discolored by sightseers constantly fondling the artwork, reports The People's Daily. The statue, which stands in a gardens in Wuhan, the capital city of central China’s Hubei Province, is to honour Yu The Great, who founded China's first dynasty in 2070 BC. Officials in Wuhan, the capital city of central China’s Hubei Province, have accused tourists of damaging a statue of the country's first leader and his wife by fondling the woman's exposed breast . The sculpture, which has been in place for ten years, depicts Yu The Great, the founder of China's first Xia Dynasty in 2070 BC, meeting his wife . Legend says that Yu and his wife were brought together by a nine-tailed fox that lead them to one another . The bronze tells the story of how the leader met his wife, after the couple were supposedly brought together by a mythical nine-tailed fox. Over the decade that the statue has been in place, people have been touching the hand of Yu The Great, the fox's back, and wife's chest. While the rest of the statue is black, the colour of the coating applied to protect the metal, the parts that have been touched have worn away to expose the metal underneath. Over the years tourists have kept touching Yu's hand, the fox's back, and his wife's exposed breast - leading to them becoming worn . While the rest of the metallic sculpture is black, the colour of the protective layer which coats the statue, the fox, hand and breast have become worn, exposing the metal underneath . Locals accuse tourists of having a lack of respect for culture, but admit the behaviour is unlikey to change . Yu the Great is thought to have lived between 2,200–2,100 BCE, and is credited with uniting the nine early provinces of China. While little is known about his rule, as his predates the earliest written records by nearly a millennium, he is credited with building an immense system of flood defences in central China. These helped to bring prosperity and stability to the volatile region, and so impressed another emperor that he named Yu as his heir, rather than his own son.","Statue in Wuhan, central China, depicts country's first ruler and his wife .

"Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill has confirmed she will return to competition in London this July following her break from athletics to become a mother. Ennis-Hill provided one of London 2012's most captivating storylines by surging to heptathlon gold, and the Sheffield-born star will return to the Olympic Stadium three years on to compete in the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games. The 29-year-old has not competed since the same event in 2013 and gave birth to her son, Reggie, last summer. But her return to action sets up the prospect of a showdown against Katarina Johnson-Thompson, the brilliant young British heptathlete who is the heir to Ennis-Hill's throne. Jessica Ennis-Hill became a national hero when she won heptathlon gold at the London 2012 Olympics . Ennis-Hill has not competed since 2013 as she took time off to become a mother . 'I am really looking forward to it,' said Ennis-Hill, who could compete in the long jump or 110m hurdles. 'My race schedule is starting to starting to take shape and it will be good to compete and get a sense of where I am in my return to competing. 'My main goal this season is to be as competitive as possible with the long-term goal being the Rio Olympics. 'Diamond League meetings always have the best athletes in the world so I’m sure this will be a good test for me; I want to perform well being back on the big stage in London but I will be realistic as 2015 is about the challenge of getting back to competitive shape after having my little boy and ultimately making the necessary progression to be at my best for Rio.' Katarina Johnson-Thompson has emerged as the new rising star of British athletics and Ennis-Hill's heir . Another British hero of London 2012, Mo Farah, will also compete in the Diamond League event, which serves as a warm-up for the World Championships in Beijing in August. Ennis-Hill will take part in the two-day meeting on July 24 and 25, with the Sainsbury's IPC Athletics Grand Prix Final taking place on July 26. Ennis-Hill added: 'The 2012 Olympics were an incredible experience for me and it will be very special to step out on that track again. It will be amazing to compete in front of all our British fans who I am sure will have their own memories of the London Games too.'","Jessica Ennis-Hill will compete at the Anniversary Games in July .

"Aaron Ramsey has scored 25 goals for Arsenal since the start of last season, none more vital than a dramatic extra-time winner in the FA Cup final. But his last one — the only goal of the game at Burnley — meant the world, because it was for someone special. ‘I’ve had a tough few weeks,’ said Ramsey, who pointed skywards after scoring at Turf Moor. ‘I’ve been on an emotional rollercoaster of late. My gran passed away a few weeks ago and she meant an awful lot to me. We had a great relationship and I’ve dedicated my last couple of goals to her. Aaron Ramsey celebrates his goal against Burnley by dedicating it to his late Gran who passed away . ‘Her name is Eileen. She’s on my Mum’s side and we used to call her Nanny Leany. She was 84. She was an incredible woman. ‘She lost her husband early in her life and raised seven kids on her own and in those days it was an incredibly difficult thing to do. She was always happy, making jokes and I had that sort of outlook on life. She always believed in me and gave me reassurances. It has been a difficult time.’ His grandmother would have been proud of young Aaron as he took time out from preparations for today’s FA Cup semi-final against Reading to pay his tribute to her. Just as she must have been proud of his career in football and the way he rebuilt it after a badly broken leg. ‘She used to watch me play and would take me to games when I was eight or nine,’ Ramsey added. ‘She would always be asking how I was doing. She didn’t go to my games but I got her Sky to watch a few. She would always complain it was not on normal TV.’ Ramsey will be on ‘normal TV’ when the BBC screen today’s semi-final from Wembley, as he was last May when his 16th goal of a prolific season won the FA Cup and ended Arsenal’s nine-year wait for a trophy. ‘It was a great day and a great moment in my career,’ he said. ‘It was a relief as well.’ Ramsey points to the sky has the goalscorer is greeted by Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin at Turf Moor . Ramsey and Bellerin celebrate on the deck after the Welsh midfielder had fired home for the Gunners . Arsenal had fought back from two down against Hull and 108 minutes had elapsed when Ramsey fired his side into a 3-2 lead before going off on a celebratory sprint which he ended flat on his back, exhausted, beneath a pile of jubilant team-mates. ‘I was knackered,’ smiled Ramsey. ‘We were in extra-time and my celebration, I didn’t really know what to do. I was just running about and it all caught up on me then so I needed a couple of seconds just to get my breath back and realise just what I’d just actually done. It was definitely overwhelming. And it was a great way to finish the season for me personally and for the team finally to win something. It was an amazing feeling. Ramsey wheels away in celebration after scoring in extra time at Wembley against Hull City . Ramsey is joined by Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta during the FA Cup Final at Wembley in 2014 . The Welsh goalscorer is mobbed by his friends as they celebrate his goal at Wembley in 2014 . ‘I’m no different to anyone else. My dream was always scoring a goal in the FA Cup final and I had managed to live my dream. Then to see how much it meant to people when a quarter of a million came out on the streets the next day. It was a beautiful day and you could see everyone was in it together.’ Ramsey had played in the 2008 FA Cup final for Cardiff aged 17, but his winners’ medal now takes pride of place in a display cabinet in the study at his home. ‘I’ve a few shirts in there, my debut shirt at Cardiff, the FA Cup winners’ shirt, some boots to mark my achievements,’ said Ramsey. ‘And there’s a big desk in there which I never use. The Welshman looks chuffed as he sets his eyes on the gleaming silverware he helped earn his side . Goalscorer Ramsey hugs his FA Cup following his goal against Hull City at Wembley in 2014 . More than a quarter of a million fans took to the streets to celebrates Arsenal's 2014 FA Cup success . ‘That feeling you get after winning is difficult to get. Everyone realised we wanted more. We are putting pressure on ourselves to get the best from each other and I feel we’ve done that in the second half of this season. ‘We’ve really stuck by each other, worked hard for each other and we want another feeling like we had last season. We do push ourselves as a team and I think the title is getting closer. Last season we started really well and maybe faded away. We lost against the bigger teams, but this season we’ve done better against them. This season, we didn’t start too well but the second half has been really good and consistent. I feel we are very close.’ If Chelsea collapse against the odds in the title race, Arsenal are best placed to pounce after a run of 33 points from a dozen Barclays Premier League games since New Year’s Day. ‘That’s still a possibility,’ said Ramsey. ‘You can’t rule it out. You can’t. When you have that momentum, it is still possible. Even though it will be difficult we have to win our remaining games and see where that leaves us. ‘It’s going to be difficult. Chelsea have a lot of points, so they will have to slip up a few times for us to catch them. So it will be difficult, but it’s still possible.’ His optimism reflects the mood in Arsenal’s camp, very different from this time last year when they went into an FA Cup semi-final stifled by the desperation to end the trophy-free years and Arsene Wenger’s uncertain future. They staggered past Wigan on penalties. Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski makes a save against Wigan Athletic during FA Cup semi final match . Fabianski's save helped Arsenal to progress to the FA Cup final which they won at Wembley in 2014 . Arsenal are stronger and more solid now, with more weaponry, flair and freedom than last year. But that does not mean they will swat Reading aside. ‘We probably did feel the pressure,’ admitted Ramsey. ‘But we got through and went on to win it and we haven’t got that sort of pressure now. That pressure is gone because we won something and there is no more of this “nine years”. ‘It’s a different sort of pressure, but one we’ve been up against many times when we’ve played lesser teams. It’s important not to take the game lightly. We just have to focus and if we manage ourselves correctly, we will go through.’ Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will be hoping to add another piece of silverware to his collection .","Aaron Ramsey starred when Arsenal won the FA Cup against Hull in 2014 .

"A family pooch received an interesting make-over when it came back from the groomers looking less like a domesticated pet and more like a wild cat. The dog named Stains had its coat trimmed to resemble a lion when its owners sent it to the groomers. According to the dog’s owner, Stains is a sheep-herding breed and his thick coat, which is best suited for colder climates, had become uncomfortable in the recent sunshine. The dog's owner looks down and laughs while filming his pet Stains, but initially it is hard to see why . It was at this point that its owner decided that what the dog really needed was a new look and opted to have half its coat shaved. Capturing his artistic vision on camera, Stains’ owner laughs hysterically while videoing his pet sitting alongside two other dogs at home. At first everything appears to be in order until the dog gets up and walks into another room, prompting the video maker to laugh even harder. Stains' coat was cut to resemble a lion's when its owners sent it to the groomers to get a trim . The filmmaker laughs throughout the video and the other dogs in the house approach Stains as if checking out his new look . Shaved from the front legs back, the dog boasts a voluminous mane around its head and neck and looks somewhat majestic. Similar to a lion, the dog’s tail remains unshaved apart from the very top of it, while the pooch’s overall colouring also helps create the illusion.

"Manchester City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a compulsory purchase clause that triggered a permanent move to the Mestalla as soon as he played for the La Liga club. Reports in Spain on Thursday suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. VIDEO Scroll down to see Negredo practice his rabonas . Manchester City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo . Negredo didn't celebrate after scoring against Levante on Monday, sparking speculation about his future . There had been suggestions that Valencia were trying to finance a deal for Radamel Falcao . The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao who is set to leave Manchester United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim, and offloading Negredo was seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. Meanwhile, City had scouts watching FC Porto’s surprise 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

"Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch. But that doesn’t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid  a stroke. Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera, Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage. The fish begins relaxing in the man's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger . The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man’s fingers. The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation. Repeating the process, the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man’s hand to be stroked again. Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers. The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers . Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more. The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish, clearly saddened by this, following it up to the surface of the water. According to Mr Giroux, who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel, the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish. The fish swims away from the man's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged . But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet. He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable. After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn’t play with it on a daily basis. The fish begins swimming around the man's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand . The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day. The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986.","Roland Giroux captured his relationship with his fish on camera .

"A drug-addicted Ryanair steward who swiped a £500 camera left on a flight was rumbled by the owner who spotted the listing on eBay and reported him to police. Teacher Aaron Galloway, 23, was on a half-term city break to Prague when he left his expensive SLR camera on the seat as he landed in the Czech Republic capital. Ground crew phoned the flight attendants within minutes but cabin crew said there was no sign of the £499 Nikon. Flighty: Ryanair steward Fernando Miguel Andrade Viseu begged Adam Galloway not to report him to police when he replied to a message warning him that he could prove that he was selling stolen goods .

Viseu was charged with the theft of the camera as well as stealing a Kindle from an unknown owner and pleaded guilty in court. However, he's not being investigated for any other offences at this time or being pursued under the proceeds of crime act. Magistrates in Chelmsford, Essex, ordered to attend a drug rehabilitation programme for six months by the court on March 9 and pay £145 costs. They also imposed a community order and ordered him to do 100 hours of unpaid work. Ryanair have now sacked him. Aaron, a primary school teacher, said: 'When I saw it on Ebay I couldn't believe it. 'I was angry with Ryanair to be honest. How can they not notice someone just taking things off the seats? 'He had deleted everything from the camera - photos of Christmas, of a family member who had passed away and my graduation - all wiped. 'I'd been looking forward to taking lots of photos on my holiday and that was just ruined.' Steward Viseu posing next to a Ryanair plane, left, and Aaron Galloway, right, with his camera in Brighton . Aaron went online when he got back home to Brighton, East Sussex, after his three-night break and was astonished to see his camera. He said: 'That night I decided to check Ebay - I'm not sure what made me do it, but I thought I would just have a look. 'Right there, with just 33 minutes to go, was my camera. 'I knew it was mine because the description with the strap, the lens, the battery, the memory card - all mine. 'It was a three day auction starting the same day I lost my camera, and the item location was Stansted. 'I contact the non-emergency police number but only got through to the switchboard and I was panicking. 'So I thought I had nothing to lose so I messaged the seller, expecting them to just ignore me. 'He admitted he worked for Ryanair and had taken my camera. I was pretty surprised because actually he could have ignored me and there was nothing I could have done. 'But he said he was really sorry.' Begging: Viseu begs teacher Aaron not to report him to police and offers to return the camera . Viseu - who was listed on eBay as fstoffel2013 - sent Aaron a message saying: 'My apologies for this. I'll obviously return the camera to you. 'Please tell me when you return and I will meet you at the terminal. 'Of course my job is important to me. I'll meet you at the terminal or whatever you want to. 'I found the camera at the end of the day and I will return it to you, of course. 'Please, please don't report me.' Aaron added: 'The police initially said they wanted me to organise to go and collect it off him in person, and they would arrest him there. 'But then once I showed them the evidence they went to his home and arrested him there.' A spokesman for Essex Police said: 'We arrested a 34-year-old man from the Stansted area on Friday February 20 on suspicion of theft.'","Teacher Adam Galloway got home and found Nikon on eBay just 35 minutes before end of auction .

"Mauricio Pochettino says another campaign in the Europa League will hamper Tottenham's hopes of breaking into the top-four. Spurs' chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League look over following poor results against Burnley and Aston Villa. But the White Hart Lane club could yet secure another season in the Europa League. Mauricio Pochettino believes Europa League participation could hamper Tottenham's top four hopes . However, Pochettino fears another year in the competition could have a detrimental impact on their hopes of entering Europe's elite club competition. 'I think I confirmed my idea and my thoughts before when I had the same question when I was manager of Southampton. 'The Europa League is difficult. When you are a team like us, you play in the Europa League and the Premier League it is difficult to manage it. The Europa League is good if you arrive at the final. We can see now that Everton are a team that has a good level but before it was very difficult for them.

Harry Kane (centre) in action as Pochettino's side struggled to a 0-0 draw against Burnley earlier this month . Liverpool last season and Manchester United this season have shown that within the Europa a League you have a better chance to fight for the top four. Meanwhile, Pochettino has told Newcastle bods John Carver that escaping criticism is impossible as a manager.

'I think you care about another manager because you can be in the same position. 'In your career sometimes you are up and sometimes you are down. You suffer a lot when things are not good. So for that reason I care a lot about him. 'But we understand that when you put your face in front on the touchline, when you are a head coach or a manager you are responsible. 'If you want to keep your place you stay in the background. 'The manager has to be brave, it is not an easy job. When the good things happen sometimes it is good to hear: ‘Good man, good job.’ 'When the problems arrive it is difficult to be in a good mood. But it is important to be brave.'

"A lot of the attention on Sunday was aimed in the direction of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods who were paired up in the final round. McIlroy did his level best to repair the damage of a tentative opening 27 holes by shooting 31 for the back nine on Friday and following it with scores of 68 and 66 over the weekend. The world No 1 finished strongly, but the battle came too late to challenge long-time leader Jordan Spieth for the green jacket. Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy were paired together for the final day, but neither could mount a challenge . McIlroy is yet to win The Masters but his birdie at the last gave him a final round of 66 and elevated him into a fourth-place finish. Not what he was hoping for but a performance that suggests it won't be long until he adds a green jacket to his major collection. McIlroy, speaking on BBC Two after finishing 12 under: 'I played well. I've played well over the entire weekend, a disappointing finish yesterday... but there are a lot of positives to take from it. 'I didn't quite have enough and it doesn't look like anyone could have kept up with Jordan this week.

McIlroy hit a final round of 66 to finish on 12 under par in fourth place, six shots behind the eventual winner . Spieth rounded off a record-breaking week by winning the first major of his career with a four-shot victory in the Masters at Augusta. The 21-year-old American, who finished in a tie for second in 2014, held a four-shot lead heading into Sunday and never looked in trouble despite the efforts of the chasing pack led by Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose. Spieth led all week at Augusta, becoming the first man ever to reach 19 under par in the Masters before bogeying the 18th hole, and proudly collected the green jacket for the first time in his young career. Jordan Spieth won his first ever major title with victory at the Masters at Augusta on Sunday . His final round of 70 went along with his first three scores this week of 64, 66 and 70 to round off a stunning performance. And McIlroy admits he was beaten by the better man this week. 'If someone had told me I would finish 12 under at the start of the week I would have taken it and sat back and seen where I finished,' he said. 'Jordan started fantastically well and has kept his foot down and been really impressive.' The 21-year-old won the coveted green jacket for the first time in his career having finished runner up in 2014 .","Rory McIlroy finished strongly to finish an impressive fourth in Augusta .

She had dominated four opponents in reaching her first clay-court final.

"Liverpool intend to speak to Jon Flanagan about a new contract at the end of the season with the defender's deal set to expire this summer. The full back was a revelation at Anfield last season as Liverpool came tantalisingly close to winning their first title since 1990. So good was Flanagan's form that he nearly forced himself into England's World Cup squad. He was named on Roy Hodgson's standby list and was widely seen as the future for club and country at right back. Jon Flanagan will speak to Liverpool about a new contract in the summer . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to keep Flanagan at Liverpool . But the 22-year-old has become something of a forgotten man with a knee injury keeping him out of action all season as his contract has ticked down. The injury, sustained just before the start of the season, was not thought to be serious at the time but Flanagan has not played a minute of first-team football in 11 months. He has been back in training now for a while now but is thought to be some way away from being ready for first-team action - though he did play 31 minutes of the recent Steven Gerrard v Jamie Carragher All-Star game at Anfield. Flanagan suffered a knee injury and has become a forgotten man this season . Flanagan impressed so much last season that he forced his way into the England squad . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is a big fan of the Liverpudlian, who is a popular member of the squad and has been on the club's books since the age of 11. And with Gerrard departing this summer Liverpool would be loathed to let another local lad leave, especially with Glen Johnson's expected departure leaving a gap to fill at full back. Both parties are confident an agreement can be reached and that the player can get his career back on track after a year to forget. Rodgers said recently: 'Hopefully Flano's contract will be sorted out. He is working his way back to fitness and when that happens I am sure the contract will get sorted. He is a big part of the future here.'","Jon Flanagan's contract expires in the summer .

"Sania Mirza became the first Indian to climb to the top of the WTA doubles ranking after she teamed up with Swiss great Martina Hingis to claim the Family Circle Cup title. The 28-year-old won her third successive doubles title with Hingis, beating Casey Dellacqua and Darija Jurak 6-0, 6-4 in just 57 minutes, to achieve the top ranking milestone. 'When you start off as a child playing tennis, you dream of being No 1 in the world. It's a dream for every person; very few get there. I feel extremely honoured to be No1, it's something that I've worked for all my life,' Mirza said in a statement.

'I hope this makes girls in India believe that anything is possible; we can achieve anything we want if we put our mind and body to it.' Mirza had once been tipped for success as a singles player after she became the first Indian to win a WTA singles title in 2005. She followed up her success in her hometown of Hyderabad by reaching the fourth round of the U.S. Open in 2005 and two years later broke into the top 30. But from then on her singles career went into freefall, with injuries taking a toll. On the doubles court, however, her career prospered as she became the first Indian woman to claim a grand slam title when she partnered Mahesh Bhupathi to the 2009 Australian Open mixed doubles crown.

When the new WTA rankings are released on Monday, Mirza's run of winning 14 successive doubles matches with Hingis will see her leapfrog Italians Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci at the top of the standings.

"Lewis Hamilton is getting inside teammate Nico Rosberg’s head as the German bids to win his first World Championship title, according to two time winner Mika Hakkinen. Rosberg accused Mercedes team-mate Hamilton of deliberately compromising his race at last weekend’s Chinese Grand Prix by slowing down but Mika Hakkinen said the British driver’s tactics, which saw him win a third consecutive Grand Prix ahead of the German, were entirely legitimate. ‘If you are leading a race that's a fantastic place to be and what goes in your mind when you are leading into finish the race first,’ said Hakkinen. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Nico Rosberg appears less pleased with 2nd . Rosberg accused Hamilton of being selfish by driving too slow and compromising his second position . Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . ‘So you do everything with the team in the right way so you are able to finish the race first. If you have to save tyres, brakes, engine, gearbox whatever it is, that's what you do. 'You don't think about the guy behind you, what he is feeling, how his car is handling or how you want his car to handle at the end of the race you just take care of your own stuff. ‘I have been in this situation with Michael [Schumacher] where where I was much quicker than him and he was definitely challenging me in a very interesting way,’ added Hakkinen. ‘What Lewis and Nico are going through at the moment, they are having a very difficult challenge, already last year and there are challenges continuing this year between them. Rosberg responded to a fan who accused him of 'crying' after he complained about Hamilton . Former world champion Mika Hakkinen says Hamilton was well within his rights to look after himself . Hamilton celebrates with with his trophy and bottle of champagne after his race win . 'They are the drivers with the best possible chance of winning at the moment. It requires a lot of nerves from the drivers to be able to be a good racing driver and not to start fighting because it doesn't make any difference.’ Hamilton, who is bidding to win a third World Championship title this season, has out-qualified and out-raced Rosberg in all three grand prix and Rosberg will likely be feeling the pressure according to Hakkinen. ‘Nico has definitely got big pressure on him,’ said Hakkinen, ‘He doesn't know how it feels to be a world champion and doesn't know what confidence a world championship generates inside you when you are racing driver. ‘He is still hunting that feeling. He wants to win but first he has to beat Lewis but Nico is a great driver and if you look at the qualifying result at the last grand prix the time difference was hardly nothing. I don't say that pole position is the key point to win a grand prix certainly it helps to start in pole.’ Lewis, many congratulations. Was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from Ferrari and, also, can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up? Were you aware that Nico was getting so backed-up towards Sebastian Vettel? LH: I wasn’t controlling his race, I was controlling my own race but, great race, I’m really happy. Definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the Ferraris were very, very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres. So, today the real goal was to manage the tyres. And, as I said, my goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico through the whole race. So, I just managed it and got to really enjoy it, to be honest. A few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop, which I really enjoyed. Ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole, full practice sessions, on my side of the garage at least. And it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race. So really happy, and yeah, kinda excited. Q: Nico, can you talk us through your view of the race today. Started second, finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at times under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe? NR: No. It’s just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race. Driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that Sebastian was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me. And then I had to cover him. So, first of all it was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because I had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer. So I’m unhappy about that, of course, today. Other than that, not much to say. Q: Lewis, would you like to respond? LH: Not really! My job is not to… it’s not my job to look after Nico’s race. My job’s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible – and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up. I just was focussing on myself. If Nico wanted to get by he could have tried but he didn’t.","Lewis Hamilton won the Chinese GP with Nico Rosberg finishing second .

"Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have again been reminded of their responsibilities to Mercedes after the team were forced to tackle head on the tension that rose between them in China on Sunday. Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff is confident the matter has been laid to rest after Rosberg bemoaned Hamilton's 'selfish' tactics following their one-two finish at the Shanghai International Circuit. Hamilton was absolved of any blame by both Wolff and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, although the problem did at least provide another scenario from which to learn. Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday . Hamilton led home Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in Shanghai to retain his lead in the championship . With the next race in Bahrain following up swiftly on Sunday, Wolff said: 'We saw tensions between Nico and Lewis in the race and we tackled them directly on Sunday night to stop anything carrying over to this weekend. 'When you have intense competition it's normal it causes emotions to run high - and that's not something we want to change. 'Both drivers are now very focused on delivering maximum performance in Bahrain and our package should cope well with the demands of the circuit. 'We maintain our philosophy of letting the drivers race, but they both know the No 1 priority for the team is to win for Mercedes-Benz.' For Rosberg, in particular, the race offers an opportunity for swift retribution as the 29-year-old has so far been trounced this season by Hamilton, who has finished ahead on the grid after qualifying and in all three races to date. Hamilton, who has out-qualified and finished ahead of Rosberg at every race, sprays a grid girl with champagne . 'China was a frustrating weekend for me and I'm glad we have another race right away to get straight back to work,' said Rosberg. 'The team has made a great start to the season, and with this incredible car they have built I know I just need to find a little bit more in myself to get back to the top step. 'I've never won in Bahrain but I've taken the last two pole positions here and also set the fastest lap at this circuit on my Formula One debut, so I know I have the pace.' Rosberg accused Hamilton of being 'selfish' as tension rose between the two Mercedes team-mates in China . Last year's intense battle between Hamilton and Rosberg was one of the highlights of the season, and lit the blue touchpaper to their rivalry as it was later discovered the latter attacked Hamilton by using a different engine setting. Rosberg is now eager to finally get one over on Hamilton, adding: ""Of course, everyone remembers the race last year and it would be great for the fans if we can put on another great show for them this time. 'If we can do that, but with the two top steps in a different order, it would be fantastic. 'It won't be so easy with the competition (in Ferrari) breathing down our necks. 'But that makes for even more exciting racing, so I'm looking forward to a great battle and I'm determined to come out on top.'","Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg to renew F1 title rivalry at Bahrain GP .

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has revealed the team may have to make 'an unpopular call' for their drivers in light of Ferrari's revival this season. Following the first three races of the new Formula One season it is clear Mercedes will not have it all their own way as Ferrari appear poised to push them all the way. Wolff's remark also comes in the wake of Nico Rosberg's moaning over the team radio during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix about how slow team-mate Lewis Hamilton was driving. Toto Wolff (left) says Nico Rosberg (right) and Lewis Hamilton will have to deal with some 'unpopular calls' Rosberg then turned on Hamilton during the post-race press conference, accusing the world champion of being selfish. Hamilton insisted he was merely looking after his tyres to ensure they lasted during the crucial middle stint of the race, with the 30-year-old exonerated of any wrongdoing by Wolff and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda. But Wolff has confirmed that with pressure from Ferrari, rather than his drivers simply allowed to fight it out between themselves as was the case last season, there may be decisions taken on the pit wall during a race that could anger one or the other. The British driver won the Chinese grand prix but has come under fire from his Mercedes team-mate . 'It may be if we are risking a win against Ferrari we would make an unpopular call, not to freeze everything, but manage them more,' Wolff said. 'Our number one objective, which is what we have decided with the drivers, is we have a big responsibility to the team and the brand. 'It's not just about those two guys - it's about the thousand people working on those cars. 'If it gets to the point where we have to interfere between the two of them because we risk losing a race win, then we would do that. Hamiltonhas won two of the three Formula One races this season and looks to be at the top of his game . 'We don't have the gap that we did last year where we can just let them push each other until the very end. We need to manage the gaps.' Suggested to Wolff he was risking Mercedes' DNA as racers - something he has insisted all along would never be tampered with - he replied: 'It depends on what you do. 'We have seen in the past a clear team order that has stated 'you are not allowed to overtake' even though the driver behind may be faster, for example. 'This is not something I can honestly see happening. Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel have proved surprise tough competition in the race for the Championship . 'I can understand why teams in the past have done it because they were under threat of losing a championship. 'Knock on wood, we haven't been in that situation. But managing the situation more, without making such a drastic call, is a possibility now.'","Toto Wolff says the Mercedes drivers may be unhappy with some calls .

"Lewis Hamilton insists he is ready for Nico Rosberg's tactics should his Mercedes team-mate attempt anything underhand in the wake of his latest outburst. Rosberg's criticism of Hamilton following Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix has reopened old wounds that at times festered between the duo last year. The 29-year-old German claimed Hamilton selfishly slowed during the middle part of the race, drawing him back into a chasing Sebastian Vettel in his Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton (right) insists he is prepared for further criticism from Mercede's team-mate Nico Rosberg . Hamilton beat his Mercedes colleague to win the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai on Sunday . Mercedes top brass Toto Wolff and Niki Lauda insist Hamilton was not at fault, with the eventual one-two the best result for the team. With Rosberg distinctly second best to Hamilton so far this season - as he has been out-qualified and out-raced by the Briton in all three grands prix - it remains to be seen what tricks he might have up his sleeve to stop the rot and regain the advantage. In Monaco last year it has been suggested by many Rosberg deliberately thwarted Hamilton during qualifying, earning pole and following up with the race win. In Belgium, Rosberg earned a rebuke and had sanctions imposed on him by the team after colliding with Hamilton on only the second lap which forced the latter out of the race. Hamilton (right) led Rosberg at the Chinese Grand Prix, and later came under criticism from his team-mate . The British racer, who leads the Drivers' Championship by 13 points, sprays champagne on a hostess . Although aware Rosberg may do all he can to beat him, an unperturbed Hamilton said: 'I feel pretty well prepared, having experienced all those kind of things. 'That stuff doesn't cross my mind. I think we're professional. We've been through some ups and downs and now we're in a good place. 'And anyway, I would like to think I am stronger this year and that will be reflected moving forwards.' The bottom line is at present Rosberg does not have an answer for Hamilton's form and pace as the 30-year-old has won eight of the last 10 races. Hamilton has also suggested Rosberg should seize a chance when it is presented to him, as was the case in Shanghai. Hamilton claimed after the race that Rosberg (left) was not quick enough to catch him even if he tried . The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai finished with a Mercedes one-two, and Sebastian Vettel third for Ferrari . 'You have to try and sympathise with people's opinions,' said Hamilton. 'I always try, in all walks of life, to put myself in that position because you wouldn't want that to happen to you. You try to think that. 'But I said to the guys, if I was in second and I had the pace I had, I would have been pushing to be as close as possible and passing. That's racing. Nico didn't try. 'They said maybe he was just comfortable second, and I said ""Well, that's the difference between us. I want to win always"". 'I would have done everything to get past, or at least pushed for three laps if I could.' Hamilton drives during the Formula One Grand Prix race at the Shanghai International Circuit on April 12 . But then cuttingly, Hamilton added: 'Even if he had (pushed), and he had got relatively close, he just wasn't quick enough. 'If you take a step back, this is motor racing, man. Racing. Don't take away the fun of the racing. It's racing. 'If I was in second or third, I would have done everything. I wouldn't have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint. 'Of course you want to get to the end of the stint, but if I thought I had more pace I would have tried to have got past, because that's the best part.'","Lewis Hamilton beat Nico Rosberg at Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix .

"Tom Varndell helped himself to a hat-trick against London Welsh as Wasps won away from home in the Aviva Premiership for the first time in 2015 to keep their top-six hopes alive. Ahead of the trip to the Kassam Stadium, Wasps' hunt for an automatic European Rugby Champions Cup spot next season had stuttered after winning just one of their previous five fixtures in all competitions. However, they claimed a 40-13 win over Welsh with tries from Varndell, Ashley Johnson, Sailosi Tagicakibau and Alapati Leiua . Tom Varndell crosses for one of his three tries as Wasps ran out comfortable winners at the Kassam Stadium . It was far from plain sailing for Wasps, though as the Exiles, whose defeat to Bath last time out confirmed that they will finish bottom of the table, trailed 12-5 at half-time after Opeti Fonua bundled over after the first two of Varndell's tries. But Johnson dotted down and Varndell added his third before Tagicakibau secured the bonus point for Wasps, with Alapati Leiua getting in on the act with the last play of the game. Chris Elder scored Welsh's second try of the match in the second period. Wasps got off to a fast start at the Kassam as they went 12 points clear after as many minutes. The visitors found the tryline after only four minutes as Varndell broke down the right flank and scored in the corner, veteran fly-half Andy Goode converting well from a tight angle. Welsh then went down to 14 men eight minutes later when Koree Britton was sent to the sin bin for pulling down a maul and Wasps instantly capitalised as Varndell grabbed his second try. Seb Stegmann is tackled by Carlo Festuccia as the exiles put up a fight, but faded away again . Alapati Leiua breaks away to score a late try as Wasps pulled away in the closing stages . The Exiles crept back into the game, though, keeping the pressure on Wasps' defence and Fonua forced his way through to make it 12-5, Tristan Roberts kicking the conversion side. Welsh started the second half well and Roberts made amends for his earlier miss as he calmly kicked a penalty between the posts to reduce the arrears even further. But Wasps soon began to dominate and a lineout close to the try-line was bundled over by Johnson in his first start as hooker. Then a swift break down the right saw Varndell free to run back around the Welsh defence and score under the posts for his hat-trick. Elder scored a try out of nowhere four minutes later for the Exiles on his Aviva Premiership debut, as he found space on the left wing to touch down in the corner. Wasps instantly replied though as Tagicakibau finished a great run through the centre by reaching for the line. And the game ended on a high for Wasps as Leiua finished the scoring with a darting run through the middle.

"The morning after the row the night before, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg barely exchanged a word in the first-class cabin of their Emirates flight to Dubai, en route to the next race in Bahrain. If the two Mercedes drivers are not quite on non-speaking terms, they are communicating only when they have to. While they kept quiet among themselves, both had a further say in public about the dispute that broke out after the Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton was particularly strident saying that the difference is that he is a ‘racer’ and Rosberg is not. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg have both had their say on Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Winner Hamilton (centre) waves to the crowd as Rosberg (left) and Sebastian Vettel shake hands . Briefly, the bones of the argument are these. Rosberg, who was beaten into second place by Hamilton, said his team-mate had been ‘selfish’ by slowing down while leading the race. It caused him (Rosberg) to be bunched up closer to the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whom he feared could overhaul him. Vettel did not manage to do so and finished third. The verbal spat played out at the press conference as the two protagonists sat side by side. Rosberg fumed. Hamilton smiled, seemingly happy to have riled his title rival. But it can now be revealed what happened after they finished their subsequent round of interviews in the Shanghai paddock on Sunday night. Both went through their usual engineering debriefs before being brought in one by one to meet senior Mercedes management including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, team principal and technical director respectively. Hamilton went in first and was in conversation with his bosses for half an hour. Rosberg for 20 minutes, now in a room illuminated by lights as darkness crept in outside. Then, more than two hours after the race had finished, Wolff was happy the team had got their story straight enough to speak to journalists. It was now 90 minutes after his scheduled press conference. Rosberg (left) was clearly angry with Hamilton in Sunday's press conference and hit out at his team-mate . The British driver (right) denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton (right) backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . He declared the talks ‘positive’ and cleared both his drivers of wrongdoing. Hamilton then spoke to the press under an embargo that mean his words have not appeared until now. ‘Nico didn’t try,’ he said with passion, often repeating his words for emphasis. ‘Nico didn’t try. ‘They said maybe he was just comfortable in second place and I said, “Well that’s the difference between us. I want to win always.” ‘And I would have done everything to get past today. Or at least pushed for three laps. He wasn’t quick enough. ‘This is motor racing, man. Racing. Don’t take away the fun of the racing. It’s racing. I wouldn’t have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint. ‘I don’t even know what Nico’s point is. Where we are is that I just won the race today. I did the best job I could possibly have done and the team got a one-two.’ Hamilton’s explanation for slowing down is that he was running his own race and conserving his tyres as best suited him. No neutral I have spoken to within Formula One disputes the world champion’s rationale. Hamilton (centre) celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Rosberg (right) appears less pleased . Hamilton crosses the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . ‘Ultimately this is Formula One,’ added Hamilton. ‘I want the guy to be up my a*** if he’s got the pace to be up my a***, and putting pressure on me. And if I can’t defend it, I lose, like in Bahrain last year. I wasn’t quick enough and I did everything I could to stay ahead. And that was the greatest race ever.’ The greatest race of this young century, certainly. Both drivers are now spending a few days in Dubai before travelling to Bahrain for this year’s race on Sunday. Before leaving, and without knowing what Hamilton had said, Rosberg offered his considered version of events through his customary post-race video, on which he answered fans’ questions. One asked if he was ‘crying’ – by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser. Rosberg said: ‘You say that I was crying. OK, I respect your opinion, and I’ll keep it in mind and I’ll try to show respect when it’s due going forward.’ Hamilton in front of team-mate Rosberg during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg (right) speaks with Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff in Shanghai during the weekend . But why did he not push to pass Hamilton? ‘It might not be so easy to understand from the outside,’ said the German. ‘But the reason is, I did try to attack Lewis in the first stint, and it just didn’t work. All I did was destroy my tyres. ‘So in the second stint there was no point to do that again. I would have completely destroyed my tyres and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that’s what I was building up to. ‘The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying. That compromised me most. And it was by just four-hundredths. That’s all down to me to be those five-hundredths quicker next time.’","A dispute broke out between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg on Sunday .

"Rangers have been fined £5,500 by the Scottish Football Association after admitting the previous board breached 'dual ownership' rules by allowing Newcastle chief Mike Ashley into Ibrox. The Sports Direct tycoon owns 9.82 per cent of the Glasgow giants but is prohibited from going over 10 per cent by an agreement struck with Hampden chiefs designed to limit his power at Ibrox. But that did not stop Ashley exerting influence. Two of his closest associates - Derek Llambias and Barry Leach - sat as directors until King forced them out at last month's general meeting. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley bought a 9.8 per cent stake in Rangers and loaned the club £5million . Ashley gave the club's old board a £5million loan in January which remains outstanding. That agreement gives the 50-year-old a floating charge on the club as well as security on a number of assets, including Murray Park and the club's registered trademarks. Representatives of the new board arrived at Hampden at 2pm on Thursday to appear before the SFA's Judicial Panel. Ashley's close associate Derek Llambias sat as director as Ashley exerted his influence . During a three-hour meeting they admitted the club had breached Disciplinary Rule 1, which requires member clubs to 'behave towards the Scottish FA and other members with the utmost good faith' - and were fined £5,000. A second fine of £500 was also imposed after Rangers admitted a breach of Disciplinary Rule 19 - which relates to dual ownership. Ashley - the world's 306th richest man, worth an estimated £3.3billion - was fined £7,500 for breaching Disciplinary Rule 19 last month.","Newcastle owner Mike Ashley owns 9.82 per cent stake in Rangers .

"Leigh Griffiths sure knows how to finish. And, in passing, how to make a point. Left on the bench for Wednesday night’s home clash with Kilmarnock, perhaps uncertain over his place in the starting XI for Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness, the Celtic striker scored a 19-minute hat-trick to guide his team to a handsome 4-1 victory. The Treble-chasing reigning champions came from a goal down, inspired by Kris Commons and the second-half introduction of Griffiths, to record a win that takes them eight points clear at the top of the Premiership – and lifts confidence ahead of their trip to Hampden. Hat-trick hero Leigh Griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award . Darryl Westlake’s wickedly deflected strike early in the second half had given the visitors a shock lead completely against the run of play – only for Commons to equalise in spectacular, if contested, fashion eight minutes later. As good and important as Commons was for Celtic, though, even his performance was overshadowed by the arrival of Griffiths, who simply exploded on to the scene with three goals of supreme quality in less time than it takes for the average warm down. Rightly named Man of the Match despite playing for just over half an hour, the former Hibs front man eased all the frets and fears of home fans on a night that had looked to be slipping away from their team. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick against Kilmarnock . Celtic had begun the night with a starting XI looking very much like the team Deila might have been thinking about for Hampden, all things being equal; leaving Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, both suspended for the semi-final, on the bench suggested that he was giving his Cup formation a gentle run out. Against a Kilmarnock team whose ambition rarely threatened to over-reach their ability, there were certainly passages of play that resembled nothing so uncompetitive as a training session. With Lee Miller plodding along on his lonesome up front and only the pace of left winger Tope Obadeyi carrying even the hint of a threat to the home side, the visitors – doughty in defence but reliably clumsy on the ball – were obviously intent on playing a containing game. Griffiths collects the match ball after his second-half hat trick on Wednesday night . Maybe, just maybe, they’d catch Celtic sleeping and grab a surprise goal. And, if not, well, a nil-nil at Parkhead is never a disgrace, right? The problem for those who turned up in anticipation of a football match was that, however well Celtic played, attack against defence boasts only so much in the way of entertainment value. James Forrest looked the most obvious outlet for a Celtic breakthrough, the winger scampering down the left and finding space where none should have existed, though too often making the wrong call. The former Scotland regular might have scored himself with seven minutes on the clock, tearing into the box and receiving an Emilio Izaguirre pass at pace, yet Forrest’s first touch was half an ounce heavy – allowing young Killie captain Lee Ashcroft to make a vital block on his shot. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . It didn’t take overly long for the crowd, such as it was on a night when empty seats abounded, to grow frustrated by the home team’s inability to get themselves ahead. Virgil van Dijk loping forward from central defence caused a few stirs of excitement, Stefan Johansen’s running beyond lone striker John Guidetti promised at least a possibility or two. Still space in the final third remained at a premium. Home skipper Scott Brown should have done a great deal better with an Izaguirre cut-back on the half-hour mark, failing to connect cleanly with the bouncing ball and watching it balloon high and wide of the target. Would set-pieces, of which there were an increasing number, provide a more productive avenue of attack for Celtic? Well, big Van Dijk came fairly close with a flashing header from a Commons corner. In open play, an inability – or unwillingness – to let fly continued to be the running theme, one great guddle involving Guidetti and Forrest, neither finding that half yard needed to take a shot inside the box, moving the locals to howls of annoyance. If they were irked by their heroes showing less than perfect concentration in the art of opening up their opposition, Kilmarnock’s opener had the home support in uproar when they took a hugely unexpected lead four minutes into the second half. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) congratulates Griffiths after the final whistle . Two or three Celtic players had a chance to close down and dispossess Obadeyi as he made ground and tied defenders in on the flank, yet he kept hold of the ball long enough for support to arrive in the shape of Westlake. Sure, the midfielder’s shot took the kind of deflection for which there is no accounting, smacking Jason Denayer and spinning beyond a helpless Craig Gordon. But failure to apply due diligence at the back definitely contributed to the concession. Their fans roused and their own pride hurt, Celtic had to muster a quick response. Step forward the captain, who pounced to nick the ball off the toe of Sammy Clingan – prompting immediately complaints of a dangerous challenge. Griffiths was thrown into the fray before the game could be restarted, Forrest making way as Celtic tried to provide Guidetti with more support up front. As substitutions go, not one of Deila’s worst. Griffiths had been on the park all of six minutes, in fact, when he put Celtic ahead, rising to score with a downward header after Commons had shown excellent skill and vision to drive towards the byeline, beat his man and dig out a cross to the back post. As soon as they went ahead, the shackles seemed to fall from the limbs of the home players. Suddenly, they were finding space, making killer passes, creating openings and – most importantly – taking shots. None better than the 25-yarder that Griffiths sent screaming past Craig Samson with 10 minutes remaining, the ball cannoning in off the keeper’s right-hand post. When he was put through behind the defence four minutes later, there was never any doubt about what would happen, the striker finishing low and hard past a shell-shocked Samson.","Defender Darryl Westlake fired Kilmarnock ahead in the 50th minute .

"Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio, although the 18-time Olympic champion won't swim in the world championships this summer. Phelps confirmed his intention to make one last run at the Olympics on Wednesday. 'You guys heard it here first,' he told reporters at Skyline Aquatic Center, where he will be competing in his first meet since serving a six-month suspension by USA Swimming after a second drunken driving arrest last fall. 'I am looking forward to next year. I don't think it's too hard to really realize why I came back.' 18-time Olympic champion Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio . But Phelps said he won't be swimming at the world meet in Russia in August as part of the punishment set forth by the sport's U.S. governing body. He had already qualified in three events before being banned from the last major international meet before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. 'I really enjoy being on those trips,' he said. 'That's why it is painful to think that I won't have the chance to compete at worlds.' There had been informal discussions about Phelps being reinstated to the US team for worlds, but it would have meant removing swimmers that were named to the team in his absence. 'By no means do I want this to be a distraction from the team,' he said. 'No way would I ever want to displace a member of that team.' Phelps in action during a practice session Mesa, Arizona on Wednesday . Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation after being arrested on DUI charges in his hometown of Baltimore last September. He offered no specifics about his treatment, which he continued in Maryland. He also enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous. 'The last couple of months have probably been the hardest I've ever had to go through in my entire life,' he said. 'I take full responsibility for all of my actions. I've hurt a lot of people and it's been terrible.' The 29-year-old swimmer was sentenced to 18 months of probation. He said he's done more growing up in recent months than he has in his entire life. 'I have been able to come out on a better end, have a clear head,' he said. 'I don't think I've ever been like this once in my life.' Phelps' longtime coach, Bob Bowman, acknowledged his star swimmer's second arrest for drunken driving made it 'pretty hard to convince me that anything was going to lead us back to something that we'd be proud of.' Phelps called Bowman a few times from rehab, which the coach described as 'really weird' because he typically never heard from Phelps away from the pool. Bowman visited Phelps during treatment, still skeptical that the swimmer was there for any reason other than he had to be. But Bowman left thinking differently. Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation . 'I just had no doubt that he had changed in a way that was really meaningful,' Bowman said. 'He was completely different and it's been that way every day since he's been back.' Phelps pleaded guilty after his first drunken driving arrest in 2004. Five years later, a photo was published of him using a marijuana pipe at a party, which drew a three-month suspension and caused some sponsors to drop him. Phelps knows not everyone will believe he's contrite and has changed. 'If somebody doesn't believe the words that are coming out of my mouth that's their choice,' he said. 'I, of course, would like to show everybody in the world that I am in a different place and I am much better than I ever have been. I understand that's going to take a lot of time. This week will be the first week that I can start that.' Phelps will be competing in Mesa for the first time since the Pan Pacific Championships last August. The Arizona meet was where Phelps made his comeback a year ago after an extended retirement following the 2012 Olympics. Phelps adjusts North Baltimore Aquatic Center team-mate Allison Schmidt's cap during practice . He isn't sure what to expect, having only recently returned to the kind of hard training he did before the 2008 Beijing Games, where he won a record eight gold medals. Phelps is falling back on the mentality he used for much of his career. 'I would just get up and swim as hard as I could and leave it in the water,' he said. 'That's what I'm going to do here. I know I'm more prepared now than I was at this time last year.' His first event is the 100-meter butterfly on Thursday, when he'll compete against longtime rival Ryan Lochte. Phelps is surrounding himself with familiar faces this week, including his fiancee Nicole Johnson and family members. 'I'm a lot happier and in a lot better state and in a lot better physical shape than I really have been in a long time,' he said.","Michael Phelps is hoping to compete a the 2016 Olympics in Rio .

"Maverick Tottenham forward Emmanuel Adebayor has insisted that he is happy to stay and fight for his place at White Hart Lane and rejected reports linking him with a move away. Taking to Twitter on Tuesday night, the 31-year-old Togo international expressed his gratitude at being able to play in the Premier League and labeled the division 'the best in the world.' Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer.

Adebayor gives an underwhelming performance against League One side Sheffield United in the League Cup . The striker's significantly more modest form since then, however, coupled with the meteoric rise of homegrown star Harry Kane, have left Adebayor little more than a bit-part in the Spurs machine. This season, he has made just 16 appearances in all competitions, scoring only twice and has been criticised for several underwhelming performances, in particular his showing against League One's Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Yet, the former Arsenal, Real Madrid and Manchester City hitman remains adamant that he will see out the remainder of his contract in north London. Adebayor's last Premier League goal for Spurs came during a 1-2 defeat by Newcastle back in October last year.

"Louis van Gaal has won a battle to install floodlights at the club's Carrington training ground. The meticulous Manchester United boss was stunned to find that players could not train after dark at the swish complex on the outskirts of the city when he arrived last summer. He immediately ordered a raft of improvements including the installation of floodlights. Sportsmail understands Van Gaal is very keen to replicate match conditions during sessions. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal looks on during a training session alongside Wayne Rooney . An aerial view of Manchester United's swish Carrington training base without its floodlights . The Manchester United boss was stunned to find players could not train after dark at the swish complex . If United are due to play a night match he would prefer them to prepare by training under lights and, should they be playing in a 3pm kick-off in the winter, he would like to train at a similar time amid fading levels of light. Previous managers at the club have tended to stick to regular morning slots. A club source said: 'The manager pays very close attention to detail. By putting the lights in it allows him to recreate conditions much closer to what the players may face.' United have had to persuade planning bosses that the development would not disturb the local bat population. As part of their proposals, called in a bat expert to inspect the premises where the likes of Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera hone their skills. Particular concerns were raised over the impact of the three species spotted at the rural location, the common pipistrelle, soprano pipistelle and Daunbenton's. However, Trafford council have now granted planning application and work should start shortly. Van Gaal would prefer them to prepare by training under lights ahead of a night match to replicate conditions . The installation of the lights will also allow Van Gaal extra time to work with his charges in bleak winters . The installation of the lights will also allow Van Gaal, who famously spends hours on the training ground, extra time to work with his charges in the notoriously bleak Manchester winters. United's planning application stated: 'The benefit of the floodlighting is that it will allow for greater use of the training pitches, particularly during the winter months. 'This is essential in enabling the football club to compete with other clubs, both at domestic and international levels. The floodlighting will enhance the usability and function of the training centre, further helping to maintain its world class status.' The likes of self-confessed Coronation Street fan Rooney and Co, however, will not find themselves there late at night. Approval was granted on the condition that the lights were not used between the hours of 9pm and 9am.

"Tottenham will subsidise Emmanuel Adebayor's £100,000-per-week wages to finally get rid of the striker this summer. The Togolese striker is out of favour at White Hart Lane, with both the player and manager Mauricio Pochettino happy for the hitman to leave once the transfer window re-opens. But Adebayor's wages will prove a key factor this summer, with the striker unwilling to take anything less than his current £5.2million salary before accepting a move.

Adebayor (right) is out of favour under current Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino (centre) However, Spurs are now willing to pay a percentage of Adebayor's wages next season in an attempt to ensure he leaves. Chairman Daniel Levy has shown a reluctance to take such measures in the past, but is so keen to show Adebayor the door that he has now changed tact. Adebayor will enter the final 12 months of his deal this summer and will be made available for loan or a permanent move.

"David Luiz should not play in central defence again after his horror show in PSG's 3-1 defeat against Barcelona, according to former England boss Glenn Hoddle. The ex-Chelsea defender came off the bench in Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final first leg and was nutmegged twice by Luis Suarez in the build-up to the Uruguayan's two goals. Luiz suffered a hamstring injury 10 days ago but Hoddle, who insists that the Brazilian has always been a defensive liability, believes he still showed his naivety even if he wasn't fully fit. Luis Suarez puts the ball through David Luiz's legs on his way to scoring his second goal of the night . Luiz suffered the same fate when Suarez weaved his way into the box for Barcelona's second goal . The Brazilian was left with his head in his hands after allowing Suarez a clean run at goal . Asked about Luiz's defending for Barcelona's third goal, the Sky Sports pundit said: 'Even if you're not 100 per cent fit you can't show that lack of intent. 'He's the last man on the pitch when Suarez picks the ball up and starts running at him. He realises he's the last man and the very last thing (you should do) when you're last man is jump in. You bide time for your team to get around you. 'He does what an eight year old who hasn't been coached does. He tries to win it by putting both of his feet together but when he does that he can't move anywhere. Suarez nutmegs him again.' Some of Luiz's best performances for PSG - and former club Chelsea - came when he was deployed in a central midfield role with less defensive responsibility, something Hoddle believes manager Laurent Blanc should consider from now on. Sky Sports pundit Glenn Hoddle described Luiz as a 'liability at the back' after PSG's defeat . Luiz defended like an 'eight-year-old who hasn't been coached' in this challenge, according to Hoddle . Suarez tucks home the first of his two goals against PSG after nutmegging Luiz with ease . He added: 'For me he's a liability at the back. He always has been. You have to find a place (for him) in midfield or even at right back. 'He's a footballer who likes to play in the playground when there's no shape to the game. He's a talent but that's not what top football is about.' However Hoddle's fellow pundit, former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, was quick to point the blame in the direction of Blanc, who chose to introduce the 25-year-old after an injury to Thiago Silva. Henry said: 'If David Luiz wasn't fit enough to start the game, why does he come on as a sub after 21 minutes? Luiz looks dejected after contributing to his side's 3-1 defeat in their Champions League quarter-final first leg . Jamie Redknapp also admitted that Luiz can be a liability but Thierry Henry questioned the player's fitness . 'From a coaching point of view, why would you put him in? If he's not fit enough to start, why do you put him in?' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp, who was also in the Sky Sports studio, showed some sympathy for Luiz but pointed towards the sheer number of high-profile errors made by the former Benfica man in recent seasons. Responding to Henry, Redknapp said: 'I do agree with you but I've seen him do that every single week in the Premier League. 'That's one of the reasons Chelsea were quick to get rid of him. Defensively, at times, he's a liability.'","David Luiz was at fault for both of Luis Suarez's goals in Barcelona's win .

Sunday's game was also marred by crowd violence, with Torpedo fans attacking Arsenal supporters and police. For that, Torpedo fans will be barred from the club's next three away games, with the exception of women and children under 13. Torpedo was fined a total of 900,000 rubles (£11,000) for various offenses including the Nazi banner, the fighting, use of pyrotechnics by fans, and insulting chants. Arsenal received a 480,000-ruble (£6,000) fine on charges including failing to secure the stadium properly. Police detained 15 fans at the game, of which seven face charges, Russian agency Tass reported on Monday. In response to the incidents at Sunday's game, Torpedo president Alexander Tukmanov told the R-Sport agency that the club's fans seemed to be 'probably the most aggressive' of any top-flight Russian team.

"The Bayern Munich squad flew back to Germany on Thursday the day after suffering a surprise defeat by Porto in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. A glum-looking Thomas Muller, Manuel Neuer and Pep Guardiola were pictured at the airport ready to board their flight back to Bavaria after their 3-1 loss at the Estadio Dragao on Wednesday. The defeat was the price the five-time European champions paid for a string of injuries and a tired squad that has not stopped playing, chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. Thomas Muller, Xabi Alonso and the rest of the squad get off the bus at the airport before returning to Germany . A glum-looking Pep Guardiola prepares to board the flight in Portugal with his depleted squad . Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and Guardiola make their way on to the plane as they return to Bavaria after defeat . Bayern, chasing a treble of domestic and European titles, travelled with only 15 outfield players to Portugal for their quarter-final first leg leaving injured Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba, among others, behind. 'I am not prepared to criticise the team,' Rummenigge said in post-midnight banquet. 'There are 13 or 14 players who are at the moment healthy and have been playing three times a week.' Bayern have been cruising towards the Bundesliga title with a 10-point advantage as the injuries seem to hardly affect them domestically. Guardiola cannot believe it as he sees his side beaten 3-1 by Porto in the quarter-final first leg on Wednesday . Neuer looks exasperated as the German champions concede their second goal of the game after 10 minutes . 'But there comes a day when you are a little bit tired, when your legs feel heavy and when you lack some of your concentration,' Rummenigge said. A lack of concentration certainly contributed to the three goals they conceded, each coming from an individual defensive mistake. What had been for much of the season their strongest asset - Bayern conceded just four goals in their first 17 Bundesliga games - was on Wednesday their Achilles heel. Jerome Boateng, Xabi Alonso and Dante, all lost possession or control near the box, allowing the Portuguese to score. Colombian Jackson Martinez rounds Neuer with ease before slotting into an empty net to put Porto 3-1 ahead . Bayern boss Pep Guardiola looks perplexed as his side fall two goals behind during the early stages of the Champions League clash . 'We imagined it differently,' said keeper Manuel Neuer, who was lucky not to be sent off after bringing down Jackson Martinez for a third-minute penalty. 'We were not confident and did not create scoring chances. The other problem was the mistakes we made. You are punished in the Champions League for those. We know we messed up together but we have to keep going.' While Bayern are not used to losing, they have every chance to overturn the first leg deficit, with Ribery and possibly Schweinsteiger fit for the return leg in Munich on Tuesday. 'I am not fully dissatisfied with the team,' coach Pep Guardiola said. 'We tried everything but it is not easy against such a physical team. 'It is a complicated result but we will take a shot at it in the return leg and we will not give up that easily.'","Bayern Munich were beaten 3-1 by Porto in the Champions League .

"Christian Benteke has revealed a secret. Despite what appeared cast-iron evidence to the contrary, he does not practise free-kicks. He has taken only a handful in his career. Yet with seven minutes to go in a game Aston Villa dared not lose, he stepped forward, pushing aside team-mates, to curl his dead-ball opportunity over the Queens Park Rangers wall and into the net. Precious point rescued. ‘I surprised myself!’ he says, laughing. ‘When I saw it, Charles N’Zogbia said, “I want to shoot”. But I said, “I want to take it”.

The Belgium striker admitted he even surprised himself by finding the back of the net with the free kick . ‘It wasn’t about the hat-trick, it was more about if I can take the free-kick or not, if I can hit the target. I have only taken one before for Villa, against Swansea, and I hit the post.’ What happens should a chance come from similar range against Liverpool? ‘I’ll take it. Sometimes you have to try.’ So speaks a striker of soaring confidence. Eight goals in his last six games, the latest a towering header to take all three points at Tottenham, Benteke is bang in form and relishing the prospect of an FA Cup semi-final. Sitting to discuss the match in a dressing room at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training complex, he looks as if he would like to be on Wembley’s turf post-haste. He has been rejuvenated under Tim Sherwood, scoring a goal every 87 minutes since the new Villa manager took over. The unnerving thing for Liverpool is that he says he will get better.

Benteke is in the kind of form which could see Tim Sherwood's Villa escape from Premier League relegation . ‘I still think I can do more, in everything,’ he insists. ‘I can’t say I’m happy to be there now, I want to do more and more.’ That insatiable appetite is understandable after a disheartening year, starved first of football, then chances. It was April 3, 2014, when a loud crack was heard across Bodymoor’s training pitches signalling Benteke’s ruptured achilles. His World Cup dream was over. Parents Jean-Pierre and Marie-Claire cancelled their tickets to Brazil. Six months of rehabilitation followed before Benteke’s return last October. A red card on his third start against Tottenham kept him out for another brief period. There was a splendid goal at Crystal Palace, then another against Manchester United. A third came against Blackpool in the FA Cup third round. Dazzlingly good, but these strikes were isolated. Benteke never appeared his barnstorming self. His movement was limited, his impact negligible. Villa’s safety-first style was a significant factor. Often Benteke looked cut adrift up front. The nadir came when Paul Lambert dropped him to the bench for the visit of Chelsea in February. ‘It was frustrating because I knew I could do better,’ he says, reflecting on that moment. ‘Every time after the game I said to myself, “I can do better”. It was frustrating to play a game with no chances. But I am not that guy who is going to complain. I understood the situation.’ Sherwood’s impact has been immediate. Just as he did with Emmanuel Adebayor at Tottenham, he has taken a misfiring striker and recalibrated the shooting. Sherwood’s tactics are tailored to Benteke and his relentless positivity has awoken the inner beast. Benteke was forced to watch Belgium reach the quarter-final of the World Cup after rupturing his achilles . Benteke praised the impact of new manager Sherwood for playing a style that suits the striker's attributes . ‘He has given me a lot of freedom and he has said to the other lads to play maybe more direct with me,’ explains Benteke. ‘When a manager says that, you feel more important, more responsible. ‘The way that we play now is comfortable for me because I’m scoring and also for the team because I help the team.’ He is excited about his partnership with Gabby Agbonlahor. ‘He helps me destroy the defenders. With two we’re always better than one.’ Benteke is grateful to Lambert for bringing him to Villa from Genk in 2012 but acknowledges it was the correct call to sack the manager. ‘That’s a tough question,’ he pauses. ‘I will say yes because the confidence of the team was a little bit low and when the gaffer came he brought the confidence up.’ Benteke believes his fitness after such a long time out was an issue too but now he feels in peak condition. ‘I play like I used to before. I feel really good.’ Those summer weeks when he could only watch his nation’s World Cup adventure on TV are becoming a distant, if difficult, memory. Benteke is delighted with the partnership he has struck up with fellow striker Gabby Agbonlahor . The striker paid tribute to former manager Paul Lambert for signing him from Genk in 2012 . ‘It was tough,’ he says. ‘I worked hard for that opportunity. But that’s life. The manager Marc Wilmots said, “If you want, you can come with the lads.” But I didn’t. I came back to Belgium and my family helped get me through. My mum said, “You have to be thankful to God, it could have been worse”.’ Becoming a father to baby Jayden last September put things in perspective. ‘It was good, I forgot about my injury,’ he says, smiling. Doubts about his talent emerged during his troubles but he has faced down critics before. Three years ago Genk dismissed his Premier League credentials. ‘They said I wasn’t ready because the level between Belgium and England is really high and I should stay one more season. But I said, “No, I am confident, I want to go”. I don’t really listen to what people say. If I feel it, I just do it. But Benteke concedes that sacking Lambert was the correct decision after the lift Sherwood has given them . Chelsea midfielder and compatriot Eden Hazard tweeted his admiration for Benteke after his Spurs winner . ‘It was my dream to play in the best league. I was a fan of Arsenal.’ He insists he is not dreaming of scoring at Wembley. ‘I don’t want a dream, I want to do it.’ He is not that close to compatriot Simon Mignolet but is good friends with Marouane Fellaini and Eden Hazard. ‘I have known them since I was really young.’ Hazard tweeted his admiration following Benteke’s goal at Spurs. ‘He is my brother, like you say. For me, he deserves to be the Player of the Year.’ Benteke will consider what he deserves in the summer. Wolfsburg have been keeping tabs on him. ‘Since I came I have had a lot of pressure here,’ he says. ‘If I want to one day, after say four or five years, be with the big club, then it is pressure every time also.’ He ultimately wants European football. That will come for Villa by reaching the final, should Arsenal also qualify. ‘I think this is the beauty of the FA Cup, now everything is possible,’ he says.","Aston Villa face Liverpool at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday .

"Bayern's shock 3-1 defeat by Porto may not have gone down well in Munich but in Manchester – the blue half at least – it will have been a different story. Pep Guardiola, whose side were outplayed in Portugal on Wednesday, remains Manchester City's first choice to replace under-fire Manuel Pellegrini. He has a year remaining on his contract in Germany but a quarter-final Champions League exit, which now seems like a real possibility, could help persuade his employers let him go this summer. Pep Guardiola saw his Bayern Munich side lose 3-1 against Porto on Wednesday night in Portugal . Guardiola is seen as a natural fit given his close relationship with two of Manchester City's executives . Guardiola, whose side were outplayed in Portugal, remains Manchester City's first choice to become manager . Manuel Pellegrini has been under pressure lately as his side fell out of the race for the Premier League title .

That would work for City. While current manager Pellegrini has a year remaining on his own deal, he has come in for fierce criticism following the stunning collapse of City's Premier League title defence and appears to be waiting for the knockout punch to land. But is Guardiola the right man for the job? The boy from Barcelona is seen as a natural fit given his close relationship with City's executive pair Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, with whom he worked during a glittering stint at the Nou Camp, and his desire to play attractive, attacking football. However, City's Abu Dhabi owners famously crave Champions League progression and, based on recent evidence, there may be some doubt as to whether Guardiola can deliver that. The 44-year-old's early record in the competition is stunning, lifting the trophy two times in three years - although he will not inherit a team featuring the likes of Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi in Manchester. And a glimpse at his away record in the knockout stages of the competition might suggest all is not as it seems. In 17 matches on the road in Europe, Guardiola's teams have won just four times, drawing eight and losing five. He has never exited before the semi-final stage but has twice bowed out to teams deemed inferior. Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in 2010 and Roberto Di Matteo's Chelsea in 2012 would both go on to win the tournament but both were rightly seen as no match for the Catalans before the ties kicked off. Guardiola has a year remaining on his contract but a quarter-final Champions League exit could be a problem . Pellegrini looks set to lose out on the Premier League title and is fighting to qualify for the Champions League . As a player . Barcelona B: Segunda Division B . Barcelona: La Liga (6), Copa del Rey (2), Supercopa de Espana (4), European Cup, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, UEFA Super Cup (2) Spain: Olympic Gold Medal . As a manager . Barcelona B: Tercera Division . Barcelona: La Liga (3), Copa del Rey (2), Supercopa de Espana (3), Champions League (2), UEFA Super Cup (2), FIFA Club World Cup (2) Bayern Munich: Bundesliga, German Cup, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup . At Bayern, where he pitched up after a year's sabbatical in 2013, the European adventures have been no better. In his first season they saw off a sleepwalking Arsenal side and David Moyes's comatose United before Real Madrid crushed them 5-0 on aggregate including that seismic 4-0 thumping at the Allianz Arena. On Wednesday, another away day defeat left Guardiola on the brink of his earliest exit yet. There may have been mitigation, with the likes of Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery missing but odds of 4-1 for a home win suggested the scale of the offence. Bayern may well turn it around next week and many would hail it as the latest of Guardiola's achievements - and there are many. In his first season at the Nou Camp, where he went from ball boy to legend, Barcelona won every competition they competed in. He lifted 14 trophies during his stint with his hometown club but when he left, while there was plenty of sadness, few did not believe it was the right decision with nemesis Mourinho polishing a first La Liga trophy in four years at the Bernabeu. At Bayern, he lifted the Bundesliga in his first season on a playing field about as level as the nearby Alps and looks set to do so again but will that be enough? Guardiola gives instructions to Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller during their Champions League defeat . Guardiola's teams have won just four times, drawing eight and losing five, in 17 matches away in Europe . If Bayern were to turn it around next week then it would be up there with Guardiola's best achievements . Would Jurgen Klopp, used to grinding out results with less talent at his disposal and suddenly available, be a better candidate? It is unlikely the powers that be at City will think so as, playing style aside, there are other reasons why Guardiola is the preferred choice. As he's shown more than once, Guardiola is not afraid to move big, ageing names on, something that would be music to the ears of the Etihad faithful. At the Nou Camp he showed the likes of Samuel Eto'o, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and none other than a certain Yaya Toure the door. His belief that reputations count for nothing, shared by another manager currently plying his trade in Manchester, could be just what City need.

"Kick It Out has welcomed the successful prosecution of a supporter who racially abused former Wales goalkeeper Jason Brown and sought to answer the player's criticism over the way the incident was handled. John Wild, from Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, was issued with a three-year banning order and ordered to carry out community service, pay compensation and cover court fees after being found guilty of racially abusing Brown while he was playing for Dartford in a Vanarama Conference fixture at Bristol Rovers last October. Brown, 32, welcomed the outcome of the case but, in doing so, also criticised a number of bodies, including Kick It Out, The Football Association and the Professional Footballers' Association, after he felt they 'did nothing about it'. Kick It Out has welcomed the successful prosecution of a supporter who racially abused Jason Brown . But Kick It Out, who work within football to promote equality and encourage inclusive practices, has responded to Brown's concerns following Wild's conviction at Bristol Magistrates Court. 'We are pleased to see the investigation undertaken by Avon and Somerset Police reach a satisfactory conclusion after Jason Brown was racially abused earlier this season,' read a Kick It Out statement, which said the organisation immediately informed the FA as soon as it was made aware of the incident. 'Paul Mortimer, Kick It Out's Professional Players Engagement Manager, met Jason on Wednesday 8 October 2014, the day after the incident, to discuss the matter in full. 'Jason gave his account of the incident and Paul clearly outlined the processes we follow when an investigation is under way, which is consistent in every case of discrimination we are involved in, throughout the meeting. 'During the discussion, Paul offered the support of Kick It Out to Jason, as we do with every complainant we are in touch with, and they both agreed to a follow-up meeting. Brown criticised Kick It Out for not doing enough to help him in his case from October last year . 'When Paul subsequently attempted to arrange a date, via phone calls and text message, to discuss with Jason how we could look to assist, Jason did not respond, nor did he to another enquiry from Kick It Out.' Kick It Out said contact was maintained with the FA 'to gain regular updates on the case' and, as the organisation has no formal investigative or regulatory powers, they work with the governing bodies on their processes and procedures, and liaise directly with the Police as and when required. 'We actively follow each complaint through to its conclusion, and if we are not satisfied with how a case is investigated, we will look to intervene,' the statement added. 'Paul's role sees him working with players from all levels of football to offer them ongoing guidance and advice, and to ensure that we are tackling issues of discrimination effectively, as a collective, across the English game. 'We will continue to push for just outcomes for all those who may be abused, and for adequate sanctions of perpetrators.' Brown, who has said in the past that the PFA and Kick It Out need to step aside and let a 'new and younger generation' combat racism, welcomed the court verdict but remained critical of the support he had received during the process. 'This is a sign of progress for everyone, not just people with colour,' Brown, who has played for Gillingham, Blackburn and Leeds, wrote on his Twitter account. 'While this progression is in society I sincerely pray and hope that these so called anti-racism (groups) will one day actually do what they say they will and support and treat every player no matter what league they are in as equals, instead of this constant lip service that they continue to provide.'

"Ben Flower was given the honour of leading Wigan's victory song after helping them to a 30-20 win over Warrington on his return from a six-month suspension. The 27-year-old Wales forward did not get among the scorers but he did enough to impress coach Shaun Wane on his first appearance since being sent off in the Warriors' Grand Final defeat by St Helens last October. 'I thought he looked a bit serious, he's not done anything for six months,' Wane said. 'I was a bit apprehensive for him but I thought he played really well - he belted a few people - and he led the song in the dressing room. Wigan Warriors forward Ben Flower takes on Warrington's Micky Higham (left) and Roy Asotasi . 'It's good to have him back. He's been vilified in the press but he's a really nice bloke.' The return of Flower dominated the build-up to the Super League derby while the half-time announcement that Sam Tomkins is returning to the club on a four-year contract made it a night to remember for Wane. 'Everything is great,' Wane said. 'It's fantastic getting these players back. We should be very proud. It's a great coup for us, it just shows we do some things right.' On the field, winger Dom Manfredi provided the highlight with his second hat-trick of tries in five days as the Warriors three times came from behind to secure a fourth win in five matches to consolidate third place in the table. Ryan Hampshire, Anthony Gelling and Liam Farrell also touched down while centre Chris Bridge scored two tries for the visitors, who had led 10-0 after 10 minutes. Flower struggles to control the ball as Warrington forward Ben Currie lines him up the for hit . 'It was a bit of tick and pass at times, which is disappointing, but I thought our attack was good,' Wane said. 'We gifted them a couple of tries with poor one-on-one misses but it was win at all costs for us and we got the win. 'Competition is driving up the skill levels and we're going to get better. We are going to put a real complete performance in soon.' The defeat leaves Warrington outside the top four but coach Tony Smith was encouraged by his side's performance. 'It was a great effort by both teams and another great game,' he said. 'We produce some of the best games between us but, at the moment, we're coming out on the wrong side of them. 'I think both coaches will be looking for some improvement in defence but some special rugby league was played. Sometimes you've just got to go 'wow', it's pretty hard to stop if they are going to go to those lengths to score tries. Dom Manfredi crosses for a Wigan try despite the attention of Toby King . 'The start of the second half really hurt us, it sapped our energy when they were throwing the ball around like a basketball. 'The second half wasn't great for us but we're heading in the right sort of directions. It takes good performances to beat us. We're much better than a few weeks ago.' Smith had mixed views on the performance of 19-year-old Declan Patton, who was making only his second appearance in Super League. 'His kicking game was sensational and I love it when he's running with the ball but he got ragged around defensively at times,' he said. 'There are some aspects of his game he needs to step up. He learned some harsh lessons there tonight but he's a good kid and will take things in his stride.'","Wigan posted a 30-20 win against Warrington on Thursday night .

"England international Sam Tomkins rejected an offer from Warrington in order to return to Wigan. The 2012 Super League Man of Steel is to cut short his stay in the NRL with New Zealand Warriors and rejoin his home-town club on a four-year contract from 2016. The announcement was made by Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan at half-time in Thursday night's First Utility Super League derby with Warrington, who were the other club after his signature once he announced he was returning to Super League. Sam Tomkins has agreed to rejoin Wigan after cutting short his stay in the NRL with New Zealand Warriors . 'Yes, I was speaking with a couple of clubs but it was always going to be between Wigan and Warrington,' Tomkins told Sky Sports News from Auckland. 'They showed a bit of interest and are successful. I thought about it but in the end the pull to go back to Wigan and play alongside my two brothers was too big. It's special playing alongside them - I've played alongside them in Super League but never together.' Tomkins, who left Wigan at the end of their 2013 Grand Final triumph, sought a release from the last 12 months of his three-year contract with the Auckland-based Warriors after becoming homesick. Wigan received a world record transfer fee, thought to be around £700,000, for Tomkins when they agreed to release him in September 2013 but retained first option to re-sign him in the event of him returning to Super League and have agreed a fee in excess of £200,000 to get him back. 'I am really happy to have this sorted and to be returning home to Wigan,' said Tomkins, who was greeted with a big cheer when he appeared on the big screen at the DW Stadium. Tomkins made 129 Super League appearances, scoring 107 tries, during his four-year stint at Wigan . 'All of my friends and family live in Wigan, a lot of them play for Wigan. It really was a no-brainer for me when I sat down and thought about things.' Tomkins, who celebrated his 26th birthday last month, becomes the third England international to rejoin Wigan in the last 12 months. Older brother Joel came back last June from a spell in rugby union with Saracens and prop forward Lee Mossop cut short his stay in the NRL with Parramatta at the end of last season. The return of Wigan's latest prodigal son was greeted with delight by home fans at the DW Stadium. Tomkins made his Wigan bow, at the age of 19, against Whitehaven in a fifth round Challenge Cup tie in May 2008, when he became the first player in rugby league history to score five tries on his first-grade debut. He went on to make 129 Super League appearances from 2009-13, in which he scored 107 tries. Thursday's announcement will signal the departure of Australian full-back Matt Bowen, who was signed as Tomkins' replacement, initially on a 12-month contract which was subsequently extended. The 26-year-old sought a release from the Warriors after becoming homesick . Tomkins, currently recovering from a knee injury, added: 'It's been a fantastic experience to test myself in the NRL but the reality is I am 13,000 miles away from my friends and family. 'When I left Wigan I always knew in my heart that I would return to play for the club one day and I am very excited at the thought of returning to the DW Stadium and pulling on that famous jersey once again. 'I have really enjoyed my time in New Zealand and can't thank everyone enough here as they have all done so much to make me feel welcome here since my arrival last year. 'My sole focus for the remainder of 2015 is to help the Warriors make the play-offs as we look to mount a serious challenge for the NRL Premiership.' Wigan coach Shaun Wane said: 'Once I heard Sam was looking to come back to England next year I knew we had to pull out all the stops to have him here. He is one of our own and a truly world-class player. 'Sam knows what we are all about here at Wigan. He understands our culture and our systems and will slot perfectly back into my squad. 'My thanks go to our chairman Ian Lenagan and rugby director Kris Radlinski who have worked tirelessly to make this happen.'","Wigan confirmed Sam Tomkins is to re-join the club during Thursday's derby against Warrington .

"The Kevin Pietersen camp have scored a comprehensive win in the PR battle with the England and Wales Cricket Board without calling on any outside assistance. It has been assumed that the way KP outplayed the ECB's army of media personnel at every turn was because his agents, Mission Sports Management, had expert help guiding their strategy. But agent Adam Wheatley, co-founder of the company with Sir Ian Botham, insists that everything has been done in-house since the brief involvement of former Sun editor David Yelland during KP's supposed reintegration into the England team in 2012. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 for Surrey in The Parks as he bids to earn a recall to the England squad . Wheatley said: 'We have just sat down together as a team with Kevin and planned the best way forward. It does help on social media that KP has a Twitter following of nearly 2.5million. 'And the ECB have totally misread the situation. You can't just keep briefing against someone. There are always two sides to a story and I think people now realise this.' Wheatley, once on the same Grimsby Town board as new ECB chairman Colin Graves, added: 'Colin's words about KP's future England chances have been interpreted in different ways but we believe there's a clean slate.' Pietersen's agents have helped him outplay the ECB without any help from outside experts . Among the many issues that the ECB must sort out when writing a job description for their new director of cricket is what exactly Andy Flower is doing to earn £300,000-a-year as technical director of elite coaching — the same amount he pocketed when in supreme control of the England team. Also, his current title does not differ a great deal from the 'director of cricket' the ECB want to appoint and could easily lead to confusion over who is responsible for what. Ridiculously, Flower was kept on by the ECB on huge money — basically as a thank you for services rendered — when there should have been a clean break after the Ashes humiliation Down Under. Andy Flower continues to earn £300,000-a-year as the ECB's technical director despite his Ashes humiliation . Test Match Special's Jonathan Agnew yesterday showed he no longer takes himself too seriously. He happily re-tweeted jibes that only four out of 100 members of the public recognised him in a poll for afternoon game show Pointless. Aggers was rather more annoyed a decade ago when Michael Vaughan admitted he didn't realise Agnew had played Test cricket. The loud music played between overs in Antigua has reinforced MCC chairman Oliver Stocken's belief that banning musical instruments from Lord's is the right approach. Insider's United secret . Tehsin Nayani, who acted as a PR spokesman for the Glazer family, has chosen the upcoming 10th anniversary of their Manchester United takeover to write a book about his six seasons as the Glazer Gatekeeper. Nayani, who remained a strange detached figure throughout his time involved with United eventually moving to Norfolk, has kept the book – more PR media study than revelationary and published on Thursday by business in sport specialists TH Media – a secret from Old Trafford. Nayani said: 'I deliberately kept a lid on it because I didn't want it authorised in any way by United. It's a personal account and I have no idea what reception it will get. ' Not great, one suspects. Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' It's understood 40-year-old Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who held up England with a dogged 46, wants to continue in Test cricket so he can play in the same West Indies side as his promising 18-year-old son Tagenarine. Father and son have already represented Guyana together. Shivnarine Chanderpaul wants to continue playing Test cricket so that he can play with his son Tagenarine . England analyst Rupert Lewis had to stay behind after play in Antigua to use the wifi in the stadium Press box because the connection was unreliable in the luxury team hotel at the Sugar Reef resort. Lewis, who did a similar job for New Zealand cricket, says his previous employers were more keen on data despite England head coach Peter Moores's perceived love of stats. Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove, the ECB representative in Antigua, prefers to stay on a boat he has chartered rather than at the team hotel. Guests on board include close friend Sir Ian Botham. Both Botham and Bransgrove hope to build houses on plots at a new golf resort complex in St Kitts — where Botham is an ambassador — designed by the same architect who planned the Ryder Cup venue Kiawah Island in South Carolina.

"With the Premier League season entering its final stretch, focus is now turning to the summer transfer window. Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from. Here are best players who are currently set to leave their Premier League clubs on a free in June. Manchester City's tenacious,  creative and versatile midfielder James Milner could leave as a free agent . Goalkeeper - Gerhard Tremmel (Swansea) At 36 years old, he is no spring chicken, but Tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side.

Swansea's Gerhard Tremmel, 36, is the understudy for Lukasz Fabianski but has done well in the cups . Right-back - Glen Johnson (Liverpool) England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup is still a regular for Liverpool, but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at Anfield this summer. Johnson, who has 54 England caps, is on a bumper deal at the Merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books.

Toure kept Cristiano Ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when Real Madrid came to Anfield in November, but the 34-year-old Ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club. Inconsistency has been Kolo Toure's curse - the 34-year-old Ivorian has produced some howlers at Liverpool . Centre-back - Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa) Vlaar performed so well at the World Cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows, especially when Thiago Silva was selected ahead of him. Injury has restricted the Dutchman to 16 appearances for Villa this season. At 30, he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams. Holland's Ron Vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the World Cup but could leave Aston Villa . Left-back - Luke Garbutt (Everton) Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal, but he is yet to put pen to paper. The 21-year-old has played nine times for Everton this year and faces a big battle to displace Leighton Baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere. Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old Luke Garbutt down for the long term but he's yet to commit . Right wing - James Milner (Manchester City) Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer, Milner has 15 years' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 England caps. Milner is both tenacious and creative, either in the centre of midfield or out wide, and he is still a year off his 30th birthday. Milner has 15 years in top flight experience, 53 England caps and still isn't 30, so a great buy for someone . Central midfield - Mikel Arteta (Arsenal) Named Arsenal captain last summer, but Arteta has not played for the Gunners since November due to injury. Hard to see him displacing the in-form Francis Coquelin on his return. May be 33, but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist. Mikel Arteta hasn't played for Arsenal since November due to injury and will need to displace Francis Coquelin . Central midfield - Tom Cleverley (Manchester United) Named captain for a tour match against Roma last summer, Cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new United manager Louis van Gaal. 'I think I'm going to be his type of player,' he said. But alas, that did not prove to be the case. The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to Aston Villa, where he has played 30 times. He is not wanted back at United. Villa and Everton are keen to sign the England international. Unwanted by Manchester United, Aston Villa and Everton want to sign England international Tom Cleverley . Left wing - Jonas Gutierrez (Newcastle) Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the Newcastle squad last month, but is no longer wanted by his club. Will be 32 in the summer, but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him. Testicular cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere, even if it isn't Newcastle . Striker - Danny Ings (Burnley) One of a number of young English strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for Burnley this season. Rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United and their neighbours City, as well as David Moyes' Real Sociedad. Manchester United and City are said to be interested in Burnley's dangerous striker Danny Ings . Striker - James Wilson (Manchester United) Promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under Ryan Giggs against Hull. The 19-year-old has played 16 times under Van Gaal, but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close, the United academy product is yet to agree terms. James Wilson, 19, has played 16 times under Louis van Gaal but is now struggling to get on the bench .","Swansea's Gerhard Tremmel in goal behind the Free Agents' 4-4-2 .

"Former Queens Park Rangers chairman Gianni Paladini has registered as a director of a new Bradford City holding company in what appears to be the first move towards taking control at Valley Parade. Paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left Loftus Road in 2011 and has attempted to buy Birmingham City from Carson Yeung. The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford, a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford . Bradford's most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea . Phil Parkinson’s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter-final replay at Reading. Those FA Cup exploits came against a backdrop of colourful and passionate support. They took 8,000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club’s enormous potential, having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn, with the help of Parkinson’s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City (Holdings) Limited, set up in February. The company was originally set up with Paladini and Mauro Milanese named as directors but Milanese’s name has been removed. Paladini has previously made an attempt to buy Birmingham from Carson Yeung (pictured) Milanese is a former centre half who played for several Italian clubs and had one year at QPR during a long playing career and briefly managed Leyton Orient last year. Paladini’s ambitions to return to football are well documented. As well as trying to buy Birmingham, he has been linked possible takeovers at Millwall and Reading. Bradford were beaten 6-0 at home by Bristol City on Tuesday, which confirmed Bristol City’s promotion to the Championship and virtually ended Bradford’s hopes of capping an incredible season by reaching the play-offs. Paladini spent eight years at QPR, seizing control after a complicated takeover in 2003 and attracting investment from billionaires Lakshmi Mittal and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. He left his role at Loftus Road in 2011 following the takeover by Tony Fernandes.","Gianni Paladini has registered as director of Bradford's holding company .

"Nigel Pearson has revealed he has turned to former manager Howard Wilkinson to help Leicester's survival bid. The Foxes boss has taken advice from Wilkinson, who he played under at Sheffield Wednesday, as Leicester battle the drop. They host Swansea on Saturday looking for a third straight win and will escape the drop zone for the first time since November if Burnley fail to win at Everton and they beat Swansea by three goals. Nigel Pearson's Foxes have beaten West Ham and West Brom in their last two games . Pearson has come under the spotlight this season after a foul-mouthed spat with a fan and a bizarre touchline altercation with Crystal Palace's James McArthur. Wilkinson, who won the First Division title with Leeds in 1992, had been a mentor for Pearson before this season and he has spoken to the ex-England caretaker manager for advice. Pearson said: 'On a professional level I have one or two people I speak to if there's something I need a bit of feedback on. Howard Wilkinson is one. 'I have a lot of respect for people I have worked with. I have friends and family I speak to, my wife remains a very important person for me in terms of getting a balanced view on life. Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner to improve his side's slim chance of Premier League survival . 'I have a lot of very good friends and colleagues at Leicester and the good thing about how we work is we're all doing a job in preparing the players but the coaches do stretch themselves as well.' The Foxes have beaten West Ham and West Brom in their last two games and still have to play relegation rivals Sunderland, Burnley and QPR. But Pearson, who has a fully fit squad, wants complete focus on the Swans as they bid to become only the third team to survive in the Barclays Premier League after being bottom at Christmas. Leicester's Andrej Kramaric (right) and Robert Huth go through their paces at training on Thursday . He said: 'It is important for us now that the players, and everyone else at the club, stay very much focused on now what is a seven-game season. 'Yes, there are lots of positives, especially getting six points, but we have still got an awful lot to do, and that is why there is no room for us to take any other stance than that. 'I know we have had our critics, but I have been very proud of how the players have coped with the setbacks they have had.'","Leicester are currently bottom of the Premier League standings .

"Winger Dom Manfredi stole the limelight from Ben Flower and Sam Tomkins as Wigan thrilled a 14,175 crowd at the DW Stadium with an exciting 30-20 win over Warrington. Most eyes before kick-off were on Welsh international Flower as he prepared to make his return from a six-month suspension imposed for punching Lance Hohaia in October's Grand Final defeat by St Helens. And the Wigan fans were delighted at half-time when the club announced the re-signing of Tomkins on a four-year deal from New Zealand Warriors, starting next season. Wigan winger Dom Manfredi scored a hat-trick for the second time in five days . All eyes were on Ben Flower on Thursday night as he made his return from a six-month ban after being sent off for punching Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of Wigan's Grand Final defeat by St Helens last October. RECEPTION: Flower's name was greeted with huge cheers when the team announcement was made 10 minutes before kick-off and there was a deafening roar 23 minutes into the match when he made his entrance, with Wigan fans on their feet for a standing ovation. PERFORMANCE: The Welshman came up with a knock-on four minutes into his return and clearly looked rusty after his lengthy lay-off. He produced some strong charges, however, and did his fair share of tackling before taking a breather after 32 minutes. Flower later returned for the last four minutes, by which time his side were firmly in charge. OVERALL: A steady if unspectacular return for the former Crusaders front rower in a match dominated by the tryscoring prowess of his young outside back team-mates. Unsurprisingly rusty at times, he will be better for his 36-minute contribution, made in two spells. By the end of a pulsating derby, however, it was the name of 21-year-old Manfredi which was on most people's lips after he scored a second hat-trick in five days. Manfredi had touched down three times in Wigan's 34-0 win over Catalans Dragons on Sunday and he once more demonstrated his exceptional ability to finish off the Wolves after they had taken the lead for a third time early in the second half. Warrington could hardly have made a better start, scoring two tries inside the first 10 minutes as they monopolised the early play. Skipper Joel Monaghan had gone close in the opening moments after gathering Richie Myler's high kick to the corner and he enjoyed an unopposed run-in after taking Stefan Ratchford's cut-out pass to open the scoring. Ratchford added the touchline conversion and the visitors increased their lead when Chris Bridge went through the attempted tackle of his opposite number Dan Sarginson for the first of his two tries. Wigan barely had touched the ball at that stage but they quickly demonstrated their attacking flair with two superbly-crafted touchdowns. Stand-off George Williams came up with a break for the first but it was a magnificent final pass from winger Joe Burgess that enabled England second rower Liam Farrell to finish off the move . Ben Flower (centre) returned to action after serving six-month ban for punching Lance Hohaia . Moments later Sydney-bound Burgess was again the provider as full-back Ryan Hampshire, making amends for the first of two bad handling errors, went over for the Warriors' second try, with Matty Smith's second goal edging his side in front. That was the signal for Wigan coach Shaun Wane to reintroduce Flower but there was little scope for the forwards to get into the action as the outside backs continued to dominate. The lead changed hands twice more before half-time, with Bridge going through Sarginson for his second try - only for Manfredi to cancel it out by taking advantage of some outrageous offloads from Anthony Gelling and Joel Tomkins to score his first. Forward Flower enjoyed a low key return as the Wigan backs ran Warrington ragged in the second half . Leading 16-14 at the break, the highly-impressive Gelling twice took the wrong option as Wigan were the first to attack in the second half and the misses began to look costly when when Warrington second rower Ben Currie sliced through the home defence for his side's fourth try to put them back in front. Wigan were not to be denied, however, and Manfredi went over twice in eight minutes to complete his hat-trick and apply the finishing touches to a splendid victory. The hosts produced some quick hands to get him over on 61 minutes but it needed a huge slice of good fortune for him to complete his hat-trick, with Smith's drop-goal attempt charged down and falling nicely for the big winger after Gelling had instinctively put his boot to the loose ball.","Wigan winger Dom Manfredi scored a hat-trick of tries on Thursday night .

"West Ham striker Diafra Sakho is out for the remainder of the season after tearing a thigh muscle on Saturday against Stoke City. The 25-year-old is West Ham's runaway top scorer this season with 12 goals and was forced off after 59 minutes during their 1-1 draw at home. West Ham claimed Sakho could return 'before the end of the season' on their official website, but it appears unlikely the Senegal international will be fit enough to feature before the next campaign. West Ham striker Diafra Sakho limps off against Stoke City after 59 minutes to be replaced by Carlton Cole . The West Ham striker has scored 12 goals this season but is set to miss the rest of the campaign . Ten of Sakho's 12 goals came in the Barclays Premier League, with Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing the club's next top scorers with just five apiece. It comes as a blow for manager Sam Allardyce who is aiming to finish in eighth position as he fights for a new contract with West Ham. Allardyce's current deal expires at the end of the season and it is not certain co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan will keep him on, despite already beating last season's total by three points.

"Gareth Bale was verbally abused by supporters outside Real Madrid's training ground and slaughtered by Spanish media as he was blamed for the goalless draw in the Champions League. Almost a month after the world's most expensive footballer's white Bentley was attacked by fans at the Valdebebas base, Bale met more angry supporters following their 0-0 stalemate with Atletico Madrid. The £86million signing was singled out by those waiting for the players to leave the training base early on Wednesday morning, as they labelled his performance lazy and told him to 'run more'. Scroll down for video . Gareth Bale was verbally abused by supporters outside the club's training ground on Wednesday morning . It came almost a month after the world's most expensive footballer's white Bentley was attacked by fans . Bale has become a scapegoat for the club and was slaughtered by Spanish media after his one-on-one miss . It comes after Marca gave Bale just five out of 10 while AS awarded him one star, as Spanish media tore into the Welshman following his one-on-one miss at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday night. Bale could have given the visitors the lead early on as he only had relatively untried goalkeeper Jan Oblak to beat, but scuppered the opportunity. Even the club's captain and  goalkeeper Iker Casillas admitted Bale's miss was costly. 'It's difficult to assimilate that in seven games against Atletico we didn't win one,' said Casillas. 'If Gareth Bale scores it is a different game to what we saw. But then it was a great save.' As well as giving him poor ratings, Marca went one further by publishing a separate damning analysis of Bale, in which they write he should have 'kept his cool' and has a 'mental block'.

"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain may face the heartache of missing the climax of Arsenal's season for the second successive year. Oxlade-Chamberlain is struggling to recover from a groin problem and has been ruled out of the FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger hopes he could be back in full training by the end of next week but is not certain and admits the England midfielder may not play again this season. Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain could miss the remainder of the season with a groin injury . Manager Arsene Wenger confirmed Oxlade-Chamberlain would definitely not face Reading in the FA Cup . 'It is in the balance,' said Wenger. 'The inflammation has not completely cleared. He is on the way, building up and he might join in next week in full training and then we see. He is at least two weeks away.' Oxlade-Chamberlain has endured bad fortune with injuries, missing the final month of last season, including the FA Cup final when Arsenal lifted their first trophy in nine years. He returned to be selected for England's World Cup squad but injured a knee in a warm-up game and did not feature in the finals. And he has not played for more than five weeks since he came off injured during the FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United.

"Police have issued a warrant for the arrest of a woman charged with bestiality after police found footage on her mobile phone of her allegedly having sex with a dog. Jenna Louise Driscoll, 25, was due to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday on seven charges of supplying or trafficking drugs, one charge of unlawful wounding and three charges of bestiality with her dog. Jenna Louise Driscoll was charged last year with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug. She was remanded on bail to appear at the court last week, and did not show, and again on Monday for the matters to he heard. After her second fail to appear, police issued an arrest warrant. Jenna Louise Driscoll has been charged with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug and unlawful wounding . The 25-year-old returned home with an unidentified man and a dog last October and was remanded to appear in court on April 13, but failed to show prompting police to issue a warrant . Police were carrying out checks on Driscoll's phone for suspected drug trafficking when they discovered the three videos which allegedly show her having sex with a dog . Driscoll was due to appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday but didn't show up and is now wanted by police on seven drug charges, one of unlawful wounding and three charges of bestiality with her dog . Following her court appearance last October, the 25-year-old was pictured arriving home  accompanied by an unidentified man and a pet dog. The dog,  believed to be a pitbull terrier, climbed the stairs to Driscoll's cream coloured residence, where neighbours say she has lived for some time. Driscoll entered her house and remained for a very short amount of time, before leaving with the man in the sedan. The charges laid against Driscoll came when police had earlier carried out checks on her phone for suspected drug trafficking and discovered the three videos. ‘This isn’t something you’d normally expect, it’s quite unusual. The last case I can recall was a few years ago, it certainly isn’t something we hear reported often,' said Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland. ‘Under the Animal Care Protection Act bestiality isn’t included. To take action and remove the dog we would have to prove actions there were cruel or that it was tormented.’ ‘The RSPCA would ideally like to get a dog out of the situation if bestiality was happening, but to operate under the act we would have to prove those two things.’ ‘We’d try to do everything we can to help the dog if that is the case.’ Driscoll was also charged with two counts of possession of an item used in the commission of a crime and three counts of supplying. She was granted bail but will have to report to police once a week and live at an apartment at Enoggera, south-west of Brisbane. Police prosecutor Sergeant Scott Pearson said Driscoll had allegedly been dealing cannabis to friends. Text messages showed that Driscoll had arranged for 113 grams of the drug to be sold for $1,150 and on another occasion 85 grams for $900, according to Sgt Pearson. It was when police were investigating the text messages they located the videos of Driscoll allegedly having sex with the dog.

"Jockey Aidan Coleman is hoping he has received the call up for the ride that will finally help him banish his Crabbie's Grand National blues at Aintree on Saturday. The 26-year-old rides well-backed The Druids Nephew, stepping in for broken leg victim Barry Geraghty on the Neil Mulholland-trained gelding which won on the opening day of last month's Cheltenham Festival. The eight-year-old is a 12-1 shot for the £1million steeplechase but Coleman knows more than most how fickle fortune can be in the biggest steeplechase in the world. Jockey Aidan Coleman (left) exits the weighing room at Haydock racecourse back in April earlier this year . The Druids Nephew ridden by Barry Geraghty clears the last jump during Day One of Cheltenham 2015 . As a 20-year-old, Coleman chose to ride seventh fence faller Stan, a disappointment turned into a calamity at the time because he had decided against partnering successful Venetia Williams-trained stablemate Mon Mome who lifted the prize at 100-1 with stand-in rider Liam Treadwell basking in glory. It was the only time in three National runs for Mon Mome that Coleman had not ridden the gelding. Coleman's two latest rides in the race have seen him unseated from a hampered The Rainbow Hunter. Coleman said: 'The Mom Mome incident was quite a blow at the time because I had a choice (of mounts) and picked the wrong one. I rode him the year before and the year afterwards, I just wasn't on him on the right day but that is just the way it goes. 'Sometimes you are ahead and sometimes you are behind – that is life in general. 'At the time I was 20, very young in life as well as racing. It was probably the first negative thing to happen in my career. 'Up until then I had never been injured, I had ridden out my claim in 14 months and was champion conditional. Since then there have been lots of good days and lots of bad days, so you become more streetwise and thicker skinned. 'I didn't had the best of luck on The Rainbow Hunter. He jumped well both times but ran into traffic problems and was more of less brought down last year. 'There is an element of luck required in any race but that applies more with the National because of the nature of the fences and the distance.' Coleman, who has enjoyed success over the famous fences in other races, feels The Druids Nephew has the right credential given that slice of Aintree luck which has so far eluded him. The jockey who hopes to be a contender for champion jockey after AP McCoy retires, added: 'It is definitely one of the best rides to pick up. Phil Smith, the chief handicapper, says he is the best handicapped horse in the race. 'The race should suit this horse. He seems quite hardy. He handled the hustle and bustle of the Cheltenham Festival and came out a very nice winner. That should stand him in good stead as far as the Aintree experience goes.'

"West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce believes his squad are unable to deal with the rigours of a full Barclays Premier League season after they dropped points by conceding late against Stoke City. Allardyce’s contract expires at the end of the season but he feels his work at Upton Park is far from done and wants to oversee the development of a squad lacking in top-flight experience. The West Ham starting XI on Saturday included six summer signings with Carl Jenkinson and Alex Song the only ones to have played in the Premier League before. Sam Allardyce believes his squad are unable to deal with the rigours of a full Premier League season . Allardyce’s contract expires at the end of the season but he feels his work at Upton Park is far from done . Marko Arnautovic scored a 95th-minute equaliser to once again see West Ham lose points late on in a game .

Unused subs: Butland, Bardsley, Sidwell, Crouch. Booked: Pieters . Manager: Mark Hughes 6.5. Referee: Roger East 7. Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic. Attendance: 34,946. Much like their season as a whole, the Hammers started strongly against Stoke before wasting their efforts with a lack of concentration late on. ‘The early part of the season is about the players achieving great heights,’ Allardyce said. ‘I think that as the squad has found at this stage they’re finding the nitty gritty of the Premier League and that is the physical and mental fatigue that they’ve not experienced. ‘I talk about Aaron Cresswell, I could talk about Carl Jenkinson. All of a sudden it’s week after week, pressure after pressure, performance after performance. Our new players from abroad, Cheikhou (Kouyate), (Diafra) Sakho, (Enner) Valencia, have all done brilliant but they’re feeling the pace a little bit. 'Next season they'll be better, they'll be more experienced, they'll be more able to cope than they have been this season.' Among the new arrivals on Saturday was former Ipswich Town left back Cresswell, who scored with a brilliant free-kick before Marko Arnautovic’s 95th-minute equaliser. West Ham had dominated early on and Cresswell’s curling effort left goalkeeper Asmir Begovic flummoxed to open the scoring. West Ham had dominated early on and Aaron Cresswell’s curling effort from a free-kick gave them the lead . Diafra Sakho is among those said to be struggling with the tail end of the season, and he limped off . But Stoke grew into the game as the home side waned and Arnautovic had two goals ruled out for offside either side of Mame Biram Diouf hitting the inside of the post with a header. The fired-up Austrian wasn’t to be denied though and he eventually shot across Adrian’s goal and into the corner with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end. It was a familiar scene for the home support whose reaction at the final whistle indicated that they do not see Allardyce as the man in charge as this inexperienced side grows. SUPER STAT: West Ham have lost more points from goals scored in the 90th minute or later this season (seven) than any other Premier League team.

Got an easy ride during the game, though, as the overmatched Vlad Chiriches bore the brunt of the home crowd's frustration before he was hooked in the 78th minute. Gave the Villa fans a wave after they asked for one in the 16th minute. Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches (left) bore the brunt of the home fans' dismay against Villa . TOUCHLINE BEHAVIOUR . The bright spring day in N17 allowed to him leave his gillet indoors so there were no flying jackets this time. He did not leave his seat until the eighth minute then remained standing for the most part. Little more than a subtle fist pump when Christian Benteke scored what proved to be the winner but his emotions poured out at the final whistle.

Did not even acknowledge Sanchez as he meandered down the following his stoppage time red card. TACTICS . Like he did here with Emmanuel Adebayor, Sherwood has shown once again that he knows how to get a striker scoring. Christian Benteke, who fronted a three-pronged attack, scored the winner before the manager set his side up perfectly to deal with the second half Spurs fight back, although it never seemed to come. Benteke points to the sky in celebration after hitting the back of the net for Villa at Tottenham . Sherwood has helped Belgium striker Benteke rediscover his scoring form since taking over . VERDICT . Low-key return for Sherwood who nailed the game plan and left with three precious points for his side. Looks a different, more relaxed man to the one who could be spotted in the home technical area here during the second half of last season.

"Swansea manager Garry Monk says he will listen to Michu before deciding whether the Spaniard has a future at the Liberty Stadium. The once-capped Spain striker has spent a frustrating season on loan at Napoli where injury has seen him make just five appearances for Rafa Bentitez's Serie A giants. Michu scored 22 goals in his first season at Swansea after signing from Rayo Vallecano for £2.2million in July 2012 and broke into the Spain squad, but two injury-riddled campaigns since have raised doubts about his future in south Wales. Garry Monk will hold talks with Michu, pictured in 2013, before making decision on Spaniard's future . Michu recently said he did not know whether he would be returning to Swansea after his spell at Napoli . The 29-year-old told Spanish newspaper Marca last week he did not know whether he would be returning to Swansea this summer to see out the final year of his contract - and Monk was also giving few clues when the subject was raised ahead of Everton's Barclays Premier League visit on Saturday. 'I'm sure we will make contact with Michu before the end of season,' Monk said. 'But we'll let his season finish and our season finish before we sit down at some point to discuss the future. 'I know he's had a difficult time with injury and his concentration right now is on getting back to fitness. 'He'll want to finish the season off strong there and I'll speak to him in the summer. 'I'll get his side of things and where he wants to take his future and I'll assess it from my side as well.' Monk has been keeping a close eye on Michu during the Spaniard's loan spell at Italian outfit Napoli . Michu scored only twice in the Premier League last season before joining Napoli and Monk made it clear that the player was determined to head to Italy. 'I had a good discussion with him last summer and this was the way he wanted to go with Napoli,' Monk said. 'But he's coming back to full fitness now and hopefully he will have a good end to the season there. 'I've got a good relationship with Michu, we were team-mates before I became manager, and I was fine with how he wanted to go. 'I've kept an eye on him and it's our duty as a club to understand what's exactly going on with Michu on a game to game basis. 'He hasn't had a sustained period where he's been fit and it's always hard as a player when that happens. 'He's been unfortunate, but if he get can a sustained period of fitness I'm sure you'll see the quality we've seen here.' Monk has heaped praise on Bafetimbi Gomis following the striker's recent fine goalscoring form . One player who has been fit and firing, however, is French striker Bafetimbi Gomis who has scored three goals in his last two appearances as Swansea have recorded back-to-back wins over Aston Villa and Hull to move within a single point of their best Premier League haul with seven games still remaining. Gomis had a difficult first half to the season playing second fiddle to Wilfried Bony but the Ivorian's initial £25million sale to Manchester City has seen him become the club's first-choice striker and he has grasped the opportunity in recent weeks. 'When Wilfried left and he was starting games Bafe was probably too eager to do well,' Monk said. 'His effort and commitment have always been great but he was trying too hard to score goals. 'He's kept that effort and commitment but he's probably more relaxed now, he's showing his composure in games now and that is vitally important.'","Michu has made just five appearances since joining Napoli on loan deal .

Fernando Torres scored his first ever league own goal as Atletico Madrid limped to a 2-2 La Liga draw against Malaga on Saturday. The Spanish striker inadvertently headed a corner at the near post over his own line to pull Malaga back into the game before half-time. Torres has found goals difficult to come by since his January return to the Vicente Calderon and has scored just four times for Diego Simeone's side. Fernando Torres (centre) scored his first ever league own goal during Atletico Madrid's 2-2 draw with Malaga . The Malaga players celebrate Torres' own goal which pulled the visitors level just before half-time . Atletico were gifted the opening goal as Malaga keeper Carlos Kameni flapped at a long throw by Jesus Gamez and it was left for Antoinne Griezmann to simply knock the ball over the line from close range. Malaga caused little threat in a cagey first half but were given a helping hand by Torres who headed past Jan Oblak. The game opened up in the second half and Malaga midfielder Samu delicately chipped the ball over Oblak with 20 minutes left. Griezmann came to the rescue with his second of the game after 77 minutes to earn the champions a 2-2 draw which sees Simeone's side remain in third place.

"Cristiano Ronaldo is to give Real Madrid a timely boost after his yellow card against Rayo Vallecano - which would have seen him suspended -  was rescinded.

"Swansea manager Garry Monk believes a strong finish will put a different slant on Everton's season - but he is determined to stop his former manager Roberto Martinez profiting at his old Liberty Stadium stomping ground on Saturday. Martinez was lauded by Everton fans last season as the club qualified for Europe with a fifth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League. But the going has been a lot tougher for the Spaniard in his second season on Merseyside with Everton having only removed the spectre of relegation by winning their last three matches. Garry Monk wants Swansea to continue their own impressive form with victory over Everton on Saturday . Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) scored twice for Swansea in their 3-1 victory over Hull last weekend . Ki Sung-Yueng (second right) also got on the scoresheet as Swansea maintained their impressive form . Vandals even defaced the outside of Goodison Park with 'Martinez Out' and 'Not Good Enough' sprayed on the wall of a stand in white paint, but Monk insists that is simply a part of modern-day football when results do not go your way. 'I always say you're only a few games away from being great or rubbish,' Monk said. 'Roberto is a good manager, but sometimes you have good periods and sometimes you have bad ones. 'It's just making sure you come through them and he's won the last three games, they're back on the up and he'll want to finish the season strongly. 'Of course they'd want to be pushing further up the league and it's not a position you'd associate with Everton. 'But if they can get back up to finish positively it will put a different twist on the season.' Everton have had to balance their domestic commitments with a demanding Europa League campaign which saw them knocked out at the round-of-16 stage last month. And Monk knows from Swansea being in the competition last season how much that has an impact on Premier League performances and results. 'Europe is tough, the travelling and constant games in certain periods,' Monk said. 'It all adds up and the intensity of the football at this level takes it out of you and takes its toll. 'Whether it (Everton's results) is all down to that I don't know, but it does play a major part and if you look at the teams who have played in the Europa League, including ourselves, it has had an impact.' Swansea have never beaten Everton in the league but they claimed a point at Goodison Park in November after being reduced to 10 men following Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal. Martinez criticised Swansea's 'strange' tactics and style of play that day but Monk put it down to 'more frustration with his own side and not winning the game'. Roberto Martinez is hoping to continue Everton's form against his former team in the Premier League . Monk (right) holds no ill feeling towards Martinez, despite him criticising Swansea after defeat in November . 'It might have been a game they'd targeted to win and when it doesn't happen as a manager you do get frustrated,' said Monk, who knows victory will take Swansea past their previous best Premier League points total of 47. 'That's what it boiled down to. But we did well, we had Jonjo sent off so we were never going to go gung-ho and we got a good point. 'We did well in the circumstances and now we want to go one better and get all three.'","Everton have won their last three games and visit Swansea on Saturday .

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first free-kick in 57 attempts to send Real Madrid on their way to a 3-0 victory over Eibar. It was his 38th league goal of the season and with Manchester United loanee Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez scoring a second this was another win that Real Madrid had wrapped up before half time as they continue their pursuit of leaders Barcelona. Ronaldo had not scored a free-kick since last March but when Luka Modric was fouled 25-yards out in a central position midway through the first half, he dipped a free-kick through the Eibar wall that bounced just in front of Xabier Irureta. Cristiano Ronaldo (right) puts Real Madrid into a 1-0 lead against Eibar with a 21st minute free-kick . Before the strike against Eibar, Ronaldo hadn't scored a La Liga free-kick in over a year .

Booked: Arruabarrena, Rosello, Boateng . Ref: Alejandro Jose Hernandez . Att: 73,965 . The Eibar goalkeeper was already travelling to his right and when the ball spun like an off-break to the keeper’s left he was left floundering at his near post as the ball crossed the line. Despite his recent poor conversion rate from free-kicks, Madrid’s goal machine has now scored 16 goals from direct set-pieces – only Roberto Carlos can match that in the last 20 years in Spain. Real Madrid were up against La Liga’s smallest club who were playing a league game at the Bernabeu for the first time in their history. Madrid had Keylor Navas making only his ninth start of the season for the rested Iker Casillas but he was seeing little more of the action that he usually does from the bench in a one-sided first half. Real could have gone ahead after 16 minutes when Ronaldo tried but failed to make contact with an Alvaro Arbeloa cross with an ambitious bicycle kick. The rebound came out to Asier Illaramendi but he hit his shot wide. Ronaldo then forced a corner with a blocked shot and from it Real managed to hit the crossbar, both posts, and had a goal ruled out for offside all inside 10 seconds. Ronaldo flicked the corner kick on to Sergio Ramos who hit the bar with a header. The ball rebounded to Isco whose shot hit one post, rolled along the line and hit the other, before coming out to Hernandez. In the team ahead of the rested Karim Benzema, he scored, but from an offside position. Javier Hernandez made the most of a rare start for Madrid by doubling Madrid's lead in the 31st minute . Hernandez watches on as his header beats Eibar goalkeeper Xabier Irureta (left) It was impossible to come any closer and sure enough Real Madrid scored with their next chance as Ronaldo rammed home that set-piece. He should have doubled the lead a minute later but just failed to reach Hernandez’ cross. Manchester United’s on-loan Mexican has become increasingly frustrated by his lack of chances in Spain. He will not stay beyond this summer but there will be no shortage of clubs interested in a forward whose strike rate is comfortably inside one goal a game. On 31 minutes Arbeloa crossed and he angled a clever and powerful header home to make it 2-0. It was his first goal in the Bernabeu and his fifth for the club. The Manchester United loanee striker celebrates just his fifth goal in Los Blancos colours . The Madrid players celebrate Hernandez's header during the 3-0 victory against La Liga minnows Eibar . Just before half time Marcelo drove forward and laid the ball off to Ronaldo in space. His fierce low shot forced a fine save from Irureta who had performed well since flapping at that spinning Ronaldo free-kick. Real coasted through the second half. They were able to withdraw Modric, Ramos and Marcelo on the hour with thoughts already turning towards Tuesday’s Madrid derby Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid. It was a gamble to make all three changes so early despite the 2-0 advantage and Carlo Ancelotti almost paid for it when on 70 minutes Federico Piovaccari clattered into Pepe who in-turn fell into keeper Navas. Both the keeper and Pepe, who had come on for Ramos, needed treatment but were able to continue. Gareth Bale will also be back for Tuesday’s Champions League first leg. He sat this one out as a precaution after taking a knock on the thigh in midweek. Madrid coped without him and his replacement Jese who scored the third on 83 minutes. He was quiet throughout in Bale’s right wing position but showed strength and skill to work an opening on the right hand edge of the penalty area before burying a shot in Irureta’s far corner.

"Iker Casillas has described the constant attention surrounding his status as Real Madrid's No 1 as 'morbid' after keeping a clean sheet against Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday.

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche has told striker Danny Ings to keep on smiling - and the goals will return. The relegation-battling Clarets have struggled for goals in recent weeks, despite some gritty performances, scoring just once in six games. The hotly-rated Ings, whose future beyond the end of the season has been the subject of considerable speculation, has not found the net in seven appearances. Danny Ings has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks as he looks to try and fire Burnley to safety . Dyche hopes the barren spell is not weighing too heavily on the 23-year-old's mind and has urged him to focus on enjoying his game. Dyche said: 'He's a bright young lad. He's a very good player and a good young lad who is grounded. 'But you can't actually get inside someone. When that whistle blows it's down to them to remind themselves of that freedom I speak about. I want players to play that way. 'His biggest thing is he puts a lot of demand on himself - and that can be a weakness as well as a strength. It's good that he has a thirst to improve, as do a lot of the players. But it has to be balanced with that enjoyment. Sean Dyche is confident that if Ings starts to enjoy playing more, then the goals will flow for the striker . 'I often say to him, play with a smile and I've told him he's best when he does. We're looking to him to continue doing that.' Burnley's battling performances have earned plaudits and despite the lack of goals, they have collected five points from a tough run of eight games. Amid that run they have beaten Manchester City and taken points off Chelsea and Tottenham. They are in the bottom three but just two points from safety and Dyche is backing his forwards to come good again. He said: 'There's certainly not pressure (on the strikers) from me. We ventured down this road early season when the goals didn't come as freely then we had a good patch over the Christmas period. 'We have scored goals and been productive in front of goal. It's about reminding the players what it takes to do that, different ways of doing that and how we can affect games.' The 23-year-old has had an impressive season nonetheless, scoring nine goals in his debut top-flight year . Ashley Barnes (right) says he's forgotten about the Nemanja Matic incident and moved on . Striker Ashley Barnes insists confidence remains high among the group. Barnes said: 'We are in this together. We are striving for one thing - to stay in this league come the end of the season.

Barnes has found himself in the spotlight of late following his controversial tackle on Chelsea's Nemanja Matic. The 25-year-old escaped punishment but Matic was sent off for his reaction to the challenge in a heated confrontation. Barnes says that incident is now behind him. 'It has gone,' he said. 'I moved on a while back. I am just concentrating on staying in this league.'","Sean Dyche says Danny Ings needs to smile and the goals will come .

"Jimmy Anderson has been motivated to play 100 Tests for England by the bitter memories of being marginalised in the early stages of his outstanding career.

I didn’t know if I’d ever play again. 'Those were the low periods but I had experienced Test cricket and seen how amazing it was and that determination to play again has driven me on.

"DOWNTON'S EXIT . We were told by Mooresey [coach Peter Moores] that Paul had been let go between sessions in the practice game against Saint Kitts. I think Mooresey had only just found out himself. You see it when football clubs get taken over; you tend to see different people brought in for key positions. Paul was a lovely guy and I feel sorry he’s lost his job but when you get new people in, changes always happen. There have been a few names bandied around and I think Straussy [Andrew Strauss] was considered last time the role came up a year ago, but he didn’t particularly fancy it. He’s certainly a very good man, but it’s hard to know who would be a good candidate until we know more about what the job role is. But Strauss, Michael Vaughan and Alec Stewart are all former England captains who would all bring their own experience and knowledge to the role. Stuart Broad admits he was sorry to see Paul Downton leave his role in the ECB . Downton (centre) was sacked as ECB managing director after a dismal World Cup this year . ALASTAIR COOK . He seems in a really happy place and excited to be back around the group. He’d be the last person to make too much of a fuss about a hundred in a warm-up game but I’d back him to score big runs in this series — he looks refreshed and ready to go. PLAYER POWER . It’s incredibly important that all the players feel they can contribute and speak up when they need to. That can be quite a scary thing but you only get better as a group when you do that. I did an Adidas event with Harlequins winger Ugo Monye and he was saying how player-led they were at the club. During the World Cup we didn’t talk enough as players and the guys weren’t speaking up as much as they needed to. We needed more edge and hopefully bringing guys like Cooky and Trotty [Jonathan Trott] back into the group will help that. Broad has backed Alastair Cook to score big runs during the series in the Caribbean . Captain Cook scored a century during a warm-up game against St Kitts & Nevis . RICHIE BENAUD . I used to watch videos of my dad playing in the 1986-87 Ashes series and I’ll always remember Richie’s commentary on that. He had this way of sounding as if he was reciting commentary when he was commentating and making it relaxing and peaceful to listen to. I don’t think there’ll be anyone in the cricket world who won’t be touched by his passing. His voice symbolised cricket and we’ll all miss him. JIMMY ANDERSON . He’s one of my best mates and we’ve played a lot of cricket together. He’s taught me a huge amount and guided me through my international career. I think we’re third behind Waqar [Younis] and Wasim [Akram] and Curtly [Ambrose] and Courtney [Walsh] as a pairing and that comes from us complementing each other’s styles and constant communication. It would a phenomenal achievement for him to become England’s leading wicket taker. Broad says that he and Jimmy Anderson are best mates and admits he has guided him through his career . Broad says it will be a great achievement for Jimmy Anderson to become England's leading wicket taker . FITNESS . Twisting my ankle in the warm-up game was a bit of a scare, but it feels fine now. There was a burning feeling for a minute or so after it happened and I was pretty worried. It’s still bit stiff in the morning but fingers crossed it will be OK. ANTIGUA TRACK . They’re generally pretty flat out here now and I think fans can expect some fairly attritional cricket for the first few days before things speed up a bit. We’ve been practising our slip catching low down by our ankles because we’re not expecting a lot of carry. I think the team that wins the series will be the one that shows most patience and gets the best out of reverse swing.

"Moeen Ali says he is ready to take on Australia’s two left-arm Mitchells in the Ashes – and has overcome the problems he had against the short ball during his introduction to Test cricket last summer. Moeen is planning to join up with the England squad ahead of the second Test in the Caribbean, starting in Grenada on April 21 – having recovered more quickly from a rib injury than anyone expected. And he intends to put to good use the experience gained during the World Cup, where he averaged 38 with a strike-rate of 105 – one of the few glimmers of light in an otherwise benighted tournament for England. Moeen Ali will join up with England ahead of their second West Indies Test after recovering quicker than expected form a rib injury . Moeen's performance in the World Cup was a glimmer of light in a disappointing tournament for England . When the Ashes get going on July 8 Australia will undoubtedly bombard Moeen with bouncers after he found a variety of ways to get out to the short ball against Sri Lanka and India last year – with Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc ready to unleash merry hell. But Moeen, who was recently named one of Wisden’s Five Cricketers of the Year, said: ‘It was something I was working on at the World Cup in Australia. And now I’ve tasted a bit of Johnson and Starc and these guys, I feel I’m much more ready than I was last year. It was good for me to see that I can handle that kind of bowling. ‘I probably thought about the short ball too much in the end, and forgot about the rest of my batting. So I’ve learned from that now, and hopefully I won’t ever do that again.’ Moeen struggled with the short delivery against Sri Lanka and India (pictured) last year . And for those who have not yet erased from their memories Johnson’s demolition job on England’s batsmen during the 5-0 Ashes whitewash in 2013-14, Moeen has some cautionary words. ‘I think Starc is quicker than Johnson,’ he said. ‘I think he’ll be more dangerous than him because of the swing. But let’s see what happens. I’ve only faced Johnson once, and that was his first game back, so maybe he’s a bit quicker now.’ Moeen, who hopes to play for Worcestershire against Yorkshire on Sunday in the opening round of County Championship matches, wants to establish himself as the Test team’s No 1 spinner. Moeen says that he worked on facing short deliveries during the World Cup earlier this year . Nineteen wickets at 23 against India last summer was a good start. And he has been working on his doosra, which was briefly unveiled against Sri Lanka at Headingley a year ago, but has remained under wraps during the ICC’s recent purge against dodgy bowling actions. ‘I feel like I’m bowling it quite well,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t right at the time, but now that I feel like I’ve got it right. But a lot of players got banned, so I’ve got to err on the careful side of things. I think in the future I’d definitely like to bowl it. ‘I feel like I’m part of the team now. But I don’t take anything for granted. I still play every game like it’s my first and my last game. I’m looking forward to going out to the West Indies and performing.’","Moeen Ali will join up with England ahead of second West Indies Test .

"If Andrew Strauss becomes England’s new supremo, the comeback hopes of Kevin Pietersen, which gained momentum with the sacking of Paul Downton, would come to an abrupt halt. Strauss said on Saturday that he can see no way back for the man he fell out with so badly over the messages Pietersen sent to South African opponents apparently criticising him as captain three years ago. Pietersen begins his county comeback with Surrey against Oxford University in The Parks on Sunday having been encouraged to return to the domestic game by ECB chairman-elect Colin Graves and emboldened by the demise of Downton, the man who sacked him last year. Andrew Strauss (right) says the Kevin Pietersen affair is a 'distraction' for English cricket . Strauss and Pietersen pictured during happier times during the 2011 series with India . Yet his hopes of an England return would seem over if Strauss succeeds in becoming the new England director of cricket after throwing his hat into the ring on Friday. ‘It’s very important for English cricket to move on from the Kevin Pietersen situation,’ said Strauss, who infamously called Pietersen ‘a complete c***’ on air last season when he thought his microphone had been switched off. ‘That threatens to envelop everything at the moment. The story has become more of a distraction than him actually playing. It’s become that big. The ECB and the England team’s efforts to move on from him haven’t worked so far but by winning that will allow them to move forward.’ Strauss’s views are as much from a cricketing point of view as a personal one, even though his feelings towards Pietersen clearly have not changed. ‘If you look at it from pure cricketing logic, after the Ashes is over, it’s quite hard to see a situation where Kevin Pietersen would come back into the side,’ Strauss told Wisden editor and Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence Booth on the Lord’s podcast. ‘You’re building towards the next Ashes in two and a half years time and the World Cup in 2019. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey for the county season in an attempt to regain his England place . Pietersen's chances of a recall have been boosted by the likely appointment of Michael Vaughan in the new ECB director of cricket role created following the sacking of Paul Downton as managing director . ‘I think if you were to bring Kevin Pietersen back it would be a short-term measure to help you win the Ashes but I can’t see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time. I think after the Ashes the story does move forward at that point.’ Michael Vaughan remains favourite to pip Strauss for a role that would have powers not enjoyed by anyone in English cricket since Ray Illingworth in the Nineties. Graves and new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison want to overhaul the system and make the new man more the equivalent of a football manager than a managing director, as was Downton. That means the director of cricket will probably be a hands-on presence in the dressing room with overall responsibility for coaching and selection, with the panel of selectors almost certainly being disbanded. There were key figures who wanted Strauss to take the job when Hugh Morris stood down 18 months ago, not least the Welshman himself, but at that stage Strauss felt it was too early for him and he has dabbled in commentary while not being a natural at it like Nasser Hussain and Atherton. Pietersen and Vaughan pictured together on England duty at Lord's in 2008 . Strauss, who played in 82 Tests with Pietersen, believes his recall would only be a short-term measure . Now the new regime at the ECB have moved the goalposts and the man Graves and Harrison want is clearly Vaughan, if they can persuade him to give up his extensive lucrative media work and other cricketing interests. Vaughan is here to commentate on England’s three-Test series against West Indies for Test Match Special and intriguingly is staying at the same hotel as the team. It will be fascinating to see whether he changes a hard-hitting commentary style that has seen him criticise several of the players who he may well now take charge of, with the ECB looking to make a quick appointment. Vaughan will need to build some bridges himself with a number of England players if he takes over but clearly Graves is not concerned by what has happened in the past and feels his fellow Yorkshireman is perfect for the role. Jimmy Anderson, who will be playing his 100th Test needing four wickets to become England’s leading wicket-taker, did not want to get drawn into which of his former England captains should get the big job. England bowler Jimmy Anderson refused to be drawn on who he would prefer to take up the role . ‘I don’t really have an opinion because we’re concentrating on building up to a Test,’ said Anderson. ‘That’s for the two new guys in charge. They’ve obviously got a clear plan of where they want to take English cricket and I’m sure they’ll get the right man for the job.’ Even though it was a diplomatic answer it was perhaps revealing that Anderson then named Hussain and Strauss as the best captains he has worked under, a view that was consistent with his autobiography where he offered little praise to the 2005 Ashes-winning captain Vaughan. Clearly, Peter Moores and even Alastair Cook will be almost auditioning for Vaughan in this series and it is impossible to see Moores in particular carrying on as coach alongside a man in Vaughan who has been so critical of him. The distractions that Strauss talked about, not just those provided by Pietersen, clearly still loom large over an England team who, it should be remembered, won the last three Tests they have played. It is imperative, not least for their captain and coach, that they continue that run here.","Former skipper Strauss says Pietersen return is out of the question .

"Thierry Henry hailed 'the detective' Francis Coquelin for his midfield display in Arsenal's hard-fought victory over Burnley at Turf Moor. The former Gunners striker said that Coquelin was his man of the match in Arsenal's 1-0 win, and he labelled the 23-year-old 'Columbo'. Coquelin played a key role in Aaron Ramsey's 12th-minute goal when he intercepted a Burnley pass and got his team on the front foot. Thierry Henry hailed the display of Francis Coquelin in Arsenal's 1-0 win over Burnley at Turf Moor . Henry was speaking on Sky Sports' coverage of the Premier League encounter on Saturday night . Speaking on Sky Sports' coverage of the Premier League encounter, Henry said: 'I thought he was brilliant today. He was our man of the match. He senses the danger and is there straight away.' Coquelin joined Arsenal in 2008 as a teenager and has had loan spells at Lorient, Freiburg and most recently Charlton. This season, though, the Frenchman has capitalised on some injuries in his position by impressing in his role as Arsenal's holding midfielder. Coquelin was Arsenal's man of the match, according to former Gunners striker Henry . The 23-year-old midfielder plays a pass under pressure from Burnley's David Jones . Henry added: 'He went away a bit before coming back to Arsenal and maybe that helped him. 'Maybe he realised ""I don't want to go on loan anymore. I want to play and show everyone I can play for Arsenal"". 'He understood he had to be that type of player to play for Arsenal.' Arsenal celebrated their eighth straight Premier League victory with a 1-0 win over Burnley at Turf Moor . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also praised the mental strength of Coquelin after seeing his team record their eighth straight league win. Wenger said: 'He gives the ball quickly and well and is good technuically. Overall he has contributed to the balance of the team. 'This is a player who has been with us for seven years. Sometimes you have to be patient. I'm very happy for him because it shows great mental strength.'","Thierry Henry praised Francis Coquelin's performance at Turf Moor .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce lamented his side's 'nerves and panic' which saw Stoke snatch a dramatic equaliser deep into stoppage time to earn a 1-1 draw at Upton Park. The Irons looked to have done enough to battle to victory after taking an early lead through a superb free-kick by full back Aaron Cresswell. However, after seeing two efforts from Marko Arnautovic ruled out for offside and a header by substitute Mame Diouf hit the post, the visitors snatched a deserved point five minutes into stoppage time when the Austrian winger crashed the ball into the far corner. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce was left disappointed after seeing his concede late on against Stoke . Allardyce will be scratching his head as to how he can help his side hang on to slender leads . West Ham remain in top 10 despite their late slip-up . West Ham remain in the top 10, but Allardyce knows their position should have been much more comfortable after witnessing yet another late capitulation from a positive position. 'You have to give Stoke a bit of credit, but from our point of view, we did not play as well as we can,' said Allardyce, who revealed striker Diafra Sakho is set for a spell on the sidelines with a thigh injury. 'It was not about us playing well or not, it was about winning and we had got ourselves into a fantastic position . 'When you are less than 30 seconds away from winning the game and you don't, that is the ultimate blow. 'We are very nervous on that stage based on what happened before. 'We should be on 50 points now, we have thrown away seven points in two minutes or less over four games. 'We cant find the right key elements to see the game out and leave ourselves on a nervous edge by having a little bit of panic in what we are trying to do which is coping with the opposition when they have to take more risks, playing more direct. Stoke celebrate after Marko Arnautovic's equaliser during the dying stages of the Premier League clash . Aaron Cresswell, pictured with West Ham team-mate Mark Noble, had put his side in the lead . 'While it was a very good goal, we should have dealt with it and kept possession better, using your intelligence to make sure you are doing it.' Allardyce added: 'If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League. 'Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.' Allardyce is out of contract in the summer, with the club's owners yet to decide in which direction they want to take West Ham ahead of their move to the Olympic Stadium. The 60-year-old, though, intends to remain professional in his approach over the final matches of a campaign which had earlier promised so much. 'It depends on what you say. Do you say what is the overall season like? It should be 50 points, it should be very, very good. It is small margins of victories to draws and draws to defeat,' Allardyce added. 'In the judgement at the end of the season, or if not what happens before that, then we talk about what we are doing going forwards. 'We are still on course to beat the best points record we have had, but we are making it hugely difficult for ourselves now when we really should be coasting instead of looking forward to every game we are playing.' Allardyce has revealed star striker Diafra Sakho is expected to be out for an estimated two to three weeks . Senegal forward Sakho limped off in the second half, and if the problem proves serious, he might not recover before the end of the campaign. Allardyce said: 'If it is a grade one off the scan, then it could be two to three weeks, if it is more, then you would be lucky to see him again this season, which is a massive blow but we have to deal with it.' Stoke boss Mark Hughes felt his side had done more than enough to end a run of three straight defeats. 'We are thankful for small mercies, because we did not think we were going to get what we deserved,' he said. 'I thought we totally dominated the game and should have won it by a country mile. 'We had the setback from the great free-kick early in the game, and it is difficult when you are the away side to come back. 'We showed great resilience and stuck at it, trying to create things, but just lacked that bit of quality at the top end. 'If one of our disallowed goals had counted, I think we would still have had time to go on and win the game. 'We want to better last season's total and are determined now to get something out of all of the matches we have left.'","Stoke claimed a point thanks to stoppage time goal by Marko Arnautovic .

"Michael Owen surprised television viewers and pundits alike by completely dismissing Charlie Adam's 66-yard strike against Chelsea as a potential Goal of the Season contender. Revealing his controversial standpoint on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show on Saturday, the former England international striker sparked a debate between his colleagues in the studio. 'I think if you asked a hundred footballers in general to go and try to re-enact them [each of the four superb goals from Adam, Bobby Zamora, Wayne Rooney and Jermain Defoe last weekend] the next day, I think more people would be able to kick the ball far and straight.' Michael Owen sparked a debate whilst speaking alongside former Liverpool team-mate Steve McManaman . The former England striker said he didn't believe Charlie Adam's strike was worthy of Goal of the Season . Owen's comments surprised his colleagues on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show on Saturday . Owen, who scored 163 career goals in 362 appearances for Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle, Manchester United and Stoke, appreciated a degree of expertise to execute such a shot but was minimally impressed. 'Just one long kick. There's a lot of skill in it, but Goal of the Season? Do me a favour!' Co-anchor and ex-player Robbie Savage waded in following Owen's outburst, and former Liverpool star and fellow pundit Steve McManaman was not far behind. 'You [Owen] scored a thousand goals and you couldn't do it,' former Leicester midfielder Savage added. 'You're talking about 100 footballers,' McManaman highlighted, 'and we couldn't do what Charlie Adam did (pointing to Savage, Owen and himself).' Charlie Adam (centre) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at Chelsea . Adam's audacious effort was clocked at more than 45 miles per hour and came from inside his own half . Refusing to back down 35-year-old Owen remained resolute: 'The only reason you couldn't  and potentially couldn't [score a goal like Adam] is because you couldn't reach [the goal]. You could kick the ball hard and far... it's just whether you could do it that far.' 'So we couldn't do it!' McManaman confirmed. Clearly feeling backed into a corner by his cohorts Owen pointed at Savage: 'He couldn't score Rooney's [turn and volley against Aston Villa].' 'I could,' Savage barked. 'I could score Defoe's [long range volley against Newcastle]. I've scored Defoe's for Wales. Twice. Two worldies.'

Responding to the comments about his strike at Stamford Bridge, Scotland international Adam hit back at his skeptic. Taking to his personal Twitter account the 29-year-old wrote: '@themichaelowen was a great player in his day but if he even thought about it his hamstring would go..'

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has admitted for the first time he could be sacked if he finishes outside the Champions League places this season. Pellegrini’s side face West Ham United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday with their top four prospects hanging in the balance. The Premier League champions have lost four of their last five games and Pellegrini said: ‘You are wrong if you think that, at this club, you are out if you don’t win the title. Manchester City midfielders Frank Lampard and  David Silva take part in a training drill on Saturday . City will hope striker Sergio Aguero can add to his tally of 25 goals this season against West Ham . ‘(But) If we miss out (on the Champions League) then maybe it will be different because that would not be the same thing. ‘If that happens, the analysis of the season will be different. Not to play in the Champions League is a disaster.’ The Mail on Sunday can reveal that City have already talked to Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp two years ago, when they were seeking to replace Roberto Mancini. In the end they rejected his flambouyant approach in favour of Pellegrini. With six matches left and the top-four positions still up for grabs, City are keeping their options open. The club are not guaranteeing the manager will survive but it does not appear they have already made up their mind to sack him as they did two seasons ago with Mancini. Their strategy was always to allow Pellegrini to continue until the end of his three-year contract in 2016 and then try and lure Pep Guardiola from Bayern Munich, whose own deal will be coming to an end in Germany. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini wants a reaction from his players after the derby mauling . Veteran goalkeeper Richard Wright shows off his handling skills to current City No 1 Joe Hart . Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has come under fire following their title race capitulation . However, dismal defeats at Burnley and Crystal Palace have placed serious question marks about Pellegrini's ability to motivate his top players. Yaya Toure and Vincent Kompany have endured poor seasons, new signings Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando have been disasters until now and even Sergio Aguero's form has deteriorated after being the stand-out player of the season until Christmas. Pellegrini is adamant he will not quit regardless of the pressure he has been under. 'I have walked away from a club once before, many years ago, but I would not quit here because it is a different case,' he said. Dejected Manchester City players look on as they are dealt yet another blow in their hunt for the league title . The reigning champions have slipped from serious title challengers to fears over not finishing in the top four . Kompany  could have been sent off for a challenge on Daley Blind before being substituted last weekend . 'You don't quit just because it's a bad moment. I think we play the football I want, attractive football. At this moment we are not getting the results that we need, but we are going the right way. 'You cannot guess the future. You must say what you think about what happened and the solution. All the other things are a matter of trust.' Pellegrini also did his best to lend his support for Toure who has fallen short of his own standards this season and is being courted by Mancini at Inter Milan. Defending his player, the City boss said: 'I feel sorry for Yaya. When he went to the Africa Cup of Nations and we lost to Arsenal and Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, he was seen as guilty because he was not here. 'He returned here and now he is a disaster, people say he doesn't have spirit, he isn't fit. He is a very important player for our team and we need him to give his best performance and the best way to recover Yaya is to trust in him. Toure's brother died last summer while he was at the World Cup with Ivory Coast. 'Yaya has had a difficult year and we must support him,' said Pellegrini.","Manchester City need to lift the gloom against West Ham on Sunday .

"Her vicious attack on a tow company clerk was not Britt McHenry's first brush with conflict. The disgraced ESPN sports reporter has been suspended for a week after footage emerged of her telling single mother-of-three Gina Michelle: 'I'm on TV and you're in a f---ing trailer, honey.' But just a month earlier she used similar language to berate an Arkansas attorney and women's rights campaigner on Twitter. Sarah Sparkman, who tweets with the handle @cupcakesarenice, remarked to her followers that she felt uneasy about the way female sports reporters are sexualized on screen. Her observation infuriated McHenry in a fight that ended with the reporter raging: 'you sound really bitter. if you work as hard as you say you do, you wouldn't bash more successful ppl on twitter.' Twitter fight: Sarah Sparkman (left), a lawyer from Arkansas, tweeted about how female sports reporters are sexualized - and was met with a tirade of anger from Britt McHenry (right) despite not tagging her in the tweet . Screengrabs of the conversation on March 12 have been posted on Sparkman's blog. It started when Sparkman wrote to her followers: 'I wish there were more women in sports broadcasting that aren't completely sexualized. 'I'm tired of seeing all sexualized photos of Kacie McDonnell in my newsfeed. I have no idea if she's talented, but I know how she's branded. 'I have nothing against beautiful women being in sports media,' she wrote, 'I just wish that they were presented as professionals and not models.' A follower responded by mentioning Britt McHenry's name - and the situation rapidly escalated. Although they did not tag McHenry in the tweet, the 28-year-old reporter found it and began berating Sparkman. Despite having written her own blog post condemning sexualization in Super Bowl adverts, McHenry seemed angered by the suggestion that female sports reporters might be sexualized. She raged: 'went to northwestern & played competitive sports. What's wrong w/ a woman wanting to look nice & be intelligent?' Sparkman responded: 'I have zero issue with beautiful women in sports media. What I have issue with is how they are sexualized.' McHenry hit back: 'define that? I modeled & still graduated in 3 yrs w/ a masters. those things don't have to be mutually exclusive.' To clarify her point, Sparkman sent McHenry a link to the definition of 'sexualization'. McHenry was not satisfied: 'personally I believe it's ppl who don't have 1 trait or the other who try to demean others,' adding, 'so you're being more of a hater than the men themselves?' In a bid to extract herself from the back-and-forth, Sparkman tweeted her exasperation to her followers: 'Man, I swear I can't give an opinion without some rando on Twitter seeking me out and bashing their misinterpretation.' The comment prompted McHenry's final scathing words, which echo the abuse she level at the tow company clerk on April 6. 'Technically given the two of us, you're the rando,' McHenry tweeted, adding: 'you sound really bitter. If you work as hard as you say you do, you wouldn't bash more successful ppl on twitter.' Her stance was at odds with a blog post she wrote in January, aiming to champion women's rights. In it, McHenry describes a cheeseburger advert that features an almost naked woman, writing: 'When so many females fight for gender equality in pay and opportunity – still to this day in 2015 – an advertisement like that only sets women back generations.' 'Women,' she pontificates, 'can be comfortable in their own skin... Be the woman with a voice, not the sex-ed up body without one.' But after the release of the towing company's surveillance footage, many have questioned how strongly she feels about equality between women. The Twitter tirade bore surprising similarities with her attack against single mother-of-three Gina Michelle of Advanced Towing in Arlington, Virginia, on Easter weekend. McHenry had left her car in the parking lot of Chinese restaurant Hunan One overnight, despite obvious signs warning that cars would be towed. When her vehicle was removed, McHenry went to the towing station and made her irritation plain. She fumes at Michelle: 'I’m in the news, sweetheart, I will f---ing sue this place.' The parking attendant can be heard in the video warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding: 'That’s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry has been suspended for one week and could face further punishment after video surfaced of her berating an Advanced Towing employee in Arlington, Virginia . Glamorous: Originally from New Jersey, McHenry is a sideline reporter for ESPN based in Washington D.C. Pictured is Gina Michelle, the clerk abused by McHenry and told she needed to lose some weight . The parking attendant patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money… with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling the woman she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f---ingg trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Online petitions calling for the sports network to fire McHenry, 28, were approaching 10,000 signatures Friday night after video was published on her rant against Gina Michelle of Advanced Towing in Arlington, Virginia. Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant . Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . McHenry tweeted her regret but has yet to make any attempt to apologize to Michelle. Advanced Trading Company insists it does not want McHenry to suffer. In a statement Advanced Towing said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry. 'As a small regulated business, we saw no benefit to releasing the video, except to highlight personal attacks employees in jobs like towing, public parking enforcement and others sometimes encounter. 'The video was not licensed or sold to anyone.' Women's rights champion? Britt McHenry encourages her blog readers to 'be the woman with a voice, not the sex-ed up body without one'. She said she  posted this selfie as an example of female empowerment .

Officer Jeffrey Swett testified on the stand that Bogard was smiling behind the wheel while running him down . The hearing was held so a judge could determine if there is substantial evidence for a trial. Swett testified on the witness stand that Bogard was smiling behind the wheel while running him down, according to ABC News. He said: 'I figured at that point in time he was going to kill me.' The officer added he felt  'immediate pain' upon impact and 'forcefully hit' the pavement afterwards. Bogard was able to get into Swett's car without resistance because the officer was investigating reports about the suspect breaking into a house and threatening to kill the occupants, according to 10News.

"I yield to no one in my love of the old days — warm beer, cricket on the village green, bobbies on bicycles two by two, all that — but it's rare a chance arises to compare the rose-tinted past with the brave new world, as it did on Saturday evening when Sky's high-octane Premier League coverage went head-to-head with Arsenal v Reading in the FA Cup semi-final on the BBC. As we know, the Premier League has the money and prestige, but what the FA Cup has is history, and boy does the BBC love a bit of history? Lest you were in any doubt, its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late Sir Laurence Olivier doing the St Crispin's Day speech from the film of Henry V ('We happy few, We band of brothers,' and so on). Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Jason Roberts and Ian Wright fronted the BBC's coverage at Wembley . BBC presenter Lineker prepares to present the Match of the Day 50th anniversary special broadcast . Reading defender Nathaniel Chaloboah (left) chases Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) on Saturday . Gunners forward Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring his side's winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final . Stand-in Match of the Day presenter Gabby Logan (left) with pundits Phil Neville and Robbie Savage (right) The excuse, I guess, was that Reading's nickname is the Royals, but as the second-tier team are also known as the Biscuitmen. The BBC even gave us a moment of history at half-time with a breakdown, something that used to be a regular feature of TV outside broadcasts, when a feature on Crystal Palace's shock semi-final victory over Liverpool 25 years ago came to a shuddering halt halfway through. In such instances, the BBC is lucky to retain the services of Gary Lineker, the best presenter of live football on TV. Sky have never really replaced the disgraced Richard Keys, who had the benefit of longevity in the post. The BBC needs to fight hard to avoid Lineker falling into the hands of rivals. Not that Sky's presenters are less than competent — David Jones did the job — but it's never a good sign when you have to go to Google to check which one it is. The price of live Premier League football is now way beyond the reach of the BBC, which may be the clincher in Lineker's future. While the BBC's match had the lion's share of the goalmouth action, it was difficult to resist turning over to Sky on occasion. Having invested its billions in the Premier League, Sky doesn't skimp on the peripheries. The sound always seems a little crisper, and in punditry, where Sky offers us the Rolls Royce of analysts, Gary Neville, the BBC counters with the mid-range Danny Murphy. In the commentary box, Sky fields Martin Tyler for its big games in the knowledge he'll rarely make a bad call, while the BBC never seems sure who its best commentator is. The man on the job on Saturday, Steve Wilson, is unfussy and made the most of what was the bigger story. The outcome on Sky was depressingly predictable. The BBC may miss out on the Premier League's pricey weekly thrills, but took the biscuit on Saturday. The BBC's Dan Walker talks pitchside with Sportsmail's Martin Keown at Wembley .

"Newcastle are set to strip Fabricio Coloccini of the captaincy this summer and give the armband to Daryl Janmaat, should he remain at the club. Former Argentina defender Coloccini has been skipper since 2011 but head coach John Carver says the club will review that position at the end of the season. The Magpies have repeatedly been let down by those appointed to lead the team this year and that has infuriated coaching staff. Newcastle boss John Carver is set to strip Fabricio Coloccini (above) of the club captaincy this summer . Daryl Janmaat will be given the honour during the summer with Carver labelling him as 'outstanding' Coloccini was needlessly sent off during last month’s 3-0 defeat at Everton and landed a three-match ban which ruled him out of the Tyne-Wear derby. In his absence, Moussa Sissoko skippered the team to three defeats and was himself red carded during Monday’s 2-0 loss at Liverpool following a reckless lunge on midfielder Lucas. The France international – who is desperate to quit St James’ in the summer – is now facing a club fine as punishment for his indiscipline. Meanwhile, official vice-captain Cheick Tiote has long since been agitating for a move away from Tyneside and he has only appeared 12 times this season because of injury. Carver said: ‘The captaincy is something that has to be addressed by the football club. ‘We need to give the captaincy to somebody who is responsible, who is a leader. The players will follow a leader, and they have to have discipline on and off the pitch. Carver said on Thursday: ‘We need to give the captaincy to somebody who is responsible, who is a leader' ‘I shouldn't have to go in there and manage that dressing room – that's what your captains are there for. I would definitely review the situation in the summer.’ Carver will recommend that Holland defender Janmaat is rewarded for an impressive first season. He, though, is attracting interest from Liverpool and, given the unsettled situation at the club right now, could be tempted by a move away. But there has been no question over Janmaat’s commitment this season, as Carver added: ‘I'd be tempted (to make Janmaat captain), yes, because he's a proper leader. ‘He's got character, strength, he's good around the dressing room. Whatever you ask him to do he'll do it and he has a good presence around the place. ‘He leads by example, and that's what you need a captain to do. Daryl has been outstanding. Moussa Sissoko hands the captains armband over to manager Carver after being sent off at Liverpool . 'This is his first year in the Premier League and he’s been outstanding, whatever position he’s played in. It’s important we keep him. We need to keep our best players.’ Coloccini, however, will captain the team for Sunday’s visit of Spurs. And Carver said: ‘If it was me, I'd want to prove a point. ‘If it was me who had been sent off and I was the captain of the football club, I'd want to perform for the next six games, because I have been sent off and we've had to reshuffle the back four because of it. ‘And I think he will give a good response because will be disappointed at what's happened. He'll not want to see this team struggle like they did a few seasons ago and end up in the Championship.’ Referee Martin Atkinson shows  Coloccini a red card during last month's trip to Everton at Goodison Park .","Fabricio Coloccini is set to be removed as Newcastle United captain .

As it emerged City have decided to listen to offers for star names Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri this summer, United’s captain said his team’s 4-2 win at Old Trafford was based on identifying fundamental flaws in Manuel Pellegrini’s team.

"An intriguing picture on Twitter has given an insight into the meticulous preparation of a commentator for a football match. BBC Radio 5 Live commentator Guy Mowbray's notes for Monday night's Premier League clash between Liverpool and Newcastle at Anfield were posted ahead of kick-off. BBC commentator Guy Mowbray's commentary notes for Liverpool's league match against Newcastle . Mowbray has worked for the BBC since 2004 . And Mowbray was not far off from correctly predicting the starting line-ups, naming 19 of the 22 players who took to the field. However, he surprisingly, and incorrectly, predicted that 18-year-old midfielder Cameron Brannagan would make his first Liverpool start. Instead Jordan Ibe returned from injury, while Brannagan was an unused substitute in Liverpool's 2-0 win at Anfield. The notes are thorough from start to finish with numbers for appearances, goals, transfer fees and other interesting tidbits to keep the millions of listeners across the country well informed. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's political science degree is noted, as is the fact that Jordon Ibe - though the 19-year-old's first name was spelt incorrectly in the notes as 'Jordan' - was born on Raheem Sterling's first birthday. Also mentioned is Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul congratulating Sunderland's Jermain Defoe on his goal in the recent Wear-Tyne derby, Jamie Sterry's Italian grandad, and the fact that Newcastle defender Ryan Taylor is a Liverpool fan. Mowbray, 43, was the youngest ever television commentator on a World Cup final when he covered the 1998 edition for Eurosport. He has worked for the BBC since 2004. Radio 5 Live's commentators now have it harder than ever after a recent change to bring the station's games in line with TV coverage, with just one commentator and one summariser. In previous years there had been two commentators who switched at the mid-point of each half, with a summariser interjecting for 90 minutes. However since 2012 the BBC commentaries have been reduced to a single commentator, putting more pressure on the likes of Mowbray to be better prepared than ever. Raheem Sterling celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Liverpool at Anfield on Monday night . Mowbray's notes are more detailed, but less colourful than those produced by another BBC commentator, Nick Barnes, who works for the corporation's Radio Newcastle. Barnes posts some of his notes for Newcastle games on Twitter, complete with his commentary microphone, showing off his artistry as well as his research. The local radio commentator's notebook included hand-drawn kits and national flags for each player, as well as colour-coded notes on the visiting club's form and the predicted line-ups in formation.

"Lewis Hamilton has come under fire for spraying a hostess in the face with champagne after winning the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai on Sunday. The reigning world champion won his second race in three to start the 2015 season, but his podium celebrations have drawn some criticism. A leading group which campaigns against sexism has condemned the behavior of the driver as 'selfish and inconsiderate', saying he should be forced to apologise for 'specially directing' the bubbly into the woman's face. Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the Chinese Grand Prix by spraying a hostess in the face with champagne . The hostess looks less than impressed as she is sprayed with champagne on the podium in Shanghai . Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object, a campaign on media sexism and 'sex object culture', said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future. For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Hamilton's celebrations have led to criticism of the two-time world champion . Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races this season . Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'. Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies. They don't like it', while one outraged user said he was a 'scumbag - an embarrassment to UK'. Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.' Hamilton sprays a hostess after winning the Spanish Grand Prix in Catalunya last May . And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.' It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on top of the driver's standings. And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013. But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' Hamilton and his team-mate Nico Rosberg had a spat when the German said his team-mate slowed him down .

"Nathaniel Clyne has been told he is England's first choice right-back by Roy Hodgson.

Sterling met Liverpool manager Rodgers and he was reminded of his professional responsibilities and warned about the consequences of taking a drug that has been called ‘hippy crack’. It has been a controversial week for Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, all coming in the wake of his interview with the BBC in which he revealed why he had rejected a £100,000-a-week deal at Liverpool. Several clubs, including Arsenal, have withdrawn their interest in the midfielder in the light of recent images.
