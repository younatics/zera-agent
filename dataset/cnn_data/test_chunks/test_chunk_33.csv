"A volleyball-playing feline was picked to star in a national TV advert after seeing off competition from thousands of gifted animals. Tortoiseshell Mimi became an internet sensation after her owner uploaded clips of her playing the sport to Facebook. The 30-second-video was shared by thousands of people around the world and features the one-year-old cat playing with 15-year-old Joshua Teague. Joshua’s dad Phil, 56, a computer programmer, bought the cat with his wife Christine, 45, when she was eight-weeks-old in December 2013 from a seller who lived in Birmingham. Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert, which was broadcast last Wednesday (15), after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group earlier this month. He said: 'All the family were really excited to see the advert. Mimi the cat appears in a 30-second video showing her unique ball skills . 'We had everyone around so we could watch it together and we told all our friends that it was going to be on. 'I am really proud that our video was chosen out of thousands of entries. 'It was completely by chance that I uploaded the video on to the Pets At Home Facebook page. The cat is seen playing volleyball with 15-year-old Joshua Teague in the hallway . Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group . 'I just saw something on there asking people to share videos and pictures of their pets so that’s what I did. I didn’t even realise it was a competition. 'The video showed Mimi playing volleyball with my son where he would throw the ball at her and she would keep batting it back. 'I had no idea it was competition so I thought it was a joke when I received an email on April 1 saying our video had been chosen for a national commercial. Mimi is seen in the video batting the ball back to Joshua every time he throws it her way . 'This kind of thing just never happens. 'She is a very talented cat. She has done many times since. 'I think she could get her own TV show.' Administrative assistant Christine said: 'I didn’t even know Phil had uploaded the video on Facebook so I thought it was an April Fools’ joke when he told me about it. 'We normally just skip the adverts when we watch programmes but we made sure to watch this one. 'Although she’s only in the advert for a few seconds, it’s nice to see her on it. 'I never thought when I filmed the video that it would end up on TV.'","A clip of Mimi playing volleyball was uploaded to Facebook .

"Breakfast TV queen Lorraine Kelly has revealed the secret to her trim new look in an interview, and surprisingly, it doesn't involve diets. It turns out the 55-year-old has been attending regular Zumba classes, and it's paid off. The Scottish presenter revealed that attending the classes - up to four times a week - has helped her drop two dress sizes, from a 14 to a 10. Scroll down for video . Lorraine Kelly (pictured left) has managed to drop two dress sizes by attending regular Zumba classes with her instructor, Maxine Jones (pictured right) Zumba is a fitness programme, combining Latin and international music, and incorporates aerobic elements across various styles of dance. The classes vary in price, but average at about £5. In an interview with Woman, Kelly gushed about her Zumba instructor, Maxine Jones. She said: 'Maxine's changed my life. I have more energy now and that helps me look and feel younger.' In the interview, the 55-year-old also revealed her excitement about her new weight loss. As the presenter of her own eponymous ITV show, which airs early in the morning every weekday, it's understandable that feeling good in front of the camera is important to Kelly. The 55-year old is no stranger to exercise, and ran the London Marathon back in 2010 . Zumba is a dance fitness programme that combines several dance styles and aerobic activity . She explained: 'I've never had a waist before, I didn't have that curviness, but now I have and I look better. 'I'm a size 10 and I love being able to go into the shops and buy a top because I like it and not because I want to hide my bottom.' Kelly also explained that Zumba had helped her develop a new-found confidence, and that at the age of 55, she had more confidence than she had ever felt. She added: 'I was never unfit, but I was never truly fit. I'd done marathons but more out of determination. 'But Zumba is so much fun…I feel more confident now in my fifties than I have ever felt. Confidence comes from within.' And Lorraine also found a friend for life in instructor Maxine. Maxine started instructing in 2011, and prior to this, had been a banker for 20 years. She explained: 'Maxine's more like a friend now – she makes me laugh. 'She's 45 and I'm 55 ­– we always joke that our combined ages add up to 100!' The 55-year-old spoke to Woman magazine about how attending Zumba classes up to four times a week had helped her drop two dress sizes .","Scottish TV presenter  has lost weight through regular Zumba classes .

"Damon Albarn said modern pop stars are part of a 'selfie generation' that just sings about platitudes . He was once the driving force behind Britpop in the 1990s and became known for his very public spat with Oasis' Gallagher brothers. And now Blur frontman Damon Albarn, who lives in Kensington and Chelsea in London, has returned to pick a fight with even more people in the music industry. Albarn has criticised today's pop stars for 'talking platitudes' and singing only about themselves, at a time when, he believes, they could be using their music to make political statements in the run up to the general election. The 47-year-old dubbed modern pop artists as existing in a 'selfie generation' of stars who use their music to reveal only how they feel. 'Modern day musicians are talking platitudes now and it's not interesting to me,' Albarn told the Sunday Times' Culture magazine. His comments are timely as Blur releases its first album in years this month. Albarn's criticisms are also likely to resonate with people who have been scornful about the work of modern day pop stars such as Taylor Swift and Sam Smith who are known for using their singles to express their emotions about failed relationships. 'What are any of them saying?' added Albarn, now a father-of-one. 'I don't hear them saying anything other than ""This is me and this is how I feel,"" which is an important part of songwriting, but we're talking in the context of an election.' Blur shot to success with Parklife in 1995 - widely seen as a commentary about growing up in the 1990s and the ordinary people that many forgot about. They became one of the best known bands in pop, fuelled by a very public row with rivals Oasis. But by 2002 Graham Coxon - best friend of Albarn - was asked to leave the band and they all began to do their own projects. In 2009 they reunited to play Hyde Park and again in 2012. Sam Smith,recently credited the man who broke his heart for inspiring his award winning album . Taylor Swift is known for using her music to criticise her ex-boyfriends and reveal her struggles in love . Albarn said he would like to see popstars talking about what is going on around them and using their music to comment on modern society and politics. He is characteristically forthright about his own political stance. The Blur frontman longs to see a Labour and Green party government, and dismisses an incident in the 1990s when Tony Blair tried to recruit him as an incident when he was young and new to politics, and still did not know his own political mind. He would also like to see Trident significantly reduced. Alex James (left), Dave Rowntree (centre, top), guitarist Graham Coxon (right) and Damon Albarn (centre front) were one of the best known boybands in the 1990s and have reunited to produced a new album . Blur release their new album The Magic Whip later this month. It is the first time since the 1999 album, entitled 13, that Graham Coxon will feature fully on the album. Magic Whip was created in two sections - the first after they reunited to play in Hyde Park in 2009 and went on a world tour - finding time in Hong Kong to come up with some new material. Coxon worked on the songs and they returned to Hong Kong again to complete the album.","Damon Albarn said modern day popstars are just singing 'platitudes'

"Homeowners could face an early rise in interest rates if Ed Miliband is propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, a major bank warned last night. US giant Morgan Stanley said the prospect of a Labour government reliant on the Scottish Nationalists would create the ‘greatest uncertainty’ of any election result. Its inevitable ‘anti-austerity’ agenda could lead to an ‘earlier bank rate hike than was previously the case’, the bank argued. US giant Morgan Stanley said the prospect of a Labour government reliant on the Scottish Nationalists would create the ‘greatest uncertainty’ of any election result . Last night, a second major bank, Goldman Sachs, also raised concerns about the same outcome on May 7. Goldman said Labour would be ‘dragged to the Left’ by the SNP, which would result in even more money going north of the border ‘at the expense of the UK as a whole’. It warned that Labour would be then expected to abandon its pledge to manage the public finances carefully. The reports are a double blow to Labour’s attempts to convince voters that the economy would be in safe hands with a Mr Miliband-led government. In an election research note, Morgan Stanley said that a Labour-led government reliant on the ‘anti-austerity and separatist SNP’ would lead investors to predict a ‘substantially looser fiscal policy’. Goldman also warned in a note to investors that a ‘Leftward shift’ could cause share prices to fall in UK firms – particularly those hit by tougher regulation and higher taxes such as banks and energy companies. Nicola Sturgeon's (left) Scottish National Party would drag Ed Miliband (right) and the Labour party into its anti-austerity agenda, Goldman Sachs warned last night . By contrast, it said the Conservative-led coalition ‘has established some credibility in markets as a consequence of its contribution to the stabilisation of the economy and revival of growth that has been achieved since 2010.’ As a result ‘it is likely that business sentiment would be supported by the emergence of a Conservative government’. Goldman also pointed out that whoever wins the election will inevitably be hit by ‘financial shocks’ in the coming years. ‘Given the mixed record of Labour administrations at dealing with such challenges in the past, the business community may be sceptical that a Labour-led government would deliver market-friendly policies.’ The comments mark another vote of confidence for Chancellor George Osborne, who was praised last week by International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde for his handling of the economy. A Tory spokesman said: ‘This confirms that working people will pay the price for an SNP-Ed Miliband government. ‘Mortgage rate rises will hit homeowners. Higher borrowing will mean higher taxes and more debt for our children to repay.’ Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘Labour is pro-business, but not business as usual. We want more competition in banking, a British Investment Bank to boost lending and action to tackle tax avoidance. ‘The big threat to the City and our economy is a re-elected Tory government taking Britain out of the EU.’ The comments mark another vote of confidence for Chancellor George Osborne, who was praised last week the head of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde for his handling of the British economy .","Major bank warns against Labour government propped up by the the SNP .

"The traditional cookie cutter wedding no longer exists - new reports suggest Brits are ditching tradition in favour of alternative practices when it comes to getting hitched. Two of the biggest changes are the fact that religious services have fallen out of favour and that brides are opting for bold colour schemes for their big day. A new study, which has tracked the decisions of brides and grooms over the past five years interviewed 1,893 newlyweds and compared them to answers they have collated since 2010. Scroll down for video . A new study has revealed the changing habits of British weddings. When it comes to honeymooning 18 per cent of us are now choosing to holiday in the UK compared to 8 per cent five years ago . The study showed that couples are shunning religious ceremonies when it comes to their big day with services falling from 40 per cent to 35 in the past five years. Registry offices have seen an increase in bookings by two thirds, going from three per cent to nine per cent since 2010, and 50 per cent of bride and grooms have opted for some form of civil ceremony when getting hitched. Tradition seems to be out of the window when it comes to paying the bill. In 2014, just seven per cent of UK couples allowed the bride's parents to pay the entire bill, down from nine per cent in 2010, while over a third of married couples in the UK (31.4 per cent) covered their entire wedding bill themselves. The trend for cupcakes is falling out of favour sinking from appearing at 15 per cent of weddings to just 10 per cent, however cheese towers are on the up by three per cent since 2011 . The study by hitched.co.uk also showed that spending on weddings as a whole is increasing, up by 3.4 per cent year on year, outpacing the economic growth of 2.8 per cent. The average cost of a wedding is now £16,020 (compared to £15,494.54 in 2013). Forking out for our own weddings seems to be having a knock on effect as lavish honeymoons are less popular than they once were. Newlyweds are now choosing to honeymoon closer to home, with 18 per cent opting for a vacation in the UK, compared to eight per cent just five years ago. 32 per cent choose Europe, an increase of 11 per cent in five years, while honeymoon visits to the rest of the world has plummeted from 71 per cent to 50. It seems that many are also less keen to jet off immediately, with just 39 per cent of us going on our honeymoon within two days of the wedding, compared to 47 per cent in 2010. Peach bridesmaid dresses are out as the favoured colour scheme for a wedding is now purple . It's good news for bridesmaids though - peach is no longer the colour scheme of choice for dresses. Purple is now the most popular colour in the UK (19 per cent), followed by blue (18 per cent). Another favourite that has fallen out of favour is cupcakes - in 2011, 15 per cent of weddings opted for them as an alternative to a traditional wedding cake, but they are now chosen by just 10 per cent of couples for their reception. This doesn't mean you will necessarily have to choke back some heavily iced fruit cake though, as five per cent of couples now have a cake made of cheese, up from two per cent in 2010. Caroline Hendry, Editor of hitched.co.uk says that our changing attitudes towards weddings are seeing new traditions created. She said: 'As well as a snapshot of trends that might come and go we can see some longer term patterns emerging, with the decline of the religious ceremony and the expectation that parents would foot the bill. 'Couples seem more keen to foot the bill for drinks, but at the same time they are still under financial pressure, so other things need to give like the lavish honeymoon with more couples honeymooning in the UK or Europe or taking longer to save.'","A new survey of newlyweds reveals Britain's changing wedding habits .

"Sir Bruce Forsyth has spoken out in favour of assisted dying, saying that watching his first wife suffer with dementia has convinced him he wants to 'die with a bit of dignity left'. The veteran entertainer, now 87, said people should not be 'left to suffer', adding that in many cases it could be 'more cruel to do nothing' than allowing them to die. Sir Bruce's first wife, Penny Calvert, was moved into a care home with dementia in 2008, and he visited regularly to help care for her until her death last year. Scroll down for video . Sir Bruce Forsyth has said that sometimes it can be 'more cruel to do nothing' than to let someone die, as he spoke out today in support of assisted dying . Sir Bruce said his experience of nursing first wife Penny Calvert (pictured here with the couple's three children) as she suffered with dementia had convinced him of a need for a change in the law . He said: 'It's a terrible illness, awful to see and awful for everyone close to the person suffering. 'It’s a very difficult situation. She didn’t remember me. It’s just so awful to have your mind and your memories taken away from you. 'It bothers me an awful lot that people are just left to suffer. If I had Alzheimer’s or dementia I would do something about it. 'The law should be changed and if people want to die with a bit of dignity left they should be able to do so. 'If it is what the person wants and it can be proved they are living a life of suffering it can be more cruel to do nothing. I’d like that right for myself.' Sir Bruce married Ms Calvert in 1953, and the couple had three children together before splitting 20 years later. He then went on to marry Anthea Redfern, the hostess on the Generation Game, followed by Wilnelia Merced, a former Miss World who he married in 1983. While Sir Bruce (left) separated from Ms Calvert (right) in 1973, the two remained in contact, and he helped to secretly nurse her after she was taken into a home in 2008, until she died last year . Sir Bruce (pictured left with third and current wife Wilnelia Merced, and right after receiving his knighthood) said he would like the right to be able to end his life 'with a bit of dignity left' Despite these new relationships, he remained on good terms with Ms Calvert, and supported her through her illness. Sir Bruce joins other celebrities and politicians who support assisted dying, including the late author Terry Pratchett, former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey, and Labour peer Lord Falconer. The latter has already tabled a bill asking that patients with less than six months to live be allowed to take their own life with the help of a doctor. However, the proposed change in the law has proved controversial, with distinguished judge Baroness Butler-Sloss saying it would 'cross a line' towards euthanasia. Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have also spoken out against assisted dying in the past. Under the 1961 Suicide Act, those who deliberate assist or encourage others to commit suicide can be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison. However, in 2010, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, issued guidelines making clear that anyone who assists a loved one who has reached a 'settled and informed' decision while 'acting out of compassion' is unlikely to be charged, leading to ambiguity.","Sir Bruce said it can be 'more cruel to do nothing' than to let someone die .

"A barrister and Oxford University graduate who spent more than two years avoiding paying for his train ticket could be the biggest fare-dodger to be prosecuted, a court heard. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over a two-and-a-half year period. He travelled from his Oxfordshire home to London Marylebone but pretended to have only gone from Wembley, in north west London. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over two-and-a-half years . Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year . The Australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to £9,714.40 in fares, claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket, and take into account annual leave. But prosecutor Malachy Pakenham told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'If it is accepted that the loss was £23,000, this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the United Kingdom. 'The Crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it. 'The train company are experts, not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed, you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket, you calculate it on a full single fare, of the return for the day, each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket'. Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year. Barnett claimed to have travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire . The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. The Rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from Wembley, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a £550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. The lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children's charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at 'promoting prosperity'. A court heard how the barrister got off at London Marylebone (pictured) by tapping out with an Oyster card . It is understood he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket, and then getting off at Marylebone by simply tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently £7.60. But this is still far less than the £19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home. The case was adjourned until July 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to Chiltern Railways. Barnett was released on unconditional bail. The deception places him among the ranks of Britain's biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding £43,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. Burrows had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing Southeastern trains the full amount in unpaid tickets, accrued over five years, within three days of being caught.","Peter Barnett, 43, travelled from Haddenham and Thame to Marylebone .

"You might think opting for a salad or sandwich for lunch will see you on your way to a healthy lifestyle. But in fact sandwiches and pasta salads can contain more fat, calories and sugar than burgers and pizzas. Some apparently healthy meals are worse for you than demonised junk foods from the likes of McDonald’s, Burger King and Pizza Express, researchers have found. Scroll down for video . Some apparently healthy meals are worse for you than demonised junk foods from the likes of McDonald’s, Burger King and Pizza Express, researchers have found . For example, Asda’s Piri Piri Chicken Pasta Salad contains 46.5g of fat – two thirds of the recommended daily intake for an adult – which is more than the 43.3g found in a Burger King Bacon and Cheese Whopper. Meanwhile a Marks & Spencer Chicken and Smoked Bacon Salad sandwich contains 694 calories and 37.1g of fat – but a Pizza Express Classic Margherita pizza has 683 calories and contains only 22.5g of fat. And a 624-calorie Brie and Bacon Panini from Caffè Nero comes in at more than 100 calories higher than a 518-calorie McDonald’s Quarter Pounder with Cheese. Consumer group Which?, which conducted the research, said it was surprised to find that three of the sandwiches it surveyed contained more than three teaspoons of sugar. These included Pret’s Posh Cheddar and Pickle on Artisan, which contains 17.6g of sugar – equivalent to more than four teaspoons. Which? added it was easy for customers to overeat at lunchtime, with dishes such as Morrisons’ Tomato and Basil Chicken Pasta, which states it contains seven servings, often eaten by one person – meaning they consume 683 calories and 38.6g of fat in one sitting. This is more than Burger King’s Chicken Royale with Cheese, which has 648 calories and 37.2g of fat. Which? said its research proves all food suppliers need to adopt the traffic light labelling system, which flags up levels of calories, fat, sugar and salt, to help consumers cut through the confusion and find healthy lunch options.

"Sofia Vergara and her ex fiance Nick Loeb are embroiled in a legal fight over her frozen eggs which they planned to have children with before their bitter split, a new report claims. Loeb has filed a lawsuit in California in a bid to prevent the Modern Family actress from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through IVF, according to InTouch. Vergara’s representatives declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by DailyMail.com on Wednesday. Court documents, filed under pseudonyms Jane and John Doe, detail how the couple fertilized embryos using her eggs and his sperm six months before their split in November 2013. Scroll down for video . Legal fight: A magazine claims Nick Loeb has filed a lawsuit against his ex-fiancee Sofia Vergara in a bid to prevent her from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through IVF, pictured here in 2011 . Loeb, 39, is seeking to ensure the female embryos are not destroyed, but Vergara has refused to 'agree to their preservation under all circumstances,' according to the legal papers. The lawsuit was first filed in August 2014 before it was refiled again on April 1 with updated information and after Loeb sought new legal representation. Another claim in the documents is that, previously, the pair twice had eggs implanted in a surrogate, but the procedure failed. Elsewhere in the lawsuit, it is claimed 42-year-old actress Vergara - who got engaged to True Blood hunk Joe Manganiello on Christmas Day after six months of dating - was 'physically and mentally abusive' to Loeb. Wrangle: The lawsuit has been filed under the pseudonyms John and Jane Doe . No directive: Ultimately, the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge, but it would be unlikely that Loeb would be able to use the embryos without Sofia's consent, according to a legal expert who spoke to InTouch . The documents state: 'She punched him in the face on two occasions, kicked him, and threw her phone at his head. She also routinely bullied him, calling him a ""loser,"" ""worthless"" and other degrading names.' In April 2013 Vergara - who has a 23-year-old son Manolo from her first marriage - spoke publicly about having frozen her eggs and her desire to have more children. She revealed that she and Loeb - who she dated on-off for almost four years - planned to use a surrogate on the account that she had thyroid cancer in 2000 and, as a result, had a lot of radiation. Complicated matter: In this page of the document it states Sofia and Nick were planning on using a gestational surrogate in 2012 to start a family and that Sofia had insisted on using a 44-year-old friend and emloyee . Arduous process: After the first two embryos failed to implant in the first surrogate the couple looked for another suitable candidate . Getting ugly: Page five of the document further details Sofia and Nick's disagreements over the usage and disposal of the embryos and also alleges Sofia was physically, emotionally and mentally abusive to him . InTouch has previously claimed that now Vergara and 38-year-old Manganiello have found a surrogate and plan to have children of their own. The actress recently told Vanity Fair magazine that while having another child would be 'weird', it something she might do if it made Joe happy. She told the magazine: 'My son, Manolo, is 23 years old, which is going to be really weird if I have another baby. But, you know, Joe wants babies and if it's going to make him super-happy, then...' The complicated legal wrangle with Loeb still stands, though. Moving on: The Modern Family actress is now engaged to Joe Manganiello and there are rumours the couple are planning to have children of their own via a surrogate . Other documentation obtained by InTouch which forms part of the lawsuit shows that Jane Doe (Vergara) asked that the embryos be destroyed in the event of her death, while Loeb refused to agree to this condition. No agreement was made between the couple about what would happen to any frozen eggs in the event they ended their relationship. Ultimately, the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge. However legal experts told InTouch that it would be unlikely that Loeb will be able to use the embryos without Sofia's consent.

"A chameleon balances carefully on a branch, waiting calmly for its prey... except that if you look closely, you will see that this picture is not all that it seems. For the 'creature' poised to pounce is not a colourful species of lizard but something altogether more human. Featuring two carefully painted female models, it is a clever piece of sculpture designed to create an amazing illusion. It is the work of Italian artist Johannes Stoetter. Scroll down for video . Can you see us? Italian artist Johannes Stoetter has painted two naked women to look like a chameleon . The 37-year-old has previously transformed his models into frogs and parrots but this may be his most intricate and impressive piece to date. Stoetter daubed water-based body paint on the naked models to create the multicoloured effect, then intertwined them to form the shape of a chameleon. To complete the deception, the models rested on a bench painted to match their skin and held the green branch in the air beneath them. Stoetter can take weeks to plan one of his pieces and hours to paint it. Speaking about The Chameleon, he said: 'I worked about four days to design the motif bigger and paint it with colours. 'The body painting took me about six hours with the help of an assistant. 'I covered the hair with natural clay to make the heads look bald. Camouflage job: A few finishing touches are applied to the two naked models to complete the transformation . 'There are different difficulties on different levels as in every work, but I think that my passion and love to my work is so big, that I figure out a way to deal with difficulties. 'My main inspirations are nature, my personal life-philosophy, every-day-life and people themselves. However, the finished result existed only briefly before the models were able to get up and wash the paint off – with just a video and some photographs to record it. The artist added:   'I think that body painting is a good way to learn to let something go, to separate from something. That happens again and again in life and it is good to be able to handle with it. 'Also the fast end of the artwork makes us perceive it in a much more intensive way.' But there is one way in which the chameleon can still claim to be the unchallenged master of disguise. Unlike the real thing, Stoetter's models can't change their colour – unless he gets his paintbrush out.","Johannes Stoetter's artwork features two carefully painted female models .

"The nation's first ever set of all-girl quintuplets is 'doing fabulous', according to their mother. Danielle Busby looked tired but ecstatic as she appeared on Today for an interview just a week after giving birth. Olivia Marie, Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Parker Kate and Riley Paige are all still in an incubator at Houston's Woman's Hospital of Texas. But they're getting stronger every day. 'They're doing fabulous. They're so precious and they're doing really, really well,' Danielle said as she beamed holding her husband Adam's hand. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ecstatic: Danielle and Adam Busby said they are still in shock but delighted a week after the birth . 'It was an emotional downpour': Danielle described holding the first of her five all-girl babies . A journey ahead: Adam admitted it was 'overwhelming' changing the babies 'because they're so tiny' Half a dozen girls: Along with their older daughter, Blayke (pictured), they now have six girls . Delivered in only four minutes via c-section, it is the first time the globe has seen all-girl quintuplets since 1969. As the girls are still building strength, she has only managed to hold two of them so far. But the experience was phenomenal. 'It was an emotional downpour,' she said. 'But that feeling when you finally get to hold your baby, there's no better feeling than that.' Adam admitted the logistics of parenting the five infants, as well as their older daughter Blayke, are still a mystery. 'I'm still getting used to changing them in an incu,' he explained. 'It's pretty overwhelming just because they're so tiny.' Alongside them sat their doctors, who revealed the girls are gearing up for their first breastmilk feeding, which will be a major milestone. And as for the mother, she's feeling fine. 'Surprisingly I feel pretty good!' she laughed. 'It's a bit of a shock!' Speaking shortly after the birth last week, Danielle  told KHOU. 'We are so thankful and blessed. And I honestly give all the credit to my God. 'I am so thankful for this wonderful hospital and team of people here, they truly all are amazing.' Dr Alexander Reiter, who delivered the babies at 28 weeks and two days, said the prognosis is good. 'Danielle is a trooper, and her positive attitude definitely shined through the pregnancy and the delivery,' said Dr Reiter to KHOU. Pride: Danielle and Adam Busby with one of their five new little girls at Houston's Woman's Hospital of Texas after Danielle delivered her quintuplets by C-section on April 7 . Welcome to the world: Babies Riley Paige and Parker Kate (right) in their NICU incubators at Houston's Woman's Hospital of Texas .

Sisters: Ava Lane (left) and Olivia Marie (right) sleeping peacefully after being delivered by C-section on April 7 . Mom and dad: Adam and Danielle tend to one of their new daughters. All five girls are doing well and only need minimal amounts of assistance breathing after being born at 7 months last week . Dr Reiter told KHOU that he delivered the baby girls with a team of a dozen other medical personnel including seven board-certified neonatologists. So far the quints are doing well and are getting only 'modest support' to breathe. 'They were all in the appropriate weight range for their gestational age, which is due to their mother's excellent efforts to have the healthiest pregnancy possible,' said Dr Finkowski-Rivera to KHOU. 'They have made a strong start in life, and we are excited to watch them grow and mature.' Born via IVF, the Busbys believe that their new quintuplets and three-year-old daughter Blayke are their miracles. Expanding family: Adam and Danielle already have a three-year-old daughter, Blayke (pictured) who they welcomed into the world via IVF therapy after thinking they might not be able to have children . 'Never would we have imagined the plan that God had for us in our journey to grow our little family.' Speaking in a video posted to their blog on Sunday, the new parents said they were 'overwhelmed and extremely busy' after their daughters' births. 'Riley Paige is the feisty one, always kicking around, always punching around and she is pretty much typically that way,' said Danielle. 'Parker, who was on my upper side on my right side, is just so relaxed. She is content and calm. 'Hazel, is the little bit. She was squished the whole time, so she loves to just keep her arms by her face, just so cute. She has a full head of blonde hair. 'The twins, Olivia Marie, Ava Lane are getting a little fesity and have a wild streak.' 'They are all doing pretty well.' Ready to pop: Danielle gave birth two days after the picture (left) and (right) is prepping for her pre-arranged C-section with her husband Adam . Meet your new sister: Blayke is introduced to one of her five new sisters by mother Danielle at the hospital over the weekend . Beaming dad, Adam said that the main thing for him and the medical team was to keep a careful eye on his little girls over the coming weeks. 'We are gonna need to monitor them,' said Adam on the blog, Itsabuzzworld, that he and Danielle have used to document the pregnancy. When big sister Blayke met her new siblings, the Busby's said their hearts felt like bursting. 'It was so cute, she had her little 'Big Sister' shirt on,' said Danielle. 'We prepared her to see all the tubes in the NICU but she was so great.' 'She did so well and just smiled. She didn't really say much but she just smiled.' Peek-a-boo: Peering into one of the NICU incubators, Blayke stares at her new sister Riley at the Woman's Hospital of Texas . Looking forward, the Busby's admitted the future is going to fun, but tough. 'This week will be an interesting transition,' said Adam. 'We have a lot of changes coming up in the next few days....trying to work out what our new norm is going to be.' To help with the challenges ahead of them, the Busby's have set up a gofundme page. 'One big item that we are going to have to be looking for in the coming weeks is a van,' write Adam and Danielle. 'We don't have a vehicle big enough to bring them home. We are looking at our options, but the Nissan NV passenger van and Ford Transit wagon are on the top of the list so far.'","Danielle and Adam Busby welcomed five girls into the world last week .

"This is the moment a young boy's dream came true when he met his hero R2D2 at a Star Wars convention and the pair danced along the corridor together. The child's infectious giggles can be heard after R2D2 followed him around Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California and the pair began spinning around each other in circles. Clearly a fan, the boy was dressed in a Star Wars t-shirt and had merchandise fixed to his wheelchair to promote the new film, the Force Awakens. A young Star Wars fan giggled in delight when he was approached by his favourite character R2D2 . The robot began turning in time with the boy and he can be heard on video giggling loudly and uncontrollably . In the video, which shows the boy  giggling with delight, the blue and white robot dances approaches him and copies the child as he begins to turn on his wheels. As the youngster makes his way down the corridor the robot follows him and pauses, mirroring the child's every move. He is then heard giggling loudly and uncontrollably as other children watch the pair. Chris Lee, who claimed he was in charge of the robot, wrote on YouTube: 'This was the second interaction that we had with this awesome kid. R2D2 approaches the boy at the convention and begins to copy his actions as he turns in his wheelchair . The robot spins around in time with the young fan, much to his delight when he realises what is happening . As the child speeds off down a corridor R2D2 follows him, beeping loudly and flashing his lights . 'He was having so much fun and laughing continuously. Even his parents and some people in the crowd (me included) started giggling uncontrollably.' He said the child's reaction was one of the highlights of the convention for him. The trailer for Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, which debuted at the event on Thursday, was viewed 88 million times worldwide in the first 24 hours.

"The U.S. Navy has sent a nuclear aircraft carrier and a guided-missile cruiser to the waters near Yemen to help beef up security and join other American ships that are prepared to block Iranian shipments. The USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy left the Persian Gulf on Sunday and are steaming through the Arabian Sea and heading towards Yemen. The vessels are believed to be joining other U.S. ships that are poised to intercept any Iranian ships carrying weapons to the Houthi rebels fighting in Yemen. The Navy has been beefing up its presence in the Gulf of Aden and the southern Arabian Sea amid reports that about eight Iranian ships are heading toward Yemen and possibly carrying arms. The USS Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (background), was dispatched to the Gulf of Aden to blockade an Iranian flotilla carrying arms. The carrier is pictured here with the USS Vicksburg cruiser - similar to the USS Normandy which was also sent to the Gulf of Aden . The guided missile cruiser USS Normandy is pictured here. The cruiser is escorting the Roosevelt to the Gulf of Aden . Navy officials said there are about nine U.S. warships in the region, including cruisers and destroyers carrying teams that can board and search other vessels. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ship movement on the record. But speaking to Reuters on Monday, a Pentagon spokesman  denied the ships were on a mission to intercept Iranian arms shipments. One U.S. official said the presence of the U.S. warships off Yemen give American decision-makers options for action in the event the situation deteriorates. The other U.S. warships in the region include two destroyers, two mine-sweepers and three amphibious ships carrying 2,200 U.S. Marines. The Shi'ite Muslim Houthi are battling government-backed fighters in an effort to take control of the country. The Houthi fighters sidelined the central government after seizing the capital Sana'a in September and expanding across Yemen, which borders oil giant Saudi Arabia. Closing in: The USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy left the Persian Gulf on Sunday (seen on the map) and are heading through the Arabian Sea towards Yemen, according to reports . The U.S. has been providing logistical and intelligence support to a Saudi Arabia-led coalition, which has been launching airstrikes against the Houthis. That air campaign is now in its fourth week. The U.S. Navy generally conducts consensual boardings of ships when needed, including to combat piracy around Africa and the region. So far, however, U.S. naval personnel have not boarded any Iranian vessels since the Yemen conflict began. White House spokesman Josh Earnest would not comment specifically on any Navy movements in Yemeni waters, but said the U.S. has concerns about Iran's 'continued support for the Houthis'. 'We have seen evidence that the Iranians are supplying weapons and other armed support to the Houthis in Yemen,' he said. 'That support will only contribute to greater violence in that country. 'These are exactly the kind of destabilizing activities that we have in mind when we raise concerns about Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East.' He said 'the Iranians are acutely aware of our concerns for their continued support of the Houthis by sending them large shipments of weapons'.","USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Normandy left Persian Gulf on Sunday and are steaming through the Arabian Sea and heading towards Yemen .

"When it comes to yoghurt lids there are typically three types of people: the 'licker', the 'spooner' who scrapes the remaining yoghurt back into the pot, and the 'waster' who throws it away. But a new kind of lid will unite these groups. Called Toyal Lotus, the technology is inspired by the water-repellent nature of a lotus leaf and uses microscopic bumps to stop liquids from sticking. Scroll down for video . The Toyal Lotus technology (right) stops yoghurt from sticking to lids of pots (left). German maker Toyo Aluminium's technology won silver place in the 2013 Du Pont awards for packaging innovation and the firm has teamed up with Japan's Morinaga Milk Industry to bring it to consumers . Maker Toyo Aluminium's technology won silver place in the 2013 Du Pont awards for packaging innovation and the German firm has teamed up with Japan's Morinaga Milk Industry to bring it to consumers. Yoghurts in Morinaga's product line can be opened and the lids peeled off without any liquid left on the surface. Toyo Aluminium claims that the amount of yoghurt that sticks to lids worldwide is the equivalent to the volume of yoghurt consumed in Africa. The technlogy was inspired by lotus leaves (pictured) that repel water to prevent being weighed down by rain, for example. In 1977, German botanist Wilhelm Barthlott studied the surface of a lotus leaf under a microscope and found that instead of having a smooth surface, the leaf was covered in microscopic bumps . These bumps increase the contact angle at which droplets touch the surface, which in turn force the droplets to form into spheres. The bumps also create pockets that push air up. On a lotus leaf this contact angle is typically 150 degrees, while the Toyal Lotus lid's  creates an angle of 170 degrees (illustrated) The inspiration for the lid came from the lotus leaf, hence the name. Lotus leaves repel water to prevent being weighed down by rain, for example. Lotus leaves repel water to prevent being weighed down by rain, for example.

These bumps increase the contact angle at which droplets touch the surface, which in turn force the droplets to form into spheres. The bumps also create pockets that push air up. As a result, these spheres can't fit in between the bumps and  roll off the surface. On a lotus leaf this contact angle is typically 150 degrees, and the higher the angle the higher the level of repellency. This is known as the 'lotus effect' and has inspired a range of hydrophobic and superhydrophobic materials.

"A 46-year-old man has been charged with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and DUI after driving 11 miles and through seven towns with another man on the hood of his car in Pennsylvania. However the driver, Dwayne Harvard, maintains he is not the one who should have been arrested. Harvard claims the man, Steven Sutton, 36, of Pittsburgh, confronted him in the driveway of his home in Springdale, saying he was furious that Harvard was giving  Sutton's girlfriend, Anna Mazzetti, a ride home. 'He took a cinder block and he was trying to hit the truck,' Harvard told WTAE. 'I said, ''calm down. You put the block down''.' Man on board: Dwayne Harvard, 46, had an argument with Steven Sutton, 36, Sunday night and struck Sutton with his 2002 Ford Explorer, driving for 11 miles through Pennsylvania before finally pulling over . Holding on: Sutton managed to stay on the hood as Harvard drove  through Harmar Township, Springdale, Frazier Township, East Deer Township, Tarentum Borough, Fawn Township and into Harrison Township . Incredible: The incident began shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday on McKinley Street in Springdale when the two men began arguing. What happened next spanned 11 miles and seven towns . Charged: Harvard was finally stopped at an exit in Kittanning, and has since been charged with simple assault, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, and DUI . Harvard claims he was 'fearing' for his life and for Mazzetti, so he took off out of his driveway. As he drove off, he sit Sutton with his 2002 Ford Explorer, and Sutton clung to the hood. Harvard proceeded to drive through Harmar Township, Springdale Township, Frazier Township, East Deer Township, Tarentum Borough, Fawn Township and into Harrison Township, all the while with Sutton hanging onto the front of his car. 'I didn't want to stop because if he had a gun, he could shoot either through the window and kill me and also kill her,' he told WTAE. Harvard also told other local TV networks he believed Sutton had a knife. Harvard said he called 911 while driving to report the incident. Argument: The two men started fighting over the fact that Harvard was giving Sutton's girlfriend, Anna Mazzetti (pictured) a ride home, Harvard claims . 'I'm innocent': In an interview with WTAE following his arrest, Harvard said it was not him that should have been arrested, and claimed Sutton had tried to attack him and Mazzetti . 'I called 911 myself and I let him know who I was,' Harvard told WTAE. 'I said, ''Listen, my name is Dwayne Harvard,'' I said, ''I got this guy on my hood''.' Some local police in the communities Harvard was driving through also saw what has happening and followed him . Eventually he was stopped by troopers after pulling off an exit in Kittanning. Police detained and interviewed both me. However they decided to arrest Harvard. Police charged Harvard with simple assault, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, and DUI. He posted bond and was released from jail. Sutton has not been charged.","Dwayne Harvard, 46, charged with simple assault, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, and DUI .

"They are the peculiar concrete markings that have been spotted all across America, prompting hikers and travellers to wonder what on Earth they could mean and where they are pointing to. But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington, Washington County, Utah . The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments . The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail . Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda, Humboldt County . Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route . One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco . The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail. Medicine Bow town in Carbon County has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad . Not all the arrows are in good condition, with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete, such as with this arrow in Mote, Nevada . Pumpernickle n Nevada has its own concrete arrow too, which one again is overlooked by the state's beautiful mountains . In the days before radio and satellite communications, the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way, even in poor weather. While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.' The couple say they have found 102 arrows so far and have set up their website Arrows Across America as part of their photography site dreamsmithphotos.com so fellow fans can share their own pictures and help map where the remaining arrows are. The Smiths told MailOnline Travel: 'We have located 102 arrows or portions of arrows, some are badly deteriorated and not much is left. Arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at Poverty Point, in Utah, but it also has a more recent concrete arrow . A beacon has survived in good condition in New Mexico (left) and at Cottage Grove in Oregon (right) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the Second World War . At Thayer Juntion, in Wyoming, there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers-by . 'Our interest grew out of an email circulating in August 2013, we wanted to know where they were, and set out to find them. 'We have managed to take photos of approximately 40, and have a trip planned this fall to take more photos of some that we were unable to get to last spring. 'Eventually we hope to have photos of all the arrows that we have located, but time and money will dictate how long that will take us. 'Before our research we knew nothing about airways, beacons or concrete arrows, it has been a marvelous journey of discovery and we cannot believe that all of this has been ""forgotten.""'.","Hikers often stumble upon the unusual concrete markers and wonder why they were built .
The arrows directed the first air mail planes across the US to deliver post .
They lay at the bottom of lit beacons and showed pilots the direction to fly in to arrive at the next air field .
While they are no longer used, many lie forgotten until they are found by arrow-hunting fans ."
"A former NFL player has revealed that his mother demanded he pay her one million dollars as the cost for 'raising him for the last 18 years' after he was drafted into the professional league. Phillip Buchanon was a first-round draft pick for the Oakland Raiders, and seventeenth overall, when his mother made the request in 2002. Buchanon, who also played for the Houston Texans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Detroit Lions and Washington Redskins before retiring in 2011, discussed the incident in his recently released book New Money: Stay Rich. 'If my mother taught me anything, it's that this is the most desperate demand that a parent can make on a child,' he wrote in an exclusive excerpt released to Fox Sports. Former NFL player Phillip Buchanon (pictured here playing for the Oakland Raiders) has revealed his mother demanded he pay her one million dollars as the cost 'for raising him for the last 18 years' after he was drafted . 'The covenant of having a child is simply that you give your child everything possible, and they owe you nothing beyond a normal amount of love and respect.' But after years, Buchanon said he realized that his mother and family members were different - especially when money became involved. He told Fox Sports that he wrote the book to make sure 'the next generation of athletes doesn't make the same mistakes' he did when he finally got paid the big NFL bucks. Buchanon said he followed the 'unwritten NFL New Money Millionaire' rule and instead bought his mother a brand new big house, as well as paid for all her finances that did not include food or entertainment. But he soon realized that gift would come with its own problems. Instead of selling her old house, like he advised, Buchanon's mother rented it to his aunt. This left Buchanon paying for mortgage and maintenance payments for both houses for seven years. Buchanon asks rookies to consider certain questions before buying their family 'big-ticket purchases', such as whether the family member would be able to make the payments if they couldn't, or if the family member expected them to pay for upkeep 20 years later. The former football star said his mother never offered him the money she made from her sister's rent, and later blamed him for 'messing up her life' after he kicked her boyfriend out of the house he paid for. 'What she didn't see was that her boyfriend was pimping her and me out,' he wrote. 'He wasn't bringing anything to the table, just taking.' Buchanon said he bought his mother a house instead, which brought its own set of problems for years . Buchanon (pictured playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) said his relatives also asked him for money, claiming they needed a check to pay for repairs and bills . Buchanon said he eventually became fed up and told his mother he would stop paying for her new house's upkeep after he paid off the mortgage. When his mother said the house was too large for her to afford the maintenance, he offered to buy her a smaller house that he would pay for with cash and put in his name, protecting her from loans and giving his brothers and sisters a stable home. Instead, his mother asked for $15,000 in cash. She ended up losing the home. 'She told me that if the new house didn't have space for two living room sets, she didn't want it,' Buchanon writes. Buchanon said he moved out of his house at 17 because he no longer 'felt secure' in a home where his mother let people 'come in and out of the house and take what they wanted'. And the football player said he soon realized it wouldn't just be his mother asking him for money, but his relatives as well, who often had 'family emergencies'. Buchanon (pictured with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers)  moved out of his house at 17 because he no longer 'felt secure' at  home because his mother let people 'come in and out of the house and take what they wanted' Buchanon said at first he would just write his relatives a check, which he said would 'always get cashed' even as the problems never got fixed. That's when Buchanon said he started offering to pay for the 'emergencies' directly to the mechanics or companies the money was supposedly owed to, only to have his relatives say 'forget about it'. Buchanon said he spent 'hundreds of thousands of dollars' before learning how to deal with his family's monetary demands. But he said it was the way his mother treated him that ended up teaching Buchanon 'the most important lessons in life'. 'The mothers and fathers of the world have been rearing their kids for generations - in every culture imaginable - and it's a one-way street when it comes to money,' he writes. 'If they pay you back someday, and you really are going through hard times, then that's just a bonus, a gratuity for being a great mother or father.'","Phillip Buchanon was a first-round draft pick for the Oakland Raiders in 2002 when his mother made what he called the 'desperate demand'

She said: 'We have had a nice warm April and it has been absolutely amazing for sales. 'In April we usually potter around and find our feet, but this year it has been really busy. We did an event last week at Chichester University and sold out of ice creams in 40 minutes. It was just incredible - and it's down to the weather. 'Everybody says people eat ice cream all year round whatever the weather, but they don't. Children want to but adults won't let them. 'We have had our best April ever and I have been in business for 11 years. I would say our turnover for April has trebled.'

He said: 'There has been lots of sunshine around and the temperatures have been pretty decent for this time of year - temperatures have hit 19C in Sussex and 18C in London. 'Generally speaking most places have had some decent sunshine. 'Tomorrow is a good day again in England and Wales, lots of blue skies and sunshine and temperatures in the high teens.' One man took his shirt off to catch some pre-summer rays in a park in London, but rain could hit the capital for Sunday's marathon . Sunbathers were out en masse in the beach in Old Portsmouth, Hampshire, were the sun is expected to last tomorrow and on Wednesday . Caught napping: Taylor Messenger was rudely awoken by friends Gabrielle Thompson and Harriet Crosby, who threw a bucket of cold sea water over him as he slept on the beach at Scarborough . A pair of mothers chat as they push their children through Cannon Hill Park in Birmingham, where flowers are well and truly in bloom . A couple enjoy their lunch in the shadow of the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol as the UK continues to bathe in sunny weather . Kendal, in Cumbria, was treated to a glorious golden glow this morning as dawn broke across the rolling fields outside the market town . It was a less pleasant start to the day for this rower, who was out in fog on the river Cam in Cambridge in the early hours of this morning . Mr Williams added: 'By Thursday a lot more cloud will be around in general and there will be light rain over Scotland. 'For most it will be a dry day still with some sunny spells, but generally that cloud is the herald of slightly more unsettled weather. 'The high pressure that has been dominating for the past few days moves over and we see a bit more of what you would expect this time of year.' Patchy rain and breezier conditions are expected to hit at the weekend, and could bring unsettled conditions as runners line up for the London Marathon.","Britain's heatwave sends ice creams sales soaring - with some vendors seeing a 400 per cent rise in sales .

"Commonplace they may be, but there's nothing ordinary about camellias. Polished evergreen foliage provides a great contrast with brightly coloured flowers and brings life to dull winter gardens. And when the flowers open their '­alabaster petals' — as the novelist Balzac put it — camellias are positively regal. They are easy to grow, but picky about soil. If yours is acid, free-draining and nutritious, they'll thrive, but they mope in alkaline or neutral ground. So, if your soil doesn't suit, plant in containers in ericaceous compost. The polished evergreen foliage of Camellias makes for a great contrast to the brightly coloured flowers . Camellias are amazingly versatile. You can give them free rein or prune to keep them compact. I've seen them trained on walls, bent over arches and even grown as hedging. Tender kinds such as C. reticulata make outstanding conservatory plants. Camellias are happy in sun or shade and grow as readily among other shrubs as in isolation. Though frost will damage open flowers, the buds and plants of most are bone hardy. And unlike other spring shrubs, camellias stagger their flowering over a long time. PERFECT FOR POTS . Potted camellias won't last as long as those in the ground. They tend to lose their youthful charm after five or six years, but are not difficult to propagate. If you don't want to buy new, take root cuttings and bring them on as replacements. The best time to take cuttings is between September and February, but you can try it now. Select healthy young shoots for leaf bud cuttings. Snip out sections, each with a single leaf and a little bud by the leaf stalk. Sever each stem just above that bud and again an inch below the leaf. Put the cutting in a mix of potting compost and grit or Perlite and place in a cold frame or propagator. This is also a good time to buy camellia plants. You can see them in flower, select your favourites and enjoy this year's display. The choice is vast, with 250 wild species and hundreds more garden varieties. Camellia japonica — native to cooler regions of China, Japan and Korea — has given rise to the hardiest and prettiest. I grow sumptuous red semidouble Adolphe Audusson and single white Alba Simplex, which thrive in containers in our bracing Lincolnshire climate. The Williamsii hybrids are also gorgeous. Developed in the Twenties by J. C. Williams, the former owner of Caerhays Castle in Cornwall, they have a greatly extended flowering season. I grow the first-named of his progeny, St Ewe. If the weather is mild, the single pink flowers appear in midwinter and continue until April. PINK AND PERKY . You may not have heard of St Ewe, but you're likely to know Donation, Britain's most popular Camellia variety. The semi-double, subtly veined pink flowers have a translucent alabaster gleam and it never stints on flower numbers. If your soil is borderline acid, Williamsii camellias, such as Donation, seem to do best. Each spring, work sulphur powder into the ground round the plants at 200g per square metre to boost acidity. And feed camellias — as well as other lime-haters — with chelated iron tonic. Otherwise, problems are few. Premature bud drop is caused by lack of water in summer, so keep the potting compost moist. Yellowing foliage signals a magnesium deficiency, but you can cure that with Epsom salts. Dissolve 20g per litre of water and sprinkle on the leaves and the ground around the plant. If, in mid-spring, your bush is disfigured by too many dead flowers, grab the main stems and give them an energetic shake. A storm of dead petals and debris will fly in all directions — but the buds will be unharmed and a glorious new display will be imminent.","The Camellias evergreen foliage provides a contrast to the bright flowers .

"The baby boom generation is set to leave a wave of funeral debt to its children and grandchildren, a report warns. The number of deaths every year in Britain – which have been falling for the past 40 years – will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as the lives of unprecedented numbers born in the post-baby boom come to an end. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Loss of baby boomers: The number of UK deaths per will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past ten years . The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.’ Expensive end: A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, an old age think tank has found . It added: ‘This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.’ Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: ‘More than half of UK households have less than £3,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. ‘We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.’ The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost £2,000 more. An average ‘full works’ funeral now costs £5,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from £102 to £160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.","Number of UK deaths per will rise by 20% over the next two decades .

"A duffel bag containing human remains was found outside a biotechnology building in Cambridge on Saturday morning, and one person was later arrested in connection with the grisly discovery, authorities said. The duffel bag was found shortly before 8am near a building used by biotechnology company Biogen Inc. and a block from a police station, Middlesex District Attorney Marian T. Ryan said. Video surveillance of the area led police to an apartment complex across the street where additional human remains were found in a common area, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Police investigated the scene after human remains were discovered at about 8am on Saturday near a biotechnology company's building in Cambridge, Massachusetts . All of the remains are believed to belong to one person, whose death is being treated as a homicide, Ryan said. She announced at an evening news conference that a person had been arrested in the case but provided no details. The name of the victim also was not released. Ryan said the person under arrest would be arraigned Monday in Cambridge District Court on charges of being an accessory after the crime of assault and battery and improper disposal of human remains. Authorities stopped short of saying whether they believed the person arrested was the killer. During a news conference police announced that a person has been arrested in the case but no details have been released . Surveillance footage led police to this pictured apartment building, where more human remains - believed to belong to the same victim - were found in a common area . 'We don't think there's a threat to the community at this point in time,' Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert Haas said. The neighborhood where the duffel bag was found includes Kendall Square near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Square. The Biogen building was cordoned off with caution tape Saturday morning as investigators examined the bag. A spokesman for Biogen referred all inquiries to police. The chief assured residents of the apartment building that they were safe and said officers would remain there for the rest of the evening. Residents who left the building were allowed to re-enter only after showing proof they lived there; officers would then escort them to their apartments.","Bag was found outside Biogen Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts Saturday .

"The latest lover of a notorious father-of-40 has revealed how the pair can't keep their hands off each other - and she's the only woman he now needs for sex. Diane Morris, 46, is engaged to Mike Holpin, 56, who has shamelessly boasted of having children with 20 different women. Ms Morris has brushed off claims that her partner uses dating site Plenty of Fish to meet more women for casual sex, claiming the two are 'crazy about each other' and that she trusts him 'completely'. Scroll down for video . Diane Morris (right) claims her and Mike Holpin's sex life is 'great' and has brushed off claims he still uses dating website Plenty of Fish despite their engagement . Ms Morris also said the two are 'crazy for each other' and it doesn't bother her that he's been married three times before . She said: 'Mike and I have a great sex life. It used to be once a day when we got together but now we are at it like every other day. 'Things are fantastic between us in that department. I trust Mike completely and I know his womanising days are over. 'So what if he's been married three times before but I know this time it is forever. We are crazy for each other.' Mr Hopin, a former alcoholic of Ebbw Vale, South Wales, was strongly criticised after admitting he didn't even know the name of some of his 40 children. And Ms Morris said there would not be any more children for the couple. She said: 'Mike would love to have more kids but unfortunately I can't due to medical reasons.' Ms Morris has a 28-year-old son from a previous relationship and met Mr Holpin through Plenty Of fish in 2012 - and he's still on the site. She says: 'His profile on Plenty of Fish might be active but I know Mike wouldn't dream of cheating on me. 'I had been single for years and I was instantly attracted to Mike. He had lovely blue eyes and he was so charming and witty.' She added it 'blew her away' when he revealed how many children he had fathered, but she 'appreciated his honesty'. She met the former fairground worker - whose favourite chat-up line is 'fancy a rump?' - a few weeks after meeting online. Mr Holpin pictured during an appearance on the TV show This Morning late last month . 'We had a cup of tea and a chat back at his place and he showed me pictures of his kids. He was open about his womanising past but he didn't tell me straightaway that he had around 40 kids. 'I have to admit I was stunned when he first told me but by then I was falling for him.' They pair are now inseparable and spend their days watching horror films and going for long walks. After a year the couple moved in together and got engaged. Now the loved-up pair can't wait to tie the knot - the fourth time for Mr Holpin. Ms Morris said: 'I was overjoyed when he proposed but we haven't set a date yet. We're saving £50 a month and it will a low key affair at a registry office. Of course we will invite all the kids but it's up to them if they want to come.' He has been accused of playing computer games for up to 20 hours a day but Ms Morris insists he is a model fiance. She said: 'Mike is on his computer a lot but he always helps me around the house. He mops the floors and chops the vegetables for dinner.' Mr Holpin has been receiving benefits for 13 years and admits his £195 a week handouts on his 20-a-day smoking habit, as well as owning games consoles and widescreen TV's. Ms Morris hasn't worked since her 20's due to suffering from bipolar disorder. 'Mike is an amazing dad and is always there for the kids. He is always around if they need to talk - that's much more important than material goods.' She added she can't wait to be the fourth Mrs Holpin, and said: 'People might think I am mad but I really don't care.

"It is perhaps the most iconic ship of all time, but the closest most people will get to the Titanic is a visit to the museum in Belfast, or a viewing of the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet blockbuster. Not so for those with endless funds. One company is offering the chance to dive 12,500ft below the surface of the sea to explore the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic. The tour takes in sights like the famous grand staircase, the ship's huge anchors and the Marconi Room, from which the world's very first SOS was broadcast. The once-in-a-lifetime privilege is being offered by luxury concierge service, Bluefish, and does not come cheap, setting you back a whopping £41,000 ($60,000). Unique experience: Travel to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the wreck of the Titanic with concierge service Bluefish . Haunting: Beams of light illuminate the features of the tragic ship, which sank on April 14, 1912 . A port side forward expansion joint on the boat deck of the bow section of the shipwreck. Travellers will learn about the ship in a series of lectures in addition to the dive . The hefty price may seem like a lot but more than 40 people have so far booked the trip to the Atlantic Ocean depths. Director of Bluefish, Steve Sims said: 'We have sent over 40 people down and they have been housewives to technology billionaires, the Titanic really does capture the minds of a wide crowd. 'Bluefish is known for providing the amazing and rare and the Titanic fits both those criteria. 'More people have been into space than set eyes on the Titanic.' Guests will stay aboard the Akademik Keldysh ship at sea and wait for suitable conditions to see the Titanic up close. The transport to the ocean floor is a MIR I or II submersible which are capable of reaching ocean depths of 20,000 ft (98 per cent of the ocean floor worldwide) and withstanding intense pressure. The submersible is constructed of nickel steel and can hold one pilot and two passengers, providing a personal encounter of the vessel. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship. As well as this divers can spot harrowing personal items such as shoes or bags caught between the metal rust, which serve as a poignant reminder of the tragic human loss. The starboard railing near the bow of the Titanic. Expeditions take place in a MIR I or II submersible, which is able to withstand the water pressure 12500ft below the surface . The wreck of the Titanic is situated around 676 kilometres from Newfoundland, almost four kilometres below the surface . Not only does the trip offer a truly unique ocean expedition, but it also offers the chance to learn about the majestic vessel in depth. You will take part in a series of lectures and briefings, revealing latest findings about the 269 metre-long liner. There will also be a ceremony commemorating the tragic events and remembering all those who lost their lives on April 14, 1912. Meals, accommodation and personal video are also included in the somewhat hefty price tag. The RV Keldysh and MIRs have made over 15 expeditions to the site of the wreck and have made over a hundred dives. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship . Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! More people have been to space than have explored the Titanic, and the dives aim to collect data for scientific experiments . The aim of the dives is not just tourism, but also obtaining imagery from the site, data and physical samples from the wreck to further research and be used in ongoing scientific experiments being conducted by worldwide scientists . Since Deep Ocean Expeditions began dives to the wreck in 1998 no artefacts have been removed from the site . However it hasn't been plain sailing for Bluefish trips to see the famous ship. Only eight people took the voyage between 2002 and 2006 and after the recession put a strain on luxury spending. 'The recession hit and everything went to pot,' Simms told CNN Money. After years of fruitless searching by many organisations the wreck of the RMS Titanic was found by Dr Robert Ballard in 1986. Since that time multiple dives have been conducted by some of the world’s five deep diving submersibles, representing France, USA and Russia . Now the service has picked back up and guests can experience the whole package, or opt to have everything apart from the dive to the wreck, for £6,820 ($10,000). The bespoke concierge service offers a range of elaborate services, besides the Titanic expedition. Whether it is racing half a million dollars Mercedes in the Mojave Desert, a Virgin Galactic flight into space, or having a James Bond experience in Monaco with Bond girls and being rescued by American Navy Seals, Simms sees no challenge as impossible for the right clients. The luxury does not come cheap, with membership to the club being £3,414 ($5,000) per annum before you have forked out for any experience. Star-crossed lovers! Many were captivated by the James Cameron film, released in 1997, which saw the affluent Rose (played by Kate Winslet) fall in love with poor Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) on the Titanic's fateful voyage .","Concierge service Bluefish are offering dives to journey to the magnificent ship on the Atlantic floor .

"A boy of 11 is among children arrested over a spate of fires across Welsh countryside which have cost £500,000 to fight. Five children were questioned by police after 623 fires ravaged 600 acres of fields and woodland this month alone. Fire crews in South Wales say they have been stretched to breaking point by the ‘unprecedented’ scale of destruction, which is mainly being blamed on gangs of youngsters. Five children have been questioned after 623 fires ravaged 600 acres of fields and woodland in one month . Officers yesterday called on parents to report their children if they suspect them of lighting fires. Deputy Chief Constable Matt Jukes, of South Wales Police, said: ‘It is only a matter of time before somebody gets seriously injured or even killed. ‘What is most concerning is that we believe that many of these grass fires are being caused by children. This must be addressed and everybody can do their bit.’ ‘Teachers, neighbours, shop owners, but most importantly parents or carers have a role to play and can make a stand against this recurring problem.’ DCC Jukes added: ‘The sad reality is that because of the naïve and reckless actions of some of the youngest members of the community, the lives of those who need the emergency services most are being put at serious risk.’ From Friday morning to Monday evening, emergency services took more than 1,600 calls for grass fires. Gordon Shumack, of Crimestoppers Wales, said: ‘The valleys are turning black again as a result of these fires being deliberately started.’ The cost of fighting the blazes, which devastated wildlife, has risen close to £500,000 since the month began. Fire chief Stephen Rossiter said: ‘The natural terrain of mountains is very dangerous underfoot, and more so when we are fighting grass fires – even for our best-trained people.’ South Wales: Gordon Shumack said the valleys were turning black as a result of the deliberately started fires . ‘It is quite possible a house will catch fire if the incidents continue. People lighting them need to understand the danger they can cause.’ The arrested 11-year-old was given ‘stern’ advice by police. Four suspects aged 12 to 14 were released on bail. It comes as the dry and sunny weather has left heathlands especially vulnerable to fast spreading fire. Meanwhile a blaze which ravaged the Pirbright Army ranges in Surrey was yesterday still smouldering nearly a week after it began. Conservation experts say that the area could take ten years to recover. A man, 33, has been arrested and released on bail over the fire.","Fire crews in South Wales stretched to breaking point by wave of wildfires .

"A rare black flamingo amazed bird watchers when it was spotted feeding among a group of the traditionally pink birds in Cyprus. The migratory bird was spotted at a salt lake near the British RAF base at Akrotiri on the island's south coast close to the resort city of Limassol. Normally, the graceful birds have a pink hue caused by the levels of beto-Carotene in their diet. Scroll down for video . Ruffling feathers: The unusual black flamingo was spotted near the coastal city of Limassol on Cyprus by birdwatchers . Alexia Perdiou, the base's assistant environment officer, said it could be one-of-a-kind. 'Of course we are all very excited because we believe it could be the only flamingo of its kind in the world and very little is known about it,' she said. 'We are expecting a lot of visitors over the next few days.' A black flamingo was reportedly last spotted in Israel in 2014 and aside from its colour, it is no different to the hundreds of pink flamingos which flock to the salt lakes of Cyprus every spring. Experts believe a rare genetic irregularity known as ""melanism"" can generate more melanin than usual, turning a flamingo's feathers a dark colour. Migrating: The bird looked very healthy despite its unusual hue and is believed to be heading to Turkey to breed . Martin Hellicar of the conservation group BirdLife Cyprus said the black-coloured flamingo was not unique, though acknowledged they were uncommon in the Mediterranean. He said it was probably migrating to its breeding area in Turkey after spending the winter elsewhere. He added that the flamingo stopped on its journey in the salt lake to feed on brine shrimp.","Bird watchers photographed the rare bird near British RAF base at Akrotiri on the island's south coast .

"The oldest active pilot is a 95-year-old man living in Cameron Park, California. Guinness World Records has confirmed Peter Weber Jr.'s feat, the Sacramento Bee reported. 'I'm overwhelmed,' Weber told the newspaper. 'I'm getting all kinds of phone calls, emails and all that stuff.' Pilot: The oldest active pilot is a 95-year-old Peter Weber Jr., it's been revealed (March 2015 photo) Active: Weber has said he flies 'at least twice a month.' He also still has his driver's license (March 2015 file photo) The record was confirmed after Weber proved he piloted a plane March 30 in Placerville by mailing in multiple pieces of evidence, according to the Sacramento Bee. The newspaper reported that Weber's flight experience goes back decades: he flew in both World War II and the Vietnam War, and also served as a Korean War flight instructor. All told, Guinness World Records says on its website that 'Peter has been a pilot for 72 years.' According to Guinness, Weber was a flight cadet in 1943. 'Peter went on to become a Lieutenant Colonel in the US Air Force,' the website says. 'He retired from the Air Force in 1970, and since then has flown for recreational purposes.' Weber pulled off his March 30 flight at the age of 95 years and 143 days, Guinness says. Weber told the Sacramento Bee in March 'The reason I did it is because I though maybe I might have the record be - being the fact my age is 95 years, 4 months and 23 days.' Years of experience: Weber reportedly was a flight cadet in 1943 and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1970 (March 2015 file photo) At the time, he said that Guinness recently made a new category for the oldest qualified pilot who still has a license and flies alone while speaking to the newspaper. Weber has been married to his wife since 1943 and is a father to a 70-year-old son, according to reports. The Sacramento Bee reported Weber still has his driver's license -- and also pointed out that a since-deceased 105-year-old Colorado man holds the record for being the oldest pilot ever, according to Guinness. Cole Kugel's final flight took place in 2007 before he died that June, Guinness says.","95-year-old Peter Weber Jr. is the oldest active pilot, according to Guinness World Records .

"British police helped Australian officials foil a suspected Lee Rigby-style terror attack on police during First World War commemorations, it emerged today. A 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire was arrested after he allegedly communicated with Australian men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day, which takes place this Saturday. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Police are now working to shore up security for a string of Anzac Day events taking place in London, including services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey to be attended by the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince William. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Police have arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of helping to plot a terror attack in Australia (file photo) Greater Manchester Police said today that the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia, and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences. It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death, in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago. A security official told ABC that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves. The alleged plot is similar to the killing of Fusilier Rigby, who was run over by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale outside his barracks in Woolwich before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him. Attack: Sevdet Besim, pictured, has been charged with planning an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day . Arrest: A suburban house in Melbourne where one of the alleged terrorist plotters was arrested on Saturday . Tony Mole, from the North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said today: 'We have uncovered communication between an individual in the North West and a man in Australia to what we believe is a credible terrorist threat. 'As soon as this information came to light we acted quickly with the relevant authorities here and abroad and this has resulted with officers from the NWCTU arresting a teenager. 'The nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation. 'We are continuing to work closely with the police in Australia and Lancashire and I want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the UK and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of Lancashire, the North-West and the UK.' Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' In the wake of the Melbourne arrests, Australian officials have ramped up security for Anzac Day events, while police in Britain  are reviewing the arrangements for Anzac Day celebrations in the UK. This year's commemorations are considered particularly significant, as April 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign, which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from Australia and New Zealand. Horrors: Soldiers pictured during the Gallipoli campaign, which left thousands of Allied troops dead . Commemoration: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh pictured laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in 1990, the 75th anniversary of the campaign; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on Saturday . London is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on Saturday - a dawn service at Hyde Park Corner, a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service. Security is already set to be high at all three events, with those attending told to carry photographic ID, but it could be ramped up further after the recent terror arrests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said over the weekend: 'Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia, we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK. 'We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers. 'While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant.' At least 50 events commemorating Anzac Day are set to take place in other parts of the UK this weekend, including services at Manchester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and Oxford University. Australian police said on Saturday that Sevdet Besim and another 18-year-old were planning to use 'edged weapons' to attack officers in Melbourne while Anzac Day celebrations are taking place. The teenagers were said to be inspired by Islamic extremist Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police in September last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a Melbourne police station. Like Britain, Australia has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would-be jihadists as the rise of ISIS has attracted young Australians to fight in the Middle East and plot terror attacks at home.

"Dozens of Jet Airways passengers experienced some frightening moments today when a plane’s landing gear appeared to collapse as it touched down at an airport in India. The plane, carrying 59 passengers and eight crew members, tilted to one side and its left engine scraped along the runway in Khajuraho. The crew ordered an evacuation after the Boeing 737-800 came to a stop, and passengers slid down the plane’s inflatable slides to safety. Photos provided by a journalist show the plane tilting to one side and its left engine touching the runway . In statements posted on Twitter, Jet Airways described it as ‘a technical problem with the landing gear’ and said reports of a fire are untrue. Passengers spotted smoke outside the plane when the left wing landing gear collapsed, Indian media reported. The incident occurred as flight 9W2423 arrived at the airport in Khajuraho, about 375 miles south-east of Delhi in the state of Madhya Pradesh, from Varanasi, a 45-minute journey. After a brief stop in Varanasi the plane was scheduled to continue to Delhi. Photos provided to MailOnline Travel by a Live India journalist show the plane tilting to the left, with its left engine touching the runway and its emergency slides deployed. Passengers were forced to exit the Boeing 737-800 via its inflatable evacuation slides . Jet Airways said in a statement: ‘Safety chutes were deployed and all 59 passengers and eight crew on board the aircraft disembarked safely and were transferred to the terminal. ‘Jet Airways is making arrangements to transfer outbound guests to Varanasi and Delhi. ‘An additional flight is also being operated on the Delhi-Varanasi sector to assist in accommodating the outbound guests.’ The Mumbai-based airline said India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is responsible for investigating aviation accidents and incidents, has been informed. It added: ‘The safety of passengers is the airline’s number one priority and Jet Airways will be working closely with the authorities during the investigation into the cause of this incident.’ A government official told the Indian Express that no one was injured, but the runway is expected to be closed for 48 hours.","Incident occurred as the Boeing 737-800 landed at Khajuraho airport .

"Dementia could soon be treated with a 'brain pacemaker' inserted directly into the skull, according to new research. Scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation (DBS), a technique already used to treat Parkinson's disease, can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed. A 'pacemaker' fitted with electrodes is inserted into the brain through holes drilled in the skull. Deep brain stimulation is already used to treat Parkinson's, but now researchers now believe it could be used to improve brain function and ward off diseases such as dementia (file image) Experiments on rats found the therapy improved their powers of recall, and it is hoped the same will apply to humans. The device sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain and has also been shown to provide benefits for a range of conditions including chronic pain, major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. The device was implanted into middle aged rats, sending out minute electrical impulses, and the study found the animals performed better in memory tests compared to those who had not been stimulated, even after 24 hours. Professor Ajai Vyas, of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, said: 'Extensive studies have shown that rats' brains and memory systems are very similar to humans. 'The electrodes are harmless to the rats, as they go on to live normally and fulfil their regular adult lifespan of around 22 months.' DBS is a surgical procedure that has become an established NHS treatment  for Parkinson's sufferers whose condition does not respond to drugs. Tests on lab mice showed improved memory within just 24 hours, while the rodents' life-spans were unaffected (file image) Now the new research, published in the journal eLife, has discovered it could also be used to enhance the growth of brain cells which relieves the harmful effects of dementia related conditions and improves short and long term memory. It found new brain cells, or neurons, can be formed by stimulating the front part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex which is involved in memory retention using minute amounts of electricity. The increase in brain cells reduces anxiety and depression, promotes improved learning, and boosts overall memory formation and retention. Prof Vyas said: 'The findings from the research clearly show the potential of enhancing the growth of brain cells using deep brain stimulation. 'Around 60 per cent of patients do not respond to regular anti depressant treatments and our research opens new doors for more effective treatment options.' Prof Lim Lee Wei, of Sunway University, Malaysia, who worked on the project while he was at Nanyang Technological University, said DBS brings multiple benefits. He said: 'No negative effects have been reported in such prefrontal cortex stimulation in humans and studies have shown that stimulation also produces anti depression effects and reduces anxiety. 'Memory loss in older people is not only a serious and widespread problem, but signifies a key symptom of dementia. 'At least one in 10 people aged 60 and above in Singapore suffer from dementia and this breakthrough could pave the way towards improved treatments for patients.' For decades, scientists have been finding ways to generate brain cells to treat brain trauma and injury, and age related diseases such as dementia. As part of a natural cycle, brain cells constantly die and get replaced by new ones. The area of the brain responsible for generating new brain cells is known as the hippocampus, which is also involved in memory forming, organising and retention. By stimulating the prefrontal cortex, new brain cells are formed in the hippocampus although it had not been directly stimulated.","Deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes inside the skull .

"Fashion designer Alannah Hill is the least likely candidate for skin cancer as she prides herself on her alabaster skin - even going to the extremes of wearing gloves and using a parasol to protect her from the sun. Therefore it was a blessing in disguise when she broke her foot after attempting the shoo her dog out of the way and went to the doctor who spotted a tiny freckle on her fourth toe of her left foot. The Tasmanian-born designer was diagnosed with an invasive malignant melanoma and if she had waited another three months the cancer would likely have spread and become terminal but thankfully she now has a 'very good' prognosis. This from a woman who never even wore thongs or sandals - footwear that is a permanent fixture on Aussies throughout the long hot summers. Hill had no intention of going public about her shocking story until her doctor encouraged her to speak out to educate others on the disease that affects almost half a million people every year in Australia. Alannah Hill was diagnosed with an invasive malignant melanomaHill has had part of her toe removed and a skin graft from her inner thigh . She still remembers receiving the phone call from the doctor's surgery like it was yesterday. 'Hello Alannah, could you come back to the surgery please? We have something we need to talk about,' she told Fairfax Media. 'The flipping over of my heart could be heard for miles.' Hill has had part of her toe removed and a skin graft from her inner thigh and then after about a week doctors will decide if she needs anymore treatment. Alannah Hill, who has never had more than three weeks off, is taking three months off to recuperate . Upon her doctor's insistence, Hill is taking a three-month break from her new clothing label - Louise Love - she severed all ties with her famous namesake label, that she started two decades ago, in 2013. Hill admitted that she hadn't got around to getting her freckle checked due to her busy lifestyle. 'The main thing to remember – and I can't stress this enough – is that we all, unfortunately, believe we are invincible,' she said. 'No matter how small your little mole is, no matter how insignificant it looks, go to your doctor and get it checked.' Hill couldn't stress enough how humans have a bad habit of feeling invincible. She said her reason for not wanting to talk about her cancer was that she didn't want people to pity her. But her doctor urged her to get the 'message out' after telling Hill heart-wrenching stories about all of the patients he has seen who had left it too late. Hill who admits to not having time to get your freckle checked, is telling her story to warn others .","Alannah Hill broke her foot after shooing her dog and hitting skirting board .

"There is an old wives' tale that says the best way to tackle red wine stains on carpets and clothes is to cover them in white wine. And while alcohol is the key to removing a spilled glass, the solution doesn't lie in a glass of Pino Grigio. In a video, a scientist has revealed how gin and vodka dilute red wine stains, why vinegar is so good at removing mineral deposits on glass, and how spit tackles stubborn food stains in your kitchen. Scroll down for video . Red wine is red because of pigments known as anthocyanins, which are alcohol soluble. When higher concentrations of clear alcohol, such as gin, vodka or white rum, are poured onto the stain, the colours dissolve into the liquid rather than drying into the carpet. These can then be soaked up using a paper towel . The video was created by the Washington-based American Chemical Society (ACS) as part of its Reactions series. It covers three household cleaning 'hacks' for windows, carpets and counter tops. The first reveals an alternative to window cleaner is to add two cups of water and a quarter cup of 70 per cent rubbing alcohol to an empty spray bottle. As the video explained: 'Vinegar is a fantastic cleaner and the secret to its cleaning capacity is acetic acid.' Gin: Pour gin, or another high-proof clear liquor, onto a red wine stain and soak it up with a cloth. Spit: Your own spit can be used to lift food stains from counter tops or hard surfaces. Bananas: Wipe the inside of the banana skin on the spot of leather that needs to be cleaned. When finished, rub with a damp cloth. Cola: Pour into the toilet bowl and leave to sit for an hour to allow the acid to take effect. Clean the inside of the bowl with a toilet brush and flush away. Vinegar also works. Tomato ketchup: Good for cleaning brass, copper and silver elements. Rub onto the area that needs cleaning, leave to work and wipe with a moist cloth. Mayonnaise: Ideal for removing marks on wood. Use a cloth with a small amount of mayonnaise and wipe the mark that needs to be removed. Leave the oils to work and wipe away any residue with a clean cloth. Brazil nuts: Also effective on wood surfaces. Cut a nut in half and rub vigorously over any scratches. Potatoes: Cut the potato in half and dip the side without peel into baking soda. When covered, firmly rub the potato on rusted areas. Grapefruit: Remove limescale by cutting the grapefruit in half and sprinkling one half with salt. Scrub the area and rinse with water. Coffee: Place dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid. Place in the fridge and leave to eliminate odour. Acetic acid sits at a 2.4 on the pH scale making it very acidic. Because of this acidity, vinegar ‘eats away’ at mineral deposits on windows including moisture and dust, while the rubbing alcohol absorbs greasy dirt like fingerprints. Onto red wine stains in fabrics, the video said the key is to 'act fast and grab a bottle of the nearest high proof clear liquor'. This can be vodka, gin or white rum, but the important part is that whichever drink is chosen it must be higher proof than the wine that has been spilled. Keep applying it to the stain while soaking the liquid up with a rag or paper towel until it’s all gone. Red wine is red because of pigments known as anthocyanins, which are alcohol soluble. When higher concentrations of alcohol are poured onto the stain, the colours dissolve into the liquid rather than drying into the carpet. As more alcohol is poured onto to the stain, the red colour dilutes completely and can be soaked up. ACS advise pouring plain water onto the carpet once the alcohol has been soaked up to remove the smell. Elsewhere, if there is a hard food stain on a countertop or hard floor, ACS suggest using spit to remove it. Inside saliva is an enzyme called amylase and it’s used as one of the first steps of digestion. Amylase speeds up the process of breaking down starches, for example. 'You may have noticed when you eat certain starchy foods like potatoes or crackers that they have a slightly sweet taste when you chew them,' said ACS. 'That’s the amylase in action and the same principle can be used to break down food spills.' A cleaning expert from Hassle.com recently revealed the science behind why certain foods are so useful for tackling rust, removing stains and tightening cracks in wood, too. The American Chemical Society (ACS) has produced a video as part of its Reactions series that covers three household cleaning 'hacks'. These include how to get streak-free windows, remove red wine stains from carpets (pictured) and clean stubborn food stains from counter tops and hard surfaces . Alex Depledge, Hassle.com's chief executive told MailOnline that tomato ketchup is good for cleaning brass, copper and silver elements. 'Tarnishing mainly occurs due to sulphur compounds in the air,' she said. 'When the ketchup is applied to the metal, the natural acid in the tomatoes reacts with the oxidising of the tarnished silver, brass or copper.' 'Potatoes and baking soda are effective at tackling rust because the oxalic acid in the potato mixes with the baking soda to help to dissolve the rust.' An alternative to window cleaner is to take an empty bottle and add two cups of water and a quarter cup of 70% rubbing alcohol. As the video explained: 'Vinegar is a fantastic cleaner and the secret to its cleaning capacity is acetic acid.' Acetic acid sits at a 2.4 on the pH scale making it very acidic' (pictured) Because of this acidity, vinegar ‘eats away’ at mineral deposits on windows including moisture and dust, while rubbing alcohol (pictured) absorbs greasy dirt like fingerprints, said the chemist . Even the weakest levels of acid can dissolve and loosen the hydrated iron oxides found in rust. This also means vinegar is a good rust remover. These foods can also replace the rust with a thin film of smooth hard oxide on the surface of the iron, to help it resist further hydrated oxidation. Phosphoric acid in cola drinks, and citric acid in lemon juice also work. 'Banana skins are often used to buff leather, followed by a damp cloth, and this is effective because the potassium in bananas is absorbed and slowly works to plump up the scratches,' Mrs Depledge said. To remove hard food stains on a countertop or hard floor, ACS suggests using spit to remove it. Inside saliva is an enzyme called amylase and it’s used as one of the first steps of digestion (pictured) Amylase speeds up the process of breaking down starches, for example. 'You may have noticed when you eat certain starchy foods like potatoes that they have a slightly sweet taste when you chew them,' said ACS. 'That’s the amylase in action and the same principle can be used to break down food spills' Potassium is often found in shoe polishes too, for the same reason. 'Ideal for removing marks on wood, mayonnaise contains oils and proteins that gently diminish scratches and marks on wood. 'They also react and cause the wood to swell, which tightens cracks in surface. 'The oils in Brazil nuts are also effective and act like a natural die to darken and hide scratches.' Elsewhere, Mrs Depledge added: 'To keep a fridge smelling fresh, experts claim putting dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid will eliminate odours. A cleaning experts has also revealed which food items can be used to clean a home. For example, potatoes remove rust because the oxalic acid reacts with baking soda to dissolve the hydrated iron oxides . Banana skins (stock image pictured) are often used to buff leather, followed by a damp cloth, and this is effective because the potassium in bananas is absorbed and slowly works to plump up the scratches. Potassium is often found in shoe polishes too, for the same reason . 'Smelly substances floating around in the air attach themselves to the surface of coffee beans via a process known as ‘adsorption'. 'Invisible to the naked eye the many tiny pores in a coffee bean create a large surface area, per unit mass. 'This gives, in chemical terms, plenty of area for the smell to adhere itself to and causes it to be cancelled out.' As a subsititute to limescale remover, Mrs Depledge recommends cutting a grapefruit in half and sprinkling one half with salt. The salt acts like an exfoliator to remove the surface limescale, while the citric acid in grapefruit acts as the cleaning agent and breaks down the scale at a more molecular level. And cola drinks are an effective toilet cleaner because they contains carbonic, citric, and phosphoric acids. Many of these acids are found in household cleaning products already, and when mixed together, the reaction causes the stains to be lifted and removed.

"Judges have caused controversy by ordering that the parents of nine children involved in plots to travel to Syria should have their identities hidden. They include three terror suspects who have all previously been named but now cannot be identified to protect their youngsters from the glare of publicity. Also among the parents are a couple who lied to the authorities about losing their daughter’s passport. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Waheed Ahmed, son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed, after being held on the Syrian border . Critics argue that the parents should be named because they could be extremists and therefore a risk to other members of the public. One case involves a family of nine Britons – three men, two women and four children aged between one and 11 – who were caught trying to get into lawless Syria from Turkey last week. The group, from Rochdale, were led by 21-year-old politics undergraduate Waheed Ahmed, the son of Shakil Ahmed – a respected Labour councillor who was photographed with Ed Miliband just months ago. Anonymity orders were granted to shield the children from the glare of publicity. But the draconian orders mean three of the adults must also have their identities hidden even though they are terror suspects. In a separate case, the High Court banned the naming of five girls, aged 15 and 16, who had their passports confiscated after they showed an interest in Islamic extremism. Four attended Bethnal Green Academy in East London while the fifth is home schooled. Counter-terrorism police have taken over the probe into the shooting of a Syrian imam in London amid fears he was murdered by a professional hit squad. Abdul Hadi Arwani, a fierce critic of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, was gunned down in Wembley as he sat in his car. Scotland Yard’s Homicide and Major Crime Command was leading the probe but counter-terrorism officers have taken over due to its potential ‘international dimensions’. They are understood to be examining his links to groups which oppose the Syrian regime. The girls were granted anonymity because they were juveniles. But this means the identities of their parents must also be hidden behind a cloak of secrecy. These include the couple who lied to the authorities about their daughter’s passport. Police and social services had sought to seize it because they were concerned the teenager had been radicalised. Counter-terrorism officers wanted to ensure she did not follow in the footsteps of four other pupils from the school – Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Sharmeena Begum – who ran away to join Islamic State. But when approached by police, social workers and teachers, her mother and father insisted the passport had disappeared and, in any case, had expired. Later, police discovered the girl’s passport remained valid until 2016. A High Court judge said the failure to disclose the truth was ‘manifestly highly relevant’ in the decision to impose a travel ban on the vulnerable child. Mr Justice Hayden, sitting in the family division of the High Court, said: ‘I have no doubt that misinformation about [the girl’s] passport had been given to the school, the police and to the social services, a fact which plainly is relevant in evaluating the matrix of risk.’ Lured to jihad: Kadiza Sultana, 16, left, Shamima Begum, 15, centre, and Amira Abase, 15, right, at Gatwick . He said the parents ‘deliberately did not share [information] with the authorities’. Hannah Stuart, a research fellow for security think-tank the Henry Jackson Society, said granting anonymity to the three Rochdale terror suspects was ‘like trying to put a cat back in a bag’ as they had previously been named. But she said the Bethnal Green schoolgirls should not be named because ‘the stigma will stay with them forever’. She also suggested the parents of one girl lied because of the malign influence of radical extremists and their apologists such as Muslim human rights group Cage, which supported Islamic State killer Jihadi John. ‘These groups foment a belief within the Muslim community, whether out of ignorance or malice, that they should be fearful of the police, of the State, of counter-terrorism policies, and should not co-operate,’ she said.

"Jailed: John Coyne, 56, who ran a central London pub  attacked his 25-year-old victim who had fallen unconscious after a night of drinking in October last year . A pub landlord has been jailed for nine years for raping a man who fell asleep in his bar. John Coyne, 56, who ran the Prince of Wales pub in Harrow Road, central London, attacked his 25-year-old victim who had fallen unconscious after a night of drinking in October last year. Coyne was convicted of rape and engaging in sexual activity without consent and jailed at Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday. The jury heard the victim, who is heterosexual, had been on a night out with friends after finishing work and ended the night at Coyne's pub where he fell asleep on a sofa. The victim then woke at around 3am to find Coyne raping him. Coyne fled and the victim called the police, who seized CCTV footage from the venue that captured the landlord committing his offences. He still denied the crimes but was found guilty by a jury. Police have today urged people to contact them if they believe they have also been attacked by the rapist pub landlord. Detective Constable Neil Hume, the officer in the case, said following the sentencing: 'Coyne abused his position as a landlord of a pub to take advantage of an unconscious customer and showed no remorse. 'I would applaud the victim's bravery attending court and hope that the sentence sends out a clear message.' Detective Inspector Neil Smithson, the senior investigating officer, added: 'The Metropolitan Police are committed to prosecuting sexual offenders. Attack: The victim had been on a night out with friends after finishing work and ended the night at Coyne's pub in Harrow Road, pictured, where he woke to find Coyne raping him . 'Coyne preyed on an unconscious customer whilst in his own pub and I would encourage anyone who believes they may have been a victim at the hands of Coyne to come forward.' The landlord was sentenced to nine years in prison for rape and five   years for causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, to be served concurrently.","John Coyne's victim, 25, woke to find the pub landlord raping him on sofa .

"Kellogg's is the latest US owned multinational to be embroiled in the controversy over tax avoidance in Britain . Kellogg's is the latest US owned multinational to be embroiled in the controversy over tax avoidance in Britain. The cereal giant warned shareholders its profits could be hit by government moves to close tax loopholes. Kellogg’s, which makes hundreds of millions of pounds each year from sales to British families, uses a complex web of companies to do business here. Its two main UK subsidiaries are owned by an operation based in the Republic of Ireland, where corporation tax is 12.5 per cent, compared with the UK’s 20 per cent. The latest figures show Kellogg’s effectively paid no corporation tax in Britain in 2013, as payments to HMRC by some of its offshoots were wiped out by tax credits elsewhere. These tax manoeuvres are perfectly legal. Kellogg’s has so far not faced criticism for its tax affairs in Britain, unlike Google, Amazon and Starbucks, which have come under fire for paying a minimal amount to the Exchequer despite huge sales here. But in its latest annual report the cereal-maker, whose worldwide sales last year hit £9.8billion, admitted ‘contemplated changes in the UK and other countries’ to ‘long established tax principles’ could have a ‘material impact’ on its business. It added VAT increases and other changes ‘may have an adverse effect on our business’. Kellogg’s has produced cereals in the UK since 1938, and says it has several hundred employees here. It sells in the UK through two main subsidiaries owned by Irish-based Kellogg Europe Trading Ltd. One is Kellogg Marketing & Sales, which distributes breakfast food for Irish and Swiss-registered companies, and reported sales of £622million to Britons in 2013. The second, Kellogg Company of Great Britain, makes cereals under contract for an Irish-based operation. These two subsidiaries paid corporation tax of £8.4million on profits of nearly £50million in 2013. Kellogg’s also has six Luxembourg registered companies which collectively paid corporation tax of £210,000 on profits of about £57million – a rate of 0.37 per cent. But this £210,000 and the £8.4million were offset by an £11.8million tax credit at another UK-registered operation, Kellogg Group Ltd. Kellogg’s said comments in its annual report are not related to Chancellor George Osborne’s ‘diverted profits tax’ – which aims to snare companies that shunt profits overseas with the main purpose of saving tax . A Kellogg’s spokesman confirmed the figures but said some profits through the Luxembourg business would relate to companies outside the UK. He declined to comment on whether Kellogg’s accepted it had in effect paid zero corporation tax in Britain, but said it is ‘a responsible taxpayer’. Kellogg’s said comments in its annual report are not related to Chancellor George Osborne’s ‘diverted profits tax’ – which aims to snare companies that shunt profits overseas with the main purpose of saving tax. Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said: ‘It looks as if Kellogg’s is trading in similar fashion to many of the better known tax avoiders.’","Kellogg’s makes hundreds of millions from annual sales to British families .

"A young woman who ate just 10 calories a day while in the grip of anorexia has spoken of how she fought her way back from the brink of death. Beth Hall, 24, from Cambridge, plummeted to a tiny 4st 13lb after battling the horrific eating disorder since her teenage years - while working in a chocolate shop. Tormented by bullies at school, she began a strict diet regime at the age of 16, living off nothing more than black tea and coffee. Determined to lose weight, she would often go for up to three days without eating a single thing. But after years of turmoil, she was finally admitted to an eating disorder clinic. And after making a full recovery, she is now a healthy size 8 and studying graphics at university. Scroll down for video . Beth Hall, now 24, from Cambridge, plummeted to a tiny 4st 13lbs (left) after being bullied at school. She has now gained weight to be a size 8 (right) At the height of her anorexia, Miss Hall would live on just 10 calories a day - or go three days without eating a single thing . Miss Hall said: 'I'm so relieved that I have managed to maintain a healthy weight after battling anorexia. 'It didn't matter how many pounds I dropped, I would always see a fat pig when I looked in the mirror. 'I would ditch my lunch at school and when my mum was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2008 I was able to disguise my eating habits as she was having treatment in hospital.' She admits she would go up to three days without eating a single thing - but remained adamant there was nothing wrong with her. 'I lived on black coffee and tea which is around 10 calories per day, I was starving my body so badly that I couldn't even think straight,' she recalled. Miss Hall was forced to drop out of university in 2009 after her eating disorder took control of her life and she struggled to cope with the work load. She added: 'I couldn't focus on anything but food, my illness was completely out of control and I was getting thinner and thinner by the day. 'I eventually got a job as a sales assistant, ironically in a chocolate shop but I was so weak and I didn't know how much more my body would take.' Then in 2011, she developed a kidney infection, leading doctors to warn she was risking her life by starving her body. Beth said: 'The doctor told me he could feel all my organs underneath my skin and that I would end up killing myself if my eating didn't improve. 'I suddenly realised that I needed help and at just 4st 13lbs, I was admitted to an eating disorder ward once my kidney infection cleared up. She said: 'I lived on black coffee and tea which is around 10 calories per day, I was starving my body so badly that I couldn't even think straight'. Miss Hall is pictured now at a healthy weight . It was only when a doctor warned he could feel all of her organs underneath her skin - and that she would end up killing herself if she didn't eat - that she sought help . 'I hated having to gain weight and eating the meals they had given me but I knew I needed to be there.' This, combined with daily group therapy sessions, saw her begin to make progress - and after four months at the eating disorder clinic, she was allowed home. 'I was finally in control of my own meals again and could attend the therapy sessions as an outpatient,' said Miss Hall. Despite suffering a relapse one year later she is now back at university and working part-time. She said: 'I'm now studying graphic design at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. 'I did suffer a relapse, but the therapy sessions gave me the coping skills I needed to get my eating habits back under control.' She added: 'My whole family, including my younger sister, Georgina, were so worried about me when my weight dropped so drastically. 'It has been a massive relief for everyone that I have been able to get my weight under control and that I'm a healthy size 8. 'I know my illness will always be there but I know how to deal with it all now. 'I hope other girls who read my story are able to gain hope from everything I have achieved. 'There is always help available and, despite how isolated you feel, things will get better and you can overcome an eating disorder.' Miss Hall said: 'I hope other girls who read my story are able to gain hope from everything I have achieved.

"Two 18-month-old twins drowned in a canal in Arizona after their mother tried to swat away a bee and let go of their stroller, police in Yuma said. Alexis Keslar was walking with her sons, Eli and Silas Keslar along the canal bank on Friday when she was distracted and the stroller tragically rolled away from her into the canal. Keslar desperately tried to rescue her sons, but police have said finding a way down the steep banks proved too difficult and she watched helplessly as the strong current swept her children away. Tragedy: The twin 18-month-old boys who died after falling into a Arizona canal this weekend have been identified as brother Eli and Silas Keslar. Pictured above on their first birthday with parents Alexis (left) and Mark Keslar (right) Eli and Silas were pulled from the water one hour later and rushed to hospital where they were pronounced dead. 'No parent should ever have to lose a child, you know, let alone both of them at the same time,' family friend Marlene Gleim told CNN. 'That's what really, really is heartbreaking to me, because those little boys were, you know, meant so much to so many people.' While authorities in the southern Arizona town officially identified the victims, a Go Fund Me page was set up for the parents, Mark and Alexis Keslar. Marlene Gleim, a friend of the boys' grandmother Marlena Martinez, set up the page after learning about their deaths on local media. The fund to cover memorial and medical costs for the boys has already raised more than $20,000. Too young: Authorities revealed on Monday that the two boys ended up in the canal because their mother was fighting off a bee . Waterway: Visible in this picture of the Yuma Canal are its steep banks. Along other parts of the canal there is a strong current running too . 'I would consider them family, and family is not always blood-related,' Ms Gleim told the Yuma Sun. 'I'm extremely… I'm at a loss of words with all of this.' After the tragic reason the boys died was revealed, authorities cautioned others on the seemingly benign canal. 'Many people typically do not comprehend how swift the current in these canals are and how deep the water can be,' Yuma police said. 'They also do not realize how difficult it is to climb back up many of the canal embankments.' Emergency: Above, the scene were the two boys were pulled out of the canal Friday morning in Yuma, Arizona . The toddlers are believed to have fallen in the water at 9.45am on Friday. After a police search that lasted more than an hour, the brothers were pulled from the water. They were flown by a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter to a Yuma hospital, where they were pronounced dead, Franklin said. The area along the canal is used by families for walks and by joggers and a family member was nearby when the boys ended up in the water. Yuma Fire Department spokesman Mike Erfert said their crews were called out on a possible drowning. Tragic: Eli and Silas are pictured above in a recent photo posted to their grandmother's Facebook page . Touching: As of Sunday, the fund to cover memorial and medical costs for the two boys had raised over $10,000 . Helicopters from the U.S. Border Patrol and the Marine Corps also flew over the canal searching for the boys. The Border Patrol helicopter crew spotted the brothers in the water, Erfert said, and they were pulled out at about 11.20am. Paramedics began immediate life-saving efforts and the boys were quickly loaded onto the Marine Corps helicopter for the trip to the hospital.","Police in Yuma, Arizona, revealed that tragic accident was caused by a bee .

"Tony Blair has said he does not want to retire until he is 91 – as he unveiled plans to set up a ‘cadre’ of ex-leaders to advise governments around the world. The defiant 61-year-old former Prime Minister said he had ‘decades’ still in him and joked that he would ‘turn to drink’ if he ever stepped down from his multitude of global roles. He told Newsweek magazine that his latest ambition was to recruit former heads of government to go round the world to advise presidents and prime ministers on how to run their countries. In an interview with the magazine Newsweek Mr Blair said he did not want to retire until he was 91 years old . Mr Blair said his latest ambition is to recruit former heads of government to advise presidents and prime ministers on how to run their countries . Mr Blair said he himself had been ‘mentored’ by US president Bill Clinton when he took office in 1997. And he said he wanted to build up his organisations, such as his Faith Foundation, so they are ‘capable of changing global policy’. Last night, Tory MPs expressed horror at the prospect of Mr Blair remaining in public life for another 30 years. Andrew Bridgen said: ‘We all know weak Ed Miliband’s called on Tony to give his flailing campaign a boost, but the attention’s clearly gone to his head.’ Mr Blair addressing an audience on Tuesday in his former consistuency in Newton Aycliffe . Andrew Percy, another Conservative MP, said: 'There are many people who would be only too happy to send Tony Blair to the farthest reaches of Planet Earth.' Earlier this week, Mr Blair this week intervened in the election campaign by making a major speech accusing David Cameron of threatening economic chaos with his EU referendum pledge. Conservative MP Andrew Percy dismissed Mr Blair's claims about not retiring until he is 91 years old . And on Thursday he rallied the troops at Labour headquarters – telling them he was optimistic of victory and that he thought Mr Miliband did ‘amazingly’ in last week’s leaders’ debate. The former Labour leader has for the past eight years been the Quartet’s representative in the Middle East, and there were rumours last month that he was due to step down from this role. But, speaking to Newsweek, Mr Blair insisted his international work would continue, saying he wanted to emulate ex-Israeli president Shimon Peres who is still politically active at the age of 91. ‘I’ve got decades,’ said Mr Blair in an unpublished transcript of the Newsweek interview. ‘He is literally exactly 30 years older than me. I want to be seeing someone when I’m 91 after having had medical tests which show I’m getting younger. ‘The thought of actually retiring is not… Look, you have to got to have some self-awareness of these things. ‘And I just know if I do that, it would literally take me about three days before I was bored out of my mind. Took to drink or something.’ Mr Blair said he wanted to emulate former Israeli president Shimon Peres who is still politically active aged 91 . Inspiration: Mr Blair told Newsweek that all world leaders become 'war-hardened' with their experiences . He told the magazine that his new leaders’ club was needed because only former leaders truly understood leaders, he said. ‘The moment I’m talking to a new leader and I’m describing what I felt and what the challenges were, there’s a total and instant empathy; an immediate locking-on to each other,’ he said. ‘Whether they come from the Left or the Right, what they want is to get things done. And I know what it’s like because I’ve sat in the decision-making seat.’ The former premier said it was ‘bizarre’ that in politics, people ‘come from no experience of running a government at all to being head of a government’. Mr Blair said former leaders become ‘war-hardened’ with all their experience, and that it is ‘odd’ to expect they should retire and ‘play golf’. ‘You also have this very interesting thing when you can get a great leader of a small country,’ she said. ‘You can get some of these guys are who fantastic executors. ‘Why not use their talents and their experience? I want to build a cadre of people: “Why not come and help the President of this country or the Prime Minister of that country?”.’ Mr Blair said that former American president Bill Clinton mentored him once he came into office in 1997 . He added: ‘When I first came into office, I found Bill Clinton an immense help in a kind of mentoring process, if you like. If you knew at the beginning what you’d learned by the end, I mean you could obviously do a better job.’ Mr Blair said he wanted to turn the Faith Foundation and his other interests into ‘organisations of sufficient weight and influence that they change policy’. ‘I have a very clear view on what should happen on tackling extremism and the link with education and the link with bad religion,’ he said. ‘And you know that I want to build that foundation into something that is actually capable of changing global policy around this issue.’","The former Prime Minister claimed he has 'decades' of work left in him .

"A San Antonio man who fatally shot a SWAT team member with the officer's own gun more than 14 years ago was executed on Wednesday. Manuel Garza Jr. received a lethal injection of pentobarbital for killing San Antonio Police Officer John 'Rocky' Riojas in February 2001. He is the sixth convicted murderer to be put to death in Texas this year. The U.S. Supreme Court had refused in November to review his case, and no last-day appeals were filed before his execution. Manuel Garza Jr. was given the death sentence after killing San Antonio Police Officer John 'Rocky' Riojas in February 2001 . Asked to make a final statement, Garza said he was sorry for causing pain to his family, friends and 'especially police officers'. 'Y'all probably hate me,' he said, looking at three friends of his victim, dressed in their navy blue San Antonio police uniforms. He wished them 'peace and love and hope y'all find God like I have and I'll see you on the other side.' As the lethal drug began taking effect, Garza uttered: 'Here it comes!' His voice rose as he said 'Goodbye,' and then he let out a howl that was cut short within seconds as he took three deep breaths, then a couple of shallow ones. He was pronounced dead 26 minutes later at 6.40pm. Before his death, Garza was given the same food as the rest of the inmates in his unit for his final meal because Texas no longer allows special-order last meals, according toLast Suppers. He had a grilled pork chop, sweet potatoes, green beans, black beans, cornbread, and peach cake, with a choice of water, tea, or punch to drink. Garza, 35, already had a long criminal record at age 20 when he was stopped by Riojas, who was part of a team targeting property crimes at apartment complexes. Garza ran off and witnesses say that when Riojas caught up with him, the two struggled and Garza grabbed the officer's gun. Riojas, 37, was fatally shot in the head. Witnesses said Garza put Riojas's gun in his pants, cursed at the fallen officer, and ran away. Garza was apprehended a day later at his sister's apartment after an informant told detectives that someone had tried to sell him the officer's missing semi-automatic service weapon. In a statement to detectives, Garza blamed Riojas. 'I truly think this was the cop's fault,' he said. 'I don't see why he wanted to pull out his gun.' Garza said he initially ran because he feared the officer would discover he was wanted on outstanding warrants. 'I didn't want to go to jail,' he said. While being escorted to a holding cell after his arrest, court documents described Garza as cocky and smirking. Riojas (pictured), 37, was part of a team targeting property crimes at apartment complexes. Garza fled when he was stopped by Riojas, which led to a struggle and the police officer's death . He used obscenity-laced language to tell officers they were 'lucky I didn't get y'all... too.' The San Antonio Police Officers Association provided buses for officers to make the 200-mile-trip to Huntsville. Several dozen police officers were outside the prison Wednesday evening, and stood at attention and saluted as Riojas' sister - who also is with the San Antonio department and watched Garza die - and the officer-witnesses emerged. 'We want them to see we do care and the salute is a form of respect,' said Mike Helle, president of the association. But Helle, who was in the same police academy training class with Riojas, said the execution 'doesn't bring back my classmate and my friend.' Defense attorneys had said the shooting was accidental and Garza was a product of childhood neglect and abuse. In a 2013 failed appeal, attorney Michael Gross said Garza's family encouraged him to break the law. His criminal record began at age 14, and included burglaries, thefts, escape from custody and leading police on a stolen car chase. Texas carries out the death penalty more than any other state. Garza was the first inmate executed with a new supply of pentobarbital recently obtained by Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials that would allow his and two other lethal injections scheduled for this month to be carried out. If the other two take place, the state prison agency once again will have to replenish its inventory of the scarce drug or find a new chemical to accommodate at least three more scheduled executions beginning next month. Drug manufacturers, under pressure from death penalty opponents, have been withholding their products for use in capital punishment.","Manuel Garza Jr. died from a lethal injection on Thursday .

"Nervous, I was: Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars films, said he had some reservations about Abrams . Mark Hamill knew he had to say yes when George Lucas told him about the plans to move forward with a new Star Wars trilogy. 'It's not like a choice. It's like I was drafted,' Hamill told a massive crowd Saturday night at Star Wars Celebration of his decision to reprise his role as Luke Skywalker in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. 'Could you imagine if for some reason I said 'I don't think I want to do it?' I would have all of you surrounding my house like villagers, angry villagers with lightsabers instead of torches,' joked the 63-year-old Star Wars veteran. Hamill admitted he was caught off guard when Lucas invited him to lunch. When Hamill's wife surmised that perhaps there was a new film in the works, Hamill laughed. Lucas had told him specifically that he was done making Star Wars movies after the prequels. He assumed Lucas was going to announce a 3-D release or roll out another box set of the films, laughing about the number of versions that have been made available. Still, his interest was piqued when Lucas disinvited Hamill's daughter. He knew that meant it must be big. When things started coming together, Hamill said he was cautiously optimistic about J.J. Abrams, the chosen director for The Force Awakens. 'I was a little suspicious because he was a Star Trek guy,' said Hamill, laughing. The actor quickly clarified that he likes Star Trek. 'It just seems odd,' he said. They're back: Hamill is pictured above with Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia, and Anthony Daniels, who played C-3PO . Oldschool: Hamill is pictured left with Fisher and Harrison Ford, who plays Han Solo, in the first Star Wars film . He went on to compliment Abrams for his inclusiveness. Abrams, Hamill noted, is also the first 'Star Wars' director to be borne out of true fandom of the original films. 'He feels the way you feel in terms of wanting practical effects. Real sets,' he said. Keeping in line with the secrecy surrounding The Force Awakens, which opens on December 18, Hamill said he is always worried about leaking information. He claims he even learned the subtitle of the seventh film on the Internet. 'They're so secretive these days,' said Hamill. 'When we did the first one no one cared.' Hamill was 'cleared' to tell the packed house that he did record a voiceover specifically for the new teaser trailer, which debuted on Thursday during the Celebration kick-off panel. This image released by Lucasfilm shows a scene from 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens,' the highly anticipated film by J.J. Abrams that hits theaters Dec. 18.  (Lucasfilm via AP) In the teaser, we hear Luke's voice saying a familiar, but slightly altered line from Return of the Jedi: 'The force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. My sister has it. You have that power too.' He laughed and said that he kept messing up and saying: 'My father had it.' The end result is a combination of the original recording and Hamill's new session, the actor said. After playing the trailer once more in the large arena, Hamill marveled that there is 'so much information there for you to speculate about' embedded in the footage. 'It implies so much that's gone on from [Return of the] Jedi till now,' he said. 'They don't call it a teaser for nothing. They want to tease you.' Doing the double: J.J.

"The pictures show a caring sister helping her brother with his coat, giving him a kiss, and tenderly holding his hand as they play together. But while the scene looks idyllic, it is tinged with sadness, as Joel Wilkinson has a muscle wasting disease meaning he will eventually be left in a wheelchair and his life will be cut short. The three-year-old, from Hull, was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy just six months ago after his parents, Emma, 33, and Chris, 36, noticed he was struggling to develop and learn to walk. They were left devastated when tests confirmed their son had the incurable condition and that is likely only to live to the age of 20. Now, they have decided to make his short life as full of joy as possible. Joel Wilkinson, five, was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy six months ago, meaning his muscles will slowly waste away. His sister Phoebe, five, adores him and cares for him as much as possible . Joel will eventually need a wheelchair and has a life expectancy of just 20.  Phoebe  plays only 'muscle friendly' games that won't tire her brother out - and refuses to play games at school unless Joel can join in . Phoebe makes sure her brother is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes, fasten up his coat (left), fetches his cereal in the morning and plays with him in the garden (right) Thankfully Joel's big sister, Phoebe, five, adores her brother and makes sure he is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes, fasten up his coat and even helps fetch him his cereals in the morning. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'We were heart broken when we discovered that Joel had such an awful terminal disease. 'We told Phoebe as soon as Joel was diagnosed that he had a problem with his muscles and that they're weaker than normal. 'It was important she understood so they could play games that wouldn't tire him such as playing with toys and painting. 'We've told them both that the doctors are trying to find a medicine to help. 'She now only plays ""muscle friendly"" games that don't involve Joel running around and getting extremely tired. 'Phoebe loves her little brother so much and she even takes care of him when they are both at school as they share break times together. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. It usually only affects boys (around one in 3,500), although girls can carry the defective gene. Although not apparent at birth symptoms appear in early childhood. Boys with Duchenne's will have difficulty with walking, jumping and climbing stairs. The disorder is diagnosed via a blood test and muscle tissue sample. Sufferers are likely to need increasing help and treatments from the age of nine. Walking becomes difficult and a wheelchair is usually needed by the age of 12. As patients go through their teenage years they are more likely to suffer from complications such as chest infections. Most most people with Duchennes survive well into their 20s and sometimes longer. The eventual cause of death is usually a severe chest infection at the stage when lung function is already poor. 'She openly tells their friends that she won't join in with any games unless Joel can keep up too. 'It's such a relief knowing that she's keeping an eye on him when I'm not around.' Mr and Mrs Wilkinson found out their son Joel had Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy just before his third birthday last year. The condition affects around one in 3,500 and causes difficulties with movement, meaning a wheelchair is normally needed by the age of 12. Mrs Wilkinson said she hopes there will be a scientific breakthrough before that point. She said: 'His only hope is that researchers have a breakthrough in time to save him and the hundreds of other boys who have this terrible disease. 'Joel will lose the use of his legs first, leaving him wheelchair-bound, and then other muscles thereafter. Eventually, his heart and lungs will fail. At first Joel's parents thought he was a late developer but when at six months he couldn't sit and by two he couldn't walk they knew something was seriously wrong. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Results from the blood test in July said he had muscle dystrophy, but it wasn't until the end of September, after more tests, that we found out it was Duchenne.' The disease, which results in muscle degeneration, has already left Joel unable to get up the stairs or walk long distances. Mrs Wilkinson added: 'Joel struggles to stand up and despite only being three he looks like a little old man when he tries to get up. 'It's an awful illness but we are going to ensure that Joel has the best life and with Phoebe's help we know he'll enjoy every second. 'Phoebe will often clear away both of their toys so that her little brother doesn't get too tired. 'She will help him put on his shoes, fasten his coat and even helps him with his cereals in the morning. 'When I tell them both to tidy up their toys Phoebe will instantly stick up for him and say ""what about his weak muscles"". Emma Wilkinson, 33, and her husband Chris, 36, realised there was something wrong with their son when Joel wasn't developing properly. The family have now decided to make Joel's short life full of joy . As well as playing with her brother at home, Phoebe looks after Joel at school, spending break times with him . 'It's adorable but he's so spoilt.' Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy occurs mainly in boys and although it can be inherited it often occurs with no known family history of the condition. Mrs Wilkinson said this was the case for her and her husband, so they were shocked when Joel was diagnosed. She said: 'We have no family history of the condition so it has been such a shock for us to come to terms with but that's why we've set up the Joy for Joel appeal.' The family have set up at online fundraising website to ensure Joel he gets the specialist treatment he needs to make his life as comfortable as possible. 'We need funds to help Joel be as independent as possible when he grows up and so we can adapt our home,' Mrs Wilkinson explained. 'When he's older we will need a special hoist and a bedroom and wet room downstairs.' Until then, the family are focusing on creating as many memories as possible with Joel while he has some muscle function. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Thanks to Phoebe, Joel has a constant play mate and she helps him ensure he gets the most out of the time he has being able to move his muscles. 'There isn't any medication Joel can take that will slow down his muscle deterioration so we have to watch helplessly as he slowly becomes weaker. 'But we're trying to keep positive and with the help of Phoebe we are getting through it as a family.' There is no cure for Duchenne's, nor any medication that can slow  his muscle deterioration. But thanks to Phoebe, Joel  has a constant playmate . Often Phoebe will clear up Joel's toys after they have played together so he doesn't become to fatigued. 'It's adorable but he's so spoilt,' Mrs Wilkinson said . Mr Wilkinson, who works in IT development support at a logistics company, said: 'We cannot put into words the heartache and devastation Joel's diagnosis is causing us. 'Being unable to help, mend and protect your child is soul-destroying. 'The only thing we can do is bring joy to the time he has.' Families in a similar position can find support by contacting Muscular Dystrophy UK. Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of the charity, said: 'Hearing that your child has a rare muscle-wasting condition can be a huge shock for parents. 'Families time and time again tell us about the importance of having a strong network in place. 'For many parents, family members and charities like Muscular Dystrophy UK, can play a major role in providing that much needed emotional support and practical help, throughout this journey. 'Many families have told us how they are struck by the sense of acceptance and resilience that a sibling can display as their brother or sister gradually gets weaker. 'Siblings can be very protective and supportive of each other, and will often find imaginative ways to play and have fun together despite mobility issues. 'This can be a huge source of comfort and reassurance for parents.'

"It has been almost 90 years since the electricity pylon as we know it was introduced into the UK. Thousands of the 165ft towers line the land, spoiling scenes of beauty with a cat’s cradle of high-voltage cables. But their days are numbered after a more elegant design was seen in action for the first time yesterday – complete with a pair of distinctive ‘earrings’. Scroll down for video . National Grid has revealed the UK's first new pylon for nearly 90 years. Called the T-pylon (artist's illustration shown) it is a third shorter than the old lattice pylons. But it is able to carry just as much power - 400,000 volts. It is designed to be less obtrusive and will be used for clean energy purposes . National Grid is building a training line of the less obtrusive T-pylons at their Eakring training academy in Nottinghamshire. Britain's first pylon, erected in July 1928 near Edinburgh, was designed by architectural luminary Sir Reginald Blomfield, inspired by the Greek root of the word ‘pylon’ (meaning gateway of an Egyptian temple). The campaign against them - they were unloved even then - was run by Rudyard Kipling, John Maynard Keynes and Hilaire Belloc. Five years later, the biggest peacetime construction project seen in Britain, the connection of 122 power stations by 4,000 miles of cable, was completed. It marked the birth of the National Grid and was a major stoking of the nation’s industrial engine and a vital asset during the Second World War. There are now more than 88,000 pylons in the UK, including 22,000 on National Grid’s main transmission network in England and Wales. These stand some 50 metres high, weigh around 30 tonnes and carry up to 400,000 volts of electricity over thousands of kilometres to some of the most exposed, weather-beaten parts of Britain. Each T-pylon measures about 115ft (35 metres) tall - about a third shorter than the old pylons, which were about 165ft (50 metres) tall. The design is a T-shape, with two ‘hanging baskets’ either side holding the various wires and cables needed to transmit electricity. T-pylons were the winners of a 2011 design competition to develop a new pylon that could deal with changing sources of electricity - namely, greener sources such as wind and solar power. ‘We’ve been able to answer ""yes"" to the hundreds of questions that need to be asked before we can introduce a new type of pylon,’ said David Wright, Director of Electricity Transmission Asset Management at National Grid. ‘The training line has enabled us to learn so many lessons about how to manufacture and build the T-pylon. ‘I’m incredibly proud of the high standard of engineering that brought us to this point.’ Despite being shorter, the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight. The simplistic design, composed mostly of just eight components, means new T-pylons can be erected in just a single day, rather than a whole week for older pylons. National Grid is building a training line of six T-pylons at their Eakring training academy in Nottinghamshire . Despite being shorter, the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight .

Maintenance is also easier, as engineers do not need to climb the pylons, but can simply work on them from an elevated platform. The new pylons won’t replace the 88,000 lattice pylons currently in use; rather, the National Grid will use them separately. National Grid plans to use the first operational T-pylons with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. ‘We developed the new type of pylon so that we could have a 21st century design to offer as we plan new transmission routes,’ added Mr Wright. ‘The T-pylon is not a replacement for the steel lattice pylon but it’s a new option and in some landscapes its shorter height and sleeker appearance can offer real advantages.’ The new pylons won’t replace the 88,000 lattice pylons currently in use; rather, the National Grid will use them separately. They plan to use the first T-pylons with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset .

"In a quest to be more green, Apple says it is investing in Chinese solar power and preserving American forests that make environmentally friendly paper. The tech giant announced a new focus on using paper from trees harvested under environmentally sound conditions. As part of the deal, Apple has pledged an unspecified amount of money for a Virginia-based nonprofit, the Conservation Fund, to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the East Coast. Then EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, now Apple's president for environmental initiatives, has spearheaded the new green focus at the world's biggest company. Apple pledged an unspecified amount of money for a Virginia-based nonprofit, the Conservation Fund, to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the East Coast. In the Reed Forest of Aroostook County, Maine, wetlands, rivers, and upland forest provide refuge for Atlantic salmon, bald eagle, and Canada lynx. In Brunswick Forest located in southern North Carolina, the high-quality pine savannas and unique plants and flowers have long made this land a conservation priority. The Conservation Fund will resell the land to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees. The initiatives come as the tech giant this year met a self-imposed goal of powering all its U.S. operations with renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions — initiatives that have won high marks from environmental groups. On Thursday,  It's also promising to use more renewable power overseas, where Apple relies heavily on contract manufacturers — and where a top executive acknowledged the company can do more. 'It's important to us to tackle climate change everywhere we are,' Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president for environmental initiatives, told The Associated Press. 'When you talk about China, you're talking about manufacturing partners. 'We're looking to bring the same innovation there. 'This is the start.' The new solar project in China has a capacity of 40 megawatts, which is smaller than some projects Apple has announced in the United States. By comparison, Apple is spending $850 million for rights to nearly half the output of a 280-megawatt solar facility planned for construction south of Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. That project will produce enough energy to power all of Apple's California offices, a computer center and 52 retail stores. Still, the Chinese project will produce more than the amount of energy consumed by Apple's 19 corporate offices and 21 retail stores in China and Hong Kong, Jackson said. She added that Apple uses renewable energy for 87 percent of the power at its facilities worldwide. That figure, however, doesn't include substantial power consumption by contract manufacturers. With the new project in China, Apple is looking to improve its own operations first. 'Before we go somewhere else and start asking and eventually requiring clean energy, you want to make sure you show folks how to do it,' said Jackson, who was U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator during President Barack Obama's first term. Apple and other tech companies have drawn criticism in the past for use of toxics in manufacturing and data centers powered by electricity from coal. But Apple's moves away from those practices in recent years have won accolades from groups like Greenpeace, which issued a statement praising the Chinese project Thursday. Jackson declined to say how much Apple is investing in the Chinese project, which is being built in partnership with U.S. energy company SunPower and four Chinese firms. Although China is known for heavy reliance on coal, its government has set aggressive goals for solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Meanwhile, Apple pledged an unspecified amount of money for a Virginia-based nonprofit, the Conservation Fund, to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the East Coast. The Conservation Fund will resell the land — 36,000 acres of timberland in Maine and North Carolina — to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees. Larry Selzer, the group's chief executive, said that will protect the forest while keeping it in the hands of private owners who pay taxes and create jobs. The Conservation Fund will resell the land — 36,000 acres of timberland in Maine and North Carolina — to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees. Selzer said he'll use proceeds from reselling the land to buy and protect additional tracts. 'Apple believes that paper, like energy, can be a renewable resource,' the pair said in a blog post announceing the deal. 'So Apple is striving to supply 100 percent of the virgin fibers used in its paper and packaging from sustainably managed forests or controlled wood sources. ' Apple won't necessarily buy paper made from trees on that land, but Jackson said the investment will increase the supply of sustainable wood fiber. She said the two tracts would produce about half the non-recycled wood fiber used in Apple's product packaging last year. That would put Apple halfway toward its goal of obtaining all its non-recycled paper products from sustainable timber. Apple wouldn't say how much paper it uses, but it says two-thirds of its paper packaging comes from recycled material. In the last three months of 2014, Apple sold more than 100 million iPhones and other gadgets, most in cardboard boxes.

"The prison guard who allegedly had an affair with the man convicted of killing one-punch victim Thomas King has been identified as a 30-year-old ironwoman competitor. It was revealed last month Kieran Loveridge, who brutally attacked Mr Kelly at Kings Cross, was moved to Goulburn Supermax prison because he had an 'improper relationship' with a female officer. The 21-year-old is thought to have had a relationship with Port Macquarie woman Jody Marson, The Daily Telegraph reported. Scroll down for video . Jody Marson (left and right) has been named as the prison guard who had an affair with Kieran Loveridge . Kieran Loveridge, who killed Thomas Kelly in a brutal one punch attack in 2012, allegedly had an affair with Ms Marson . Corrective Services NSW has since launched an investigation into the matter after Loveridge was moved from the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre. The alleged relationship took place inside the the correctional centre where two inmates share one cell. Ms Marson was suspended after other staff members claimed they had witness the alleged affair inside the Kempsey prison. She is now under investigation. Her Facebook reveals she is a fitness enthusiast, with photos showing her cycling in ironwoman competitions. The social media page also shows renovations she has carried out on a house she recently bought in Port Macquarie on the NSW north coast. When approached by The Daily Telegraph for comment, the 30-year-old did not wish to speak about the matter. Ms Marson (right) was suspended after other staff members claimed they had witness the alleged affair inside the Kempsey prison . Corrective Services NSW Commisioner Peter Severin confirmed they were looking at 'electronic prison records and CCTV footage'. He told the Daily Telegraph employees were expected to stick with the department's 'strict and very clear policies and procedures governing how correctional staff should interact with inmates'. Mr Severin added they would 'fully investigate' any breaches in behaviour and would enforce suitable penalties, which included dismissal. Loveridge was moved to the higher security prison after he stomped on a fellow inmate's head along with a 22-year-old prisoner. Thomas Kelly died after he was punched in the head by Loveridge on July 7, 2012 . A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia a 21-year-old man was charged with reckless grievous bodily harm following an assault inside a west Kempsey correctional facility. She said police were told 'possibly two or three inmates assaulted another inmate' who was left with head injuries. Loveridge will appear in Goulburn Local Court on Wednesday, May 27. The 21-year-old is serving 14 years for Mr Kelly's manslaughter. Mr Kelly suffered catastrophic head injuries after Loveridge punched him once in an unprovoked attack at Kings Cross, in Sydney's inner-city, on July 7, 2012. The 18-year-old's life support was turned off two days later. Initially, Loveridge was jailed in November 2013 for just four years for manslaughter, which prompted wide-spread public anger. The Deparment PP launched an appeal against the leniency of the decision, which was upheld and in July 2014 he was handed a lengthier jail time. In November 2013, a court heard how 19-year-old Loveridge had drunk several cans of Smirnoff double black vodka drinks and shots as he prowled Kings Cross and told a friend 'I swear I’m going to bash someone'. Mr Kelly, an accounting cadet, was walking with his girlfriend and talking on his mobile phone when he was violently attacked. Police originally charged Loveridge with murder but he offered to plead guilty to manslaughter. The earliest Loveridge can be released from jail is November 17, 2022.

"A couple who married in their teens and suffer from cystic fibrosis are in a race against time as the young wife waits for a life-saving lung transplant. Katie Prager, 24, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs in September 2009 and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs. As her health continues to decline, her husband Dalton, 23, who has already received new lungs, is pleading for help. Her insurance company, Kentucky Medicaid, will not pay for the out-of-state treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, he says. Dalton pleaded: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story. 'We are both ready to continue fighting but at this point we are running out of options and need your help. Please help me save my wife Katie.' Scroll down for video . Katie and Dalton Prager (above), who suffer from cystic fibrosis, followed their hearts and married as teens in 2011 . Katie, left, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs called Burkholderia Cepacia, and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs . Dalton has already received new lungs, but Katie is waiting as Kentucky Medicaid will not pay for the out-of-state-treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . For the couple who put everything on the line when they first met in person in 2009, her husband can not imagine losing the love of his life who he married four years ago. In December 2014, Katie was discharged from the Pittsburgh hospital after a long stay and returned to Kentucky, but began having trouble breathing three days later. The hospital would not admit her because Medicare would not pay because she had used her lifetime maximum, the couple says. She will not be covered for the expensive out-of-state medical procedure again until she spends 60 consecutive days out of the hospital. She was admitted into University of Kentucky Hospital, but it however, does not do transplants on patients with the kind of infection that Katie has. 'Sixty days out of the hospital is not an option for her anymore. Medicaid is also not an option as it will not cover her transplant due to UPMC being 'out of network',' Dalton wrote on the couple's YouCaring page. 'After explaining to Medicaid and Pittsburgh that there are only two places in the country, who would operate, due to (the bacteria) Cepacia, (UPMC and Duke Medical Center) still refused to work together to help her. 'She is struggling to attempt to negotiate her healthcare options from her hospital bed at the University of Kentucky.' Dalton said: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story' Only three months away from their four-year anniversary, the couple has not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received new lungs, and hope they can be together to celebrate . Katie said that she feels like efforts to get transferred to Pittsburgh are at a standstill and that something needs to be done. 'It needs to happen soon. Nervous they aren't going to accept my case and that I'll have to restart this whole process at a completely different hospital,' she wrote on the couple's Facebook page. In February, Dr. Michael Anstead who is Katie's pulmonologist at the University of Kentucky, wrote a letter to Medicaid seeking for them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care in Pittsburgh, according to CNN. But Kentucky Medicaid denied the proposal saying UPMC declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. 'Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,' Gwenda Bond, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services wrote in a statement to CNN. 'Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.' However, the hospital claims that Medicaid told them if they wanted to treat Katie, they would be required to sign up hundreds of doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. 'UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation,' wrote spokeswoman Wendy Zellner. So far, the couple relies on communication on phones and computers to keep in touch . UPMC said they are want to help Katie but said it is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address the situation . While Katie seems to be caught in limbo, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they are working to find a solution concerning her case by reaching out to the state agency. Only three months away from their four year anniversary in July, the couple have not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received his lung transplant at UPMC. Even though he also had Cepacia like Katie, which makes lung transplants more complicated, his has been a success. However, he has not been able to be near his wife in person until she receives a lung transplant because of the risk of infection. So far, they rely on communication through their phones or computers. But all they want is to be able to spend their anniversary together. 'I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug,' Katie told CNN. 'That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary.' So far, the couple's YouCaring page has raised $43,425 in donations out of its goal of $50,000.","Katie and Dalton Prager, 24 and 23, met in 2009 and married two years later .

"'Nurse death': Vera Maresova, 50, has confessed to killing five women and one man at the hospital . A former nurse in the Czech Republic has admitted murdering six of her elderly patients with massive doses of potassium in order to ease her workload. Vera Maresova, 50, confessed to killing five women and one man over a four-year period at a hospital in  Rumburk - a small town in the north of the country. Dubbed 'Nurse Death' by local media, Maresova was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation. According to the prosecution, Maresova injected the potassium straight into the blood stream of her six elderly patients, which caused them to suffer heart failure and eventually death. All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Maresova thought their deaths would simply be attributed to natural causes. Initially arrested last August for the death of one patient, a 70-year-old woman who died from potassium poisoning in June, Maresova subsequently admitted killing five others dating back to 2010. In total her victims included five women and one man. 'All of her victims were elderly and needed intensive treatment,' a police spokesperson said. 'The woman who was supposed to care for them but instead killed them because she wanted to make life easier for herself,' he added. 'The terrible number of victims is six. We do not suspect the nurse committed any more murders';, he went on to say. Confession: Vera Maresova (right) was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation .

Prosecutor Frantisek Stibor said: 'She is not insane and knew exactly what she was doing. Therefore she is fit to stand trial. 'She used her knowledge of medicine to cause malfunctions in heart rhythms which led to heart failure and death.' The first murder was in January 2010 and was followed by another at the end of 2011. In April 2012 she killed her third victim and three more between February and June 2014. Having confessed to the crime, 50-year-old Maresova now faces the prospect of spending the rest of her life in prison.","Vera Maresova, 50, killed five women and one man over a four-year period .

"Double rapist Solomon Khoorban, 33, a former soldier based at Woolwich barracks, London, has been jailed for 16 years . A double rapist ex-soldier who went undetected for 12 years after attacking a 16-year-old in a West End nightclub and raping a second woman at knifepoint has finally been jailed. Violent Solomon Khoorban, now 33, forced himself on the teenager in the VIP area at Equinox nightclub in Leicester Square - which has now been replaced by a casino - after punching her so hard in the face  that she was knocked unconscious. He then ordered his terrified victim to wait in the VIP area for at least 30 minutes, threatening to kill her if she did not oblige. Princess Diana was among a host of famous faces who attended shows, events and after parties at the club before it closed down. Just two months later, in August 2003, the knife-wielding attacker raped a 32-year-old woman as she walked through Greenwich, south east London. The former gunner, who was 21 at the time, put her in a headlock, dragged her  into the bushes and raped her twice. He also told her: 'B****** shouldn't be out at this time'. Both rapes were reported to police at the time but it took detectives more than a decade to track Khoorban down and link him to the sex attacks. The arrest came after the Met’s Specialist Crime and Operations Command carried out a review of both investigations in September 2014. Detectives combed through a series of ID photos from the British Army before identifying Khoorban as a suspect. When he was arrested in November 2014, police linked his DNA to the attacks. He had not previously been on the DNA database because he had not been in trouble with police. Jailing him at Snaresbrooke Crown Court for 16 years, Judge Sheelagh Canavan said Khoorban was a 'violent sexual predator' who had ruined his victims' lives. She said: 'The damage you have caused these women and no doubt will continue to cause will last the rest of their lives. They are serving a life sentence. 'The younger girl was 16 with her whole life to look forward to and she is moving forward with this over her. 'The second victim has been traumatised by what you did to her. Nothing I can say or do will change that. 'You are a violent sexual predator, I have no doubt you were excited by your use of violence which was far beyond anything that was needed to achieve your purpose.' During the hearing, the court heard how Khoorban had raped his first victim during a night out when she was marking the end of her GCSEs. The soldier had asked his victim to go upstairs to talk and she agreed because her feet were hurting after dancing in high heels. The court heard how the subsequent attack was so violent that the teenager had to be rushed to hospital to be treated for her injuries. Judge Sheelagh Canavan said: 'I doubt anyone who was there will forget the sight of that young girl as she ran from the scene of the attack.' The court heard how police had launched a manhunt for Khoorban after the first rape, releasing an e-fit in a public appeal. Wanted: At the time of the attack, police released this grainy CCTV footage showing Khoorban (right) leaving the club . The first rape took place in Equinox nightclub - which has now been replaced by a casino - in London's Leicester Square (file picture - club not pictured) But Khoorban, who was based with the Royal Artillery's 16th Regiment at Woolwich barracks at the time, was not caught. Instead, two months later, he targeted another woman after prowling the Greenwich area armed with a knife. In a desperate attempt to protect herself, the victim told Khoorban she was pregnant and had AIDS. But Khoorban shoved his hand over her mouth, thrust the knife into her face and punched her repeatedly, knocking out her teeth and leaving her with permanent scarring. After raping her, Khoorban told the woman to wait in the bushes for ten minutes to allow him time to escape. He threatened to 'finish her' off if she moved. The court heard how the victim told police it was 'like an eagle had landed on me'. The court heard how, during his time in the army, Khoorban once bit off part of a comrade's earlobe and broke his nose. He hit another soldier in the face and punched a third so many times he lost consciousness. But the soldier, who served in Northern Ireland, Cyprus and Germany, never faced a civil or military charges for these offences. He was only discharged from the army in 2007 for using cocaine. Several years after the attacks, he was also  diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and depression. In court, the defendant acknowledged he was not suffering mental health problems at the time of the attacks in 2003. Christopher Amis, defending, said his client wanted forgiveness from his victims, but was not expecting it. He told the court: 'There's nothing I can say to undo what this defendant visited on these two victims, nothing can put matters right and absolutely nothing that can turn back the clock.' He added: 'He entered pleas of guilty, he has not prevaricated and whatever else he's done he has at least spared these two victims of these appalling crimes the ordeal of having to give evidence in front of a jury. 'He served in the army for a number of years and while it's true he was discharged in circumstances relating to the taking of cocaine, it's also right that there's no evidence that whilst he was serving in the army he did anything other than discharge his duty satisfactorily.' Mr Amis said Khoorban also recognised that he had been 'a bad person' for carrying out the attacks. Khooban was based at Woolwich barracks (pictured) in south east London at the time of the attacks in 2003 . 'I asked him why he did it and he said ""I was a bad person in those days, I recognise it and I say it, I don't recognise myself now as the person I was then""', he told the court. 'I asked him if there was anything he wished me to say that he felt he would want said, he said: ""I just want forgiveness, I'm not expecting it, I don't deserve it but I want it and I need it"". 'He acknowledges that he will never be forgiven for these appalling offences and that's a burden he will carry the burden for the rest of his days.' Mr Amis added that Khoorban was on the point of refusing to come into court to face his two victims. Khoorban, who appeared in the dock in a dark green prison tracksuit and a full beard, sat with his head in his hands and sighed throughout the hearing. The former soldier, from East Ham, London, will also have to sign  the sex offender's register indefinitely. After the hearing, investigating officer Detective Sergeant Matt Flynn praised the bravery of the two victims. He said: 'Both young women were subjected to horrific and gratuitous ordeals at the hands of a dangerous and predatory individual. 'The devastating affect of these attacks on both women is indescribable. For the past 12 years they have had to get on with their lives knowing their attacker was still out there. 'It is only due to their courage and fortitude that Khoorban was charged with these abhorrent and cowardly attacks. Without their support he would not have been brought to justice.'","Solomon Khoorban, 33, raped teen at club after punching her unconscious .

A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video . First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew . The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest . Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning . They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to 30 flight attendants from four different continents . Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 . On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing. When not in use, the secret door must be closed and latched to avoid passengers wandering in. Sleep tight: The cosy and comfortable looking crew sleeping quarters on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner .

"Kristen Lindsey from Brenham, Texas, allegedly hunted the animal down and shot it with a bow believing it was feral and then posted the image on Facebook . A veterinarian has been fired from her clinic after she posted a horrifying image of her holding a cat she had killed by firing an arrow into its head on Facebook. Kristen Lindsey, 31, who lives in Brenham, Texas, allegedly hunted the animal down in her backyard and shot it with a bow, believing it was feral. But a local rescue center say the cat, believed to be called Tiger, was domesticated and had been missing for around two weeks. Beneath the shocking image, Lindsey, a Wyoming native, wrote: 'My first bow kill... lol. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it's head. Vet of the year award... gladly accepted.' She also said in a comment, before she learned she no longer had a job: 'And no I did not lose my job. Psshh. Like someone would get rid of me. I'm awesome.' The Colorado State graduate lost her job at the Washington Animal Clinic after the image began circulating online and staff have since been distancing themselves from the former employee. Staff at released a statement on Facebook on Friday saying: 'We are absolutely appalled, shocked, upset, and disgusted by the conduct. 'We have parted ways with Ms. Lindsey. We do not allow such conduct and we condemn it in the strongest possible manner,' the clinic said in the statement.' 'Please know that when informed of this we responded swiftly and appropriately and please do not impute this awful conduct to the Washington Animal Clinic or any of its personnel.' Local prosecutors are now considering whether she should face criminal charges. A Facebook page, called 'justice for the cat murdered by Kirsten Lindsey'  has already been 'liked' by more than 7,000 people. A video of the six-year-old cat that Lindsey is believed to have killed riding on top of a tractor has also surfaced online. Scroll down for video . Lindsey, pictured with her mother Becky, said after the picture was uploaded that she didn't lose her job - claiming no one would fire her because she is 'awesome'. However she later learned she had been fired . Local prosecutors are now considering whether she should face criminal charges. She was also slammed online with a number of people saying she should lose her veterinarian licence . Austin County Sheriff Jack Brandes says he was disturbed by the image. He told KBTX: 'This kind of stuff shouldn't happen in our society,' Brandes said. 'It's a very sad thing. 'Hopefully we will get to the bottom of it and get the truth, 100 per cent truth, and get it to the DA and put it in his hands if it needs to go any further.' The Texas Veterinary Medical Association also condemned her reactions, insisting her conduct does not reflect the standards of other vets. In a statement, they said: 'The Texas Veterinary Medical Association (TVMA) strongly condemns the actions of a veterinarian who claims to have recently shot and killed a feral cat with the use of a bow and arrow. 'The veterinarian, who worked in Brenham, Texas, and is not a TVMA member, posted a picture of herself holding the deceased cat on her personal Facebook page along with some insensitive remarks about the incident. A video of the six-year-old cat that Lindsey is believed to have killed riding on top of a tractor has also surfaced online . The Colorado State graduate lost her job at the Washington Animal Clinic (pictured) after the image began circulating online. She has yet to respond to the image . 'This individual’s actions directly violate the veterinarian’s oath taken to use his or her “scientific knowledge and skills for the benefit of society through the protection of animal health and welfare, the prevention and relief of animal suffering, the conservation of animal resources, the promotion of public health and the advancement of medical knowledge.” 'We are saddened and disturbed by the unfortunate actions of this individual, and we remind Texas residents that this conduct is not reflective of the veterinary profession or of the veterinarians who strive to embody the words of the veterinarian’s oath every day. 'Upon learning of the troubling misconduct, the Brenham clinic where the veterinarian was practicing immediately condemned her actions and terminated her employment. 'The clinic’s ownership and staff have expressed their deepest shock and disgust at such behavior and are regretful that the individual acted in a manner that so drastically deviated from the conduct and values the clinic has upheld in its community for years. 'We hope you will stand strong with us against this type of behavior against animals. TVMA values the trust built between veterinarians and the public based on mutually shared care for animals. The clinic issued a statement confirming Lindsey had been fired and distanced themselves from the employee. They said they were 'disgusted' by her conduct . 'We hope that we can unite to prevent actions like this from occurring in the future. She was also condemned online by a number of people in her profession. Larry Wallace, who said he had been a veterinarian for 40 years, said on Facebook: 'I have never in my long career heard of such an atrocious act by a member of my profession. 'This person most be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 'She took an oath to protect and heal not to killing innocent life. I will be contacting my national association about this matter as she has tarnished the profession for which she has chosen.' Underneath the clinic's statement, Sheilah Christensen wrote: 'She needs to be in jail for animal abuse - follow your state state statutes re animal abuse. Take her license away -- my God, what did she do to the animals in her care at your clinic.' Cruelty to animals is a Class A misdemeanor under penal code 42.092: “A person commits an offense if the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly tortures an animal or in a cruel manner kills or causes serious bodily injury to an animal.” Lindsey interned at Equine Sports Medicine & Surgery in Weatherford from 2012 to 2013. She created a personal blog called Wyo-Girl-Kristen Lindsey and posted about herself in 2011, saying: 'I love Wyoming and the mountains....the Big Horns especially...but any will do when it really comes down to it. 'I love hunting, fly fishing, pack trips, the outdoors in general, horses, skiing, dancing, whiskey, my friends, my family, God, raising hell, my daddy, and sheep.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Bill de Blasio is going up against Hillary Clinton as the Democratic presidential candidate, it has been claimed. The Mayor of New York is allegedly entering the race as a 'leftist' alternative to Clinton in the hopes that this will see him represent the party in the 2016 elections. This claims come in the wake of a television appearance last week, just hours before Clinton announced her candidacy, where de Blasio refused to back her. Scroll down for video . The Mayor of New York is allegedly entering preparing to run for president as a 'leftist' alternative to Hillary Clinton, according to a source within the Democratic Party . De Blasio's intentions to throw his hat in the ring as Democrat presidential candidate comes from a 'national party operative', according to the New York Post. The mayor's bid for presidency is backed by the Working Families Party, and he hopes that left-leaning 'progressive activists' will join them in supporting him over the coming months, the source claims. 'De Blasio and his advisers are trying to position the mayor as the 'draft' candidate for the left in 2016. That's why he refused to endorse Hillary last week,' the party operative told the Post. The 53-year-old has yet to back Clinton, despite the fact that he was campaign manager of her U.S. Senate bid in 2000, an indication that the rumours of his intentions to run for president may be true. The New York City mayor, known to be more liberal than Clinton on most issues, surprised many Democrats when he declined to endorse his former boss during an interview last week. Behind her back? Bill de Blasio has yet to endorse Hillary Clinton as the Democrats' presidential candidate, despite the fact that he was campaign manager of her U.S. Senate bid in 2000 . The New York City mayor, seen inspecting a Bronx apartment as pary of an affordable housing project, said he will not endorse Clinton  until he can 'see an actual vision of where they want to go' Appearing on Meet The Press, De Blasio said he would withhold his blessing 'until I see an actual vision of where they want to go.' 'She's a tremendous public servant,' the mayor continued. 'I think she is one of the most qualified people to ever run for this office. And by the way, thoroughly vetted, we can say that. But we need to see the substance.' De Blasio has taken several steps to raise his profile in recent weeks, including making a bid for the 2016 Democratic National Convention, hosting a meeting of liberals at Gracie Mansion this month and traveling to Nebraska and Iowa — site of the first nominating caucus —  last  week to champion the fight against income inequality. Today, Clinton is scheduled to arrive in New Hampshire as she steps up her campaign for the Democratic nomination. As she did in Iowa last week, Clinton plans to forgo the packed rallies that marked her previous campaign and focus on smaller round-table events with selected groups of supporters.","Bill de Blasio 'wants to be a more liberal alternative to Hillary Clinton'

"Christopher Barry, 53, was stabbed to death by a 13-year-old boy after a row outside a block of flats . A 13-year-old boy has been jailed for more than 11 years after pleading guilty to a brutal stabbing making him one of Britain's youngest ever murderers. The boy, who is a member of the notorious Wood Green Gang, pleaded guilty to stabbing 53-year-old Christopher Barry twice in the chest outside his home in Edmonton, north London, on December 14 last year. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pulled a knife from his rucksack and stabbed Mr Barry, a builder, as he got into a lift following a row. The Old Bailey heard the boy became enraged when Mr Barry, who was known as Jack, would not let the boy and his friends into the block of flats. Zoe Johnson QC told the court the murder happened on December 14 last year, as the killer attended a 13th birthday party at his friend's flat off The Broadway, in Edmonton, north London. He and a group of friends left the flat to see one boy to his bus home, but returned to the wrong block to try to rejoin the party. 'Tragically it appears they returned to the wrong door of the wrong block', said Ms Johnson. 'When they buzzed the door, they were buzzing the wrong flat which explains why no one answered.' Mr Barry and his girlfriend, Sabrina Finn, arrived home to find the group of boys trying to get into the black of flats when they lived. Ms Johnson said: 'One of those boys was continually pressing the button to be let in. 'Mr Barry and his girlfriend said they couldn't let the boys into the flat if the occupants weren't answering the buzzer. The attack happened as Mr Barry (left) returned home with his girlfriend, council worker Sabrina Finn (right) 'As Mr Barry used his fob to open the main entrance, it appears there was a bit of pushing and shoving between him and the boys. 'Mr Barry and his girlfriend entered the block and walked to the lift. 'The defendant followed Mr Barry into the block, along a short corridor, around a corner, and as Mr Barry stepped into the lift, the defendant stabbed him twice in the chest, in a completely unprovoked and cowardly attack.' One of the boys with the killer told police he had seen his friend 'become angry and take a kitchen knife out of his rucksack.' Another of the boys saw him thrust the knife at Mr Barry and say: 'What are you saying now? What are you saying now?' before swinging the knife at the victim. When they ran from the block of flats, the killer told a friend he had 'just ripped the man's jacket'. The Old Bailey (pictured) heard the boy became enraged when Mr Barry, who was known as Jack, would not let the boy and his friends into the block of flats where he lived. He fatally stabbed Mr Barry twice . Mr Barry did not initially realise he had been stabbed, but found blood on his shirt and when he entered his flat he collapsed. Paramedics found him laying face down in a pool of blood, with a wound in his abdomen and another in his chest. He later died from his injuries. In texts later that night, the boy told a friend: 'I'm going to prison' and posted on Facebook: 'The thing I'm going to miss most when I go pen (penitentiary) is NY gyal (New York Girl).' Ms Johnson said the boy also went by a street name associated with the Wood Green Gang. 'This is a gang that he candidly admitted he was associated with since the age of ten', she said. The court heard the teenager was given a police caution and excluded from his first school when he was caught with a knife and cannabis in February 2013, then aged just 11. Ms Johnson said Mr Barry's girlfriend, Ms Finn, had written an impact statement describing the 'appalling effects on her and many of Mr Barry's family and friends'. 'I'm back at work now, but although I walk, talk, and look the same as I did before, inside I'm tired and my heart is broken', she said. Mr Barry was stabbed following the row outside this block of flats in Edmonton, north London (pictured) 'Jack and I had four happy years together and this young boy has taken that happiness away from me. 'For that I'm very sad and angry as my life will never been the same again.' The boy's mother wept in court as Judge Stephen Kramer QC today sentenced the boy to a minimum of 11 years detention at her majesty's pleasure. 'When Mr Barry returned home, he refused to let you in to that block but you nevertheless got in', he said. 'You followed Mr Barry, produced your knife, and then stabbed him twice in the chest. 'The injury to the chest went through clothing including a wax jacket and went deep.' 'You are only 13 years old but shortly after 7.30pm on the evening of December 14 2014, you were carrying a knife in your bag. 'You wanted to get into a block of flats but you went to the wrong block with tragic consequences for everyone involved.' The judge said it was an aggravating factor that the boy had taken the knife to the scene in his bag and said he had clearly intended to cause really serious harm to Mr Barry. The boy has been deemed a high risk of causing harm and at a medium risk of reoffending when he is released, and the judge urged him to reconsider his gang affiliation. However he also accepted it was not a premeditated attack and that the boy had a 'troubled background'. He took into account the boy's remorse, revealed in a letter from his mother which was not read out in court. The boy, wearing a pale blue shirt with a white buttoned up collar, showed no emotion and stared straight ahead as the sentence was passed. The teenager pleaded guilty to one count of murder on March 6, and Michael Turner QC, defending, said this was a 'unique' early admission from such a young defendant. Judge Kramer refused an application by the press to lift a legal ban on naming the boy, saying there were 'exceptional' circumstances.","A boy aged 13 has been jailed for 11 years for murder of Christopher Barry .

"Revealed: Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, the owner of the stripy Kensington property, may be worth up to £60million and has fallen out with her family over inheritance . The woman accused of painting red and white stripes on her £15million Kensington townhouse in a bitter planning row  is a war hero's daughter worth as much as £60million who has fallen out with her family over inheritance. Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring has been accused by critics in her west London neighbourhood of ordering the dramatic overnight paint job ‘to get her own back’ when they objected to her plans to demolish the property and rebuild it with a two-storey ‘iceberg’ basement. Residents in the otherwise immaculate cobbled cul-de-sac in Kensington, one of the city’s wealthiest areas, said the colourful redesign was driving them ‘mad’ and likened Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, believed to be in her early 70s, to ‘a child throwing a tantrum’. Today MailOnline can reveal Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring has also fallen out with the family of her late husband Robert, who have accused her of failing to pass on cash and property worth millions after his death in 2007. Robert Lisle, her stepson, said her behaviour does not surprise him, having last had contact with her in 2012 when they continued to row over the inheritance he believes is due to him and the wider family. He said: ‘She has made commitments and reneged on them. She’s an extremely unpleasant character'. His wife Sally claims Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring's  life revolves around money, which has left her estranged from much of her family. She said: 'She's fallen out with the family. It's sad, she is missing out on them growing up and getting married. But she's not involved because of her decisions. 'Her husband promised money and property to his children and grandchildren but after he died it never materialised. They were promises my husband's father made, but she has never kept one. 'She's so rude, in fact she is the rudest person I've ever met. 'Money is not our god - but money is her god. We don't need it to be happy, we are already, but it is for her. She's got nothing else in her life, no friends, just her and her money'. Ms Lisle-Mainwaring's original name is understood to be Patricia Royde, who later changed her name to Zipporah - the name of Moses' wife - because of 'vanity', her family claim. She is the daughter of a Second World War hero pilot, Flying Officer George Reicher Royde, who was handed the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942 for helping fly a bomber back to Britain from a European raid when the pilot was injured, saving the rest of the crew on board. But in 1943 he was shot down over Belgium while heading to bomb German factories and buried in the Schoonselhof Cemetery. In May 2013 Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring helped unveiled a memorial at the crash site to remember her father's life and the others lost. Neighbours of a £15million townhouse in South End, Kensington - one of the most exclusive areas of London - have branded the property an ‘eyesore’ after it was painted with red and white stripes following objections to knock it down and replace it with a five-storey mansion . Memorial: In May 2013 Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, second from right, helped unveil a memorial at the crash site to remember her father's life and the others lost when his RAF plane was shot down in 1943 . Residents surrounding her stripy Kensington townhouse told MailOnline they are ‘horrendously unhappy’ with the new exterior of the three-storey terraced home in South End, Kensington, and likened it to a ‘beachside hut’. Planning documents show Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring wanted to replace the property with a five-storey ‘traditional mews-style’ home, including a two-story basement complete with gym, media room and swimming pool with a double-height ceiling. The new property could be worth £25million. Hero: Her father Flying Officer George Reicher Royde, was handed the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942 for helping fly a bomber back to Britain from a European raid when the pilot was injured, saving the rest of the crew on board . The plans were initially turned down by Kensington and Chelsea Council but approved on appeal. However, a neighbour then lodged a legal challenge which means the case will go to the High Court in June where a final decision will be made. Residents now believe that Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, a property developer, ordered the garish paint job - which took place under the cover of darkness - as an act of revenge for the legal challenge. While Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s solicitors refused to comment yesterday on the motives behind the dramatic paint job, there is little doubt that it has rubbed the objecting neighbours up the wrong way. Saskia Moyle, 18, who lives opposite the house with her father, said the new colourful exterior had not gone down well with local residents, with the majority complaining that it lowers the classy tone of the quiet cobbled street. She told MailOnline: 'The neighbours are all horrendously unhappy with it. Everyone's complained. We all hate it. It's a bit of an eyesore. 'The woman who owns it put in a planning application to go down two floors but it was rejected and now we think she's trying to do this so the council is forced to demolish it'. Colin Burchett, a chauffeur who works from the neighbouring road, said the property had been receiving lots of attention from tourists, who now regularly visit the quaint street to take photos. He said: ‘In terms of the paint job, I just think it’s really bizarre. I’d like to know how they have got away with it. ‘Surely it’s a listed building or there must be restrictions. All of the windows on the street are exactly the same and when another property in the road wanted some work done there was a notice up for ages. I can’t see how they’ve got away with it.’ The owner of the £15million Kensington townhouse was once involved in a high-profile legal challenge over another property dispute. Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, along with her husband Robert - who died in 2007, four years into the marriage -, was the owner of Yeoman's Row Management Limited which became embroiled in a legal battle with property developer Mr Cobbe. The dispute began in 2002 when Mr Cobbe verbally agreed to buy and redevelop a block of 13 flats in Knightsbridge owned by Yeoman's. At his own expense, it was decided that he would apply for planning permission for the development to turn the flats into six terraced houses. Residents said they are ‘horrendously unhappy’ with the new exterior of the three-storey terraced home in South End, Kensington, which suddenly appeared after legal challenges thwarted a planning application to give the home a double basement to include a swimming pool . The house (pictured centre before the paint job which occurred in the last couple of weeks) was bought by Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring several years ago and turned from office space into storage space. She now wants to turn it into a residential property measuring five-storeys . Ms Lisle-Mainwaring has submitted several planning applications but ultimately wishes to demolish the current property and rebuild it to take it from three-storeys to five-storeys with a double basement below ground. It will include four bedrooms, a gym, pool and media room . The company would then sell Mr Cobbe the property for £12million upon the planning application being successful, and when the work was completed, he would have to give Yeoman's 50 per cent of the profits if the sale was in excess of £24million. If the planning application was not successful, Mr Cobbe would receive no payment. The contract was purely verbal and there was no written formal agreement or the instruction of lawyers. Mr Cobbe spent about £200,000 obtaining planning permission between 2002 and 2004 and, on the day after the consent was granted, Yeoman's told him the agreement no longer stood. The firm claimed the agreement had lapsed as the consent had not been obtained within a set period of time and refused to sell him the land. Mr Cobbe started legal proceedings, claiming the company had breached the verbal contract, and the case went to the High Court. He said he should be paid for the work he carried out to obtain planning permission and also claimed a right to the land since its value had increased considerably thanks to the planning consent. The Court of Appeal ruled to award Mr Cobbe a sum in excess of £5million but the House of Lords overturned the decision, claiming Mr Cobbe was not entitled to ‘property estoppel’ because he did not have a formal contract. However, the Lords ruled that Mr Cobbe was entitled to a sum for 'unjust enrichment' and he was awarded around £200,000 to cover the cost of obtaining planning permission and a fee for his services. During the case, the Chancery Division and the Court of Appeal criticised Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s conduct as ‘unconscionable’ and ‘unpleasant’. Afterwards, solicitors Clarke Wilmott said the fact Mr Cobbe had only been paid for his time and expenses meant Ms Lisle-Mainwaring was ‘laughing all the way to the bank’. The Knightsbridge development, which is currently under construction, was described in objection letters by residents as something which would cause ‘irreparable damage’ to the ‘quality of life and sense of community’ on the street while ‘solely benefiting the commercial developers’. Yeoman's Row Management Limited is no longer active and it is understood Ms Lisle-Mainwaring now splits her time between the UK and Switzerland, with properties registered in London and Geneva. Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring was unavailable for comment today but her solicitor said her Kensington home was not bought for £15million and would not be worth £25million if the two years of proposed work is completed. He also denied claims by neighbours the stripes were painted during the night, backed up by the man who painted them. The tradesman, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline: 'It's not true it was painted during the night. I did it in five hours during the day around six weeks ago. I wasn't told why I had to do it, but I read in the newspapers it was to do with the neighbours'.","Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring accused of painting £15million house like a 'beach hut' in row over planning application .

"Researchers sketching out a 'wiring diagram' for rat brains have discovered its structure is organized like the Internet. They say the animal's cerebral cortex is 'like a mini-Internet'. The first comprehensive picture of how neurons connect to one another found local networks of neurons layered like the shells in a Russian nesting doll. The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. The brain operates in a similar way, the researchers found. 'The cerebral cortex is like a mini-Internet,' said Larry Swanson, professor at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and corresponding author of a paper on the discovery. 'The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. 'The brain operates in a similar way.' The study was published on April 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For years, scientists looking for clues to brain function through its structure focused on what could be seen — the brain's lobes, grooves and folds. Two local networks — one governing vision and learning, and another tapped into bodily concerns like muscle and organ function — make up the inner shell of the rat's cerebral cortex. Two others — one governing smell, and another that assembles and makes sense of the information from the other three networks — make up the outer shell. This means that certain flows of information are genetically 'hardwired' into the brain, Swanson said. The discovery is the result of a massive, labor-intensive effort to organize 40 years' worth of data from peer-reviewed research articles detailing connections in rat brains. 'The data was already out there; it just needed to be compiled into a more useful format,' Swanson said. Lead author Mihail Bota of USC Dornsife created the database from more than 16,000 reports of connections, which he weighted both on the strength of the connection and the reliability of the methodology used to discover it. The process took more than 4,000 hours to complete, yielding a database that is free and available. Olaf Sporns of Indiana University subsequently performed a network analysis of the connections. A color-coded flat map of 1,923 rat cortical association macroconnections (RCAMs). The team used studies of rat brains because of the sheer volume of detailed information available. Swanson believes that the database can create an important link between human brain studies — which are largely done as non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging scans — and rat brain studies, which can be more in-depth. 'Having a wiring diagram for the brain will allow knowledge to flow both ways between human and animal studies,' Swanson said. 'This allows us to take theories from human brain scan studies and experimentally verify them in animals, and discoveries made in animal studies are likely to have an analogue in humans.' 'We're bridging the gap between our work in rat brains and the Stevens Institute's work with human brains,' Swanson said. 'If we can connect these two veins of neuroscience in a concrete and meaningful way, then we can dramatically expand our reservoir of information about the brain practically overnight.' In the future, Swanson hopes to be able to expand the neural-connection map of the rat brain beyond the cerebral cortex, some day mapping the entire nervous system.","Researchers say the cerebral cortex of rats is 'like a mini-Internet'

"Unique insight:CJullian Fellowes, pictured with Downton star Michelle Dockery . Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes is to give a unique insight into his inspiration for the period drama at the Chalke Valley History Festival. The stellar bill also includes historian David Starkey, best-selling novelist Kate Mosse, award-winning biographer Claire Tomalin, explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Private Eye editor Ian Hislop and Neil MacGregor, who recently announced he is to step down as director of the British Museum. Visitors to the festival, sponsored by the Daily Mail, will also be able to hear first-hand accounts from the last surviving British Dambuster George ‘Johnny’ Johnson, and Battle of Britain fighter pilot Tom Neil. The event attracts more than 30,000 visitors to its idyllic venue in a Wiltshire field. This year it boasts more than 140 speakers, a stunning air show and ‘living history’ re-enactments over seven days – a rapid rise from its humble beginnings when 12 events were held in one tent just five years ago. Festival co-chairman James Holland said: ‘Our festival is the only one of its kind in the UK. There’s so much to see and do.’ This year there will even be a medieval tournament. Away from the clattering of swords, much clamour is expected among Downton fans for tickets to see Lord Fellowes following the announcement that the forthcoming series of the hugely popular drama will be the last. This year’s judges for the festival’s annual competition to find young writers who can bring history to life include Birdsong author Sebastian Faulks, Claire Tomalin and best-selling novelist Charlie Higson. Budding young authors are being asked to submit a first chapter of a historical novel of no more than 1,500 words, and a brief outline of the rest of the proposed novel of up to 500 words, for a chance of winning the Penguin Chalke Valley History Prize. It must be on one of the following themes: The Ancients; Secret and Spies; The Home; Adventurers and Inventors; or King and Country. There are two age groups: 11 to 14 and 15 to 18. Entrants will be judged on historical research, writing skill and originality. The winner of each category gets £500, £100 of Penguin Books and a one-to-one session with a senior publisher at Penguin. The winners’ schools also receive £500. Those shortlisted in each age group will be invited to the Penguin Chalke Valley History Prize Final on June 28. Entries must be uploaded at cvhf.org.uk/ history-prize by noon on May 29. Giving a talk titled The World of Downton Abbey: From the Great War to the Roaring Twenties, he will appear in conversation with ITN political editor Tom Bradby, discussing the enormous social change brought by the First World War and why this period continues to fascinate and inspire him. Tickets for this and all talks go on sale today. Starkey, famous for his TV series including Monarchy, will mark the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta, by talking about its genesis, history, and influence on Britain today. Mosse will explain the historical backdrop of her Languedoc trilogy, each set in or around Carcassonne at an important point in the French city’s history, from the 13th century to the Second World War. Tomalin speaks on diarist Samuel Pepys. Sir Ranulph, whose ancestors fought on both the French and English sides at Agincourt, will take an irreverent look at the 1415 battle. In a year of many poignant anniversaries, there will be a 1940s themed Victory Party recognising the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Mr Johnson, 93, a bomb aimer in RAF 617 Squadron’s Dambusters raid of May 17, 1943, will be among seven Lancaster crew veterans sharing their memories. For the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, Wing Commander Neil, 94, who survived 141 combat missions, will talk about those days. Hislop will discuss the importance of satire past and present while MacGregor, credited with turning the British Museum into one of the world’s most visited attractions, will explore 600 years of Germany’s complex history. The festival, in Ebbesbourne Wake near Salisbury, Wiltshire, runs from June 22 to 28. To buy tickets, go to www.cvhf.org.uk or phone 01722 781133.

"Head teacher Peter Gale been sacked for 'inappropriate' and 'unprofessional' behaviour . The first male headteacher at an all-girls grammar school has been sacked for 'inappropriate' and 'unprofessional' behaviour less than two years after taking up the post. Peter Gale was fired from his position at high-performing Nonsuch High School for Girls in Cheam, Surrey, due to 'serious breaches' in safeguarding procedures. He was appointed to run the school, which counts singer Katie Melua amongst its alumnae, in September 2013 after the mysterious departure of its previous head, Karin Rowsell. In a letter to parents, the chairman of the governing body, Tony Hyams-Parish, said: 'The governing body has terminated Peter Gale's employment at Nonsuch High School for Girls due to serious breaches in applying safeguarding procedures and instances of unprofessional and inappropriate conduct. 'As you can imagine, this was not an easy decision. 'Especially because we recognise that since Peter's appointment there have been many positive changes within the school led by Peter and the senior leadership team. 'However, the governing body and staff take their safeguarding responsibilities towards students very seriously and, importantly, any breaches of safeguarding procedures, and have therefore acted promptly to address these matters.' Carol Dickie, the school's bursar said the education of the 1,200 pupils would be unaffected by the sacking but did not elaborate on the allegations. The soon will soon start the process of recruiting a new headteacher and in the interim deputy head Tracey Hartley will fill the position. Mr Gale moved to the school after working as the deputy headteacher at Rosebery School in Epsom where he was responsible for curriculum, data and timetabling. He was also  seconded to George Abbot School in Guildford as part of its executive team. Well-known alumnae from the school include Olympic cycling champion Joanna Rowsell (left) and singer Katie Melua .

"Ethan Czahor (pictured) has launched ‘Clear’ which removes any posts that might cause you problems with your current or future employer . A former aide to Jeb Bush who was fired for offensive tweets has developed an app that lets you scrub embarrassing messages from the social network. Ethan Czahor has launched ‘Clear’ which removes any posts that might cause you problems with your current or future employer. Users can search for keywords such as ‘gay’, ‘black’ or swear words and the program deletes any tweet that mentions them. Mr Czahor said hoped the app would ensure others do not suffer the same fate as he did. In February, Mr Czahor was fired from his job as a chief technology officer for Mr Bush, the former Florida governor and potential 2016 Presidential candidate. Among the old Twitter messages he posted was one in which he called female students ‘sluts’. One post read: ‘When I burp in the gym I feel like it’s my way of saying, ‘sorry guys, but I’m not gay’’. Mr Czahor told Time magazine: ‘Why wasn’t I smart enough to take care of this before it happens? ‘This could happen to anyone in any field - it doesn’t have to be politics - every millennial is now entering the workforce, and maybe even a senior position, and everything they’ve said online for the last 10 years is still there, and that’s a new thing for this generation’. Mr Czahor said that with Clear a user’s tweets are analysed using IBM’s Watson supercomputer and put through sentiment analysis to ensure they are taken in context.

Users are then given a rating between 0 and 100 as to how safe their profile is and the can act accordingly based on the result. Researchers from Stanford and Cornell University recently studied 40 million posts made by 1.7 million web users to try to identify trolls. From this data they were able identify so-called Future-Banned Users (FBUs) - and Never-Banned Users (NBUs). The former are people that are more likely to exhibit antisocial behaviour on online forums, while the latter are everyday users that don't show signs of troll-like behaviour. The researchers then built an algorithm that scans posts for signs of such antisocial behaviour, and a study shows this algorithm can identify potential trolls in 80% of cases. For example, posts made by  trolls are less readable. Trolls are more likely to veer off-topic and have fewer similarities in terms of language and content compared to other posts. Trolls are also less likely to use positive words than other users and they swear more. In terms of activity, the study found that trolls make more comments each day, and post more times on each thread. Trolls were also more likely to have had posts deleted than other users. Mr Czahor said: ‘The most challenging part of this is determining which tweets are actually offensive, and that’s something that will take a while to get really good at’. He added he also wanted to develop the app so that it worked for other social networks and blogs. After his tweets became public it emerged that in his personal blog he praised civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. because he ‘didn’t have his pants sagged to his ankles’. Mr Czahor said: ‘You as a person exist in a lot of places on the internet, and I just feel that you have the right to at least know what’s out there, and to take care of it’. Like the general public, celebrities have often been caught out by old tweets they posted that have come back to haunt them. And when somebody becomes famous, their messages on social networks going back years are combed through by fans and put under the spotlight. In the US Trevor Noah, the new host of comedy programme The Daily Show, was criticised for old tweets in which he made anti-Semitic jokes. He also made jokes about overweight women which sparked criticism that he was the wrong man for the job. Last year Twitter made it easier to find such messages as its search option allows anyone to comb through every tweet ever published publicly. Previously you had to scroll through years of tweets or pay for expensive search software. The app is currently in beta and interested users can register their interest to be told when the app will be available for download from the iOS store.","App created to remove posts that might cause problems with employers .

"Stephanie Scott was allegedly murdered just days before she was due to walk down the aisle . The man accused of the brutal murder of young teacher Stephanie Scott led a secret life online that included violent video games, a seeming obsession with fantasy worlds and rambling writings for a science fiction series. New details have emerged about Vincent Stanford, who created an online alter ego to use in science fiction, gaming and fantasy forums characters. Stanford, 24, has been charged with killing Ms Scott, a popular high school teacher in Leeton, 550 kilometres from Sydney, on Easter Sunday, just days before she was due to be married to her childhood sweetheart. Fairfax Media identified an online profile it said Stanford used, including a YouTube channel and multiple gaming forums. Using the name of a mythical Aztec serpent Quetzalcoalt, Stanford's wrote scripts for his favourite TV series, the science fiction show Stargate, titled 'Secret endangered' about a fictional land 'under imminent threat when wraith survivors know about atlantis'. 'Hi. Wanted to introduce myself names Vincent. Love stargate and videogames and I do a bit of 3d modelling in my spare time [sic],' he wrote as Quetzalcoalt in one forum. 'Loved stargate resistance and i like fallout 3 gears of war franchise halo 1 through 3 and the dead space games.' he posted in another forum, in June 2012, in reference to some of his favourite shooting games. According to Fairfax Media, Stanford signed petitions to save violent galactic warfare games such as Stargate World and Stargate Resistant. His YouTube account included more than 65 videos - mostly recordings of him playing games with other people online, including the violent zombie apocalypse Dying Light and the fantasy game League of Legends. In many of the videos he can be heard talking in a European-sounding language. In one, he laughs after deliberately blowing up his game character by shooting a gas cannister. Scroll down for video . The online profile named quetzalcoalt identifies himself as a person named Vincent who loves videogames . Stanford uploaded some of his online video game battles to YouTube (seen here) Stanford has uploaded more than 65 videos of his gaming interactions with other gamers as he commentates . Stanford had an obsession with a number of computer games, including League of Legends . Stanford commented 'I regret nothing' on a YouTube video about Nazi leader Rudolf Hess. 'RIP Rudolf Hess. Ich bereue nichts,' he wrote. The gamer was like an invisible man in the small rural town he moved to just 13 months ago. Leeton has a close-knit community of only 6,700 people, but little else is known of the casual school cleaner who has swept the halls of Leeton High School since October. Stanford was born in Tasmania and lived in Holland with his family and working in the city of Rotterdam before returning to Australia as an adult. He moved into a single-storey home with his mother Anika and elder brother Luke with just a small bag of belongings each. His neighbours in Maiden Avenue say the family were welcomed by the community but Stanford made few connections. Neighbour Gail Scanlan told Daily Mail Australia Stanford was a ‘big strong fellow with dark, black eyes’ who she and her husband would chat to over the fence. Police were lead to the place where Stephanie Scott's remains were found, by the family of her accused killer . Stephanie Scott (right), pictured with her fiancé Aaron Leeson-Woolley, was last seen on Easter Sunday . She described him as a beautifully mannered and polite young man who wanted to get ahead in life. Mrs Scanlan said the accused and his family mostly kept to themselves but were friendly and 'would come over for a cup of coffee'. His mother Anika, a qualified nurse, worked at a local nursing home and Stanford, along with his brother Luke, worked shift work so Mr Scanlan said they did not see the family often. Meanwhile, as Stanford adjusted to life in Leeton, his identical twin brother – who moved from Holland back to Australia in June 2013 - settled in South Australia. Stanford engaged in fictional gunfire with other gamers in the violent video games . In one YouTube video, he commented 'I regret nothing' on a  video about Nazi leader Rudolf Hess . Mr Scanlan, the retired pensioner living next door to Stanford, confirmed on Friday that photographs of Stanford's twin that had circulated in the media were correct. ‘That’s definitely him. They really look identical. Vincent is a little broader and fatter in the face but you can’t mistake who it is,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘They look exactly the same in the face – the image of each other. He also has the same receding hairline. Looking at him is like looking at Vincent.’ Hinting at a possible family rift, the alleged killer’s twin wrote on Facebook on January 4: ‘One good thing about not being able to go home, been back to Swan Reach and Gawler for the first time in 4 years.’ The Sydney Morning Herald reports Stanford worked with his twin designing a new video game called Overseer but it was never released. Ms Scott, pictured on a wine tour for her hen party last month in Canberra last month with her mother Merrilyn . Steph was set to marry her childhood sweetheart Aaron and honeymoon in Tahiti . Before moving back to Australia, Stanford - who speaks with a Dutch accent - previously worked as a cleaner for a dental company in Holland. In Leeton, he landed a casual job with cleaning company Colin Joss & Co, who have a contract with the Department of Education in NSW. Senior manager at the company Fleur Dooley told Daily Mail Australia that Stanford had worked for them since October last year. She explained he had passed national criminal record checks and worked at multiple schools in the area, as well as the local TAFE. 'He was employed as a casual cleaner and worked on different sites a required,' Ms Dooley said. It has now emerged Stanford was not contracted to work on the Sunday that he allegedly killed Ms Scott. Her body was discovered on Friday evening around 5pm in Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW .

A police forensic officer carried evidence from his home after Stanford was charged with murder . Ms Scott was preparing lesson plans at Leeton High School for a relief teacher who would be working in her place while she was on her honeymoon when she disappeared. An autopsy will soon begin on Ms Scott's body to determine how she was killed and dumped in bushland six days before she was due to get married. Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week. This follows after it has emerged detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Ms Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports. Police discovered the burnt remains of a woman's body around 5pm on Friday . Stanford has reportedly been uncooperative with investigators. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW police for comment. It has also emerged that one of the last actions of Ms Scott was to send an email to the bus company hired for her wedding, confirming transportation for guests. Police discovered the burnt remains of a woman's body around 5pm on Friday after they were directed to Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW by  Stanford's mother and brother. It's further alleged a gasoline can had been found nearby. It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family. Ms Scott's grief-stricken fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley was supported by loved ones to release yellow balloons into the air to commemorate her life at a memorial on what would have been their wedding day . On Saturday, the day Ms Scott was due to marry fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley, a memorial was held . Ms Scott was last seen at Leeton High School as she prepared to go away on her honeymoon .

Her father Robert Scott spoke to the gathered mourners on behalf of his family and friends who were united in their grief on Saturday at Mountford Park in Leeton. The 26-year-old was last seen on Easter Sunday, when her disappearance sparked a widespread search for the much-loved teacher. 'Stephanie was a bright, intelligent and fun-loving woman who has impacted on many people here today,' Mr Scott said at his daughter's memorial on Saturday. 'Our wishes for the future are that this stays in your minds and you remember her. 'I'm sure she'd wish for that to be the case and you could remember her for the great little girl she was.'

"Jeremy Clarkson has finally spoken out about his high-profile sacking from Top Gear, admitting he will 'miss' fronting the BBC2 show. Clarkson, 54, who was fired in March after attacking a producer during filming, has not publicly addressed his dismissal, apart from to say that 'everyone's upset'. But the presenter today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who sent their support in the aftermath of his sacking, saying he would 'miss being there'. It came as Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said she would be keen to return to the motoring show if she were invited back. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (left) today revealed he would 'miss' fronting Top Gear, as it emerged that former presenter Angela Rippon (right) would be keen to return to the motoring show . Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said it would be 'great' if she were invited back to front Top Gear . Writing in The Sun, Clarkson said: 'Heartfelt thanks to all those who have written to say how much they will miss me on Top Gear. It's not as much, however, as I'll miss being there.' Clarkson was dropped by the BBC after an internal investigation found he had launched an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips. The presenter was found to have split the producer's lip and verbally abused him. Following weeks of speculation over the star's future, Lord Hall, the director-general of the corporation, publicly announced  that the BBC would not be renewing Clarkson's contract. He said Clarkson had 'crossed the line' and that 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Now, with the future of the show still up in the air, former newsreader Ms Rippon said it would be 'great' if she was invited back. Clarkson, who was dropped by the BBC after launching an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon. today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who have supported him . She told The Daily Mirror: 'It would be great if they said ""let's get the old girl back to do the odd film for us"". What I did all those years ago is totally different to what they do now. 'If a programme is going to have longevity, which Top Gear has, it has to keep evolving.' She added that there should be a woman included in the team - because half the drivers on the road are female. Jodie Kidd, the former model, has already been linked to the show. It also emerged last month that DIY SOS star Nick Knowles could become the new Top Gear presenter because the BBC believe he is a 'safe pair of hands'. Meanwhile, BBC bosses are said to be desperately trying to hold onto James May (left) and Richard Hammond (right) - Clarkson's co-presenters - for the BBC2 show . Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era' But BBC bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade Richard Hammond and James May to continue with the show, in a bid to cling onto long-term fans. Although May, 52, and Hammond, 45, have both hinted separately that they do not see a future with Top Gear, both have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Richard is a TV presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he's been on the show a bit longer than James. That is a big opportunity to pass over.' They added: 'It would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one.' Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era'. But little has been said since the initial reaction to the sacking. Some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to sign up the group as a trio. All three were on the cusp of signing new three-year deals when the Clarkson fracas unfolded. Some believe the pair are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to snap up the former Top Gear group as a trio . The day after Clarkson's sacking, May gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to Top Gear, suggesting he is to ‘go back to normal life.’ The presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher. He said: 'I might want to do something completely different with my life, I'm quite old now. (I might do) something outside of cars, I always wanted to be a teacher.' He also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top-rating programme, saying: 'We always knew it wasn't going to last forever'. Clarkson, 54, was sacked after attacking Oisin Tymon in an episode which Lord Hall said had 'crossed the line' But the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob previously made it clear he wanted May and Hammond to continue presenting the show without Clarkson, despite acknowledging it would be 'perfectly natural' for them to have reservations about continuing. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' May fronts several other TV programmes, including the popular James May's Toy Stories, James May's Man Lab and Oz and James' Big Wine Adventure with wine expert Oz Clarke. Hammond has a successful career as a children’s television host, fronting the second series of National Geographic's Science of Stupid. He also hosted BBC1’s physical game show Total Wipeout and the CBBC series Blast Lab before they were axed. Clarkson, May and Hammond are scheduled to take part in the live Top Gear shows next month. But the shows have been renamed, without BBC branding. Earlier this month North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel. Clarkson pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You, which was due to be filmed next week, and aired a day later. It would have marked his first BBC appearance since the fracas which led to his departure.","Clarkson has not spoken publicly about sacking since news broke in March .

"A 31-year-old British woman has died in a freak accident when she was crushed by a falling tree in the Bolivian jungle while on her dream round-the-world trip. Louise Shepherd had been hiking through the remote Madidi national park in the north-western part of the country when a tree toppled onto her during a storm. Ms Shepherd, from Cobham, Surrey, had taken a 'gap year' off work in order to go travelling around the world with her sister Hannah and college friend Rose Jones, both 30. Tragedy: Louise Shepherd, 31, from Cobham, Surrey, was hiking through a national park in north-west Bolivia with her sister and a friend when a tree toppled onto her during a storm . Her grief-stricken parents, Peter and Christine Shepherd from Cobham, Surrey said they were left having to choose a burial plot instead of planning for her birthday. Mrs Shepherd said: 'She lit up a room, everybody instantly liked her. 'We have been so moved by all the condolence cards from around the world. Ms Shepherd, from Surrey, had taken a 'gap year' off work in order to go travelling around the world . 'She was a special person and touched a lot of people's lives. She was the kindest person you could meet.' Louise gained her first degree in business and marketing at the University of Westminster in 2006. Ms Shepherd went onto obtain a masters degree at Kingston University in south-west London in museums, galleries and the creative economy, after which she took a position at the university's alumni office. She formerly worked as a support worker for the disability and dyslexia support office. Hannah Shepherd said today that she herself was nearly killed at the same time as her sister. She said: 'It was like a tornado that hit us within seconds. We were told to run by the guides and heard a tree crack and then it fell. 'Louise was killed instantly as she was hit by the full force of the tree. She was my best friend. She had such charisma and was beautiful and good to everyone. 'People just gravitated towards her. She died as she was having the time of her life - and not many people can say that.' One friend said in an online message: 'A parent's worst nightmare, lovely girl.' Ms Shepherd's former colleagues have also paid their respects on the university's website. One staff member said: 'She was a beautiful young lady inside and out, and always a pleasure to work with.' Heartbreaking: Friends and family of the popular university graduate have been paying tribute to her today . Helen Trott, the department head she worked with at Kingston, said : 'Louise had a passion for life and love of people. She was a beautiful young lady. Our thoughts are with her friends and family at this sad time.' The university has set up a book of condolences which, after being signed, will be handed to Ms Shepherd's family. A Kingston University spokesman said : 'Louise was an invaluable member of the team and made a major contribution to developing relations with alumni across the world. 'She was one of those people who lit up the room wherever she was. Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this sad time.' Staff and students are being invited to sign a book of condolence which has been opened at the university for people to make personal tributes in Louise's memory.","Louise Shepherd, 31, killed in Bolivia while on round-the-world trip .

"A rapist who left a teenager for dead after a savage attack at a bus stop had already stalked three other women that night before choosing his victim. The 18-year-old was hit over the head 20 times with a rock and dragged into a garden to be brutally raped by the man and left for dead in the Beeston area of Leeds last month. Now police investigating the case have come across CCTV that shows the man following three other potential victims earlier on the same night. CCTV footage of a man police believer to be the attacker of a woman who was brutally raped at a bus stop in Leeds. He was shown wearing a green Puma sweatshirt, dark jacket and jeans in the hours before the incident when he also stalked three other women . West Yorkshire Police produced this computer generated image after taking a description of the suspect from his victim. He is described as of Pakistani or Middle Eastern background and in his early twenties . It includes one woman who was forced to flee from the man by bus after walking to her car in Leeds city centre, ending up miles away from where she was going, just to get to safety. Another potential victim followed may have been aware she was being stalked as he also walked up behind her in the city centre as she walked past a row of bars. While a third woman can be seen on the footage seen by police turning around to find herself just an inch away from the rapist, before darting into a shop and staying in there until he left on the city's Burley Road. Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police said the man had been looking for women in Leeds city centre before moving on to the outskirts of the city. A map showing the areas of Leeds, where the rapist had been stalking women on the night of the attack . He told the Daily Mirror: 'His first target was a woman in her 20s who had parked her car. He is seen walking behind her, six inches from her back pocket. 'She was so concerned she got a bus that took her miles from where she was going. 'Another woman was also so concerned, she headed for a shop. On reaching it she is seen on film stopping and turning to see where he is. 'As she does, she is face-to-face with him. He is only about an inch away.' In a graphic CCTV sequence the man is seen dragging the woman from the bus stop and into a garden to rape her . The chilling footage was released by West Yorkshire Police in a bid to trace the man who is wanted for rape and attempted murder .

"One of Australia’s most prestigious race days, the opening of The Championships, has been postponed after wild weather left Randwick Racecourse unsafe to compete on. Stewards announced it was too risky to race on the wet surface after an early inspection at around 9.30am Saturday morning, disappointing the 25,000 punters officials expected to show. Under normal circumstances the Australian Turf Club would've been packed with punters dressed to the nines scrambling for a seat, but as early racegoers Susie Pleasance and Helen Quarrel learned, the field was absolutely empty.

We might have got through one or two, but to get through 10 races with big fields would have been a miracle so we will wait for Monday,’ he added.

"U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro will have a substantive 'discussion' tomorrow at a regional summit the two men are attending this weekend in Panama, the White House said Friday. It will be the first time in more than 50 years that leaders from the previously estranged countries will have had a lengthy in-person exchange. Ahead of an anticipated run-in, if not a formal meeting, this weekend in at the seventh Summit of the Americas, the two presidents spoke by phone on Wednesday for only the second, known time in as many years. Jorge Leganoa, deputy director of Cuba's National Information Agency, this morning made the disclosure to the Associated Press, and a White House official later told reporters traveling with the administration, 'I can confirm that President Obama spoke with President Castro on Wednesday, before President Obama departed Washington.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama walks across the Miraflores Locks during his tour of the Panama Canal today.

A White House official today told reporters traveling with the administration: 'I can confirm that President Obama spoke with President Castro on Wednesday, before President Obama departed Washington' Apart from a couple of brief, informal encounters, including a 2013 handshake between Obama and Castro at South African leader Nelson Mandela's funeral, the leaders of the United States and Cuba have not had any significant meetings since Cuba's 1959 revolution . President Barack Obama is pictured here today with Secretary of State John Kerry, left, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, far left, at a bilateral meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, who is out of frame . The decades-long detente between the countries appeared to be official over on Friday as the United States' Obama and Cuba's Castro prepared to share the same stage  in an encounter rich with symbolism as their countries . set aside decades of mistrust and attempt to restore diplomatic . relations. The rapprochement is set to dominate the Summit of the . Americas meeting, held in Panama, less than four months after . they announced they would seek to lower tensions and boost trade . and travel between the two Cold War enemies. Obama and Castro have separate agendas for most of the day, and the White House had said a private meeting was not on the books. But they were both scheduled to attend the start of the summit along with . other regional leaders on Friday evening and the White House said they could have an unscripted 'interaction' there. A national security adviser to the president told reporters in a Friday update, 'We don't have a formal meeting scheduled at a certain time, but we anticipate they will have a discussion tomorrow.' 'We certainly do anticipate that they will have the opportunity to see each other at the summit tomorrow, to have a discussion,' the adviser, Ben Rhodes, reportedly said. Apart from a couple of brief, informal encounters, including a 2013 handshake between Obama and Castro at South African leader Nelson Mandela's funeral, the . leaders of the United States and Cuba have not had any . significant meetings since Castro's older brother Fidel toppled U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista in a 1959 . revolution. But the two nations' top diplomats - Secretary of State John . Kerry and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez - held talks at . a Panama City hotel on Thursday night, the first meeting of its . kind since John Foster Dulles and Gonzalo Guell got together in . Washington in 1958. Sitting face-to-face in a room visible through a large glass . window, Kerry and Rodriguez talked for over two hours. A senior . State Department official described it as a 'lengthy and very . constructive discussion' and said they made progress. Obama and Castro have separate agendas for most of the day, and the White House had said a private meeting was not on the books. But they were both scheduled to attend the start of the summit along with other regional leaders on Friday evening and the White House said they could have an unscripted conversation there. By Friday afternoon that exchange had been upgraded by the White House to a 'discussion' Secretary of State John Kerry and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez - held talks at a Panama City hotel on Thursday night, the first meeting between the countries' diplomats since 1958 . President Obama,  John Kerry and Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina participate in a multi-lateral meeting with Central American Integration System (SICA) Presidents this afternoon . Obama appears to be close to removing Cuba from the U.S. list of countries that it says sponsor terrorism. Cuba's . inclusion on the list has exacerbated tensions and made it . harder for U.S. firms to do business with Cuba. The U.S. State Department has now recommended that Cuba be . taken off the list, a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee . aide said on Thursday. Obama is expected to agree, although it is not clear whether . he will announce his decision during the summit. 'We don't want to be imprisoned by the past,' Obama said Thursday during the first leg of his trip abroad in in Jamaica. 'When something doesn't work for 50 years, you don't just keep on doing it. 'You try something new.' Rhodes told reporters Friday that he was 'not ruling out any announcement but... we are not there yet in terms of a final recommendation being made to the president, and the president making a determination.' A U.S. official said Kerry and Rodriguez used their meeting . to smooth the way for Cuba's removal from the list. The United . States has pushed for Cuban assurances of no future support for . terrorism, and Cuba has made the same demand of Washington. Striking Cuba from the list would move the two countries . closer to renewing full diplomatic relations, broken off by . Washington in 1961, and would be popular in Latin America, where . governments had pushed Washington for years to change its Cuba . policy.

Widespread praise in the region for Obama's new Cuba policy . was tempered last month, however, when his administration . imposed sanctions on Venezuela, Cuba's closest ally and main . benefactor. That controversy now hangs over the summit, which . ends on Saturday. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he will present . Obama with a petition signed by 13.4 million people demanding . that the sanctions be reversed. He is certain to receive support . from Castro and other left-wing leaders in Latin America. Of the situation, Rhodes on Friday said, 'Our principal way of communicating with Venezuela will be direct dialogue, even as we know that there will be differences between our two governments on a variety of issues.' Following Friday's announcement that President Obama would in fact meet with Castro, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, increasingly a thorn in the administration's side, said the U.S. president 'is truly writing new chapters in American foreign policy' - but they are 'ones of America and the values we stand for – human rights, freedom, and democracy – in retreat and decline.' Graham accused Obama of appeasing 'autocratic dictators, thugs, and adversaries and said he has 'emboldened' America's enemies while leaving the country's 'friends demoralized.' 'There can be no doubt that President Obama’s failing foreign policy has greatly diminished America’s influence in the world,' the Republican lawmaker who is 'testing the waters' for a presidential campaign said.

"It has been almost a month since an Italian model accused movie executive Harvey Weinstein of groping her, and Wednesday night he and his wife were spotted out together for the first time since the alleged incident. Weinsten and his designer wife Georgina Chapman turned up for the premiere of his new Broadway production Finding Neverland in New York City. The play, which stars Glee star Matthew Morrison and Kelsey Grammer, is based on the 2004 film of the same name Weinstein produced starring Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp. The couple have been out together numerous times over the past few weeks as well, attending Finding Neverland rehearsals, celebrating Easter together with their children, and at a party for Georgina’s birthday earlier in the week. Scroll down for video . Harvey Weinsten and his designer wife Georgina Chapman (above) turned up for the premiere of his new Broadway play Finding Neverland on Wednesday . Composer Gary Barlow, actor Matthew Morrison,  Weinstein, actress Laura Michelle Kelly and actor Kelsey Grammer at the premiere . The happy couple were joined by stars including Helen Mirren, Bryan Cranston, Ansel Elgort, Darren Criss, Olivia Wilde and Christoph Waltz for the opening night of the play, which received disastrous reviews from critics. New York Magazine called the show 'badly written' and 'frustrating,' while the New York Times said the production is 'largely made up of empty calories.' Ambra Battilana (above) claimed Weinstein stuck his hand under her skirt during a meeting at his office in March . Earlier this week Chapman shared a photo of the birthday flowers (above) Weinstein sent her . And while Weinstein may not be thrilled with these reviews, he is not doubt happy with the news that he will not be facing criminal charges for last month's groping incident. District attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero said last Friday: 'This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. 'After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.'

The perfectly polished Chapman, 38, and notoriously brash Weinstein, 63, began dating in late 2004 and were married three years later at their Connecticut estate. The wedding, in which the British beauty wore one of her own Marchesa designs, was packed with celebrities, including Cameron Diaz, Renee Zellweger, Naomi Watts, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez and Vogue editrix Anna Wintour, to name just a few.

"The third of five men arrested during raids in Melbourne at the weekend which saw police foil an Anzac Day terror plot has now been charged. The 18-year-old Hampton Park man had his Preventative Detention Order - which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days -  removed, and the teenager was re-arrested. The man has now been charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts', according to Victorian Police and AFP. Scroll down for video . A third man has been charged after raids in Melbourne led police to foil an Anzac Day terror plot. Police uncovered swords and knifes after searching five teenager's homes . He will appear in Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. On Monday a police insider revealed sickening details about the alleged Anzac Day terror plot, claiming the accused men planned to run over a police officer and then kill him with a knife. According to the ABC, a security official close to the ongoing investigation said the group of five men intended to take the officer's gun and embark on a shooting rampage on the streets of Melbourne. The shocking plans mirror those of Islamic preachers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who ran down 25-year-old soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich south-east London in May 2013 before 'butchering him' to death. Sevdet Besim (pictured) along with four other men, planned to run down a police officer before using a knife to stab him to death . The British-born Muslim converts ran Rigby down in a car before hacking him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in a frenzied attack.. They dumped the body of the father-of-one in the middle of the road near Woolwich Barracks in south east London. Adebolajo and Adebowale lay in wait near the barracks and picked Fusilier Rigby to kill after assuming he was a soldier because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack. Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon . Both men were shot by police in dramatic scenes captured by CCTV. They claimed they were 'soldiers of Allah' and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing. The five men who were arrested in anti-terror raids on Saturday in Melbourne, after the culmination of a month-long operation code-named Operation Rising, were planning a strikingly similar attack. Around 200 police officers were involved in the raids and investigations are still ongoing. Police said the alleged plot could have been executed any time in the next week after they found knifes and swords in the teenager's homes and it emerged that they were scouting police stations in the run-up to their attack. British soldier Lee Rigby was stabbed to death with a meat cleaver on the streets of London in 2013 . Michael Adebolajo (right) and Michael Adebowale (left) ran down 25-year-old soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich south-east London in May 2013 before 'butchering him' to death . It comes as a British teenager has been arrested on suspicion of helping to plot the ISIS-inspired attack during the First World War commemorations. The 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire allegedly communicated with Australian men who were planning to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Greater Manchester Police said today the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' Mr Besim did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody for a filing hearing on April 24 . The teen was interviewed by police all morning before travelling to the Magistrates Court where he was charged . Two of the five men arrested in pre-dawn raids on Saturday remain in custody, including Sevdet Besim, 18, of Hallam, who was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act. A second 18-year-old man, of Hampton Park in Melbourne's southeast, is being held under a Preventative Detention Order, which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days. He has now been charged. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured). His parents have spoken out after it emerged the five men were trying to avenge their son . Police held one of the alleged ringleaders in jail under tough new terror laws, despite not being charged. The man, who cannot be identified due to suppression orders, could be held for the whole 14 days after police applied for a Preventive Detention Order. Both men often frequented the controversial Al-Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale. A friend of the two men still in custody said they became radicalised after the death of Numan Haider. Haider was killed by police last year after he attacked officers with a knife, and is believed to have planned an ISIS-like attack. The two alleged ringleaders of the Anzac Day plot reportedly attended Haider's funeral. Haider's parents spoke out for the first time since his death in September, when he was gunned down while trying to stab two officers. Their comments come after it emerged the five men who planned Saturday's attacks were planning to avenge their son. 'We just want only peace for our family — and Australia,' Haider's father told the Herald Sun. 'We don't want violence.' It was also revealed the young men arrested on Saturday had personal links with a senior Australian jihadist and Islamic State recruiter in Syria. All five men are from suburbs in the city's far southeast. Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash (left), 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS . Pictured is one of the homes in the suburb where police made one of several arrest during terror raids . Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash, 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS, according to Fairfax Media. Prakash, who is know by the jihadist name Abu Khalid al-Kambodi, may have been in direct communication with the teenagers until recently. Islamic preacher Junaid Thorne, a self-styled Australian jihadist speaker, has described the raids in Melbourne as the 'usual nonsense' and said it was 'strange' how authorities could stop alleged terrorism plots 'but can't foil rape incidents'. Mr Thorne has been a regular speaker at the controversial Al-Furqan Centre in Springvale in Melbourne, where the five men arrested at the weekend also attended. Like the five men arrested at the weekend, Mr Thorne was linked with 18-year-old Numan Haider, who was shot dead in September after stabbing two police officers at a Melbourne police station car park. Just two days before 18-year-old Sevdet was arrested at his Melbourne home on Saturday, he was perusing the Facebook page of Junaid Thorne. Residents living next door to the homes that were raided in the early hours of the morning have described waking to glass smashing, screams and 'fire-cracker like' noises before seeing lights . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) and Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan (left) address a media conference in Sydney. Mr Abbott urged all Australians to continue with their Anzac Day celebration plans as normal . 'Strange how Australian authorities always foil terrorism plans, but can't foil rape incidents, robberies, domestic violence or anything else,' Mr Thorne tweeted in the wake of the arrests. 'May Allah be with the young kids and their families who were arrested today in #MelbourneArrest over mere speculation and the usual nonsense.' Thorne had also befriended Sharky Jama, the former Melbourne model who was killed earlier this month while fighting with Islamic State. The 25-year-old has also posted messages online in support of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Thorne sparked outrage in January when he told social media followers that insults to the Prophet Mohammad were 'not allowed' and were likely to 'simulate some kind of response' following the terror attacks in Paris. Thorne, who moved to Saudi Arabia with his family where he lived for 14 years until he was deported in 2013 for protesting his brother's imprisonment on terror charges, was in February banned from applying for passports or travelling overseas. The self-proclaimed sheik attempted to gain passage on a flight under false identification. Over the past 12 months, Thorne's views have been the subject of public scrutiny. Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne has come out in support of the five teenagers . Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them (on) certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.' Following the nation's biggest ever terror raids last September, he labelled Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in a statement posted on his Facebook page. After Melbourne man Numan Haider, 18, allegedly stabbed two police officers outside of a police station, Thorne said that he had been 'murdered by authorities'. Thorne later told the ABC Haider had attended some of his lectures, which he performs around the country. Thorne does not describe himself as a supporter of the Islamic State. He told the ABC last year: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them (Islamic State), I would get in trouble,' he said. 'If I was to say that (I) don't support them at all, that would be untrue. 'I may support them on certain issues, while I disagree with them on other issues'.

"Tory election chiefs have given their candidates a letter-writing kit to target farmers, pensioners and women, leaked documents have revealed. A series of model letters have been drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages designed to woo voters with just 28 days to go before the May 7 election. Women are told they are 'vital to the success of the British economy' while pensioners are praised for their 'wealth of experience'. A series of model letters have been drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages designed to woo voters with just 28 days to go before the May 7 election . The letter-writing kit was revealed today as David Cameron made a campaign stop  at the National Grid Training Centre in Newark . Tory candidates are told to praise teachers as 'the best we have ever had' and tell farmers that they are 'vital' the party's economic plan, according to the leaked letter-writing guide. The letter templates are aimed at what party headquarters describes as 'target groups' in the electorate. Tory chiefs believe there are seven groups of voters who can be persuaded to change their vote in the run up to the election, including military veterans, pensioners, teachers and parents. The other groups Tory candidates are asked to target are women, young voters and farmers. There are also a number of letters 'written specifically for individual subjects', including defence, immigration and Europe. It advises activists: 'People are more likely to respond to a message from you if you write to them on an issue that they are directly interested in. 'This pack aims to provide you with pre-written examples you can use as the basis on which to write to people on issues that they raise.' The 37-page document, leaked to the Guardian, tells its candidates to tell women: 'Conservatives are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for men and women in all aspects of their lives. 'We are supporting women in work and providing greater financial security by reducing taxes, cutting the cost of childcare, addressing the gender pay gap and introducing shared parental leave.' Leaked documents reveal Tory election chiefs have given their candidates a letter-writing kit to target farmers, pensioners, women and other target voters - as well as advice on how to respond to questions about certain subjects . The letter templates are aimed at what party headquarters describes as 'target groups' in the electorate . The pack also says: 'Women are vital to the success of the British economy, and because our long-term economic plan is working, there are now more women in work and more women running their own business than ever before'. A pensioner who has raised an issue may receive a letter that says: 'Conservatives believe that if you have worked hard, saved, paid your taxes and done the right thing, you deserve dignity and financial security when you retire. 'We want a country where you get something for something, not something for nothing.' A Tory spokesman refused to comment about the letter-writing guide. But Labour MP Graham Jones said: 'This pack contains thousands of words but, as usual with the Tories, no answers. 'Rather than pumping out propaganda, what they should be doing is providing an explanation for their extreme plans, which would put the NHS at risk, and an answer as to whether they'll give millionaires yet another tax break.' Green Party activists have been told to dress in 'mainstream' fashion while knocking on doors in a bid to win over sceptical voters. A manual for the party's supporters urges them to appear 'level headed' and 'agreeable' – and even encourages them to compliment people's homes. The advice, which has been distributed among Green campaigners in London, also provides stock answers to ease voters' concerns about their radical plans to dismantle the army, legalise drugs and pay everybody £72 a week no matter how rich they are. A Green campaigning manual urges activists to dress in 'mainstream' fashion - unlike the campaigners pictured with the party's only MP Caroline Lucas at a fracking protest at Balcombe, West Sussex (above) It comes amid growing scrutiny of the Green Party's manifesto commitments after its membership surged to more than 50,000, outnumbering the Liberal Democrats and Ukip. But the party's surge in support was hit by a series of disastrous media appearances from the party's leader Natalie Bennett in which she struggled to explain her key policies. In February she suffered what she called a 'brain fade' on LBC Radio when she forgot the details of her party's key housing policies. Ms Bennett endured another tough interview yesterday - and was forced to defend her proposal to give every adult in Britain a guaranteed weekly income. She admitted the so-called 'citizens income' – which critics say would cost £280billion – would take longer than five years to bring in, and could take even longer. Ms Bennett also admitted that another Green pledge – to dismantle the Armed Forces and use weapons factories to build wind turbines – was also a 'long-term aspiration'. The party also supports leaving Nato and abandoning nuclear weapons. The Green manual for volunteers aims to ease voters' concerns over the party's radical platform.","Series of model letters  drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages .

"The decomposing bodies of the men accused of killing 148 innocent people at a Kenyan university were paraded in front of a large crowd at a primary school today. The authorities drove the naked, bloated corpses of the four alleged terrorists around the town in a pickup truck from the mortuary to Garissa Primary School. It comes as survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding in a wardrobe and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued after al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Paraded: The naked bodies of the alleged attackers were driven around Garissa before the pickup truck parked at a primary school . In the primary school playground, hundreds gathered to look at the bodies of the men accused of being the attackers . Hundreds of people, some grieving for the loved ones they lost in the siege, gathered in the sweltering heat to catch a glimpse of the men who are believed to be responsible. Pictures of the crowds and the bodies piled onto the vehicle are being shared on social media. Four attackers died at Garissa, but they have not been named and their nationalities have not been revealed. It was hoped that crowds viewing the corpses might identify them. 'I want to see them,' Muna Haji told The Washington Post. 'I want to know that these people are dead. They have killed innocent people.' Survivor Ms Cheroitich, who hid under a pile of clothes, spoke about her ordeal following her rescue today. She was initially too petrified to come out of the wardrobe, but a lecturer she knew eventually convinced her that police officers were not the al-Shabaab gunmen - 50 hours after the barbaric attack began. Kenyan troops searching the building were alarmed when they heard sounds coming from inside a wardrobe. A police officer said: 'She kept asking for reassurance from the security forces they were not al-Shabaab before she could come out. 'She was given milk and rushed to the Garissa hospital, where she is being observed before being given counselling.' Speaking later in hospital, the survivor said she told officers from inside the wardrobe: 'How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?' 'I was just praying to my God,' Ms Cheroitich, a Christian, said. A crowd gathers outside the morgue to catch a glimpse of the corpses of the alleged terrorists who killed 148 .

People gather to catch a glimpse of the bodies of the alleged terrorists at the hospital mortuary in Garissa . This picture of a classroom strewn with dead bodies has emerged revealing the true horror of the massacre . Four other survivors from the massacre at Garissa University College were found yesterday. A photograph from inside one of the classrooms at the university has emerged, showing at least 12 bodies strewn across the floor, which is covered in blood. At least three people appear to have been huddled in fear in the corner of the room when they were murdered by the militant Islamists. The terrorists raided the university early on Thursday morning, overwhelming guards and murdering people they suspected of being a Christian. A total of 148 people were killed in the siege, with the gunmen shooting and beheading those who could not recite the Koran. Most of those killed were students but two police officers, one soldier and two watchmen are among the dead. Kenya's interior minister, Joseph Nkaissery said the four terrorist gunmen had strapped themselves with explosives. When officers shot at them, they exploded 'like bombs' and shrapnel injured officers. Kenyan security officials said dozens of hostages were freed and four of the gunmen, believed to be armed with AK-47s, were killed. Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, emerged after two days of hiding inside wardrobe at the university, and was initially too petrified to believe police officers were not al-Shabaab gunmen . Today survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued . The Interior Ministry said five suspects had been detained, some while trying to flee to Somalia, where al-Shabaab is based. Four were Kenyans of Somali origin, and the fifth was Tanzanian, the ministry said. Officials said all three were associates of Islamist teacher Mohamed Mohamud, who is believed to have masterminded the attack. There is a £145,000 bounty on his head. The interior ministry said the three suspects arrested at the border had coordinated the attack. Two people were detained at the university, including a security guard and a Tanzanian man. 'We suspect the Tanzanian, who was hiding in the ceiling, was one of the combatants,' ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. 'He had ammunition with him when he was arrested on Thursday night. We suspect the guard facilitated the entry (into the university).' In a chilling warning today, the terrorist group said more attacks like the university massacre were planned. 'Kenyan cities will run red with blood,' al-Shabab said in a statement, according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group.

A woman who survived the attack (centre) is reunited with relatives at Nyayo stadium in Nairobi today . The militants said the barbaric attack was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the rebels in Somalia. 'This will be a long, gruesome war of which you, the Kenyan public, are its first casualties. 'No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath.' Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said today that those behind the attack were 'deeply embedded' in Kenya, and called on Kenyan Muslims to help prevent radicalisation. 'Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities,' he said in a televised speech. 'Radicalisation that breeds terrorism is not conducted in the bush at night. It occurs in the full glare of day, in madrasas, in homes, and in mosques with rogue imams.'

"In a beautiful new campaign for Vans and & Other Stories, the woman dubbed the 'world's oldest supermodel' has put her younger counterparts to shame. Looking radiant, Daphne Selfe, 86, shows off the collaboration between the footwear super-brand and the ethereal high street store with uncompromising grace. Daphne said of the collection, in which she appears with 22-year-old Flo Dron: 'The & Other Stories’ collection that is featured in this story is truly relaxed and timeless with a modern twist, all in lovely colours.' 86-year-old Daphne Selfe has starred in the campaign for Vans and & Other Stories alongside Flo Dunn, 22 . The images show the new footwear which sees Stories make a twist on the classic vans slip on. The shoes are then worn with pieces from the brands SS2015 collection. Daphne's career originally began  in 1949 and she once told the Express: 'Modelling was respectable then so my parents were very happy for me to do it and it was fabulous. 'I still think the Fifties was the best time to be a model because the clothes were so lovely. Of course we were much more innocent. 'There was no television, only the radio and we'd never heard of drugs.' At the time of the interview in 2011 Daphne, from Baldock, Hertfordshire, was still commanding £1,000 per day for her work. Daphne looks cool and relaxed as she models the & Other Stories collection alongside the customised shoes . 'That rate is quite rare but it's very nice when it comes and helps the pension,' she said. The model also comes from a time when it was OK to not be super skinny: 'I'm a big-boned person and back in 1950 I was 10st 7lb, although nobody told me to lose weight. 'I didn't do anything to make myself thin but once I had three children I lost weight and now I'm 8st. 'My waist is 28'' so I can sometimes get into a size eight on a shoot but I wear a 10 for comfort. I think it's ridiculous and very sad that some of the models now have become so skeletal.' Flo and Daphne sit side by side as they model almost matching outfits for the two brands . Daphne wears a day time look with lace up vans (left) changing into a red dress for another picture (right) The model has never had any surgery and shies away from botox. She once said: 'I’ve never had anything done to my face. 'Not that poison [botox], not a facelift. I think it’s a waste of money. Anyway, I couldn’t afford it!’ She previously revealed to the MailOnline that she posed nude back in the day for artists such as Barbara Hepworth. The outfits chosen for the campaign look great no matter what age the model is . She revealed that she keeps her grey hair, which is brushed down around her shoulders in the new campaign, long because it is cheaper. She said: 'My hair is long now because it’s cheaper, I don’t have to do anything, but put it in a topknot or a French pleat. 'It avoids that old lady permed look, lengthens the neck and lifts the face. I’ve got so many friends who don’t touch the make-up pot. You should keep looking nice, it makes you feel so much better.’ In modelling shots taken from the earlier part of her career Daphne shows off her effortless grace . Daphne is known for her timeless beauty and has previously admitted to never having had any surgery . Daphne took part in the Dare To Wear campaign in 2014 for the Trafford Center in Manchester . Over the last few years Daphne has landed a number of campaigns with well known brands. In 2013 she was chosen to work for TK Maxx and last year she fronted the Dare To Wear campaign for the Trafford Center in Manchester. Daphne says that she has good genes and maintains a healthy lifestyle: 'My parents gave me good genes and health, and I have always eaten sensibly. 'I was brought up through the war so the phrase ""make do and mend"" has never done me any harm. I always try to make the best of everything, to stay positive and to have a healthy lifestyle.'

"An Oregon woman who came home and beat her boyfriend's former girlfriend with a crowbar after finding her getting high on heroin in her bathroom will no longer face prosecution. Elena Curtin of Portland was seven-months pregnant when she was charged with second-degree assault after she struck her boyfriend's ex in the head and arm with a crowbar in November 2014. She was set to go to trial in Multnomah County Circuit Court this week, but prosecutors dropped the charge on Monday because Curtin, 23, was 'completely justified in her outrage'. Elena Curtin of Portland, Oregon, was seven-months pregnant when she was charged with second-degree assault after she struck her boyfriend's ex in the head and arm with a crowbar in November 2014 . Curtin gave birth in January. When Curtin came home, she found her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend shooting heroin while sitting on her toilet, Oregonian/OregonLive reported. When she asked her to leave and the woman refused, Curtin beat her with a crowbar. Oregon law allows for use of physical force against an intruder who won't leave a resident's home. Curtin's defense attorney, Casey Kovacic, said the ex-girlfriend was 'jealous and bitter' that the boyfriend was in a relationship with his client. The boyfriend, who is the father of Curtin's child, struggled with heroin in the past. The ex and the boyfriend had gotten high at the apartment before and they have a five-year-old child. They have since reconciled and Curtin is now living with her parents. The boyfriend has not been a part of his new child's life. Kovacic wrote in an email: 'In the two years leading up to this incident, [the ex] made it her personal mission to make Elena's life miserable. 'She routinely harassed and threatened to hurt Elena, stole from her, and cruelly plotted to drag [the boyfriend] back into addiction. 'That's one silver lining -  she's [Curtin] been able to examine how bad (her relationship) was and move on with her life.' If she had gone to trial and been convicted, Curtin would have faced received a mandatory prison sentence of almost six years.

"It was a case of so near, yet so far for the Queen today as she roared on her filly, Ring of Truth, at Newbury today. The monarch, who was resplendent in a fuchsia suit and a matching hat, appeared unusually nervous and was spotted crossing her fingers in the Royal Box. Unfortunately for Her Majesty, her horse  was narrowly pipped to the post - prompting a brief look of horror and a rueful smile from her owner. Oh no! The Queen allows herself a look of horror as Ring of Truth is narrowly pipped to the post . One is not amused: The Queen briefly looks glum before smiling at her second place finish . Better than nothing: The Queen's second place appeared to go down well and she got a third place later on . The Queen, who has long been an avid racing fan, had a second runner later in the afternoon but was once again left to rue missed chances after her horse Capel Path came in third. Newbury Racecourse is currently hosting the Dubai Duty Free Spring Trials, one of the most prestigious dates on the flat racing calendar. The event, which coincides with the racecourse's annual real ale festival, also saw runners owned by fellow royal Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai take to the track. Unfortunately for the Emirati, the horses bred by his Godolphin Stud also failed to triumph with one, Strong Chemistry, taking second place in the Dubai Duty Free Full Of Surprises Handicap. Despite failing to register a win, the 88-year-old monarch was on cheerful form and chatted happily to jockey Richard Hughes in the parade ring ahead of the Maiden Stakes. Top tips: The Queen chatted to Ring of Truth's jockey Richard Hughes ahead of the race . Looking around: The Queen, joined by racing manager John Warren (second right), toured the parade ring . Enjoying the day: Afterwards, she made her way back to the Royal Box in the grandstand . The Queen certainly has plenty to smile about, with her fifth great-grandchild due next weekend and sex claims against her son Prince Andrew struck out by a US judge. She has also been  making the most of the recent spell of hot weather and has been pictured twice in the last seven days enjoying a trot around Windsor Great Park. The Queen, who usually rides wearing a silk scarf rather than a riding hat, first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a Shetland pony, named Peggy, aged four. Since then, the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50's, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961. Lovely: The Queen was resplendent in a cheerful fuchsia coat and a matching hat . Cheerful: The Queen has multiple reasons to be cheerful at the moment, including the impending royal birth . Great-grandchild: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child will be her fifth great-grandchild . Recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback. Nevertheless, the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Along with her thoroughbred race horses, the Queen also breeds Fell ponies and has a stud specialising in Highland ponies at Balmoral.

"Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, on the defensive after a set of acrimonious exchanges with female journalists including, is denying that he has a problem with women. 'I think I have been universally short-tempered and testy with both male and female reporters. I'll own up to that,' the Kentucky senator told CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer yesterday, responding to accusations of sexism that bubbled up following his Wednesday morning dust up with TODAY host Savannah Guthrie. Paul, who announced his bid for the Oval Office on Tuesday, admitted  that he needs to 'have more patience' with reporters, even if he's 'annoyed' with them while maintaining that 'interviews should be questions and not editorializing.' The confession summed up the freshman lawmaker's second day as an official 2016 contestant - a bumpy ride that has so far included a confrontation with the chairwoman of the Democratic Party over late-term abortion and Paul's declaration that she seems to be 'OK with killing a 7-pound baby.' Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul is on the defensive after an acrimonious exchange with TODAY host Savannah Guthrie on Wednesday morning. 'No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!' Listen, you've editorialized,' he blasted at Guthrie . Paul, a libertarian-leaning Kentucky senator, launched his presidential bid on Tuesday in Louisville.  Responding yesterday to accusations of sexism that bubbled up following his  dust up with Guthrie, Paul said, 'I think I have been universally short-tempered and testy with both male and female reporters. I'll own up to that' Paul's woes on Wednesday began with an early morning sparring match on TODAY with Guthrie over perceived flip flops on foreign policy issues. A disgruntled Paul cut her off and said, 'Why don't we let me explain instead of talking over me, OK?' 'Before we go through a litany of things you say I've changed on, why don't you ask me a question: ""Have I changed my opinion?"" That would be sort of a better way to approach an interview.' Guthrie proceeding as requested, asking him if he had shifted his views on any foreign policies, but he still wasn't satisfied, telling her, 'No, no, you've editorialized.' 'No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!' Listen, you've editorialized. Let me answer a question! You ask a question, and you say, ""Have your views changed?"" instead of editorializing and saying my views have changed,' he continued. Paul responded with a similarly peevish attitude to a line of questioning he considered 'slanted' in a February back and forth with CNBC anchor Kelly Evans, whom he shushed and told to 'calm down a bit' before giving her advice on how to do her job. American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal opposition-research group, tore into Paul on Wednesday morning, telling Daily Mail Online, 'Rand Paul can't seem to step in front of a camera without proving that shooting from the hip is a good way to shoot yourself in the foot.' 'He's got miles to go before his ability catches up to his ambition,' the group's spokesman, Ben Ray, said. ''And judging by his temper, he knows it, too.' A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee accused Paul of running away from his record. 'Every time he gets asked about something he’s said, his response is to deny ever having said it,' DNC National Press Secretary Holly Shulman said, adding that it will be difficult for Paul to run as the ' ""trust"" candidate when he keeps blatantly lying to voters about his own record.' 'And Senator… don’t bother shushing us. We have the video to prove it,' she said. By Wednesday afternoon Paul was being labeled as a sexist, leading the conservative to declare  on CNN that he's an 'equal opportunity' offender. 'I was annoyed with a male reporter this morning,' he said. 'I will have to get better at holding my tongue and holding my temper.' The male reporter in question may have been the Associated Press' Philip Elliot, whom Paul had derided earlier that day at a New Hampshire campaign stop for aggressively pressing him to nail down his views on abortion. 'I gave you about a five-minute answer. Put in my five-minute answer,' he reportedly told Elliot, growing tired of the discussion. According to Elliot, Paul had previously contended that, 'The thing is about abortion — and about a lot of things — is that I think people get tied up in all these details of, sort of, you're this or this or that, or you're hard and fast (on) one thing or the other.' 'I think the most important thing is the general concept of: Do you support the sanctity of life? Do you think there's something special about life? So you think when we're born that a human baby is different than an animal, that there's something special that is imbued into human life? And I think there is.' Paul acknowledged that he'd supported bills that granted exceptions in cases of rape and incest and bills that did not. 'In general, I am pro-life. So I will support legislation that advances and shows that life is special and deserves protection,' he explained. The freshman senator also had confrontation with Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Wednesday. 'Why don't we ask the DNC: Is it OK to kill a 7-pound baby in the uterus?' had said. Schultz responded  by attacking his position on personal liberty - and by asking him not to shush her . Paul was joined by his wife Kelley Ashby on stage Tuesday as he declared that he would campaign to 'take our country back' After the DNC blasted the Associated Press' write-up of the conversation, other reporters following Paul around in New Hampshire began asking him about abortion, at which point the freshman senator turned the argument on the campaign arm of the Democratic Party. 'Why don't we ask the DNC: Is it OK to kill a 7-pound baby in the uterus?' he shot back. 'You go back and go ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she's OK with killing a 7-pound baby that's just not born yet,' Paul said, referencing the DNC's chairwoman. 'Ask her when life begins, and ask Debbie when she's willing to protect life. When you get an answer from Debbie, come back to me.' Reporters didn't have to wait very long for a response. Shortly after Paul laid down the gauntlet, the DNC issued a statement on behalf of Wasserman Schultz that said: 'Here’s an answer. I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved. Period. End of story.' 'Now your turn, Senator Paul,' she said. 'We know you want to allow government officials like yourself to make this decision for women — but do you stand by your opposition to any exceptions, even when it comes to rape, incest, or life of the mother? 'Or do we just have different definitions of ""personal liberty""?' Getting in one last dig, Wasserman Shultz ended her statement with the remark, 'And I’d appreciate it if you could respond without ’shushing’ me.' Appearing on CNN, Paul said, 'It sounds like her answer is yes, that she’s OK with killing a 7-pound baby.' 'Debbie’s position, which I guess is the Democratic Party’s position, that an abortion all the way up until the day of birth would be fine, I really think most pro-choice people would be uncomfortable with that,' he asserted. Thursday morning brought better news for Paul, as a Quinnipiac University Poll was released that showed him beating possible Democratic competitor Hillary Clinton in a general election match up in two swing states that President Barack Obama won by several points in 2012. Paul has consistently performed well against Clinton in surveys, but he now leads her in Iowa and Colorado by one and three points, respectively. Hurting Clinton is the perception among voters that she is 'not honest and trustworthy,' Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, explained in a statement accompanying the release of the survey. Reviewing survey data, Brown said, 'it is difficult to see Secretary Clinton's slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail.' That Paul and other probable GOP contenders have gained so much ground on her since it became public knowledge that she exclusively used her private email address during her tenure at the State Department, Brown said is 'ominous.' 'I'm going to keep an open mind and look at the agreement,' Paul said, while allowing that 'I do believe that negotiation is better than war.' He mirrored other Republicans in questioning the 'sincerity of the Iranians' in reaching an agreement with the U.S. and five European nations. 'If they're immediately saying that the agreement doesn't mean what President Obama says, that is a big problem,' Paul said. 'The Iranians put out 500 words, the Americans put out 1,300 words, the Europeans put out 200 words. And they don't all seem to agree, but it's very, very little information so far.' He defended his position on foreign aid, saying that even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed that his country should one day shake off its dependence on America to fund its defense program. 'I still agree with my original precept, which is – lemme answer the question! – I still agree with my original statement from years ago that ultimately all nations should be free of foreign aid,' he said, 'because we shouldn't borrow money to do it.' 'But my opinion's not any different than Netanyahu's opinion.' The Paul campaign did not respond to a request for comment no whether or not Guthrie gave him a fair interview.","'Why don't we let me explain instead of talking over me, OK?' he asked TODAY's Savannah Guthrie as she tried to corner him Wednesday morning .

"Graham Leonard, pictured leaving court after admitting endangering an aircraft . A passenger who hijacked a plane's tannoy system while drunk to sing karaoke and then caused an airport to be evacuated could be handed a jail term. Graham Leonard, who was returning to Scotland after attending a Manchester United football match, grabbed the PA microphone on the private charter flight and burst into song for his fellow football fans after drinking beer and gin on match day. And after frustrating the cabin crew with his antics during the flight - including throwing a hot towel at one - he then caused part of an airport to be evacuated after deliberately setting off the fire alarm on arrival in Aberdeen. Sheriff Edward Savage said he was keeping 'all options open' and Mr Kelly to find out what impact a jail sentence would have on his client. 'I'm not entirely satisfied given the very serious nature of these matters that a financial penalty will reflect how serious these matters are,' said Mr Savage. 'I want to make it absolutely clear that I'm keeping all options open.' Leonard, 46, appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday where he admitted endangering the aircraft and its passengers as well as setting off the airport alarm knowing there was no blaze. The court heard that Leonard, from Newmacher, in Aberdeenshire, had been part of a group of Scots fans that had chartered an Eastern Airways flight to jet down to watch United's 3-0 league win over Tottenham on March 15 this year. They had been drinking beer and gin and tonics before leaving Aberdeen Airport, then spent the day meeting former players at a corporate event in a hotel in Manchester. Fiscal depute Karen Dow said that Leonard was one of three passengers that missed their ride back to the airport after the drunken day out. When he did eventually board the 9:17pm private flight from Manchester he started causing trouble for the cabin crew. Leonard was flying on a priavet charter Eastern Airways flight into Aberdeen Airport (file photo) Ms Dow said: 'During the journey the accused approached the complainer to ask if he could sing a song on the public address system. 'She said no and that was not permitted. The accused went to the PA mic and started singing. 'The complainer approached him and told him to stop and asked him to return to his seat. 'His behaviour persisted. This was frustrating for the complainer as it was part of the communication system used by the captain.' The court heard that the businessman, who owns a painting and decorating firm in Aberdeen, also repeatedly refused to sit down before throwing a hot hand towel at one of the stewardesses. Graham Leonard was returning to Scotland after watching Manchester United at Old Trafford, pictured . On arrival at Aberdeen International Airport he was seen 'talking' into the airport's PA system then activating a fire alarm. Around 40 people had to be evacuated from the area and two units from Scottish Fire and Rescue Service were called out to the false alarm. Defence agent Gregor Kelly said his client was 'mortified' about his conduct but asked the sheriff to consider a financial penalty. He said: 'In the sober light of day he is extremely apologetic. The full extent of what he had done did not become clear until the next day when he spoke to others. After landing at Aberdeen Airport, Leonard set the fire alarm off causing an evacuation . 'He is ordinarily a responsible business man. 'He is a regular on this charter plane which goes down to follow the fortunes of Manchester United. 'They had drank a mixture of beer and gin and tonic before embarking on the flight down. There was a special corporate event at hotel in Manchester with ex-players. 'He got carried away. There is no excuse for his behaviour.' Sentence was deferred for reports. Leonard was ordained to appear next month. Speaking after the case called, he said: 'I'm deeply sorry about what happened. 'It was just a drunken day out that went wrong. I'm sorry for any trouble I've caused. I'm deeply embarrassed about it.'

"One Minnesota reporter made news herself on Wednesday when her boyfriend popped the question to her while she was live on-air. Following a segment on wedding costs that touched on the price of engagement rings, WCCO This Morning reporter Ashley Roberts' boyfriend, Justin McCray, surprised her with an engagement ring of her own. And it was a good news day for everyone involved — Ashley said yes. Scroll down for video. She said yes! Reporter Ashley Roberts was surprised on air during Minnesota's This Morning show by a proposal from her boyfriend Justin McCray (pictured together) Romantic plan: Ashley's co-workers helped arrange for her boyfriend to come out after an on-air discussion about engagement rings . To her surprise, it seems Ashley's This Morning co-workers were in on the plan all along; while wrapping up the wedding segment, anchor Jason DeRush noted that men spend an average of $5,855 on the engagement ring. 'Guys are under a lot of pressure to treat the woman to a nice big rock,' Ashley, who is originally from Florida, responded. The anchors then introduced a 'fashion expert' to talk more about rings — but the expert turned out to be none other than Ashley's boyfriend Justin. Surprise appearance: Ashley was nearly speechless upon seeing her boyfriend, repeating 'oh my god, oh my god' while Justin knelt down in front of her . 'I want to spend the rest of my life with you,' Justin told her, before getting down on one knee and presenting her with a ring. 'Now Jason,' he added, turning to the show's anchor, 'you were talking about [the cost of] rings, and I promise you — a brother pretty broke.' Luckily, Ashley seemed far from disappointed with her rock; the reporter repeated 'Oh my god, oh my god' before flashing her new ring for her co-workers, exclaiming: 'I'm engaged!' Happy ending: She can be seen in the video excitedly telling her co-workers 'I'm engaged!' Before the camera cut away, Ashley realized the whole wedding piece was for her benefit, asking: 'So wait, is this why we're doing the wedding segment?' Not that she minded doing the work. 'Best surprise of my life,' she wrote on Twitter later that day. 'I get to spend the rest of my life with my best friend.

The tiny home (circled), sandwiched between two other properties, which has sold for £750,000, is located on a leafy street in Islington, north London . Inside, the narrow house is only 5ft wide in some areas, a little over the size of a rugby player's shoulders and its maximum width is 8ft 8in . The home has what boat owners would call a narrow 'galley kitchen', an expert has said, with the estate agency calling it 'well proportioned' The property is a two-bedroom apartment, with a narrow but long and extended back section . It also features tiny study, reception room, shower room, cloakroom, kitchen and a garden and is said to be garnering a lot of interest . It has two-bedrooms, a tiny study, reception room, shower room, cloakroom, kitchen and a garden. At its widest, it stretches across 8ft 8in. The property was put on the market with Foxtons for £750,000 - almost double the price it sold for in 2001. Neither its dimensions nor its size put off buyers - with the estate agency yesterday confirming the home was now under offer. The advert called it a 'stylish two bedroom period house' which 'offers beautifully bright living space throughout with characterful touches and a pretty rear garden'. Foxtons declined to comment. At a price of £750,000, the buyer will have to pay £27,000 in stamp duty - the same as a second-hand narrow boat which is 50ft long. Henry Pryor, a buying agent, said: 'This home must be one of the few in which you genuinely could not swing a cat. 'Strangely the first floor master bedroom is wider than the ground floor room below and it has what boat owners would know as a ""galley kitchen"". 'A lot of buyers would struggle with the idea of living in a home little bigger than a cricket net.' Late last year a 34-bedroom North Devon mansion which is 40 times the size of the Islington home sold for just £600,000. The property's backyard is a narrow strip of land stuck between the house and a neighbour's fence . The backyard deck runs along the roof of a room in the tiny house giving the occupants a place to sit outside on sunny days . At a price of £750,000, the buyer will have to pay £27,000 in stamp duty.

"A New York teen who lost everything in Hurricane Sandy has been accepted to seven Ivy League schools. Daria Rose, 18, immersed herself in her studies after she and her family lost everything -- including their home -- when the superstorm hit in October 2012. And after a difficult high school experience, the 18-year-old has a bright future ahead of her. The Hempstead teen has been accepted into all seven of the Ivy League schools she applied to, ABC news reports. Scroll down for video . Acceptance: New York teen Daria Rose (photographed) lost everything in Hurricane Sandy and was recently accepted to seven Ivy League schools . Dreams: The frequent moves Rose and her family underwent after the superstorm made finishing school work difficult for Rose, but she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school . 'I was like, oh my God, I just got into Harvard,' Rose told ABC 7. 'Then I checked Princeton, and I was like, oh my God I, just got into Princeton. And I checked Brown, I got in. It just kept going and going.' Rose did not apply to Columbia, according to ABC. Rose and her family lived in several hotels as well as her grandmother's house after being forced to evacuate their home in Baldwin, which was destroyed, ABC News reports. After more than a year, the family moved into a new home in Baldwin. Although the frequent moves made finishing school work difficult, Rose said, she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school. 'I was living in these small spaces but in my head I was able to escape,' Rose said 'find myself in a literary world.' Rose wrote about her Hurricane Sandy experience in a college application essay in which she talked about the storm and how reading helped her cope. Secure: A college essay about her experience helped Rose to secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown . Blessing: Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks (left), said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because the teen had something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices . The essay helped the Sacred Heart Academy student secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown. 'After moving so much and meeting so many different people, I learned I can adapt and adjust to all these different situations and people,' Rose told ABC 7. Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks, said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because it provided the teen with something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices. 'It's easy to say 'I'm just going to lay here in a ball and cry and wallow in my own self pity,'' Brooks said. 'I'd make sure she'd get up and put one foot in front of the other.' Destroyed: Rose and her family lived in several hotels as well as her grandmother's house after being forced to evacuate their home in Baldwin (photographed), which was destroyed . New Home: After more than a year, the family moved into a new home in Baldwin (photographed is wreckage of Rose's home following the storm) While Rose said she had always leaned toward Yale, in her junior year of high school, she began looking at other options and decided to apply to the seven schools. Rose applied to seven of the eight Ivy League schools and, on March 31, the schools posted their decisions online, according to ABC. 'They're all such great schools,' Rose said. '[I'll] try to see where I'll fit in the best.' Rose said she plans to study political science and Russian literature. She has until May 1 to decided where she will attend.","New York teen Daria Rose lost everything in Hurricane Sandy and was recently accepted to seven Ivy League schools .

"A tiny garden gnome that appeared on the cover of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's album and was signed by all four band member has sold for £29,000. The cardboard gnome featured alongside a host of celebrities and historic figures including actress Diana Dors, singer Bob Dylan and actor Marlon Brando on the psychedelic cover of the ground-breaking 1967 album. In total more than 60 celebrities appear on the famous cover including the Fab Four themselves - but because it would have been impossible to get all of them in a room together, waxworks and cardboard cutouts were used instead. The cardboard gnome featured alongside a host of celebrities and historic figures including actress Diana Dors, singer Bob Dylan and actor Marlon Brando on the psychedelic cover of the ground-breaking 1967 album . The knee-high little gnome, circled, appeared next to George Harrison's left leg on the famous album cover . Other well-known figures include writer Edgar Allen Poe, dancer Fred Astaire, comedians Laurel and Hardy and boxer Sonny Liston, poet Dylan Thomas and philosopher Karl Marx. The album cover was the brainchild of artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth and photographer Michael Cooper, who constructed and shot it it on March 30, 1967. John Lennon had wanted models of Jesus and Adolf Hitler to be included but his requests were denied. The album cover ended up being so extravagant that the final cost of producing the artwork was £3,000 - a whopping £50,000 in today's money. Following the shoot Mr Cooper's photography assistant was given the 20-inch tall cardboard gnome as a souvenir by The Beatles, who each signed it. The front and back of the gnome were then mounted alongside an unopened copy of the Sgt Pepper's vinyl LP. The cardboard gnome actually came in two parts and was pinned together for the cover. Gifted to a photography assistant it was signed by all for members of the band following the shoot . It emerged for sale almost 50 years after the album was released after it was listed for auction by a private collector. Experts at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, had given the gnome a pre-sale estimate of $25,000 - around £17,000 - but it ended up going to an unnamed buyer for $42,500 - or £29,000. Dean Harmeyer, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'This is a true rarity and a cornerstone piece of any Beatles collection. The album cover ended up being so extravagant that it cost £3,000, equivalent to £50,000 in today's money . Peter Blake (pictured) and Jann Haworth designed the iconic cover using an ink drawing by Paul McCartney as inspiration . Paul McCartney had the initial idea for the iconic cover and outlined the cover in an ink drawing. The actual designing of the cover was done by artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth. The cover’s collage of famous faces includes 57 cardboard cut-out photographs (including two gnomes) and nine waxworks. They show a range of personalities from different walks of life including actors, sportsmen and scientists. The album also reflects the personal and artistic changes within the band at the time Sgt Pepper's was made. The influence of George Harrison’s exploration of Indian music and philosophy through the inclusion of self-realisation gurus. The fab four themselves appear in day-glow, mock military uniforms. Paul McCartney envisioned the Sgt Peppers band as alter egos the Beatles could use to distance themselves from their previous incarnations. John Lennon requested the inclusion of Hitler and Jesus in the artwork but he was turned down. Elvis did not appear on the album cover because it was felt he was too big an icon to be included. 'Designer Peter Blake worked with the Beatles to stage the cover of Sgt. Pepper's, which was filled with life-size cardboard likenesses of famous figures - Mae West, Bob Dylan, Marlon Brando - behind the Beatles. 'Among the smaller items in the foreground was this garden gnome, which appears just to the right of George's leg. 'At the end of the cover session on March 30, 1967, the gnome was chosen as a memento by an assistant to cover photographer Michael Cooper, and it was signed by the Beatles immediately following the shoot.

"The WI has been told it must pay the Royal Albert Hall thousands of pounds if it wants to serve the cakes to 5,000 women attending centenary celebrations at the venue in June . It’s been a gargantuan undertaking, even by the formidable standards of the Women’s Institute. For days on end, two of its members slaved away baking enough cakes to feed 5,000 women attending the WI’s centenary celebrations at the Royal Albert Hall in June. But the WI has now been told it must pay the venue thousands of pounds to serve the cakes. ‘It’s outrageous,’ said one WI stalwart, who did not wish to be named. ‘We can’t waste money on this. I don’t understand why they just won’t let us give it away.’ Claire Hope, 35, a member of her local WI group in Dorking, Surrey, added: ‘It seems rather petty. 'The WI is a charity and I would have thought the Albert Hall could have come to an amicable arrangement.’ The idea was that the 5,000 members attending the National Federation of the Women’s Institute’s AGM, which this year celebrates the anniversary, would find a box of centenary cake on their seats. But organisers were astonished to be told that the gesture would incur a ‘sampling charge’ of £2,500 because the centenary cake has fallen foul of the Hall’s sponsorship rules. Even though the fruitcake has been home-made by two WI star bakers, some of the ingredients were donated by companies including Dairy Crest, Diageo and Whitworths, and their contribution is acknowledged on the cake boxes. Under the Hall’s booking conditions, extra fees are liable if products of commercial sponsors are promoted inside the building. To avoid the unexpected cost, members will now be given a piece of the cake to eat on the way home, instead of at the venue. A WI spokeswoman said: ‘Once we considered the logistics, we decided it would be easier all round to give every federation their “pieces” to distribute after the meeting.’ The Royal Albert Hall declined to confirm the amount of the extra cake charge - but under the Hall’s booking conditions, extra fees are liable if products of commercial sponsors are promoted inside the building . Baking the 44 WI fruitcakes used more than five stone of butter, several hundred eggs and enough rum to paralyse a fleet of pirate ships. Here’s what it took in total: . The Royal Albert Hall declined to confirm the amount of the extra cake charge. But a spokeswoman said: ‘The Hall charges a fee for sponsors’ commercial products to be promoted within the building. The Women’s Institute informed us that their requirements had changed and the product will no longer be consumed on the premises. Therefore no fee will apply.’ The cakes’ creation has been a military exercise for retired home economics teachers, Anne Harrison, 72, a dairy farmer’s wife from Wensleydale, North Yorkshire, and Pat Tulip, 75, from Bilton, Northumberland. They spent 11 full days last month baking 44 12 x 12in cakes 3.5in deep between them. Divided up, this provides enough cake for the 5,000 members. Miss Tulip said: ‘We’ve been very careful with costing. We used cheap flour and bought eggs in bulk. If we hadn’t had some donations, it would have cost about £1,100.’ The pair followed a recipe chosen following a competition for the WI’s 200,000-plus members won by Julie Clarke, 66, from Coverdale, North Yorkshire, who is chairman of the WI’s North Yorks West Federation.","Women's Institute centenary celebrations will be held at the venue in June .

"Councils are pocketing thousands in change by forcing drivers to overpay for parking because their meters  do not accept five or 10 pence coins brought in three years ago. Town halls   have failed to recalibrate some of the 100,000 ticket machines in the UK - making it impossible for drivers to pay the exact cost of parking. In Manchester, where 240 machines are still not upgraded, motorists without old-style coins must use £1 and two 20p pieces for a typical £1.25 hour's parking - handing the council a 15p profit. Big profit: Town hall bosses in Manchester have been accused of pocketing thousands of pounds extra from 240 parking ticket machines in the city because they still do not accept new 5p and 10p pieces . The council also charges £1.85 for an hour and a half and £3.10 for two hours and 30 minutes, meaning that drivers without the right coins must overpay for them too. Nationwide there are 100,000 parking meters yet several councils are still yet to upgrade them to accept the three-year-old 5p and 10p coins. Many local authorities don't use machines that offer change because they could become targets for theft. Experts fear the problem could become even worse when the new 12-sided pound coin is released in 2017. This is because their hourly charges often end in 5p and 10p yet the machines do not accept new five or 10p coins, making it impossible for drivers to pay the exact fee. Manchester drivers have demanded refunds and want to know why the council is yet to upgrade its machines. Darren Edwards, 42, was forced to overpay for his parking as the machine could not take the correct change. He said: 'I know it is not much but if you think how often those parking spots are used, and if everyone is over paying that soon adds up.' Coin chaos: The 5p and 10p pieces introduced three years ago are slightly thicker than the old ones, which means that a considerable number of machines still reject them . The parking machine he used currently charges of £1.25 for an hour's parking, £1.85 for an hour and a half and £3.10 for two hours and 30 minutes. But a sticker says it will not accept the new silver coins. The new thicker nickel-plated steel coins were introduced in 2012 by the Royal Mint and since then, 330million are in circulation while older copper-nickel coins have been steadily recalled. Industry chiefs insist the bill for converting parking meters, vending machines and phone boxes to accept the new £1 coin could be more than £200million. The 12-sided coin, which resembles a classic threepenny bit, was announced as a way to fight a surge in the number of £1 in circulation - a racket that costs the economy some £45million a year. But roughly 1.2million machines on the market will have to be re-calibrated to fit the new piece, which is set to be introduced in 2017, according to one industry expert. Payphones, parking metres, betting shop fruit machines, launderette washing machines and supermarket trolleys are among the devices that will need to be upgraded. Last year the Royal Mint suggested that the cost of converting these machines would be around £20million. But company chiefs have today disputed the amount - calculating that it could me more than five times as much. Jonathan Hilder, CEO of the Automatic Vending Association, estimated that forgeries make up some 3.03 per cent of the more than 1.5billion £1 coins in circulation. He said that increasingly sophisticated technology meant that coins were easier to fake - and that 50 per cent of these counterfeit coins successfully passed through vending machines. The new coin  will be made from two types of metal, like the current £2 coin. A Freedom of Information request to Manchester council revealed the town hall made £14.8m from car parking in 2013/14. Coun Luthfur Rahman, the council's assistant executive member for environment, said: 'We are in the process of re-calibrating all the pay and display machines to accept the new 5p and 10p coins. 'This will be completed by the end of the month. 'There is also an alternative payment method - Pay by Phone - which doesn't require correct change as the tariff is charged directly to the customer's credit or debit card via their mobile phone. 'This cashless method also allows customers to purchase further parking time, up to the maximum permitted, with no need to return to the pay and display machine, as well as providing text reminders when their parking time is about to expire.' In recent years drivers have complained about similar problems in towns and cities all over the UK. Councils in Sheffield, Brighton, Telford, Hull and in Edinburgh are among many who admitted to problems. The vending industry said updating machines could local authorities as much as £100million to modify parking meters and called the coin charges 'a disaster'. Because of the cost of changing machines, or having machines able to give change, councils are encouraging people to pay in other ways. A spokesman for the British Parking Association said: 'Mobile phone technology is beginning to revolutionise the way parking is paid for and offers more flexibility than static coin machines. 'Parking providers are already offering other cashless payment methods including credit cards and pre-booking. Some smart phone apps allow motorists to scan QR codes on signage instead of feeding a machine, all of which cut time, offer variety and ease of payment'.","In Manchester 240 machines still don't accept coinage introduced in 2012 .

"It is the smallest computer in the world - and 150 of them can fit in a thimble. Called the Michigan Micro Mote, to tiny technology is a complete computer system. Its inventors say it can act as a smart sensor, and give everyday objects computing capabilities. The Michigan Micro Mote is the smallest computer in the world, measuring less than 2mm across. The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. By strobing light at a high frequency, the operator is able to send information to the computer. Once the Micro Mote processes the data, it is able to send the information to a central computer via conventional radio frequencies. The Michigan Micro Mote is the first complete, operational computer system measuring as small as two millimeters across. 'To be 'complete,' a computer system must have an input of data, the ability to process that data - meaning process and store it, make decisions about what to do next – and ultimately, the ability to output the data.' Professor David Blaauw explained. 'The sensors are the input and the radios are the output. The other key to being a complete computer is the ability to supply its own power.' The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. They are the culmination of work initiated by Blaauw and Sylvester on very low-power processing for millimeter-scale systems. A key breakthrough in the size/power matchup came with the Phoenix processor in 2008. The Phoenix processor is miniscule at 915 x 915µm2, and boasts ultra-low operating voltage and a unique standby mode that results in an average power consumption of only 500pW. (Consider that 1pW is the average power consumption of a single human cell.) Blaauw explained why Phoenix's extreme energy efficiency is so important: 'As you shrink down in size, the percentage of the system tends to be dominated by the battery. 'It's actually not hard to make chips small, but it is hard to make them low power. 'We could have very small chips, but we'd still end up with really large batteries.' This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information, its inventors say. The solar system allows the computer to work  under indoor lights without ever having to be charged. 'With a 1mm2 solar cell producing 20nW, the device can harvest enough energy under ambient light to run perpetually,' the team say. The device's standby power consumption is 2nA. That's about a million times less power than the average mobile phone consumes while on standby, or the comparative difference between the thickness of a sheet of paper and the length of a football field. There are currently three different systems in the M3 family, focusing on several different applications: sensing temperature, pressure, and taking images. 'Down the road we want these sensors to be able to talk to one another,' says Blaauw, 'and we're currently working to extend their range to about 20m.' The working computer is smaller than a grain of rice programmed and charged via light and could be used for a variety of medical and industrial purposes. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information. Numerous specks of technology could be discretely placed to invisibly monitor a home, business, or personal device. 'We found that a lot of people were very interested in these devices, and that's why we went with the modular or stacked approach.' Blaauw explained. 'It's the key aspect of our design. If you need a different sensing modality you take out one sensor and replace it with another - like mix and match tinker toys.'","Michigan Micro Mote is a complete computer system less that 5mm across .

"A former mob enforcer in Rhode Island with ties to late New England crime boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca has died in a federal prison in North Carolina. Gerard T. 'The Frenchman' Ouimette was 75. The Federal Bureau of Prison's website reported that Ouimette, who had lived in Fall River, Massachusetts, died Sunday. Ouimette, suspected of having a role in up to eight murders, 'ran' the federal prison in North Carolina in the 1970s and even had booze, drugs and lobster dinner smuggled in on a weekly basis, according to a Rhode Island State Police report. His nephew, Kevin Ouimette Lynch, tells the Providence Journal that his uncle was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and died in his sleep at a prison in Butner, North Carolina. Ouimette was reportedly in control of a gangster network responsible for gambling, loansharking, extortion, and murder, among other crimes . Ouimette passed away in this medium security facility after being diagnosed with lung cancer . In 1996, Ouimette was convicted of extortion and became the first criminal in New England sentenced to life in prison under the federal 'three strikes and you're out' provision for violent offenders. Ouimette had more than 10 convictions during his criminal career, including one for punching an FBI agent. The Providence Journal reports that Ouimette spent a total of 46 years behind bars. A 1979 FBI document regarding his background paints the picture of man in control of a massive underworld network. 'Subject OUIMETTE controls a large group of criminals known as the OUIMETTE faction, whose criminal activities include gambling, loansharking, extortion and property violations such as major hijackings, robberies and burglaries,' the report states. Ouimette had close ties to crime boss Raymond Patriarca, seen here leaving a federal building in Boston on June 27, 1967. 'Although not Italian, OUIMETTE enjoys the same stature as lieutenants under RAYMOND L.S. PATRIARCA, who controls organized crime (OC) in the Boston and New England area.' The document went on to call Ouimette responsible for 'seven of eight gangland-style murders.' He was never convicted of any homicides, however. Ouimette was known to his associates as 'The Frenchman.' In his 2012 memoir, 'What Price Providence,' the enforcer blamed the police for the nickname. ''The Frenchman' is the name that Rhode Island police attached to me in 1969 since I am proud of my French descent, an anomaly in that neighborhood,' he wrote. 'Due to ensuing notoriety, the name stuck.' In the introduction to that back, he wrote that he knew he would die in prison. 'There is a saying that is appropriate to prison life: 'If you sit by the river long enough, you will eventually see all your enemies float by,'' he wrote. 'Bottom line is, if you can survive, you're ahead of the game, not by much, but by some. The reason is, there is no room for error when you are playing the La Costra Nostra's major leagues; one mistake can end your life, and often does.' The gangland enforcer's influence was not diminished behind bars, and state police said he even became the boss of the ACI's maxium security prison in the 1970s. At least once a week in the latter years of that decade, gang associate Charles 'The Ghost' Kennedy would visit the facility with as much as $600 worth of alcohol, marijuana, ham, cold cuts, cheese, and Italian bread for security guards to deliver to the incarcerated Ouimette and his gang. They even had catered lobster dinners, police said. Ouimette, then 55, is seen here being escorted out of Federal Court in Providence, Rhode Island, after being sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1996 . Besides booze, Ouimette even once had his son, then only five-years-old, smuggled into the prison for a sleepover, the Journal reported. Eventually he and Kennedy had a falling out, and Kennedy claimed a hit squad was assembled to kill him. A fearful man, during his 1996 exortion trial several strippers who were called to testify about threats Ouimette had made in their club broke down in tears before him in court. Ouimette's body will be sent back to Rhode Island where Ouimette will be buried.","Gerard T. Ouimette, 75, known as 'The Frenchman,' died in medium security federal pen in his sleep .

"Supernan: Eileen Mason, 92, saved her friend from a would-be robber by ramming him with her scooter . A 92-year-old great-grandmother has told of how she saved her 75-year-old friend from a mugger - by ramming him with her mobility scooter. Eileen Mason and Margaret Seabrook had been to a lunch club meeting in Swindon, Wiltshire, when an 'evil looking' man suddenly appeared from behind a fence. According to the two pensioners, the man initially attempted to get his hands on the contents of Mrs Seabrook's scooter basket, before grabbing Mrs Mason by the arm and reaching for her carrier bag. However, the would-be robber was soon to regret his action, as Mrs Mason shouted 'Oh, no you don't,' and slammed on the accelerator of her scooter. The attacker was knocked to the ground, and the motorised pair sped off into the distance. Speaking after the robbery attempt, the great-grandmothers said they refused to let the 'weasel' bring them down. Mrs Mason said she had seen the young man's intention to take the contents of Mrs Seabrook's basket, before turning on her in an attempt to steal a brand new pair of trousers from her bag. The sprightly 92-year-old says the next few moments were 'a bit of a blur' and that all she remembers is accelerating her scooter and knocking the man to the ground. Mrs Mason, who has four children, ten grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren, said: 'I saw him look into my basket and I said; 'Oh no you don't!', really loudly. 'I put my scooter into accelerate and turned really fast. The next thing I know he was on the floor. I thought 'my gosh'. 'I had slowed up because it looked like something was going to happen. He just looked evil, with dark, piercing eyes. 'He came from over my shoulder, caught my arm and pulled me back. 'When he came round the second time, I slammed down on the speed so the scooter went up on to the grass, and when the back end came round it knocked him down. 'He lay there for a moment and then made a quick exit. I have never seen him round here before, and I felt a bit panicky because we did not like the look of him. Heroic ladies: Mrs Mason and her friend Margaret Seabrook, 75, had been to a lunch club meeting in Swindon, Wiltshire, when an 'evil looking' man tried to rob them of the contents of their mobility scooter baskets . 'You just don't think this would happen to you on your way home from lunch club. 'We always go together, and It's a good thing we did, otherwise it would have been much easier for him. 'I might be old but I'm still quick. I think the way I shouted probably frightened him. 'The next day I was very shaken. We were lucky, because he could have hit us - if he had been able to catch us.' Mrs Seabrook, a mother-of-three, who has eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, added: 'We came around the corner and he was just stood there by the fence. 'He didn't look right. He had a white baseball cap on his head back to front, which isn't the right way to wear it, and black eyes. 'I heard Eileen shout so I swung around and all I saw was him on the floor. I didn't see his face after that because he ran away so fast. 'If he had got my bag he would have got everything, because all my bank cards were in my purse. We were both very shaken up by it, but we can laugh about it now. Shocking scenes: Mrs Mason shouted 'oh no, you don't' and ran over the unidentified attacker, after which he made a swift exit, leaving the two great-grandmothers to speed off on their scooters . Heroine: Mrs Mason said the pair were 'lucky' to get away from the robbery, which took place on this path in Swindon, Wecause, she says, 'he could have hit us - if he had been able to catch us' 'We've been friends for ten years and we are always on our scooters together, nothing like this has happened before. 'I don't think it'll happen again now either, I certainly hope not. They were obviously targeting us because they thought we'd be an easy target - he was wrong. 'After, I took Eileen back to my flat, called the police, and made a cup of tea to calm.' Eileen added: 'Everyone on Facebook has been going crazy - I can't believe it. Everyone has been so supportive of us. We just can't believe it all really.' 'We go to the lunch club every week on our scooters and nothing like this has ever happened before. 'We went through the war and all the bombings. We won't let a weasel like that hold us back. 'I would stand up for myself again if I needed to, but hopefully I won't need to. We will carry on as normal though, he hasn't put us off.' Wiltshire Police are appealing for any witnesses to the incident, which took place at 1.15pm, to contact them on 101.","Eileen Mason, 92, knocked would-be thief to the ground with her scooter .

"Giant glaciers of ice may be lurking all over Mars, hidden from view by dust on the surface. That’s the surprising conclusion of a study that found that large amounts of ice were not just at the Martian poles, but likely towards the equator as well. It means that, if all ice were to be spread across the surface of Mars, the entire planet would be covered in more than 3.3ft (one metre). This image from Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows that a thick layer of dust on Mars covers the glaciers, so they appear as the surface of the ground, but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust . The latest research was carried out by scientists at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past. In June 2013, Curiosity found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. Images from several Martian satellites had revealed the shape of glaciers just below the surface, and confirmed most were made of water-ice. And now the researchers have measured how big the glaciers are, and their similarity to glaciers on Earth. In total there is more than 150 billion cubic metres of ice on Mars, which could ‘cover the entire surface of Mars with 1.1 metres of ice,’ explained Dr Nanna Bjørnholt Karlsson at the Centre for Ice and Climate at the Niels Bohr Institute. She added that the ice closer to the Martian equator was ‘an important part of Mars’ water reservoir.’ There are thought to be thousands of glacier-like formations on the planet in both the northern and southern hemispheres. They are located on Mars between latitude 30.0 and 50.0 - equivalent to just south of Denmark’s location on Earth. Mars has belts of glaciers at its central latitudes - between the blue lines, in both the southern and northern hemispheres. A thick layer of dust covers the glaciers, so they appear as the surface of the ground, but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust . Using radar measurements (shown) from Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, researchers have been able to identify thousands of glacier-like formations on Mars. They can see how thick the ice is on the radar images . As the ice has not evaporated into space, the dust must be protecting it. If the ice were unprotected, it would evaporate and become water vapour, owing to the low atmospheric pressure on Mars. ‘We have looked at radar measurements spanning ten years back in time to see how thick the ice is and how it behaves,’ Dr Nanna Bjørnholt Karlsson explained. ‘A glacier is after all a big chunk of ice and it flows and gets a form that tells us something about how soft it is. ‘We then compared this with how glaciers on Earth behave and from that we have been able to make models for the ice flow.’ The latest research was carried out by scientists at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. They looked at how big the glaciers were, and also how similar they were to glaciers on Earth (one in Alaska shown) Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, artist's illustration shown, launched on 12 August 2005. It entered Martian orbit on 10 March 2006, and continues to remain operational today. It is tasked with imaging the surface, and also monitors weather and surface conditions on Mars .","Danish scientists studied ice hidden under the surface of Mars .

"Dusan Bako, who flew into a rage and punched his pregnant girlfriend repeatedly in the stomach, causing her to lose their unborn baby . A teenage rapper has been jailed after punching his heavily pregnant 16-year-old girlfriend in the stomach causing her to lose their unborn baby. Dusan Bako, 18, flew into a rage after he tried to call the teenager's phone only to discover it was switched off. During a confrontation near a park in Oldham, Greater Manchester, Bako put his arm around the back of the girl's neck and with the other clenched his fist and repeatedly punched the victim in the stomach. One horrified witness who saw the attack said Bako hit the girl 'like a boxer' before she was taken to hospital where she later miscarried their child. Bako, from Oldham, was initially charged with child destruction but ahead of his trial, pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after a plea bargaining deal. Prosecutors at Manchester Crown Court said Bako had a 'flashpoint of rage' and punched her in the stomach knowing she was pregnant. The court heard the girl who cannot be named told how being with Bako was ‘like being tortured' and in the run up to the attack in August last year she was living in fear of him and his demands that he wanted the baby 'for his family.' Mark Kellet prosecuting said: 'They had met on Facebook and started dating. She describes that they were very much in love, and the pregnancy was planned because they were so in love. 'She moved in with Dusan and his parents and there was, she says, significant animosity between their respective parents. While living with Dusan, she missed her parents and this caused friction within the relationship and she deiced to return home. 'In the arguments that followed she describes the defendant as physically and verbally abusive and she turned-off her phone because she says the defendant had made threats towards her. He sent a text message to her father asking him to tell her to turn-on her telephone, which she did. 'He then asked her to come outside and speak to him. She says that she was reluctant because he had previously made threats about punching her in the stomach. When she told him that she did not wish to go outside to speak to him, he became threatening, saying that he would come into the house and cause trouble. 'When she left the house, her mother could see the defendant dragging her by her sweatshirt, so she and her husband followed. Her mother shouted: “Why are you dragging her like this, she’s pregnant.” Bako put his arm around the back of the girl's neck and with the other clenched his fist and repeatedly punched the victim in the stomach . 'Once they had entered a park, the defendant grabbed the girl around the neck and punched her in the stomach, a forceful and deliberate blow targeting her stomach area. She immediately doubled up in pain.' Eye witness Carol Hulme, who was walking her dog said in a statement: 'As the male ran in and grabbed the young female, he stopped suddenly and put his arm around the back of her neck. 'With the other arm he clenched his fist, swung his arm back and punched the female in the stomach. As soon as he punched her, he swung his arm back again and repeated the punch in the same area whilst still grabbing her around the neck. 'He hit her like a boxer would hit his opponent. It seemed more of a targeted strike. She couldn't move, the way he had hold of her. I’ve never seen anyone hit someone like that so low down. 'It would have been between her stomach and her private area. The best was to describe the direction of the punch is like an uppercut, the fist down striking upwards. I am still thinking how strange it is that she was hit that low. ' Bako fled the scene as the girl let out an 'ungodly scream.’ She was taken to hospital where the baby’s heartbeat began to slow. The girl was given a scan and watched the monitor screen as the baby died. She describes being in great pain. Mr Kellet added: 'This was caused as a result of the injury to the girl caused by the punch. In essence, the punch to the stomach caused a placental haemorrhage and abruption. Bako was jailed for fours years, eight months at Manchester Crown Court, pictured, after admitting causing grievous bodily harm with intent . 'The foetus became starved of oxygen and died.' Bako later surrendered to police and told officers the punch was accidental. He said: 'I took her to the park, her mum was shouting at me and then came up behind me and tried to slap me. 'I tried to hit her to defend myself, but I caught her in the stomach by mistake. I never intended to hit her or hurt the baby.” In mitigation, defence counsel Peter Warne said: 'We are not dealing with a mature 18 year old. This was a complete instant loss of self-control and an ‘emotional reaction to a situation that confronted him. He wishes to write a letter of apology. 'He is remorseful. He wants to do what he can to make amends even if only writing a letter to explain how sorry he is. Iit is not easy for someone of his age and immaturity to face up to what he has done and be brave enough to enter the plea he did for a very serious offence.' Jailing him for four years, eight months, today Judge Robert Atherton told Bako: 'You delivered a serious blow to the lower stomach of your girlfriend who was pregnant with your child and as a result of that blow described as a boxer delivering an upper cut, the placenta of the child was ruptured which lead to starvation of oxygen, terminating the pregnancy. 'I cannot begin to understand or appreciate her feelings at this loss or either your feelings at this loss.'","Dusan Bako, 18, flew into a rage with his 16-year-old pregnant girlfriend .

"Although Hillary Clinton boasts a robust 3.6 million Twitter followers, not even a vast right-wing conspiracy would be able to interact with 2 million of them. According to two popular online measuring tools, no more than 44 per cent of her Twitter fan base consists of real people who are active in using the social media platform. And at least 15 per cent – more than 544,000 – are completely fake. StatusPeople.com, the oldest publicly available Twitter-auditing tool, reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state's followers are 'good'; 15 per cent are 'fake'; and 41 per cent are 'inactive,' meaning that they never tweet or reply to any tweets. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . FAKERS: According to one popular online audit tool, only 44 per cent of Hillary Clinton's Twitter followers are real people who participate on the social media platform . 'I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT': Clinton has cast herself as a champion of 'everyday Americans' Another Twitter sleuthing website sampled more than 320,000 of Clinton's followers and found that a much larger number of them were 'fake' Just 4 per cent of President Barack Obama's Twitter followers, by comparison, are considered fake. The White House worked overtime to purge most of them after a September 2013 report found that more than half of his followers didn't really exist. Michelle Obama's Twitter audience is 25 per cent fake, according to StatusPeople, along with 21 per cent of Vice President Joe Biden's. Another tool, TwitterAudit.com, sampled 320,000 of Mrs. Clinton's followers and found that 18 per cent were fake. The new measurements will add to the Clinton presidential campaign's embarrassment following news on Tuesday that a large number of her Facebook fans may represent 'likes' that were purchased rather than earned. REALLY? Hillary Clinton's Twitter follower-count appears to be significantly inflated . FACEBOOK FAKERY: Clinton boasts two-thirds of a million Facebook 'likes,' but more than 46,000 of them list 'Baghdad' as their hometown . Vocativ reported that at least 7 per cent of them listed Baghdad, Iraq as their hometown, a larger number than any U.S. city. That would represent more than 46,000 people. Additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her U.S. Facebook fans are older than 55, most of the Baghdad contingent is in the 18-34 age range. While Clinton was America's top diplomat, her State Department was buying Facebook 'likes,' according to an Associated Press report from last year. 'In 2013, the State Department, which has more than 400,000 likes and was recently most popular in Cairo, said it would stop buying Facebook fans after its inspector general criticized the agency for spending $630,000 to boost the numbers,' the wire service reported. Clinton left the agency while the inspector general was investigating. ASTROTURF? A woman cast as a kindly, gardening grandma in Clinton's campaign launch video is actually a former abortion lobbyist who once helmed a campaign for Texas state Senator Wendy Davis . WHERE'S SCOOBY? Clinton's caravan was spotted in Maumee, Ohio on Monday when she lunched at Chipotle, but no one recognized her . Facebook says it has entire teams of employees tasked with rooting out schemes to artificially boost statistics. 'When we catch fraudulent activity, we work to counter and prevent it – including blocking accounts and removing fake likes,' the company reports on its website. Clinton is in Monticello, Iowa on Tuesday for the first stop on her nascent presidential 'listening' tour. She was driven from New York in a van that her campaign aides have dubbed 'Scooby,' after the 'Mystery Machine' van in the Scooby-Doo cartoon series. Daily Mail Online visited Kirkwood Community College on Monday, the site of the event, and heard from students that the former first lady is a 'control freak' who may be pursuing legal status for illegal immigrants because the Democratic Party needs a new pool of loyal voters.","Two different online audit tools say no more than 44 per cent of Hillary's 3.6 million Twitter fans are real people who participate in the platform .

"Tragic: Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, died after being struck by an express train . The families of two teenage girls killed by a train at a level crossing have been shut out of a meeting where they planned to challenge Network Rail bosses over their bonuses and passenger safety. Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, died when an express train hit them at Elsenham station, Essex, in December 2005 as they set off on a Christmas shopping trip. The friends had been using the station’s unlocked footpath crossing to catch a service to Cambridge when they were struck by a through train bound for Stansted Airport. An inquest returned verdicts of accidental death – but it later emerged that crucial safety reports had not been disclosed to the coroner, leading to allegations of a cover-up. Network Rail was subsequently convicted of criminal negligence and fined £1 million over the deaths. However, campaigners say too many dangerous crossings still exist in rural areas – despite a Network Rail closure programme – and that ‘excessive’ bonus payments to executives totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds are not justified. The girls’ parents had planned to raise their concerns at a meeting in London last week organised by Network Rail’s Public Members, a watchdog whose role is to hold the taxpayer-funded body to account. However, their request to attend was turned down. Last night the girls’ fathers, Chris Bazlinton and Reg Thompson, said in a statement: ‘Bonus payments were made to Network Rail executives even after failures in regard to safety at level crossings, resulting in many deaths, including those of our daughters. ‘We had hoped that Members would challenge Network Rail on these issues and ensure action to improve safety at level crossings is speeded up. The Network Rail governance structure is seriously flawed and not fit for purpose.’ Network Rail, which receives a £4 million annual subsidy from the taxpayer, does not have shareholders. Instead, its activities are scrutinised by a panel of about 30 individuals, appointed by independent assessors for three-year terms. Fatal accident site: Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, were fatally struck Elsenham station, Essex, in December 2005 . Last year, chief executive Sir David Higgins, who has since left the company, saw his basic £591,425 salary boosted by a £67,919 bonus, while network operations chief Robin Gisby, who has also left, received a £47,641 bonus on top of his £380,275 salary. In total, the firm’s bosses received £250,000 in bonuses last year. A Network Rail spokesman said: ‘The tragedy at Elsenham was a watershed for this company and the way it approaches safety at level crossings, and members of the families have played a pivotal role in this. As a result… level crossings in Britain are among the safest in Europe, but there is still much that can, and will be done to make them safer still.’ David Porter, co-ordinator of the Public Members, said: ‘The decision not to invite the families to the workshop was… in no way influenced by Network Rail. The Members are independent but their role is limited and they are not involved in the day-to-day running of the company.’","Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, struck by express train .

"Talk about a chain reaction! This is the moment a billiards player performs a complex trick shot by setting up a domino train to pot four balls. Video footage shows a white ball being rolled down a positioned cue. It then bounces off one side of the red-clothed table and hits the first in a long line of dominoes. One by one the small counters fall down, tapping balls into various pockets as they go. First a yellow, then a blue, then a red. Finally, the last domino  gently hits an orange ball, causing it to roll down another positioned cue lying on the table. The orb then knocks a green ball into the center pocket. In less than 30 seconds the stunt comes to a close. The clip was uploaded by YouTube user honda4ridered.

"Hillary Clinton  'whooped' for joy at the birth of her granddaughter before she saw Bill becoming tearful in the hospital waiting room, she has revealed. The former Secretary of State gave details of her daughter's pregnancy in a new Epilogue for her memoir, Hard Choices, released just days before she is expected to announce her presidential run. In the new chapter, shared by the Huffington Post on Friday, she suggested that the birth of her granddaughter made her think about the future of all children and had motivated her political plans. She explained how in 2014, she and her husband got the 'wonderful news' that their daughter Chelsea and her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky were expecting a baby. Doting: Hillary Clinton, pictured with her husband Bill and their granddaughter Charlotte after her birth last year, has said the baby girl has made her realize she has much more work to do . Hillary Clinton was 'unabashedly giddy' at the news, she said. 'As the summer slipped away, I drove Chelsea crazy checking in practically every hour,' she wrote. 'How are you feeling? Any news from the doctor? When's it going to happen!' But, whereas she and Bill had been disorganized ahead of the birth of Chelsea, their daughter was far calmer and better prepared, she wrote. 'I remember how frazzled [Bill] was when it was finally time to go to the hospital,' she recalled of her own labor. 'Lamaze recommended bringing a small plastic bag of ice to suck on during labor. Bill ended up bringing enough to fill a thirty-nine-gallon garbage bag. It was quite a sight. 'By comparison, Chelsea and Marc were much more organized and prepared.' In September, Chelsea started going into labor in New York City, so they headed to the hospital to greet their first grandchild - Charlotte Clinton Mezvinksy, who was born on September 26. 'Chelsea emerged, exhausted but glowing,' she wrote. 'All our pent up nervous energy burst out in laughter and excited whoops, more like a couple of kids than the newly-minted grandparents we had suddenly become. 'After a while, Bill and I stepped out into the hallway to let them rest. We sat quietly, holding hands, trying to process the rush of emotions. I looked over and saw a tear in Bill's eye.' Calm: In a new chapter of her book, Hillary Clinton said her daughter Chelsea and son-in-law Marc Mezvinksy were far more organized and relaxed about the birth of baby Charlotte than she was about Chelsea . Proud: She revealed that she saw tears in her husband's eyes after the birth of baby Charlotte at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, pictured, last September. She is the couple's first granddaughter . She explained that while she had been nervous about giving birth to Chelsea and the impending responsibility, 'as a new grandmother... there is nothing but joy'. 'It's probably the world's best job,' she wrote. 'I love every minute of it.' She added that even though she has a terrible singing voice - so terrible that an 18-month-old Chelsea told her to stop singing to her - she enjoys singing lullabies to baby Charlotte. 'Charlotte has yet to complain,' she wrote. Welcoming her granddaughter has made her want to make the world a better place for Charlotte and other children, she wrote in the epilogue - hinting that she will be back in politics soon. 'Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on,' she wrote. 'Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up.' Nervous: She said that before the birth of Chelsea, pictured together in the 1980s, she had been so nervous about being a mother but that now she finds being a grandmother is pure joy . She went on: 'In just a few months, Charlotte had already helped me see the world in new ways. There was so much more to do.' Earlier this week, former President Bill Clinton said his granddaughter has changed his outlook in politics too - although it's had the opposite effect. 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody,' he told Town & Country magazine. 'I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad.' It followed reports that Hillary has rented space for her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn Heights. According to reports on Friday, she will announce her bid to run for president on Sunday before immediately traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire to meet with voters.","In the new chapter released on Friday, Clinton shared her experiences as a grandmother and how they had motivated her political plans .

"Teacher Carol Chandler, 53, (pictured outside court) is accused of indecently assaulting a boy under the age of 16 in the 1980s at a top independent school . A female teacher has appeared in court in connection with alleged historic child sex abuse at a top independent school. Carol Chandler, 53, of Wellington, Shropshire, is accused of indecently assaulting a boy under the age of 16 in the 1980s. She was charged as part of the Metropolitan Police’s Operation Winthorpe, Scotland Yard’s investigation into allegations of sex abuse at St Paul’s School in Barnes, south west London - where former pupils include Chancellor George Osborne. The investigation is also looking into its prep school Colet Court. Chandler is charged with three counts of indecent assault and two counts of gross indecency on a male under the age of 16 between 1983 and 1985. Dressed in a smart grey dress, she appeared at City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court and spoke only to confirm her identity. Her case was sent to Southwark Crown Court, where she is due to appear on April 21. A total of five people have now been charged by officers from Operation Winthorpe. Michael Ellis, 69, and Chandler are the latest to be charged. Ellis, of Chiswick, west London, is accused of one count of indecent assault on a 14-year-old boy in 1973, one count of indecent assault on a 16-year-old boy in 1992 and four counts of making indecent images on or before July 8 last year. One man remains on bail pending further inquiries. The boys-only day school on the banks of the Thames has one of the toughest admissions tests in London and most pupils come from its £6,000-a-year preparatory school Colet Court. Five people have been charged by officers from investigating child sex abuse at St Paul's (pictured) Chandler leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court today after appearing on the five charges .

"A notorious thug who once survived a gangland hit has been banned from every pub and club in Manchester after ramming  his car into nightclub doors when his friend was refused entry. David Totton, 36,  admitted driving a hired white Peugeot RCZ into the doors of Club Liv, a nightspot popular with footballers in central Manchester, at around 3am on August 31 last year. Totton, who survived being shot in the head in 2006 as part of a suspected assassination attempt, tried to claim the attack had been meant as 'a joke', but a judge ruled otherwise. David Totton, 36, admitted driving a rented white Peugeot RCZ into the doors of Club Liv in Manchester (pictured) after bouncers refused to let his friend come inside . Totton was walking through Manchester city centre when he saw his friend, who was not named, in an altercation with door staff so he went over to act as 'peace-maker' The  attack began in the early hours of August 31 as Totton was walking past St Peter's Street when he saw a friend having an argument with club bouncers, Manchester Crown Court heard. He went over to remonstrate with the bouncers and act as 'peace-maker', but was told because it was late nobody else was being allowed in. Totton, who has a well-known history of violence, was told to leave as well, and the doormen eventually closed and locked the doors in order to prevent an altercation. Recognising Totton, who has a long history of violence, staff closed and locked the doors. Totton the drove his car on to the pavement at low speed before 'nudging' the doors with his bumper . Instead of leaving, Totton knocked on the window of the club asking for the doorman to come out, and when he refused, Totton calmly walked back to his car and climbed inside. He then drove up to the club doors at a low speed before nudging his front bumper against them. After the doormen still failed to come outside he drove off, and later handed himself over to police, telling officers it was 'a prank' and he didn't mean to intimidate anyone. Prosecuting, Simon Barrett said: 'The defendant was recognised by one of the door staff as someone who was barred. 'Then the gentleman who was with the defendant became aggressive and abusive towards staff and because of that and previous incidents the door staff took the decision to bring in the barriers and to lock the doors to avoid confrontation. 'This defendant can be seen tapping on the window to speak to the doorman and then left.' He added: 'He got in the driver's side of the vehicle then then collided with the front of a taxi then went forward before reversing again back up Peter Street to where he was adjacent with Club Liv. 'He proceeded to move towards the doors of the nightclub, mounting the pavement, approaching with the vehicle the doors of the nightclub and nudging the doors. 'This is done very slowly. It is not an intention to cause injury, more an intimidation of door staff.' Defending Totton, who has 24 convictions for 80 offences, James Harrison said: 'It was a prank, albeit one not understood by the defendant to have the potential for intimidation. Totton (whose car is pictured mounting the pavement bottom left) eventually gave up and left, but handed himself over to police later, admitting that he committed the offence as 'a prank' A judge at Manchester Crown Court refused to accept Totton's claims the attack was meant as a joke, and instead handed him a suspended prison sentence and banned him from driving for three years . 'He now recognises it did have. He of course acknowledges that what he did will have had an effect to those people behind the door. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. 'Given his offending history and past use of violence to door men it would be thought the gesture will have been thought of as a method of intimidation.' Totton (pictured) is a notorious figure, having survived a gangland assassination attempt in 2006 during which he was shot in the head . Recorder John Michael Murray said: 'I have seen the CCTV which in my judgement puts the incident into a proper context. 'I am satisfied that you did not drive at speed and from footage appears the manoeuvre was at a slow speed. There is no evidence of people jumping out of the way. 'I am satisfied that what you did was designed to intimidate - it was obviously a deliberate act. As I said to counsel earlier it was clearly arrogant. 'I do not regard is as being a prank as seems to be suggested. It is a criminal offence.' Totton was also ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in the community and was disqualified from driving for three years. He was also handed a criminal behaviour order  barring from entering  any pubs, bars or clubs in Manchester city centre, between 9pm and 7am, for two years. Totton survived an infamous shooting in March 2006 when two gunmen burst into the Brass Handles pub in Manchester where Totton was watching a football match with friends. The men, Richard Austin, 19, and Carlton Alveranga, 20 were guided to Totton's table by a female 'spotter' positioned behind him who was sending them text messages. Totton was shot three times, including once in the head, while a friend of his was shot another five times, but both survived. Meanwhile Alveranga's gun jammed, and the two men were disarmed, shot with their own weapons and then beaten to death on a grass verge outside. The attack is believed to have taken place after Totton got into a row with gang boss Ian McLeod, again after a row outside a nightclub. Seven months after the attack, Totton was jailed for four-and-a-half years for battering two car park attendants into the Grosvenor Casino in Manchester. The pair were attacked as they tired to help security guard eject Totton and his friends.

"A Spanish woman found dead alongside her British partner and two children in Gibraltar is believed to have killed her family before taking her own life. Anarda De La Caridad Perez Friman, 37, is said to have been 'suffering from post-natal depression' when she allegedly stabbed John Joseph Shannon, 31, the couple's six-week-old baby and her daughter, four. Mr Shannon, from Liverpool, had initially been accused of killing his partner and the two children, but police now believe Perez Friman, a Spanish national of Cuban descent, to be the culprit. Scene: John Joseph Shannon, from Liverpool, was found dead alongside his partner Anarda De La Caridad Perez Friman, 37, their six-week-old baby Eve and Perez Friman's daughter . The couple and the two children, identified as Eve Shannon Perez, and Amanda Kristoffersen Perez, Perez Friman's daughter from a previous relationship, were found dead earlier this week. According to police, the scene was so horrific that the officers who found their bodies were offered counselling. The family, who lived in Estepona, Spain, had arrived in Gibraltar on March 25, and were staying in an apartment in the Boschetti Steps area owned by a family friend. Perez Friman is said to have suffered a 'psychotic incident' as a result of post-natal depression, and stabbed her partner and the two children before taking her own life, the Sunday Express reports. According to the newspaper, Mr Shannon's body was found with defensive wounds which suggest that he has been trying to protect the children before being killed. Accusations: Initial reports indicated that Mr Shannon was responsible for the gruesome killings, but police now believe that Perez Friman suffered a 'psychotic incident' as a result of post-natal depression . Acting superintendent Wayne Tunbridge, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We are not looking for anyone outside of the family at this stage but we have numerous lines of enquiry. 'We are in communication with the family members of the four deceased who now must come to Gibraltar before we release any details about the individuals. The family were found in the rented flat in the Boschetti's Steps area at 11.35am on Monday. Royal Gibraltar Police said the family had been living in Estepona, Malaga before arriving in Gibraltar and 'it is understood that it was their intention to travel to the United Kingdom'. Gibraltar police is now awaiting the results of postmortem examinations conducted by Home Office pathologists.","Spanish woman allegedly stabbed British partner and two children .

"Between the sugar-free devotees and the paleo health nuts sprouting advice in forums and on blogs, there are a lot of confusing messages surrounding what foods are best and most for nourishing children. In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia, UK children's cookbook guru Annabel Karmel has slammed Pete Evans' controversial bone broth recipe in his book 'Bubba Yum Yum - The Paleo Way', calling it dangerous, and said the paleo method goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts recommend. 'Babies need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need and bone broth will not give them what breast milk or formula does,' Karmel, 51, said. Scroll down for video . Motivated mumpreneur: British children's cook book author Annabel Karmel, has over 40 books to her name . Paleo, puhlease... Karmel believes bone broth instead of breast milk or formula is dangerous and ill advised . As an expert on children's nutrition from babies through to toddlers, Karmel believes that, unlike  Pete Evans' exclusion diet that recommends bone broth over breast milk, it is all about a well-rounded diet approach. 'Who is going to be making bone broth? 'I mean, it’s a lot of work and  it’s also very low calorie amount of food,' she said. 'The baby won't have any nutrition they need -  it’s entirely dangerous and I would definitely not advise that.' 'Children’s diets are slightly different to adult diets. When they’re young, the whole low-fat high fibre doesn't apply to children, they need high fats and not many high fibre foods because they deplete the body of nutrients when they’re young,' she added. Bad for bubba: Karmel says Pete Evan's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise . 'However, from two years old, provided they’re not underweight, they can have low-fat skim milk, but up until two they should have full fat milk, proper yoghurt and full fat everything. 'Yet a lot of people give them fruit and vegetables for far too long and  they don’t have the nutrients they need to grow so children as a result become deficient in vitamins and minerals.' 'So it's really important babies have iron rich food, essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth. 'They need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they’re running around, so cheese, avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that’s really important,' said Karmel. Fad foods: Karmel says she doesn't believe in fads and is against sugar free, paleo and low carb diets . 'So basically (the paleo diet) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and I don’t know where he gets his advice from but I would not advise it.' At the mention of certain grains and carbohydrates being excluded, Karmel gasped. 'Sandwiches, breakfast cereals, pasta, all of those - are you saying you cannot have any of that? They're staples for children. If you can’t get them to eat something you can at least get them to eat spaghetti bolegnese. 'And in their lunch box they’d usually have a wrap or a sandwich, so what are they going to have? Bone broth?!' Karmel is also an advocate of good sugars despite popular beliefs currently surrounding the move towards complete sugar bans. ‘I’m not into fads, I prefer an all-round good diet but I’m not a purist either. If a child has an icecream or a chocolate it’s okay as well as long as it’s a part of a good diet. That's life - if you ban  foods, they become forbidden treats and children will want them all the more,' she says. 'These exclusion diets don't make sense to me, you need protein, carbohydrates, you need fat, you need essential fatty acids and you need a balance of all these things.' Karmel crusade: Karmel is out to revolutionise healthy meals for kids with the launch of a new frozen food range . 'There’s sugar and then there is sugar. Fruit sugars are okay, and having an orange juice or a smoothie is okay. While it's  not as good as eating the whole fruit (where you get  the fibre) they still have a lot of nutrients in them.' 'It’s almost like juices and smoothies are now being promoted as not good for you – which is just not true,' she says. 'Yet, I would have chocolate cake or a bag of crisps in the fridge but my children didn't usually want to eat it because the food I made was healthy tasted delicious it was often better than the unhealthy food.' Obesity epidemic: Karmel says aside from diabetes and tooth decay, obese children are also not happy . Instead, Karmel believes balance is key. Mothers are working longer hours than ever before and she believes while they all start with good intentions and want to feed their children well, children get hungry, won't wait and so mothers are worn down into giving unhealthy, time-poor food substitutes like chocolate, chicken nuggets, pizza etc. As a mother of three herself, Karmel knows exactly the pressures facing new mums. Beginning her career after the tragic death of her first born Natasha, Karmel became extremely passionate about making recipes that would nourish her children that followed, as well as helping other mother's give their children food they would eat. Mum to the rescue: Karmel aims to revolutionise meal time for mums with 33 freezer friendly meals in range . It was while she worked at a playgroup that her success in fact began. Sharing recipes with other mums, they  praised her meals and suggested she write a cook book. And the rest is history. Her cook book,  'The Complete Baby And Toddler Meal Planner' (in which she worked closely with the Institute of Children's Health) was born. And despite initially being rejected by 20 publishers, it went on to sell four million copies back in 1991, making her a guru of children's cookery. Rags to riches: Karmel's first cook book 'Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner' was refused by 20 publishers before getting picked up . Now in a bid to help the seven million obese people currently across the nation, Karmel has arrived in Australia to promote her new healthy food range for children in the hopes to be a trail blazer, revolutionise the healthy meal scene for children and help mother's for generations to come. 1.Spaghetti bolognese  - 'I add five hidden vegetables - onion, leek, tomato, carrot and capsicum. It's absolutely delicious.' 2.Chicken and apple balls - ' With minced chicken, thyme, breadcrumbs, apple, chicken stock mixed and made into little balls.' 3. Fish goujons - 'Fish coated in crushed rice crispies and parmesan. It's different but really yummy and children lick them up with their fingers.' The freezer friendly meal range is made in Australia with locally sourced ingredients,  has over 33 meal options and includes a variety of flavours from butter chicken to oriental food and a five veg spaghetti bolognese. 'Somebody has to do something, children are getting mature onset diabetes and they’re loosing their teeth with all the huge amounts of sugar,' she says. 'Plus fat children are not happy children, they are not good at sports, they are laughed at, they have complexes and you know you want them to grow up to be healthy and happy.' She also adds, while mums want the best for their children, it is difficult feeding children and they need help because currently whenever they buy something  unhealthy food is pushed at them. 'The only challenge now will be to get mums to go to the frozen food aisle and buy these foods because its not where they expect to find them.'","UK celebrity cook book author Annabel Karmel shares her thoughts on paleo for kids .

"Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has attracted both criticism and applause for her controversial decision to wear a headscarf during her visit to Iran. Bishop, who is Australia's highest-ranking official to visit Iran in 12 years, donned a black headscarf during a meeting with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani and her Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif. Social media lit up as those from both sides of the argument weighed in on whether Bishop was right to cover her head in keeping with local custom, while political commentators and politicians have also voiced their opinions. Scroll down for video . To veil or not to veil: Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has sparked a debate over her choice to wear a scarf during her visit to Iran . 'You respect the culture wherever you are': The Foreign Minister also met with her counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif, and later defended her wearing of the headscarf that sparked the debate . Accessories: Bishop also donned a hat during the trip, which attracted several unfortunate comparisons to Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal music video on social media . 'Good on #JulieBishop for respecting another country's culture! That's true feminism,' Twitter user Sawyer remarked. 'I'm not religious but I am respectful. I don't like Bishop but I'm glad she respected Iran and their culture,' Brianna Refalo added. While Westerners are not required by law to cover their heads, the Foreign Minister said she did so out of respect for the culture. 'When I went for an audience with the Pope, they told me I had to wear a scarf,' the Foreign Minister told the Australian. 'So I wore a scarf. You respect the culture wherever you are.' Criticism: Michelle Obama attracted criticism for refusing to cover her head at the funeral of Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah in January . Neither Hillary Clinton nor Condoleezza Rice were veiled for their trips to the Middle East during their tenures as US Secretary of State, except for when visiting Mosques. 'I support Julie Bishop wearing a head scarf while overseas... but saying that it's part of her daily outfit though, not so much,' wrote Rodney Gordon on Twitter. The tweet was in reference to an earlier comment given by Bishop to Sydney Morning Herald, in which she appeared to deny her ensemble was purely political. 'As a matter of fact I wear scarves and hats and headgear quite often as part of my everyday wear,' Bishop said. The hat and scarf combo Bishop later donned also attracted a number of unfortunate comparisons to Michael Jackson on social media. Opinion: Views on Twitter were divided... while some just liked the sartorial style . Iranian Journalist and founder of Facebook page 'My Stealthy Freedom, Masih Alinejad, wrote a post calling for the Foreign Minister to raise the issue of the compulsory wearing of a hijab for women in Iran. 'Madam Bishop was asked not to give in to the compulsory veil and to raise her voice very much like numerous Iranian women who have started doing so,' Alinejad wrote on Facebook. 'We also asked the Australian foreign minister to ask the officials of the Islamic Republic to respect her personal values and not to impose the compulsory veil on Iranian women.' Iranian Journalist Masih Alinejad wrote a post on her Facebook group 'My Stealthy Freedom' calling for the Foreign Minister to raise the issue of the compulsory wearing of a hijab for women in Iran during her visit . Meanwhile Opposition Leader Bill Shorten waded into the debate, following Andrew Bolt's comments that Bishop should have 'stood up for Western values' and that she looked 'ridiculous'. 'I think it's ridiculous to criticise Julie Bishop for wearing a headscarf in Iran,' Mr Shorten said. 'Would they criticise Julie Bishop if she wore a scarf to meet the pope? If I wore a yarmulke in Israel to certain events, I don't think that would be inappropriate. 'What really matters here is regardless of Liberal or Labor, that our representatives when they go overseas behave in a sensible, non-ideological, pragmatic fashion. Going bare: Hillary Clinton did not don a scarf during her visit to Saudi Arabia as Secretary of State in 2012 . ... nor did Condoleezza Rice during her visit in 2007 . 'It just makes common sense that when you go to someone's house, or indeed someone's nation, you're just a bit respectful of the customs and traditions of the place that you're visiting.' On Saturday Bishop hailed Iran's efforts to crush the jihadist Islamic State group in Iraq, saying on a rare trip to Tehran that the militants can be defeated. Australia is part of an international coalition in Iraq and has 500 troops deployed there. Iran, though not part of the coalition, has run a parallel campaign using Shiite militias and military advisers to reverse the IS surge that came close to felling the Baghdad government last June. 'We are witnessing a more complex and dangerous form of terrorism with Daesh,' Bishop said at a joint press conference, using an Arabic acronym to refer to the militant group. The Foreign Minister met with President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran on Saturday . 'Both countries can contribute in the fight against this terrorist organisation and put an end to the misery of the people in Iraq,' she said, referring to Iran and Australia's efforts. Iraq needs 'a strong and stable government' added Bishop, who along with Zarif said Australia and Iran were in Iraq at the request of the Baghdad government in fighting IS. 'The fight against Daesh and terrorism in Iraq should be managed by the Iraqi government,' Zarif said. 'Anything we do in Iraq is in coordination with the Iraqi government.' From Iran, the Foreign Minister travels to Paris, Berlin and Brussels. She wrote on Twitter that the trip intends to 'advance Australia's economic/security interests in Europe.'","Foreign Minister Julie Bishop attracted criticism and applause for move .

"A woman who was kidnapped, held for ransom and driven to an area near the Mexican border has opened up about her traumatic experience.

She was released unharmed the following day after one of the kidnappers introduced her to his mother who helped her escape to another location . She escaped the hands of her captors the following day unharmed and said she tried to keep in good spirits for much of the time she was kidnapped. Miguel Angel Cruz Navarro was reportedly the ringleader of the kidnapping. He was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2014 . On Tuesday she will open up about her experiences on the popular true crime documentary show House of Horrors: Kidnapped on Investigation Discovery. Elizondo has said in prior interviews that she was determined to look strong throughout the kidnapping, according to the Panamerican Online. She said in 2013: '(I thought) which one of these guys is going to rape me? All these thoughts were going through my head. 'I was very kind to them. I cracked jokes with them to get out of the situation mentally. 'They saw me as a good person and I think that's why I wasn't physically harmed or raped or anything like that.' An investigation revealed that Elizondo was targeted by the kidnappers because her father was a well-known wealthy business man in the area, according to The Inquisitr. The men demanded a $160,000 ransom when they first called Elizondo's father. She was told by the kidnappers that her father lived a secret life and sold alcohol and cigarettes to the Mexican drug cartel. But eventually, one of the kidnappers introduced Elizondo to his mother, who helped her escape to another location where her parents could reach her. The kidnappers, named as Milton Treviño, Miguel Angel Cruz Navarro, 35, and Onan Herrera-Sanchez, 28, were all arrested. Investigators revealed the Elizondo was targeted because her father was a wealthy and well-known businessman in the area. The kidnappers demanded a $160,000 when they first reached out to the psychology graduate student's father . Investigators said that Treviño, Herrera-Sanchez and Navarro's wife Elva Navarro were responsible for taking Elizondo from the parking lot. Navarro, who was supposedly the ringleader of the operation, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in April 2014, according to FOX Rio. Treviño, who pleaded guilty in the case in 2013 was sentenced to ten years in prison and Herrera-Sanchez was sentenced to 20 years. Elva Navarro was sentenced to three years in December 2014 to three years for her role at a spa that injected women with a deadly fake botox, according to Valley Central. She is still facing kidnapping charges, among others.","Ana Elizondo was kidnapped in 2012 as she was leaving a night class at the University of Texas, Pan American .

"Private matter: Larry Reid was arrested about 12:30 p.m. Monday on U.S. Highway 95 near the edge of Boulder City city limits . Senator Harry Reid's 73-year-old brother has been arrested and charged with driving drunk and hitting a police officer. Larry Reid was arrested for DUI about 12:40 p.m. between Boulder City and Searchlight in Nevada. Mr. Reid was also charged with battery of a police officer, driving across a median, resisting arrest, not wearing a seat belt and possession of a gun while under the influence of alcohol. A trooper saw Larry Reid's Lexus SUV in the dirt median with the engine still running, Patrol spokesman Trooper Loy Hixson said. The Nevada Senator's office released a statement confirming that Larry Reid is the Democrat's brother, saying only that it is 'a private matter.' Details of the arrest were not immediately available since the official complaint had not been filed with the court. Meanwhile, his older brother, Senator Harry Reid, who recently suffered an accident while exercising, said in a video message last week he would not seek re-election next year, and threw his weight behind New York Senator Chuck Schumer to replace him when he leaves office. 'The job of minority leader of the United States Senate is just as important as being the majority leader,' Reid said in the video. 'It gives you so much opportunity to do good things for this country. And that's what I am focused on.'

"An Anzac soldier's cricketing skills were put to good use on the battlefields of Gallipoli when he picked up Turkish bombs and threw them back at the enemy during World War I. Lance Corporal Leonard Keysor, 30, received a Victoria Cross for his 48-hour effort that saw him lob live, palm-sized iron grenades from the trenches of Lone Pine to save the lives of his comrades. The Victoria Cross is the highest military honour an Australian can receive. LCpl Keysor even caught some of the bombs in mid-air, Channel 7's Sunday Night reported. Scroll down for video . Lance Corporal Leonard Keysor served during World War I in Gallipoli and was awarded a Victoria Cross medal . The 30-year-old fought in the trenches at Lone Pine in Anzac Cove on the shores of Turkey . LCpl Keysor signed up just before the start of the war in 1914 as a pilot but instead was sent to the shores of Turkey. He had moved to Sydney after living in Canada for 10 years and had been a clerk for most of his life. In Australia, he discovered cricket and it soon became a passion for the young man. Anzac War Memorial's Brad Manera said LCpl Keysor was an unlikely candidate to become a bomb thrower, but his strong arm soon solidified him as an asset to the Australian army. 'He's one of those blokes that's obviously got great hand-eye coordination. He should have been a test cricketer,' Mr Manera told Victoria Cross winner Ben Roberts-Smith who was hosting the Sunday Night special to mark the Anzac centenary. Every time LCpl Keysor picked up a grenade, he was risking his life to save others as Turkish bombs only had an eight-second fuse while soldiers were being killed around him. LCpl was awarded the VC for his 48-hour effort where he threw live grenades back at the enemy . His grand niece, Keira Quinn Lockyer, said her great uncle was a humble man who did not think he did anything special . 'He doesn't know how many seconds, how many fractions of a second he's got before he flings it back,' Mr Manera told the news program. 'It's a remarkable feat of endurance and every time he grabs one of those grenades he's putting his life on the line and he's doing it hundreds of times over a period of 48 hours.' Not only was he throwing bombs back at the Turkish army, LCpl Keysor was also shielding the blasts by throwing sandbags on top of them and covering them with his coat. His grand niece, Keira Quinn Lockyer, who penned a book about LCpl Keysor's life was told it was 'one of the most sustained acts of bravery' during World War I. Anzac War Memorial's Brad Manera said each time LCpl Keysor picked up a Turkish bomb he was risking his life . The Sunday Night special was hosted by Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith who served in Afghanistan . A Sunday Night re-enactment shows Turkish bombs as palm-sized, iron grenades (left), which were then lobbed over trench walls back at the enemy by LCpl Keysor (right) 'It wasn't something that was done in the heat of the moment. It was something that was sustained for days,' she told Sunday Night. Ms Lockyer revealed her great uncle was a humble man and referred to his time at Gallipoli as the 'only adventure he ever had'. 'I'm proud of Leonard obviously and Leonard made the comment many times that ""I didn't do anything more special than others. I was noticed and that was the difference"",' she said. 'He thought he was no more deserving than any other of the soldiers at Lone Pine that day.'","Leonard Keysor, 30, was a bomb thrower during World War I at Gallipoli .

"Headmistress: Valerie Rutty stole thousands of pounds raised by her pupils from bake sales and fetes that was supposed to pay for new school kit . A headmistress who stole thousands of pounds raised by her pupils from bake sales and fetes that was supposed to pay for new school kit avoided jail today. Valerie Rutty, of Warrington, Cheshire, altered invoices by increasing the prices of work she had commissioned - then paid the difference between the actual sums into her own bank account by cheque from the school fund. The 60-year-old stole almost £3,500 from the fund raised by parents, teachers and pupils over a period of more than three years at Irlam Primary School in Greater Manchester. The cash was collected by children aged three to 11 and their families through non-uniform days and other fundraisers. It would help pay for extra-curricular days out and gym equipment. But Rutty wrote nine separate cheques into a bank account she shared with her mother between December 2010 and May last year. She was only caught when Salford City Council received an anonymous letter saying she had been stealing from the school accounts. An audit was then carried out and Rutty was suspended from the school in September last year, subsequently losing her £60,000-a-year job. The money was repaid in full last month. At Manchester Crown Court Rutty was handed a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 70 hours of unpaid work in the community after admitting theft. Theft: The 60-year-old stole almost £3,500 from the fund at Irlam Primary School in Greater Manchester . Juliet Berry, prosecuting, said: ‘The account from which she stole money was entitled the “Irlam Primary School Fund”. ‘This money had been raised by parents and pupils at the school by hosting various events including fetes, non-uniform etc and the purpose of the money was to raise money for school trips, football kits and the like. One teacher revealed how Irlam Primary School is in serious need of more money. In a victim impact statement, a member of staff at the school named only as Mr Hargreaves said: ‘The school is in desperate need of funds to improve the quality of provision for children and staff. ‘The children worked extremely hard to help with this and we are faced with the fact that the money raised has been taken. ‘Members of staff, particularly the deputy headteacher, have been placed under severe personal stress and a great deal of uncertainty and additional work. The feelings of mistrust are perhaps the most damaging effect on the school and staff.’ ‘The money was raised by the children and parents themselves. It wasn’t money from the local authority, so one can understand how parents must feel.’ Marsha Myers, defending, said the case had been a ‘chastening experience’ for her client. Rutty had done a ‘great deal of benefit’ to the school and it achieved ratings of ‘good’ in its last Ofsted report, the court was told. But the judge told Rutty she had 'marred' her career, having previously been someone parents and children ‘would look up to’. Judge Robert Atherton added: ‘You are now 60 and have done a great deal during your life for the benefit of people and you have marred the end of your career over this period of time and that is very sad. ‘These families, parents and children would look up to you as Mrs Rutty, the headmistress, who was doing a very fine job in many respects and now their confidence has gone. 'I can understand the parents’ frustration, annoyance and anger that their money, the money they have raised, has been taken in this way.’ Rutty was also ordered to pay costs of £500. Irlam Primary, a 416-pupil community school, was formed in September 1980, following the amalgamation of an infant and junior school. On its official website, a welcome letter from the school reads: ‘All members of the staff team are committed to developing our vision which is to encourage children to be... responsible citizens who make a positive contribution to society.’","Valerie Rutty altered invoices by raising prices of work she commissioned .

"Dame Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, is facing the threat of a new inquiry into claims she put patient safety at risk in a drive to meet targets . The most powerful woman in the NHS is facing the threat of a new inquiry into claims that she put patient safety at risk in a drive to meet targets, the Mail can reveal. Dame Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, was accused of gagging a whistleblower who tried to warn about the impact of targets on ordinary patients. She was investigated by the General Medical Council, which concluded that there was no case to answer. However, it is now reviewing part of this decision and is appointing an independent expert to consider if the original investigation went ‘far enough’ in respect of patient safety. The GMC is concerned that there ‘may have been a material flaw’ in the previous decision, which could lead to the case being reopened. Dame Barbara, 57, a former Bradford GP who worked alongside Sir David Nicholson when he was NHS chief, was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower Gary Walker while she was in charge of East Midlands Strategic Health Authority. Mr Walker and other senior executives at the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHT) claim that they had raised concerns with her that the enforcement of targets – implemented by the last Labour government – was endangering lives. This, they alleged, contributed to the trust being in the bottom 25 of the Department of Health’s mortality league tables and being compared to the scandal-hit Mid Staffs. They took their allegations to the GMC, the regulatory body for doctors, who investigated but concluded that there was no case to answer. But following complaints to the watchdog about its review, it is calling for an independent report. The GMC said the absence of such a report ‘may amount to a material flaw in the investigation’ that may have affected the decision. ‘There are concerns that the evidence gathered in the initial investigation did not go far enough in relation to allegations surrounding patient safety,’ it said. The GMC concluded that the review is ‘necessary for the protection of the public’. Dame Barbara, 57, a former GP, was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower Gary Walker (above), who tried to warn about the impact of targets, while she was in charge of East Midlands Strategic Health Authority . It added: ‘The specific question here is whether Dr Hakin’s fitness to practise could be called into question on the basis of her insistence that ULHT met the NHS targets no matter what. Further evidence from an external independent expert would have been useful to consider whether Dr Hakin’s actions were reasonable in all of the circumstances.’ Dame Barbara, who earns around £205,000 in her current role and was referred to as the most powerful woman in the NHS by the Health Service Journal, said the original allegations were ‘spurious and vexatious’. She alleged they stemmed from the ‘failure’ of the ULHT board to manage the hospital and it was a ‘campaign to discredit her’. Mr Walker said yesterday: ‘I am delighted the GMC is now considering that when Dr Hakin put pressure on me and my colleagues to hit targets it may have put the lives of patients at risk. ‘The NHS tried to gag me and prevent me from giving evidence to the GMC but what really happened is finally being exposed. ‘I hope now the GMC will do the right thing and seek to remove Dr Hakin’s licence.’ A GMC spokesman said it was ‘reviewing a decision made as part of our original investigation’ but added that Dame Barbara was not under investigation. Labour insisted that it was ‘always clear that NHS targets should not be implemented in a way that jeopardises the quality of patient care’.","Dame Barbara Hakin, 57, facing threat of a new inquiry over patient safety .

"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's wine from their French vineyard has gone on sale in a British supermarket for the first time after winning rave reviews from critics. Marks and Spencer is stocking a limited supply of the 2014 Miraval Rose and has urged those seeking a taste of the superstars' Provence vineyard to 'get in quick'. The £18-a-bottle wine is produced at the couple's Chateau Miraval estate, where they married in August last year after having purchased it for £41million in 2012. Brad and Angelina's 2014 Miraval Rose wine (pictured) right has finally reached the High street after receiving rave reviews from wine critics . The wine is produced at the couple's Chateau Miraval estate (pictured), where they married in August last year . Wine Spectator ranked the first vintage at number 84 in its list of the top 100 wines of 2013, making it the only rose to be included, while Decanter magazine described it as having 'a sense of power alongside the elegance ... with a delicious mouth-watering finish'. The wine has sold previously in the UK through specialist wine merchants but M&S is the first to offer it up on the High street. The retailer describes it as an 'intriguing pale pink rose with strawberry, white pear and floral aromas' with summer berry, wild herb and tangy tangerine flavours balanced by a refreshing acidity.' Helping Pitt and Jolie take over the vineyard was Marc Perrin, a famous Provence winemaker who was introduced to the Hollywood stars by friends last year. According to Perrin, his family and the famous couple came together with the business venture over a few bottles of wine when the stars invited him over to the Chateau in June 2012. M&S drinks buyer Emma Dawson said: 'We're excited to be launching what could well be the most famous rose in the world. 'Not only does Miraval boast A-lister owners, it's a really lovely crisp rose, perfect for summer drinking.' She added: 'This rose is best enjoyed lightly chilled, while young and fresh, and makes an excellent aperitif or matches with many Provencal style dishes such as fish, vegetables and salads.' The 2014 Miraval Rose is available in selected M&S stores now. Helping Pitt and Jolie take over the vineyard (pictured) was Marc Perrin, a famous Provence winemaker .

"The Tories have jumped to a six point lead over Labour in the polls, putting David Cameron within striking distance of an overhaul majority. With just over three weeks until polling day, 39 per cent of voters now say they will back the Conservatives compared to just 33 per cent for Labour, according to the pollsters ICM. The shock poll, published this afternoon, comes after the Tories unveiled their key election pledge to scrap inheritance tax on family homes worth up to £1million. Scroll down for video . With just over three weeks until polling day, 39 per cent of voters now say they will back the Conservatives compared to just 33 per cent for Labour, according to the pollsters ICM . Bad news: Just 33 per cent of voters plan on supporting Ed Miliband, pictured at the Labour Manifesto Launch, in the upcoming election . It came after a series of polls had suggested Labour had pulled slightly ahead of the Tories and will be a major blow to Ed Miliband in the wake of the his manifesto launch today. According to the ICM poll for the Guardian, the Tories have jumped three per cent in the last month – while Labour has dropped two points. The Lib Dems remain unchanged on 8 per cent – with Ukip even further behind on 7 per cent, tied in fourth place with the Greens. However, a separate poll by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft had to two parties tied on 33 per cent. Ukip and the Lib Dems are each up three points at 13 per cent and 9 per cent. But the Tory campaign will be buoyed by the Guardian ICM poll which gives the party its strongest public support since 2012 – and three points higher than it achieved in 2010. According to the ICM poll for the Guardian, the Tories have jumped three per cent in the last month – while Labour has dropped two points . David Cameron, buoyed by a new poll today, was out campaigning in Alnwick, Northumberland, today . Mr Cameron has consistently claimed the Tories can win a working majority at the election – having fallen just short five years ago. The Prime Minister needs another 23 seats to take the number of Tory MPs in the House of Commons to 326. Mr Cameron has pitched the election as a straight choice between himself and Mr Miliband and will be encourage by further findings buried in today's poll, showing that voters are increasingly happy with his performance as Prime Minister. Ed Miliband, unveiling Labour's manifesto in Manchester today, suffered a blow today after polls showed he was falling behind David Cameron in the race for Number 10 . The survey gives Mr Cameron a public satisfaction rating of plus 18 – with 52 per cent of voters saying he is doing a good job, and only 34 per cent suggesting he is doing badly. Only in November, Mr Cameron's net score was -3 last November. Mr Cameron's personal rating remains comfortably ahead of Ed Miliband's – with the Labour leader languishing on -30. Mr Cameron's standing is also streets ahead of that of all the other political leaders – with Nick Clegg stuck on -20 and Nigel Farage on –16. Mr Cameron and the Chancellor George Osborne are also the most 'trusted team to run the economy properly' for 44 per cent of voters. This is compared to just 17 per cent who would rather trust Mr Miliband and Ed Balls.","New polls shows 39% of voters now say they will back the Conservatives .

"Madonna received a barrage of criticism from her gay fanbase today after posting a photograph of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and 'thanking' her for her service. The 56-year-old pop star posted the image of the Iron Lady on Instagram - before quickly deleting it just moments later after receiving dozens of abusive messages. Some of her fans took umbrage to the photo, which Madonna captioned with: 'Thank you Margaret Thatcher' followed by '#unapologetic #rebelheart' and a love heart. The singer, who has a large gay fanbase, offended fans who reminded her that Thatcher enacted legislation that banned 'promoting' homosexuality in 1988. Scroll down for video . Pop singer Madonna faced a barrage of criticism from her gay fanbase today after posting this photograph of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and 'thanking' her for her service. She deleted it just moments later . Madonna has immersed herself in the gay community and was named one of the greatest gay icons of all time . Conservative Thatcher, who led the country from 1979 until 1990, established Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 – a legislation that was considered anti-gay and later overturned in 2003. Section 28 was introduced against a backdrop of councils promoting gay relationships in schools and the rise of AIDS. The section of the act banned councils from using taxpayers' money to fund books, plays, leaflets, films or any other material showing gay relationships as normal and 'promoting the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship'. Madonna, who has previously immersed herself in the gay community and was named one of the greatest gay icons of all time in 2012, thanked Thatcher for her example in the Instagram post today. Some of Madonna's fans took umbrage to the post of Thatcher's picture and said she had gone 'a step too far' However, Conservative fans praised her for the post, with one saying the singer was 'back in my good books' Madonna was close friends with openly bisexual comedienne Sandra Bernhard; pictured above in 2000 . Madge posed with her friend Rosie O'Donnell, who is openly lesbian; seen above in 2001 . Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 was introduced under Thatcher’s rule and was a legislation that was considered anti-gay. It was brought in against a backdrop of councils promoting gay relationships in schools and the rise of AIDS. Thatcher's government claimed to have taken up the 'dangerous gauntlet' to protect children but it became a rallying cry for campaigners. Current Prime Minister David Cameron has since apologised for banning the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Speaking in 2009, Mr Cameron said the Conservative party had 'got it wrong' when it introduced Section 28 in the late 1980s. He insisted he was making his apology because the legislation had been 'offensive to gay people' and said: 'I'm sorry for Section 28. We got it wrong. It was an emotional issue. We have got to move on and we have moved on.' Alongside the portrait of Thatcher, she pulled out a famous quote from the Iron Lady, which read: 'If you just set out to be liked, you will be prepared to compromise on anything at anytime, and would achieve nothing.' The post was signed off with #rebelheart – in an apparent plug for her new album which goes by the same name. However, she took down the post just minutes after uploading it, after fans responded with criticism. One fan, called Sean, wrote: ‘Madonna’s Thatcher post was too far’. Another, writing under the name Madonsha, said: ‘Lost a bit of respect for Madonna for posting a picture of Margaret Thatcher, that woman ruined this country recked (sic) so many lives urgh.’ And Richard Rippon added: ‘Madonna should know that Thatcher was divisive in the UK. Some thought she was a heartless witch, others, an evil threat to society.’ However, other fans praised her Instagram post, including Louise Mensch who wrote: ‘Madonna back in my good books. #Thatcher’ The singer then attempted to quell any abuse by following the post up with a rather revealing selfie. The saucy image showed the mother-of-four - dressed in a black corset, nylons, garters and white jacket - lying on a floor surrounded by roses, including one held in her mouth. In the picture, she revealed her cleavage, covered somewhat in red underwear, and showed her cupping one of her breasts with her hand. She captioned the photo: 'He sent me roses begging my forgiveness. I said I'd think about it. These guys..............??????' Cougar kiss: Madonna surprised rapper Drake with a kiss on stage at Coachella last week . Although she did not reveal the identity of the gentleman who showered her with the red blooms, speculation will likely be that she was speaking of Drake - the rapper who left her red-faced when he winced in horror after she planted an amorous kiss on him during a performance at Coachella last week. The 28-year-old later explained that the kiss was fulfilling for him, despite being photographed appearing to wipe his mouth when the singer kissed him mid-performance. Aftwerwards, Drake said on Twitter: 'Don't misinterpret my shock!! I got to make out with the queen Madonna and I feel about that forever. Thank you @madonna.' Madonna has long said to have been a supporter of gay rights, ever since meeting her gay ballet teacher as a teenager in Detroit, Michigan. She has since circulated within the gay community, becoming close friends with lesbian Rosie O'Donnell and bisexual comedienne Sandra Bernhard. It is not the first time Madonna has been in the spotlight for uploading controversial posts to social media. In fact, her behaviour on Twitter and Instagram has become increasingly erratic of late with regular doses of raunchy semi-nude photographs posted online as well as bizarre references to high-profile political leaders and human rights' activists. The singer came under fire from fans earlier this year after posting pictures of iconic public figures such as Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Princess Diana with bondage tape photoshopped onto their faces. The images were altered to look like her own image on her new album cover - Rebel Hearts - and she was accused of comparing herself to the revolutionaries and civil rights leaders. In the ensuing furore, she was also accused of both racism and narcissism - both of which she took to social media to deny. The Queen of Pop's cover for her new album Rebel Heart is a close-up of her face with black string on it . The singer came under fire from fans earlier this year after posting pictures of iconic public figures such as Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Princess Diana with bondage tape photoshopped onto their faces . She said: 'I'm sorry. I'm not comparing myself to anyone. I'm admiring and acknowledging there Rebel Hearts (sic)'. She added: 'This is niether a crime or an insult or racist! I also did it with Michael jaclson and frida khalo and marilyn monroe (sic).' 'Am I saying I am them NO I'm saying they are Rebel Hearts too. And I didn't do it My fans did And I just re posted those photos My fans aren't racist either If they put me in the same category as these other people Thank you.' Her promotion of her latest album has also brought with it countless other controversies. In January, the pop star was accused by many online commentators of using the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris to promote her album. It came after she posted a series of photos to her Instagram to offer support after 12 people were killed in the gun attack on the French satirical magazine’s offices. But as the star offered encouraging words in the captions for her social media images, she also provided some hashtags which were in promotion of her new album. The singer's behaviour on Twitter and Instagram has become increasingly erratic of late with regular doses of raunchy semi-nude photographs posted online, including this image in which she grabbed her breasts . The controversy came on the heels of the pop icon likening the leak of her album to a 'form of terrorism' - her comments coming just after the world was left in shock following a deadly hostage terrorist siege in Sydney and the devastating Taliban school massacre in Pakistan. Madonna posted a viral image 'Je suis Charlie' (I am Charlie) with the caption: 'These are very scary times we are living in. Ignorance breeds Intolerance and fear. We can only fight darkness with light! We are all Charlie! #revolutionoflove [heart] #rebelhearts.' Revolution Of Love is a track off her album Rebel Hearts, both of which she used as hashtags at the end of her post. Fans branded her insensitive for likening the leak of her upcoming album to a 'form of terrorism’ and using the tragedies to promote her work. Her son 14-year-old Rocco, from her second marriage to British film director Guy Ritchie, is also no stranger to controversy himself, having caused a storm in October last year when he posted a video purporting to show ISIS terrorists executing children on his Instagram page. His mother, in typically bombastic fashion, hit back at critics, telling the world that she was 'proud' of the teenager who was, she added, 'fighting for freedom'.","Madonna posted photograph of Margaret Thatcher before later deleting it .

"Britons spend an astonishing £100 million a year on cough syrup – when a glass of honey and lemon could work just as well, according to a new BBC television investigation. It claims that branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using ‘clever marketing’ to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products, and that some manufacturers simply use the same pills in different packaging throughout their ranges. Scroll down for video . 'Clever marketing': Dr Chris Van Tulleken with a range of packets that, he says, may contain exactly the same pills . The UK over-the-counter medicines market, which also includes painkillers and anti-fungal creams, is worth £2.5 billion, with brands vying for attention with brightly coloured packaging and promises that are questionable under scrutiny, claims Dr Chris Van Tulleken. In The Truth About Medicine, to be broadcast on Thursday, Dr Van Tulleken, an infectious diseases specialist, warns we should think less about convenience and more about the effectiveness of medicines. There are three main types of over-the-counter cough remedies, those that contain suppressants to alleviate symptoms of a dry, tickly cough, syrups that reduce the urge to cough by coating the throat, and products that help to thin sticky mucus, making coughing easier. Some also contain paracetamol or ibuprofen, both of which reduce a temperature, decongestants and antihistamines that can help sleep. Yet an authoritative study from Cardiff University’s Common Cold Centre claimed cough medicines work mostly through a placebo effect, and that just 15 per cent of the effect can be attributed to the medicines in them. PREVENT: Sores on the inside of the mouth or cheeks can be caused by damage to the lining of the mouth from hot foods, biting your cheek or even rubbing dentures. They can also be a sign of an iron or Vitamin B12 deficiency, so a balanced diet can help prevent them. Spicy foods and chocolate can be triggers, so keep a food diary if you have recurrent outbreaks to pinpoint problem foods. It’s also worth checking your toothpaste – formulas that contain a foaming agent called sodium lauryl sulphate can cause mouth ulcers by reducing the protective mucus layer in the mouth. You might consider switching brands. TREAT: Over-the-counter antiseptic gels can bring relief from the stinging and help form a protective layer around the mouth ulcer to speed up healing. You could also try a medicated mouthwash containing chlorhexidine, which is anti-inflammatory and helps reduce bacteria. If you have had mouth ulcers for more than three weeks, go to your GP or dentist, who may prescribe steroids in the form of a tablet, mouth spray or gel. DON’T BOTHER: Some people believe upping their Vitamin C intake will cure their mouth ulcers, as the vitamin is known to help the wound-healing process, but too much can actually irritate the mouth. Stick to the daily recommended allowance of 40mg per day (30mg for children aged one to ten) through a healthy diet. A study of 60 over-the-counter medicines found that all but two contained sweeteners such as honey or sucrose, which can stimulate saliva and mucus production. In the documentary, Dr Van Tulleken shows how an old-fashioned remedy of honey and lemon could be just the tonic to banish a troublesome cough. He inhales pepper spray into his lungs, which makes him cough, then takes a lemon-and-honey concoction. He inhales the pepper spray once more, but doesn’t cough at all. Professor Alyn Morice of Hull University, who also appears in the programme, admits there is no good scientific answer as to why the home-made cure is as effective but, with no potential side effects, the health benefits are obvious. The Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB), a trade association representing manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines, says that although it is difficult to test the effectiveness of cough medicines, as the severity and duration of symptoms can vary, research has shown they are rated as effective by 90 per cent of consumers. The film also reveals that UK families spend £350 million on a variety of painkillers, with packaging claiming to specifically target ailments such as period pain, headaches or muscular problems. For example, Nurofen and Feminax both market forms of ibuprofen that are aimed specifically at those suffering from period pain, while Panadol ActiFast, which is a branded form of paracetamol, claims on the packet to treat tension headaches, period pains and toothache. But Dr Van Tulleken says that once the medicine is absorbed into the bloodstream, there is no way to send it to a particular part of the body. He also reveals that different branded packets all have an identical product licence number, which means they look different but contain exactly the same pills. ‘It isn’t that the manufacturers are being untruthful, but it is clever marketing to tempt you to spend more money,’ said Dr Van Tulleken. The investigation claims branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using ‘clever marketing’ to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products . PAGB chief executive Matthew Speers told this newspaper: ‘People search for products to treat their specific symptoms, so different labelling and packaging help people navigate the range more easily. ‘There are different formulations and formats of over-the-counter medicines, which could mean a painkiller gets to work faster or provides pain relief for longer, even if it has the same active ingredient. ‘For example, migraine products work faster while back pain products tend to be longer-lasting.’ Dr Van Tulleken says: ‘Some medicines are a waste of our hard-earned cash. Products may be convenient but not necessarily effective.’ Excess production of the skin pigment melanin can cause blotchy uneven patches of darker skin, known as hyperpigmentation or, more commonly, liver spots. Although harmless, they can be unsightly, appearing most commonly on the backs of the hands. Sun damage is a common cause and pregnancy hormones can also trigger the condition. Two recent pregnancies and many years as a sun-worshipper have left me with blotches of darker skin just above my upper lip, on my cheeks and under my eyes. In the winter I cover them with a foundation, but as summer approaches I’d rather not have to cover up with lots of make up. Where’s the solution? The Bliss Labs active 99.0 anti-ageing facial is on offer at their day spa at South Kensington in London. What’s the treatment? The 75-minute facial promises to firm, smooth and reduce the appearance of fine lines as well as helping to reduce the discoloration caused by hyperpigmentation. The therapist begins by cleansing my skin with an exfoliating powder cleanser. She then gets started with the microdermabrasion machine, which works like a mini-hoover to suck up the dead skin cells, and applies a glycolic peel which targets the hyperpigmentation by breaking apart the dead, damaged cells and peeling away the dark marks. After this she applies a serum, which contains kojic acid (this helps to reduce the appearance of dark spots and discoloration and even out the skin tone) and niacinamide, a form of Vitamin B which can even out skin tone. She then uses a wand attached to a micro-current machine to deliver tiny electrical impulses which enhance the penetration of the active ingredients in the serum. The micro-currents also have an anti-ageing effect by increasing blood and lymph circulation and boosting the production of collagen and elastin. The therapist follows up by applying an eye cream to help diminish puffiness and dark circles. She then applies an intensive moisturiser which contains glycolic acid (known to help fade the effects of hyperpigmentation), and finishes off by applying an SPF 30 to the face – important as microdermabrasion can increase the skin’s photosensitivity for two weeks. Does it work? My skin felt fresher and clearer and its tone was brighter and more even. This was the perfect preparation for scaling down my make up routine as the summer approaches.

"A pet dog was slashed across the head with a meat cleaver as he tried to protect his owners from armed robbers. The terrier, named Cookie, barked at  Joseph Devaney, 23, and Kieron Rolstron, 22, as they burst into the home of a young couple and demanded money. But as owners John and Emma Evans watched in horror, Devaney brought down the machete on the animal's head to stop it barking before making off in the victims' car. Cookie, pictured with his injuries, was slashed with a meat cleaver during the aggravated burglary in Chorley . Joseph Devaney, left, struck Cookie over the head with a meat cleaver while is accomplice Kieron Rolstron, right shouted at the terrified householders 'give me your money' and 'I will stab you' during last year's attack . Cookie suffered serious injuries and had be sedated whilst he was given stitches and is now recovering at home in Clayton Brook, near Chorley, Lancashire. At Preston Crown Court, Devaney and Rolstron were jailed after pleading guilty to aggravated burglary and aggravated vehicle taking. Devaney also pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Rolstron was jailed for eight years seven months whilst Devaney was given nine years. The attack occurred at 10pm on September 15 last year whilst Mr and Mrs Evans' seven-year-old daughter was sleeping in her upstairs bedroom. The couple were watching TV with Cookie snoozing beside them when Devaney, who was wielding a meat cleaver and Rolstron, who was armed with a knife, raced into the living room before making demands for money and attacking the dog. As the animal yelped in agony, Rolstron, a former plaster's labourer from Bamber Bridge, began shouting over and over again, 'give me your money' before grabbing the frightened dad by his shirt. In a brave act of courage the court was told that Mr Evans attempted to reach for Rolstron's knife but he was repeatedly threatened with violence. Rolstron was said to shout 'I will stab you' before the couple were pushed into the kitchen. Both were then ordered to kneel down as the intruders repeated their demands for money despite pleas from the couple that there was none in the house. Prosecuting counsel Mr Henry Pepper told the court that Rolstron had been pointing and brandishing the knife at the couple before the duo fled from the scene with the couple's mobile telephones and car keys before making their getaway in the family's car. Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard that John and Emma Evans' seven-year-old daughter was sleeping upstairs when both men stormed into their house, attacking their dog and threatening them with violence . The court heard that Cookie, pictured, required stitches and is recovering at home following the attack . Mr Pepper said: 'Rolstron was shouting a number of times ""give me your money"" and grabbed John Evans' top. He said, ""I will stab you"" and shouted it a number of times. Both were pushed into the kitchen and both were told to kneel down. 'The occupiers were at home, there was violence used or threatened to be used, both defendants had weapons - a knife and a meat cleaver. The Crown say these weapons were present on entry, it was night time and there was a child asleep in the house. Both defendants had their faces covered.' The robbers took the couple's Citroen Picasso which was involved in a police pursuit at 1.30am the following morning after it was seen being driven dangerously through red lights and on the wrong side of the road. It was written-off after it crashed during the police chase. Both men were then located near to the crash and arrested. Rolstron was found in a field by a police helicopter whilst Devaney was found by police dogs hiding in a gazebo and in possession of one of the mobiles. The other phone is believed to have been sold soon after the theft. In a victim impact statement Mr Evans described the events as 'very frightening' and had feared he was going to be stabbed. Mrs Evans described the incident at 'absolutely terrifying'. Devaney had previous convictions for burglary, assault occasioning actual body harm, and possession of counterfeit money with intent. Rolstron had previous convictions for aggravated vehicle taking and possession of an offensive weapon. Both were also disqualified from driving for five years. For Devaney, Mr Daniel Prowse said that while violence was threatened against the victims, violence hadn't been used and said that 'mercifully' the child had remained asleep. He added that his client had shown 'clear and sincere remorse' and was 'extremely apologetic'. He added: 'He is very very sorry for his actions.' For Rolstron, Mr Philip Holden added: 'Mercifully there was no physical injury to the complainants and mercifully the child remained asleep upstairs. Mr Rolstron for what it is worth did not know there was going to be injury to the dog.' In passing sentence Judge Pamela Badley said that whatever the 'torturous' reasons had been for entering the house it had 'terrified' the couple. She said: 'One of the most unpleasant aspects was that the family pet was struck by you, Joseph Devaney. This was done to increase terror for the couple and it certainly had that effect. This was significant psychological abuse of the couple. The terror was such that you were able to achieve your aim. 'There was a child, a seven-year-old at home, she was upstairs, the commotion would not have been easy for her to ignore. The effect of the family dog would have been clear to her. Each of you were either under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 'Whilst you were there each of you knew the effect you were having on this couple and you continued in the way you did demanding money and pushing each of them around.'","Joseph Devaney and Kieron Rolstron stormed into the house in Chorley .

"A man has died after a ride-on lawnmower he was using overturned into a farmhouse pond and trapped him underneath. The man, who has been named locally as 62-year-old Richard Clements, is believed to have been mowing grass outside his property in Wattisham, Suffolk, when the machine toppled down a bank into the water and trapped him. His family managed to drag him from the pond and made frantic efforts to save him but he was pronounced dead at the scene. A man, in his 60s, has died after the ride-on lawnmower he was using to cut the grass at a farmhouse property in Wattisham, Suffolk, overturned into a pond. Pictured: An air ambulance at the scene yesterday . Friends today told of their shock at the incident, which occurred in the quiet village just before 5.15pm yesterday. Peter Mead, the secretary of Stowmarket Meadlands Recreation Club which Mr Clements had been chairman of for around 30 years, said they grew up together. The 70-year-old from Cotton, Suffolk, said: 'I heard about it last night it was a complete shock. I have been told that he was riding a lawnmower and it went into the pond. I don't know much more about how it happened. 'But knowing the sort of person Richard was I am not surprised. He was a very hands on guy and would do that kind of work. 'We used to play football together and we used to work together at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). I worked in the sales office he was a chemist and then a waste environmental manager before he retired about three of four years ago. 'He was just a really nice bloke. The club used to be part of ICI but we wanted to make it independent and Richard was heavily involved on that. 'He did so much for the club, he's really going to be missed. He's left us in a bit of a pickle really.' Liam Cracknell, 47, a lorry driver, who lives on the same street as Mr Clements, said: 'I heard about it this morning, it's really sad. 'I think the whole village will be shocked about it. 'I heard he drowned after the piece of machinery fell on top of him. 'Obviously it's very, very sad you don't wish that on anybody, but this isn't the first time we have had something like this happen. 'A couple of years ago we had a mam die in a pond and we had a young girl die in a bath after she had an epileptic fit. 'That's three drownings in one village which is the really strange. Obviously they are not connected but it's a very strange coincidence.' The incident occurred at about 5.15pm yesterday in the rural Suffolk village of Wattisham (above). Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death and a file is being prepared for the coroner . Another neighbour, who didn't want to be named, added: 'I was here at the time and I saw all the ambulance and fire engines. 'It's a real shock to hear what actually happened. I knew him to say hello to he seemed like a really nice bloke. He was very well known round here and really liked. It's such a shame.' East of England Ambulance Service said Mr Clements suffered a heart attack and, despite the best efforts of emergency services, died at the scene. Suffolk Police was unable to confirm whether he lived at the rural farmhouse but said he wasn't a contracted worker brought in to maintain the land. The force said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and said a file was being prepared for the coroner. A spokesman said: 'Police were called to address in Bildeston Road at Wattisham around 5.15pm yesterday to reports that a ride-on lawnmower was upside down in a pond in a private garden. 'A man, believed to be in his 60s, who had been driving the lawnmower was pulled from the vehicle and attempts were made to resuscitate him, however he was pronounced deceased at the scene.' An air ambulance and hazardous response team were sent to the incident. The tragic incident comes just two years after a man died in similar circumstances in the rural village. Michael Bradwel, 52, was working to restore a farmhouse in the village in May 2013 and died after being found unconscious in a pond within the grounds of a property.","Man was cutting the grass with a ride-on lawnmower when it overturned .

"Break-ups can be hard enough to deal with but two women were left with permanent reminders of their failed relationships thanks to having their ex-partners' names tattooed on their bodies. Jessica Hardy, 23, from Hereford, was so desperate to remove her former flame's name from her forearm when she met her new man, Ryan, she tried to burn it off with acid. 'I'm desperate to get rid of it, I have bad dreams about it,' she said on Channel 5 show Tattoo Disasters. Scroll down for video . Jessica Hardy was so desperate to remove her former flame's name from her forearm she used acid . The mother-of-one said she couldn't afford laser removal surgery to have the tattoo removed so when she heard about acid peels for the skin, she thought she had an ideal solution. 'I came across a YouTube video about acid peels so I thought that would be the way to get rid of my tattoo. The kit cost £25 online and I thought ""bargain"".' But instead of removing her tattoo as she hoped, Jessica's dangerous DIY treatment gave her chemical burns. A chemical peel should be applied by a beauty professional as it's designed to damage the skin in a controlled way. The body responds to the damage by healing and rejuvenating the skin - supposedly making it look younger. But Jessica applied the acid without diluting it with water or reading the instructions. As a result, it immediately caused her skin to burn and blister. Jessica's tattoo, left, featuring the name of her ex, and the burns she suffered, right, after applying acid . Six painful applications left Jessica's skin red raw and scabby - and the tattoo remained . She said: 'It felt like someone had poured boiling water on my arm and then got a lighter to it. 'After five minutes it went white and blistered, then started peeling, after three days it went all scabby. 'I didn't want to get it checked in case the nurses thought I was self-harming and I didn't want them to take the acid off me as I still wanted it.' Despite her painful first encounter with the acid, Jessica repeated the treatment another six times. Her skin became red raw, scabby and inflamed - and worst of all, the tattoo was still visible. Realising her DIY treatments were a painful failure, Jessica finally sought the advice of tattoo artist Aaron Mullen. He said: 'I have never seen anything like it before, my first reaction was shock, she shouldn't have taken such a drastic measure to use acid on her skin.' Jess, left, regretted getting her ex-boyfriend's name tattooed on her bikini line, right . He recommended laser removal surgery but said Jessica would have to wait until her skin has healed from the acid burns. Jessica said: 'I regret doing the acid now as I have made process slower. It will be another six to nine months till it will be completely gone.' Another woman keen to get rid of a tattoo featuring the name of an ex is Jess, 23, a dental nurse, from London. She appears on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters this week where she reveals her regrets over her tattoo. 'My boyfriend Jack and I got matching tattoos. Then we broke up and I'm left with his name tattooed on me in an awkward position below my bikini line. 'I regret it every single day. It upsets me and I'm constantly reminds me of what happened when I look at it. I definitely shouldn't have done it, it was a really big mistake,' she said. Jess said the tattoo had seemed like a good idea at the time but now she's been dumped by Jack, it's a permanent reminder of the love she's lost. Jess realised the tattoo was a big mistake when Jack dumped her . The dental nurse managed to get the old tattoo covered up with a new one by tattoo artist David Kaffri . Before, left, and after, right, shots reveal how Jess no longer has Jack's name visible on her body . 'I was in love with him and I thought he was in love with me. We got matching tattoos as we thought we could be together forever,' she said. 'A year-and-a-half later he decided he wanted to be single when he went to uni and broke up with me. When he broke up with me, I said ""I have your name tattooed on me, what am I going to do?""' Jess sought the advice of skin expert Dr Sam Bunting who told her: 'You have two options - one is to get rid of it altogether and that would involve using laser, which is quite a long, painstaking process and will cause some discomfort. 'The other is to change it so the word Jack isn't distinguishable.' Jess decided on the latter and enlisted the help of tattoo artist David Kaffri, who is no stranger to ridding people of tattoos featuring the name of an ex. He said: 'I like it when people come to me with a tattoo they hate and I can transform it into one they love. 'When I first saw Jess' tattoo, I thought, ""Oh My God that's a bad mistake"". The ""Jack"" is quite substantial. 'Names are a common cover-up. In the tattoo world it's believed to be a jinx, if you put someone's name on your body, it will end up bad.' David designed a feminine paisley style tattoo to cover up the name and Jess was delighted with the end result. She said: 'I love it, it looks amazing, Jack is no more, you can't see the old tattoo at all. I feel like a weight is off my shoulders, it has a closed a chapter for me, now I can finally move on. 'Now I can look down and see a nice tattoo instead of bad memories.' A firm of lawyers is offering a free tattoo amendment service to its clients who are filing for divorce and have their ex-partner's name inked on their body. Stephensons Solicitors LLP is giving its clients the opportunity to turn the tattooed name of their former partner into a work of art. It is also offering to 'cover up' the tattoos which were purchased 'during better times'. Stephensons Solicitors LLP is giving its clients the opportunity to turn the tattooed name of their former partner into a work of art after filing for divorce . The firm is working with entertainment television channel truTV to offer the unique service so clients can get over their ex-spouse. It comes after a new series of television show 'Tattoo Nightmares' will air on the channel. The new service will be trialled for customers who file for divorce at the firm's London office from April 20, 2015. Mike Devlin, from Stephensons' family law team, said: 'It's not unusual for us to see clients who have tattoos of their ex-partners' names. 'Acquired during better times, when going through a family breakdown, these are an unnecessary reminder of the past. 'Covering these tattoos helps our clients to focus on moving forward. Divorce and family breakdown is one of the most stressful times in a person's life and we do everything we can to ease that process.'","Jessica Hardy, 23, has tattoo with ex-boyfriend's name on her forearm .

"A 33-year-old professional skydiver who has made more than 6,000 dives was killed during a dive in Florida on Wednesday, after her chute apparently collided with another mid-air. Jessica Edgeington, of Villa Rica, Georgia, was a skilled diver known for a type of high-speed sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and sweep over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition. She died after plummeting to the ground at the Skydive DeLand in DeLand, Florida. It is the second death at the skydiving center this year, after Navy SEAL William Marston died after landing heavily in January. It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air. First responders arrived about 4.10pm and Edgeington was pronounced dead at the scene. Tragedy: Jessica Edgeington, 33, a professional skydiver, was killed in a dive on Wednesday in DeLand, Florida, after apparently colliding with another dive mid-air . Professional: Edgeington had made over 6,000 jumps and competed in a sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and swoop over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition . Investigation: It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air, but the crash is under investigation . Scene: Edgeington was pronounced dead at DeLand Municipal Airport on Wednesday about 4.10pm . Local media reports say Edgeington collided with another diver, causing a problem with her parachute. However the crash is currently under investigation. According to The Tampa Bay Times,  'swoopers' like Edgeington jump from the plane at 5,000 feet and reach speeds of 90 miles per hour as they descend. The sport is about how the person can handle their parachute and make maneuvers, including turns and twists. Edgeington gave an interview with the Associated Press in May last year while competing for a spot on the U.S. Parachute Team. 'It's not necessarily scary to jump out of the plane anymore,' she said. Killed: Jessica Edgeington, seen here at a swooping course,  died Wednesday afternoon after flying out of Skydive DeLand in Florida on Wednesday . Edgeington continued in the interview: 'I get competition nerves when I'm at something like this. 'So that's probably the most nerve wracking thing, is getting ready to compete. 'Trying to perform and do your best. Hopefully not mess up.' On her Facebook page, Edgeington lists herself as a 'canopy coach' for PD Factory Team. Canopy coaches educate skydivers of every level, from beginners working on accuracy to advanced semi-pros and elite military personnel. Her page was inundated with messages from family, friends and colleagues following the tragedy on Wednesday. Crash: Jessica Edgeington, 33, of Villa Rica, Georgia, died Wednesday afternoon at Skydive DeLand . It is the second death at the the DeLand field this year. In January, William 'Blake' Marston, a Navy SEAL learning how to skydive, died after hitting the land too hard, according to My News 13. The field is at DeLand Municipal Airport. Tributes: Hundreds of tributes have flooded in for the skydiver, describing her as a 'wonderful soul' Two other men died in separate incidents at Skydive DeLand in 2013. That year, in the 3.2 million jumps that happened across the country, the United States Parachute Associated recorded a total of 24 fatal skydiving accidents. There are thousands of dives at Skydive Delandeach year. It is also the home of SkyDive University, a professional skydiving instruction and coaching organization.","Jessica Edgeington, 33, had made over 6,000 jumps .

"Timothy McVeigh considered the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building 20 years ago a failure because the structure was still standing after the blast that killed 168 people. McVeigh also viewed himself as a 'Paul Revere-type messenger' and even suggested his defense team should receive $800,000 from the government, according an archive of documents donated by the convicted bomber's lead attorney. The estimated one million pages of paper documents from Stephen Jones now fill 550 file cabinet-sized boxes at the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas. The trove, which was delivered to the school where the attorney received his undergraduate degree in three phases since 1998, only became fully organized late last year. Scroll down for video . Timothy McVeigh (right) is escorted from the Noble County Courthouse in Oklahoma by FBI agents in 1995 . A photo taken on April 27, 1995, shows damage to the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building after the truck bomb . Rescue workers continue digging through the rubble after the deadly bombing in Oklahoma City in April 1995 . Firemen examine the wreckage at the building after the 1,200lb truck bomb blew off the structure's north side . The archive includes a confidential report from a polygraph examiner, who wrote that McVeigh had wanted to `take out' the Murrah Building on April 19, 1995. Although the blast killed 168, including 19 children, the examiner concluded that 'In McVeigh's mind, he believed that he had definitely screwed up because he left the building still standing'. McVeigh was executed by injection in 2001 at age 33. Co-conspirator Terry Nichols was convicted separately and sentenced to life in prison. Even as he stood accused of orchestrating what until the Sept. 11 attacks was considered the deadliest act of terrorism on US soil, McVeigh appeared to be driven by profit and thought his attorneys should be entitled to '$800,000 (after fees, taxes).' 'If I'm gonna die anyway, I want to make some money. Not for me, but to try to make up for what my family has been put thru, as well as to shell out some `bonuses' to my legal team.,' he wrote in one note to his defense team included in the archive. In another, he doodled a tank ramming a house and wrote: 'This is the FBI! ... Send out your women and children. We know you're in there and we know you have Bibles and a copy of the Constitution!' The collection also includes a copy of a published cartoon showing 11 jurors frowning and one smiling, with an arrow pointing to her and the note: 'My choice, potential juror.' McVeigh was identified as a suspect in the bombing of the building, sentenced to death and executed in 2001 . Medical assistants run from the blast site after being told another bomb had been found on April 19, 1995 . This is one of over 500 boxes of attorney/client documents that were donated by attorney Stephen Jones . An Oklahoma City police car decorated with kind words and a small American flag sits near the blast area . Don Carleton, executive director of the museum, said Jones wasn't comfortable putting the material at an Oklahoma institution 'because the feelings were so raw' and his fears the collection could be perceived as 'almost a shrine' to the convicted bomber. Carleton said: 'It's been a difficult collection to figure out how to let people know we have it available for research. 'You don't want to promote it. That's not the right word. You don't want to publicize it without coming across as being somewhat celebratory. 'It's almost like Holocaust records. You've got a whole bunch of people who are rightly so sensitive to this.' Besides the handwritten notes from McVeigh, the defense case files include reports of investigations, news stories, photos, recordings and trial exhibits. In 2001, Jones published a book suggesting McVeigh and Nichols could not have been alone in carrying out the bombing, . McVeigh denied any knowledge of another collaborator, or presence of an accomplice who became known in the case as John Doe No. 2. But the polygraph examiner, Tim Domgard, wrote there were 'indications of deception' in McVeigh's responses related to questions about others involved. McVeigh provided a first-person account of the bombing during two days of interviews with Jones in September 1995.

A hurt woman holds a child following the blast that  killed 168 people, including 19 children, and injured more . Federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and FBI agents survey the damage to the Alfred Murrah building . He talked of lighting the fuse in a rental truck filled with explosive fertilizer, parking it at the building, throwing the key behind the seat, then walking away and trying not to look conspicuous, even after the blast hit. He told Jones that he didn't have the resources to conduct a 'solo war' and was convinced he 'could have gotten away clean from this and continued on if I had anywhere to go.' 'I determined that the best way would be to continue on as the Paul Revere type messenger instead of the John Brown type revolutionary, that you could accomplish maybe two in one,' McVeigh said. In the polygraph interview, McVeigh said when he was pulled over by an Oklahoma highway trooper shortly after the bombing for not displaying a license plate on his car, he had 'several opportunities to kill the trooper, however, did not because he was a state official and not a federal official.' Asked about events leading up to the bombing, McVeigh said 'action had to be taken' after the 1994 passage of the assault weapons ban, but said he wasn't certain at that time exactly what kind of action would be appropriate. In other notes, he also points to the outcome of the Branch Davidian siege near Waco as an influence.

The files have numerous references to media coverage and McVeigh's sense that Jones was too cozy with reporters and TV producers. McVeigh complained to Jones in 1995 that he was granting so many television and newspaper interviews, 'I am afraid you are becoming addicted to the `media bug.' Jones responded: 'If you want to keep the media on your side, they must be fed.' In one note to Jones marked 'Personal,' McVeigh told him if anyone ever approached him 'to `lean' on you to `throw' my case, please confide in me.' 'I am a realist, and I know our government,' he added. 'TDC - threat, duress, or coercion - is a standard. Money or muscle can influence all but the most ideological.' In the interview with Jones detailing the bombing and his arrest, he recalled how someone at the jail watching television coverage of the bombing investigation told him he resembled a composite photo of a suspect being sought. Then a court appearance for his arrest for carrying a concealed gun and knife during the traffic stop, he noticed increased police activity around the courthouse where he was held. After his bond was set at $5,000, a woman in an adjacent cell told him: 'They think you're the bomber.' 'And I said, `No way.' And then here is where it becomes a blur, Stephen,' McVeigh told Jones.","Almost 1 million pages of documents donated by bomber's lead attorney .

"A heartbroken father told yesterday how his daughter had been given hard drugs by dealers targeting schools. In an emotional open letter, he told how the ‘bright and beautiful’ GCSE pupil started using a cocktail of banned substances including cocaine, ecstasy, methadone and ‘party drug’ meow meow. The father – identified only as John to protect his family’s privacy – warned that Class A drugs were widely available to children, and urged schools and police to get tough. He said dealers made the drugs ‘incredibly cheap and available’ to hook their young customers. A father has revealed that his teenage daughter became hooked on cocaine and ecstasy after buying the drugs in the school playground (file pic posed by a model) His daughter was given them for free or paid only a few pounds for pills, sometimes without knowing what she was taking. She had not only put her health in danger but risked sexual abuse by meeting up with men she did not know. The father has sent the open letter to his local council, South Gloucestershire, pleading for action to combat a ‘serious drug problem’. The man described himself as a single parent to a son and daughter – referred to as Jack and Jill – who both went to a local secondary. ‘Two weeks ago I discovered that Jill had been taking Class A drugs for three to four months,’ he said. ‘How dumb am I not to know? But do you know the signs as a parent?’ The father said he had initially dismissed changes in his daughter’s behaviour as ‘teenage moodiness’. He has now written an open letter (above) to his local authority, South Gloucestershire, begging them to take the issue more seriously asking if a young person has to die before the problem is addressed . But he told the Bristol Post: ‘She came to me and said she had got caught up with a group and started taking cocaine and ecstasy. ‘I had noticed she had been a bit off but I thought it was a teenage daughter rebelling against her dad … it just didn’t occur to me and I felt naïve and stupid.’ Horrified by his daughter’s revelations, the father said he went to her school and police but officers were ‘aggressive and threatening’ when his daughter volunteered information, including the names of alleged dealers. He accused authorities of ‘pretending a problem doesn’t exist’ and warned the situation would get worse if it was not tackled, adding: ‘Does a young person here have to die?’ The father said his own investigations had found evidence that illicit drugs were available inside schools and youth clubs. The father, only known as John, has called on South Gloucestershire Council to do more to tackle drug dealing in its schools . He told how he had limited his daughter’s use of her mobile phone and social media, apparently to stop her falling back into drug use. He said he hoped she had stopped before she became hooked. The father said his relationship with his daughter had hit ‘rock bottom’ over his attempts to protect her from lapsing back into drug abuse, saying: ‘She hates me now.’ But, in the absence of help from authorities, he said he now believed it was up to parents to try to ‘take control’ to help their children. The despairing father said he could not offer a ‘simple answer’ but said the problem of drug use would only get worse if it was ignored. South Gloucestershire council refused to comment and said it was a matter for police. Inspector Adrian Fallows, a neighbourhood police manager for South Gloucestershire, said: ‘We are working with schools to educate young people about drugs and also to deal firmly with any drugs issues that may arise. ‘The supply, production and use of drugs in our communities, and the acquisitive crimes associated with drugs, is a serious matter. ‘We will do whatever we can to protect young people by disrupting the system and bringing to justice anyone dealing drugs and profiting from crime.’","Father, only known as John, noticed his daughter was acting strangely .

"What are the chances of finding musical talent by randomly approaching people on the street? Brisbane based DJ-duo Mashed N Kutcher did just that when they offered a keyboard and microphone to members of the public and invited them to bash out a melody. The black-and-white clip has spread like wildfire, clocking up over 1.25 million views in under a week and gaining coverage on leading media outlets around the globe. The clip shows Adam and Matt, who choose not to give their full names, approach a busdriver and a 7-Eleven clerk to have a bash on the keys before going in search of a singer. It's then they happen upon a pleasant surprise. Brisbane based Singer Ross Bunbury offers his vocals to DJ-duo Mashed N Kutcher in a viral video . The duo hail down a jogger on the street and ask: ‘do you mind singing something real quick?’ ‘What do you want me to sing?' the panting jogger asks, to which they reply: ‘just make something up.’ The mystery runner then launches into a moving melody, seemingly leaving the DJs lost for words. ‘We were pretty shocked. We had been approaching people all afternoon, and suddenly we found someone who not only sings but is willing to bust out like that on the first try,’ Matt told Daily Mail Australia.' They later sampled the velvet vocals of the jogger, which they described as 'actually amazing,' into an electronic dance song. ‘As DJ’s we try to collaborate with as many people as we can, but it’s not always easy to link up with Black Eyed Peas or David Guetta, so we decided to hit the streets.’ The DJ's said they were shocked to find such an impressive talent on the street, and that it proves there is talent to be found beyond  artists featured on TV and radio . The duo approach the likes of a busdriver and 7-Eleven clerk and invite them to collaborate . Last month, the boys released a similar video which saw them order pizza and collaborate with the deliveryman. But the seemingly blasé response of the DJs in their latest clip has fuelled accusations that the video was staged. ‘People are entitled to their opinion,' Matt said. 'We always get a wide range of responses to our videos, and that’s fine. All we wanted to do was show you there is a talent everywhere, not just on the TV and radio,’ said Matt. The band has since received a flurry of requests to release a full version of the song, which they plan to do at a later date. ‘We’re pretty stoked at how much the video has taken off. It’s very exciting. Hopefully we can do something for the singer too, it would be amazing if he got signed!’ Last month, the boys released a similar video which saw them order Domino's pizza and collaborate with the deliveryman . The duo said they are 'stoked' with the success of the video and they hope it will help the singer they featured raise his profile . The jogger in the clip was later revealed as Ross Burbury (pictured,) a singer songwriter from Brisbane . The singer in the video, later revealed as Ross Burbury, is a singer songwriter from Brisbane who is also head of direct sales at News Corporation. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Burbury for comment but he was unavailable at the time of publication. Mashed N Kutcher, who formed in 2013, have built a strong following from their mashups and energetic live shows. Their first single Do It Now charted in the national Top 30 on iTunes and was the number one trending track in Brisbane on popular music app Shazam.

"It was supposed to be the place where Stephanie Scott was to spend the happiest day of her life, instead her wedding venue seemed like the loneliest place on the planet. A guest list of 120 people had been invited to Stephanie and her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley's wedding at the picturesque Eat Your Greens venue 2km outside the tiny town of Eugowra, in New South Wales' central west region. These same guests were now 275km and three hours' drive away after attending a heart-breaking ceremony at Mountford Park in Leeton, as Stephanie's family and friends honoured the 26-year-old teacher's memory. The popular high school teacher was last seen on Easter Sunday, which sparked a widespread search until police found the remains of a body at a national park on Friday - the day before Ms Scott's big day.

The couple's wedding venue is 2km outside the tiny town of Eugowra, in New South Wales' central west region . But on Saturday, the wedding venue was locked up and deserted as guests instead paid tribute to Ms Scott at her memorial service which was held 275km and three hours' drive away from Eat Your Greens .

The planned wedding venue was locked up and the car park was empty and silent, with only the sound of crickets and toads in the nearby countryside. The grounds surrounding the premises were immaculate, and in the middle there was a hallway of trees that looked like an aisle. You could imagine guests chatting happily around the grounds.

'Generally the place is lively with people enjoying themselves on a Saturday night. There's always something going on there. I was wondering why it was so quiet,' one neighbour said . Tributes to Ms Scott were left at the gates of her wedding venue. Her big day was supposed to take place on Saturday . But it was pointless to think of what could have been - where there should have been laughter there was now only an eerie stillness. It was a haunting place, and one that a neighbour - who asked not to be named - had not seen the like of for a while.

The popular high school teacher was honoured with cards, flowers, balloons, candles, and pictures as students from the school, along with friends, family, and strangers visited to remember the 26-year-old. Many of Ms Scott's friends and family had travelled from interstate and overseas for the wedding, but stayed for the memorial instead, in the wake of the news that police had discovered a body on Friday night they believed to be that of the 26-year-old. Detective Superintendent Michael Rowan, local area commander at Griffith, said that the body found just metres from the road in Cocoparra National Park, in the Riverina region of NSW, had been burned. The remains of the body have been taken to Glebe infirmary for further forensics. Police also said that a gasoline can had been found at the site.

"Campaign: Amanda Burleigh has won her battle . A midwife has won a decade-long battle to give mothers more time attached to their newborns before the umbilical cord is cut. Amanda Burleigh was convinced that clamping the cord within seconds of delivery – shutting off the blood supply from the placenta – was wrong. Since the 1950s, when doctors and midwives started giving women a hormonal injection to reduce the risk of haemorrhage, they have clamped the cord within seconds of birth. They feared the drug – since replaced with a safer substitute – could harm the baby. But Ms Burleigh, a midwife at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, believed it was unnatural to clamp the cord when it was still visibly pulsating with blood. She said: ‘One day I had a brainwave and thought, “We all clamp the cord within seconds of the baby being born, but we are doing it without any evidence about whether it’s good or bad for the baby.”' She contacted other medics, including obstetrician Dr David Hutchon, and together the group amassed evidence that stopping the blood flow so early could be harmful. One study showed immediate cord-clamping could deprive a baby of a third of its blood stock – enough to fill a medium-size wine glass. In particular, they found the practice raised the risk of iron deficiency anaemia. A tenth of all toddlers are anaemic, which is linked to delays in learning, speaking and understanding. There is also growing evidence that immediate cord-clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies. They have finally succeeded in getting the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to change its guidelines. NICE now states that doctors and midwives should not routinely clamp the cord ‘earlier than one minute from the birth of the baby’. The cord should be clamped within five minutes, but left longer if the mother requests. Besides the medical benefits, the change means mothers get the chance to hold their babies for a moment while still connected to them. Ms Burleigh, a midwife for 26 years, said she had to overcome persistent doubts from colleagues, who asked who she was to query medical protocol. ‘There was quite a lot of resistance from both doctors and midwives,’ she said. ‘At times I felt like a whistleblower.’ There is also growing evidence that immediate cord-clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies . However, she said she felt a ‘moral duty’ to challenge a practice that was not grounded in evidence. Dr Hutchon, now retired, said hospitals had blindly clamped and cut within seconds of birth for decades. He said: ‘We didn’t notice we were doing any harm because we were doing it to every baby.’ He became interested in 2003 after hearing that more premature babies survived when the cord was not cut early. But he said there was ‘continual resistance to change’ – with some doctors refusing delayed cord-clamping even today. Some still believed the theory that immediate clamping reduced the risk of mothers haemorrhaging, Dr Hutchon said, even though a 2013 study found it made no difference. Ms Burleigh, recently named Midwife of the Year by the British Journal Of Midwifery, added: ‘In 20 or 30 years I think we will look back on immediate cord-clamping and think, “What were we doing? We dropped an absolute clanger.""' A spokesman for NICE said that its advice on care during childbirth was reviewed ‘at regular intervals’.","Amanda Burleigh was convinced clamping cord immediately was wrong .

"When Chelsea Clinton became the first daughter of the United States of America, she was just a twelve-year-old from Arkansas with a full head of voluminous frizzy curls. But over the years, as Chelsea has grown up into an intelligent and elegant woman, her curls quickly began to fade, appearing more and more controlled as the years wore on, before eventually vanishing completely. Now, in a candid interview with Elle magazine, Chelsea has finally revealed just what happened to her much-loved ringlets – insisting that, far from being an intentional style change, her once-unruly mane simply straightened itself out over time. Scroll down for video . All grown up: In the latest issue of Elle, Chelsea Clinton finally reveals to the world just what happened to her once-curly hair . Mystery solved: Chelsea's famous curls (pictured left in 1998) went from unmanageable frizz to tight ringlets, before fading into a fuller, wavier style (pictured right, in 2015) When asked by the magazine about what became of her 'pre-Raphaelite curls', Chelsea revealed: 'I don't actually have curly hair anymore.' 'My curls, in my early twenties, just fell into waves. I don't know if they got tired of me, but the curls slowly subsided, and so now it's naturally a little bit wavy but... I miss my curls. The 35-year-old daughter of Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States, also talked about her marriage to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in the new interview, as well as her role as a mother to her baby daughter Charlotte. Quite a change: Chelsea, pictured here at age 11 just a few months before her father Bill was elected president, was often the victim of bullying remarks over her unruly hair . Hillary's girl: Elle Editor-in-Chief Robbie Myers describes Chelsea as being 'innately regal' with 'a kind of grace that doesn't seem practiced' Visit site . We've watched her grow up in the White House to become a woman who commands much commending through her fiercely intelligent and graceful character.  Chelsea Clinton may be the first daughter again and she shows off her sleek grown up look on the cover of Elle Magazine in a Gucci dress from the spring 2015 collection. She's now a mother herself and dresses appropriately for her age in a chic little black dress.  The carefully placed cut out and luxurious fabric show off her enviable figure.  The simple slim line belt really highlights that and we love the minimalist styling.  This makes us focus on the woman in front of us.

'I'm curious if Charlotte's going to have curly hair,' she told the magazine, adding that the scrutiny on little Charlotte's locks will 'inevitably' match her own growing up. 'I should apologize to her now,' she added. Chelsea noted that seven-month-old Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, who was born on September 26, has now become the center of her and her husband's life 'in the most blessed sense'. She said: 'I now understand - this is something else that Marc and I talk about all the time - all of the enthusiastic, bombastically spectacular, wonderful things people say about their children, because we also feel and think all those things about Charlotte - that she is just the most remarkable little bubbly, perfect, chunky monkey creature ever.' What a difference a decade makes: Chelsea in 2004 (L) and 2014 (R) showing off the naturally changing state of her locks . Still springy: At only 13-years-old Chelsea had already tamed most of her frizz, but rocked a tightly curled look for most of the years of her father's presidency . Despite her glamorous look in this month's Elle fashion spread, Chelsea confessed that fashion is not her forte. The former White House resident spoke of her family's relationship with designer Oscar de la Renta, who passed away in October, saying he 'was always giving me fashion advice - often in the form of just telling me what to wear, because I don't have a fashion brain'. Although shying away from making a direct comment on her mother's run for president and her own potential return to the role of first daughter, Chelsea did comment at length on the need for women in politics and gender equality in the workplace. 'We've made real progress on legal protections for women, but in no way are women at parity to men in our country in the workplace,' she explained. 'And if we look in the political sphere, it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of Congress is treated as a real success. Since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality? 'And so when you ask about the importance of having a woman president, absolutely it's important, for, yes, symbolic reasons—symbols are important; it is important who and what we choose to elevate, and to celebrate.'

"Gruesome death rituals performed 1,200 years ago have been uncovered in dozens of tombs in Peru's Cotahuasi Valley. Each tomb was filled with bones of up to 60 mummies, with infants kept in small containers, and others repeatedly ripped to pieces while decomposing. Archaeologists have so far opened up seven of the tombs, recovering 171 broken mummies from the ancient ceremonial site known as Tenahaha. Gruesome death rituals performed 1,200 years ago have been uncovered in dozens of tombs in Peru's Cotahuasi Valley. Pictured is the burial of a young woman found in the middle of one of the tombs. Analysis of her skeletal remains reveal that she suffered dental problems, including the loss of teeth . 'When we think of the dead, we bury the relative and that's it,' Justin Jennings, a curator at Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum told DailyMail.com. 'But back then, in the Andes, you continued to interact with those folks. People were moving bodies around all the time.' The mummies in the tombs ranged in age from several days old to the elderly. But over the years rats had eaten away many of the remains, leaving only fragments. In one tomb, researchers discovered 400 isolated human body parts, including teeth, hands and feet. The few mummies that remained intact were bound by rope and placed in a foetal position. The mummies in the tombs ranged in age from several days old to the elderly. But over the years rats had eaten away at many of the remains. This image shows three vessels found by the feet of an individual. The mummies were buried with a variety of items including some beautifally decorated ceramic, pictured . Pictured is the partial skull of an individual found in one of the seven opened tombs. The dead, numbering in the low thousands, towered over the living from in their tombs high on the hills around the valley . 'On occasion, there were mummies that were placed as offerings around the outside of the tombs,' said Jennings. The Middle Horizon period (A.D. 600–1000) was a time of sweeping cultural change in the Andes. Archaeologists have long associated this period with the expansion of the Wari state in the south-central Andes and coastal area of modern-day Peru. Along with their expansion, came widespread violence. Skull fragments in some areas of their territory reveal that 50 per cent had dents in their heads caused by violent blows. Pottery in these areas were etched with drawings of fanged teeth and human trophy skulls. But Tenahaha was believed to have been a relatively peaceful area in Peru at that time. In Tenahaha, only one per cent of skulls had dents. The pottery at the site is also decorated with what looks like depictions of people smiling. Tenahaha may have served as a 'neutral ground' where people could bury their dead and feast. 'They were broken apart but then placed back together in an anatomically correct position.' Scientists are still trying to understand why some of the mummies and artefacts were broken up in this way. One theory is that the movement of the mummies may have helped create a sense of equality among the community. There is also evidence that the rituals went on for days at a time, with parties being held in the valley below the tombs. Jennings said that the dead, likely numbering in the low thousands, towered over the living from in their tombs high on the hills around the valley. 'It seems to be a place where people were bringing down their dead to that location,' said Jennings. 'They were having parties. There is evidence that they were making and drinking corn beer, and placing offerings underneath them.' But he adds that the picture remains blurry, as the rituals were performed over many years, and likely changed during that time. A study of pottery at the site suggests it was used between about A.D. 800 and A.D. 1000, with the Inca settling there 500 years later. Tenahaha was believed to have been a relatively peaceful area in Peru during those years. Pictured is a dismembered mummy. A tupu, which was an artifact that could have been used to fasten clothing, fell through this mummy’s rib cage when it was moved . Tenahaha appears to have been created as a place where people from nearby villages could feast. Parties, that lasted for several days at a time, were often held in the valley below the tombs. This image shows a storage area where food for feasting could have been kept . Pictured are some of the decorated cups found in the tombs. Human hands, lines, dots and happy faces can be seen. Pottery found in other parts of Peru had more gruesome images, largely due to a culture of violence . The wider area, however, was undergoing dramatic change, with populations growing, agriculture expanding and class differences emerging. At this time, the Wari was being established in the south-central Andes and coastal area of modern-day Peru. And with it came widespread violence. Skull fragments on the islands close by revealed that 50 per cent had dents in their heads caused by violent blows. Pottery in these areas were etched with drawings of fanged teeth and human trophy skulls. In Tenahaha, only one per cent of skulls had dents. The pottery at the site is also decorated with what looks like depictions of people smiling. Jennings believe Tenahaha may have served as a 'neutral ground' where people could bury their dead and feast. 'We have finished the excavations, and we're now trying to look at a different sites nearby during the same period to understand the relationship,' Jennings added. Cotahuasi Canyon near the city of Arequipa in Peru is the deepest canyon in the world, and a site of archaeological significance. The canyon is an impressive chasm that the river has eroded between two enormous mountain massifs: the Coropuna and the Sulimana . Scientists are still trying to understand reasons why some of the mummies and artefacts were broken up in this way. One theory is that the movement of the mummies may have helped create a sense of equality among the community.

"A property developer in a wealthy Connecticut suburb believes his family are the victims of small-town vengeance which saw his son demoted in the local Little League to punish him for threatening the town's overwhelmingly white ethnic makeup. Christopher Stefanoni, a 50-year-old from Darien, a town of 21,000 with a median household income of $200,000, says his nine-year old was kicked off his team and put in a lower-ranking one just after he proposed developments involving affordable housing. According to a lawsuit filed by Stefanoni, locals are so worried at the prospect of the town's black population - currently 70 people, or 0.33 per cent - getting any bigger that they hit back through the medium of baseball.

As well as his son being booted to a lesser team in the league, Stefanoni was also banned from coaching. The town and the Little League both deny that the goings-on of the Little League and Stefanoni's housing plans are linked. In court documents they describe his grievance as 'an imaginary slight that has no connection to reality'. U.S. Census information says that Darien is 94 per cent white, with 620 Hispanic residents and fewer than 100 blacks. Stefanoni said two proposals were rejected by town officials; a 16-apartment complex with five affordable units, and a 30-apartment one with nine affordable units. He said: 'Darien is a little white enclave, sort of a holdout segregated town. The attitudes that people in Darien have are very exclusionary, demeaning. 'When they go after your kids, they've crossed the line'. The town has previously been investigated by the Justice Department over a policy which gave affordable housing priority to people who already lived and worked in Darien. Swanky: This photograph shows Darien's downtown area, complete with picturesque New England architecture and expensive cars parked up in front of boutique stores . The policy was dropped before the investigation finished. The lawsuit and a federal housing investigation reopened old wounds in Darien. The town was made famous by the 1947 Oscar-winner Gentleman's Agreement, starring Gregory Peck, which depicted anti-Semitic residents conspiring not to sell property to Jews. Stefanoni and his wife, Margaret, filed the lawsuit in 2013 against the Darien Little League those who were in charge when their son was demoted, in fall 2010. The demotion came just days after Stefanoni filed an affordable housing application for property right next to the home of a former league official. Several months later, Stefanoni was banned from coaching in the league. Lawyers for the Little League deny the allegations and have filed a motion to have the suit dismissed. According to court documents, league officials say they made a mistake placing the Stefanoni's son on a higher-level team, after the housing application was filed, and corrected the error by moving him to another team. Sceptical: Deli owner Rob WIlliamson, pictured in front of his store, does not think the town is conspiring to keep out black people . In the application they wrote: 'Mr Stefanoni is pursuing a baseless litigation as a means to harass and retaliate against defendants for an imaginary slight that has no connection to reality or to the civil rights laws that he purports to vindicate.' Former Little League board members named in the lawsuit declined to comment. Stefanoni made a total of three affordable housing applications, one of which was ultimately approved. The lawsuit includes allegations about city officials blocking affordable housing applications to keep blacks from moving into town, claims identical to those in another pending federal lawsuit against the town by a different affordable housing developer whose project was rejected. The U.S. Department of Justice in 2010 began investigating whether the town was violating the Fair Housing Act with a zoning policy approved in 2009 that gave top priority for new affordable housing to Darien residents and other people with ties to the town, including town employees. The planning and zoning commission rescinded the policy later in 2010, and the Justice Department closed the investigation in 2012 without taking any action, the Darien Times reported. Unfortunate reputation: Darien was immortalized in 1947 by the likes of Gregory Peck in Gentleman's Agreement, which depicted townsfolk conspiring to keep out Jews by not selling them property . According to state data, 2.6 percent of Darien's nearly 7,100 housing units qualify as affordable. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy has called affordable housing one of the state's most pressing needs and has committed hundreds of millions of dollars for more affordable housing. In 2010, Darien won a four-year exemption to a state law making it easier for developers to build in towns with less than 10 percent affordable housing and town officials expect to win another after resolving a dispute with the state. The town says it is entitled to the exemption under a complicated formula involving existing affordable housing units. Darien First Selectman Jayme Stevenson said the town has made significant efforts to increase affordable housing and its housing practices aren't discriminatory. 'The Darien of today bears no resemblance to the allegations that the Stefanonis ... are intending to propagate,' she said. 'These folks are developers and they're looking to develop housing and make some money.' Rob Williamson, owner of Uncle's Deli in downtown Darien, said he doesn't believe the town is being discriminatory in rejecting affordable housing applications. 'The town's small, very tight knit,' the resident of nearby Stamford said. 'That doesn't mean we want to keep anyone out. It's a small, little New England town and I think they want to keep it that way.'","Christopher Stefanoni's son was pushed into low-ranking team in 2010 .

"A war hero pilot who survived almost 70 skirmishes with the Luftwaffe has died after being knocked down by a hit-and-run driver near his home. Doug Gregory, 92, had popped out for his daily newspaper when he was struck by a car outside a petrol station. The ex-Spitfire pilot suffered a serious head injury and was flown to hospital by air ambulance, but died two weeks later. A hero: Doug Gregory. 92, only retired from his job as a stunt pilot two years ago. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after surviving almost 70 missions over Nazi-occupied Europe . Fighter pilot: The 92-year-old had survived 70 missions against the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. He flew Beaufighters and Mosquitoes before testing  aircraft, including models of Spitfires and Hurricanes . Mr Gregory began flying during the Second World War and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his gallantry in 69 combat missions over Nazi-occupied Europe. Having volunteered for the Royal Air Force as early as he could, straight after his 18th birthday in 1941, Mr Gregory flew Beaufighters and Mosquitoes. He also tested a wide range of aircraft, including Spitfires and Hurricanes. A veteran of D-Day, the RAF’s Battle of Berlin bombing campaign and night sorties all over Europe, he recalled years later: ‘I wasn’t shot down but I was shot at. Luckily they missed – most of the time.’ Mr Gregory also survived a brain haemorrhage in 1947. He only retired from his role as a stunt pilot at the age of 90. Mr Gregory was performing loop-the-loops throughout his 80s – earning the nickname The Flying Zimmer – as a founder member of the Great War Display Team, a band of pilots determined to preserve the spirit and skills of Britain’s First World War dogfighter heroes. Knocked down: The war hero was making his daily trip to the shops and had just purchased a newspaper when he was struck. Officers are still investigating the collision but say no-one has been arrested or charged . Hit-and-run: Police at the scene where Mr Gregory was knocked down by a car. Officers say a female motorist driving a silver-coloured Nissan involved in the collision came forward and was interviewed under caution . The accident happened on March 30 just after he had bought a paper at his local newsagent’s in Blackfield, Hampshire. His wife and son accompanied him to Southampton General Hospital, where he died on Sunday. Police said a woman who was driving a silver-coloured Nissan involved in the accident later came forward and was interviewed under caution. A police spokesman said officers were still investigating the accident. He added that no one had been arrested or charged in connection with the collision. Last night tributes poured in. Military historian Paul Beaver tweeted: ‘Deep regret at passing of Doug Gregory, night intruder veteran & honorary member of Army Flying Association. Our thoughts with Liz & family.’ Another fan tweeted: ‘RIP Doug Gregory DFC a great former Mosquito and display pilot. Blue skies, Sir. Very sad news.’ Mr Gregory's love of flying continued after the war. He built a 1917-style bi-plane and joined the Great War Display Team, eventually becoming Britain's oldest stunt pilot until he decided to give up his role in 2013 . Teacher: After leaving the RAF in 1946 Mr Gregory (left) became an art teacher at two Hampshire schools. Police said no-one had been arrested or charged in connection with the collision in Blackfield (right) When he gave up his role as a stunt pilot in 2013 Mr Gregory insisted he would still continue to fly planes . Mr Gregory left the RAF in 1946 and spent the rest of his working life teaching art in a Hampshire comprehensive. But on his retirement, aged 60, he wanted to do something more than garden and play golf, so he used his £5,000 savings to spend four years building himself the 1917-style SE5A biplane that he flew in airshows. He joined the Great War Display Team, saying: ‘Flying has been my favourite thing all my life, especially aerobatics. I don’t do any other kind of sport. Flying is quite enough to keep me going.’ Determined to teach younger generations of the bravery of the First World War pilots, he said in 2007: ‘I am afraid that the public’s grasp of history today is pathetic. 'If we can help people understand a bit more about what happened in the Great War, then it has to be worthwhile.’ In 2010, Mr Gregory and some of his fellow pilots took part in a mock dogfight over the New Forest to celebrate the centenary of the former Royal Fying Corps airfield at East Boldre. He finally quit flying in 2013, saying of his beloved biplane: ‘I will miss it terribly, but it is difficult to get in and out of and very hard to start.’","Doug Gregory flew Beaufighters and Mosquitoes in the Second World War .

"Not all turtles can swim, said Florida wildlife officials this week after beachgoers tried to throw baby tortoises in the ocean. There were at least three reports of people trying to release gopher tortoises in the ocean because they were mistaken for sea turtles. ABC reports that while people were concerned that the tortoise hatchlings would get eaten by predators, tortoises are unable to swim like the sea turtle. Tortoise: Tortoises can't swim, said Florida Wildlife officials this week after people tried to throw baby tortoises in the ocean to protect them from beach predadtors . According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, all five species of sea turtle and the gopher turtle nest in the sand which is why some people may confuse  one with the other. It's important to know that you should never attempt to relocate gopher tortoise adults, juveniles or hatchlings if you happen to see one near a beach,' the commission said in statement on Friday. The commission also said that one can tell the difference between a sea turtle and a tortoise by looking at the animal's feet. Gopher tortoises have toes with claws on each toe and sea turtles have flippers with just one or two claws on each fore flipper. 'To distinguish gopher tortoises from sea turtles, simply inspect their limbs from a distance: Gopher tortoises have toes, with claws on each toe. Sea turtles have flippers with only one or two claws present on each fore flipper, ‘said the statement. ABC reports that gopher tortoises are protected by Florida law and sea turtles are on Florida's endangered species or threatened survival list. Whether people see a tortoise or sea turtle, they should not interfere with the animal's natural behavior unless they are a wildlife professional, said the commission. Sea turtles: Sea turtles are able to swim, but Florida Wildlife officials warn that people should not throw baby turtles in the ocean because they may be of a species that cannot swim .","Not all turtles can swim, said Florida wildlife officials this week after concerned beachgoers tried to throw baby tortoises in the ocean .

"Various types of renewable energy such as solar and wind are often touted as being the solution to the world’s growing energy crisis. But one researcher has come up with a novel idea that could trump them all - a biological solar panel that works around the clock. By harnessing the electrons generated by plants such as moss, he said he can create useful energy that could be used at home or elsewhere. A University of Cambridge scientist has revealed his green source of energy. By using just moss he is able to generate enough power to run a clock (shown). He said panels of plant material could power appliances in our homes. And the technology could help farmers grow crops where electricity is scarce . Dr Paolo Bombelli will present his research as part of the Pint of Science festival, which is running from 18 to 20 May in 50 cities across nine countries. His idea is relatively simple - by wiring up plants to an electro-chemical system, he is able to harness the waste electrons and energy produced during the photosynthesis process. And the results are surprisingly efficient. He demonstrated how a smartphone-sized block of moss could be used to power a digital clock. The Pint of Science festival is taking place from Monday 18 to Wednesday 20 May 2015. It sees scientists of various disciplines give talks in pubs around the world, with topics ranging from the brain to space, that the public can attend for £3 - the ‘price of a pint’. Dr Paolo Bombelli, with his moss-powered clock, is one of the scientists taking part. This year more than 600 science evenings will take place in 50 cities across nine countries. Cities in the UK include Bristol, London, Manchester and Southampton. A full schedule can be found on their website. An A4-sized area of leaves - about 93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day. Dr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the movie The Matrix. ‘In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,’ he explained. ‘And although it was a bit crude, the concept is actually correct. ‘But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans.’ The apparatus required is also relatively simple - cables, some water and a plant. At the moment, Dr Bombelli is trying to find a way to increase the ‘flux’ of electrons emitted by a plant, making more energy available. ‘If we can crack this, we can get a very large flux of electrons coming out, then we can build a biological solar panel,’ he told MailOnline. Dr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the 1999 movie The Matrix. ‘In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,’ he explained, shown in this image from the movie. 'But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans' An A4-sized area of leaves - about (93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day. The ultimate goal is to develop panels that generate five watts per square metre (11 square ft). By comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre . Dr Paolo Bombelli  presented his research at a preview  of the Pint of Science festival (left). He is adamant that regular moss (stock image right) could provide an additional source of renewable energy to complement others that are available . For example, he said people could have one of these panels on the roof of their house to power certain appliances in their home. The goal is to generate up to five watts per square metre (11 square feet). By comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre. The uses are not just in the home, though. Dr Bombelli said in regions where people don’t have access to energy, biological solar panels could be useful for tasks such as growing crops. People could be shown how to build the simple systems and, unlike solar panels which require technical expertise to fix, the biological solar panels can be fixed easily. ‘To assemble one is not too difficult,’ he explained. And to demonstrate just how useful the technology can be, Dr Bombelli is gearing up to deploy a plant-powered system in London Zoo. A trap camera powered by moss will be installed in the next four to eight weeks, and ultimately the same camera could be used to capture images of animals in the wild. Rice farming is one area Dr Bombelli sees his technology being useful. It could help power technology in areas where electricity is scarce, possibly increasing yields. Shown is a stock image of rice paddy fields in India, one region Dr Bombelli said his technology could be useful . He noted that there are limitations: the technology is not very mobile, and its power output is low compared to other renewable energies. Nonetheless he thinks it could be part of a ‘portfolio of renewable technology’ to generate electricity. ‘We don’t really think the world is going to be powered by this technology, but it could play a role,’ he said.","University of Cambridge scientist has revealed his green source of energy .

"This is the dramatic moment robbers who raided a cash and carry were arrested while running along a busy motorway after a dramatic chase which saw them ram two police cars. The gang of four were spotted trying to escape along the M42 after they held up a cash-and-carry in Derby on September 26 last year. The white Seat Leon they were travelling in was traced by a police helicopter and today dramatic footage has been released showing the car ramming two police vehicles as they tried to hide under a bridge. Scroll down for video . The gang of robbers attempted to flee on foot along a busy road in a dramatic police chase after holding up a cash and carry . The chase was captured on camera by a police helicopter, that had been following the gang as they tried to escape . Police eventually caught up with the men, arresting them. They have now been jailed at Birmingham Crown Court . The footage then shows the gang jumping out of their stolen vehicle when they realise they were boxed in and shows them fleeing along the busy A45 on foot. The robbers can then be seen running across the busy motorway slip road as police give chase. And they manage to grab one of the gang members who can be seen being pulled out of bushes and handcuffed on the floor by three officers. Officers then managed to arrested the four robbers but had to use CS spray when one of the men, John Gourlay, produced a baton and threatened police at the road side. While in custody, the gang were linked to a further 20 offences where thousands of pounds worth of cigarettes were stolen over a three week period. Earlier the gang of four were in a stolen Seat Leon and attempted to flee from police in the vehicle . The gang were unaware they were being followed by an unmarked police car and then stopped under a bridge . Eventually the Seat became boxed in by the police vehicles, with the gang attempting to ram the cars out of the way . The four men were charged with conspiracy to commit robbery in September last year and appeared at Birmingham Crown Court for trial last month. They were all convicted of the charge and three of the gang have now been sentenced to over 30 years in prison. Gourlay, 41, of no fixed address, was jailed for 13 years and three months whilst Anton Richards, 29, of Birmingham, was caged for 11 years. Charlie Johnson, 19, of Birmingham, was jailed for six years but the last member Kyran Rooney, 19, of Yardley, Birmingham will be sentenced on May 7. The court heard how the gang stole a series of cars from addresses in the West Midlands, Warwickshire and Shropshire. John Gourlay, left, has been sentenced to 13 years in prison, and Anton Richards, right, 11 years after the raid on the cash and carry . They used the vehicles as getaway cars in raids on cigarette delivery vans across the Midlands region between August 31 and September 26 last year. The robbers also targeted customers as they left cash and carries, having stocked up their cars with tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol. They were eventually caught when they were spotted travelling on the M42 towards Birmingham in the Seat Leon, which they had stolen from Droitwich in Worcestershire. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Kerri Buckley, of West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a detailed and complex inquiry into a series of raids on delivery vans and customers of cash and carries across the wider Midlands region. 'The cases were first linked when the gang began to target delivery vehicles belonging to one particular company, the series was then connected along with the thefts of the getaway cars and the robberies of shopkeepers going to stock up at cash and carries. 'The volume of offences in such a short space of time is quite shocking and the length of the sentences these men have received is a testament to that, while reflecting on just how organised this criminal network was.'","Police gave chase to a gang of robbers who had raided a cash and carry .

"A respected Women's Institute president has been convicted after raiding the bank account of her dying life-long friend. Kathleen Bailey, 70, a church elder and avid charity fundraiser, was given power of attorney over her terminally ill 87-year-old friend's finances. Bailey later became a carer for her victim, who was battling breast cancer and had no children. But the grandmother, from Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester, helped herself to at least £1,500 and used the money to finance trips to north Wales. Kathleen Bailey (pictured) was given a suspended jail sentence after admitting stealing from her dying friend's bank account . She was handed a 12-month suspended jail sentence after admitting a charge of theft at Bolton Crown Court. She was also ordered to pay £1,500 to her victim's estate. The court heard her victim had persuaded Bailey to take power of attorney, giving her control of the sick friend's financial affairs. She had used the power properly at first to ensure her friend was looked after in a care home in Bury and enjoyed days out. But she then 'overstepped the mark', according to the prosecution, when she helped herself to cash from her friend's account. Officials at NatWest bank in Ramsbottom suspended the account when they noticed increasingly large sums of money being withdrawn from October 2012. Over a three-month period, £800, £880 and £1,100 was taken out in successive transactions. The police arrested Bailey at her home in Ramsbottom - and her victim died eight weeks later. Before her death, she told officers she had been happy for her friend to treat herself, the court heard. Colin Buckle, defending, said the pair had been life-long friends and that Bailey had become her elderly friend's carer, and had also taken her away on holidays as well as carrying out daily chores. The defendant 'still misses her friend', he said. She was handed a suspended jail sentence after admitting a charge of theft at Bolton Crown Court (pictured) But the prosecution said Bailey 'overstepped the mark' and took at least £1,500 for herself although the exact figure was not known. 'When she found out her friend of 70 years had betrayed her trust she was devastated.' After the hearing, a member of the victim's family - who believe Bailey stole as much as £10,000 - said: 'I am absolutely shocked and appalled how anybody could do this to such a caring, loving lady, especially when she was in such poor health, fighting terminal cancer. 'When she found out that Kathleen Bailey had betrayed her trust and stolen her savings which were paying for her nursing care, she was devastated. 'She told me it wasn't just the money, it was the fact that her best friend of 70 years and whom she relied on in her ill health had betrayed her trust. 'She had been such a strong lady, but her confidence was so severely knocked that within a few weeks, she had lost her 12-year battle with cancer.' A friend blasted Bailey's 'shameless crime', adding: 'The money that the victim had was being used to pay for her care. She thought at first that it had all gone. 'She was devastated by the breach of trust. They were close friends for years and she treated her as a daughter. It's an awful thing to do to a dying woman. She was a lovely women who was very generous.' Bailey's solicitor Helen Vaughan added: 'I have absolutely no doubt Kathleen Bailey intended no harm or wrong towards her friend.' Bailey was president of the Shuttleworth-in-Ramsbottom Women's Institute and a well-known church elder at Dundee United Reformed Church. She was also involved in a number of charities and organisations, including Ramsbottom Fire Cadets.","Kathleen Bailey, 70, was given power of attorney over friend's finances .

The guest noted they heard five shots, followed by a pause, which was followed by three more shots before hearing silence. They also stated they had seen a hole in the glass on the outside of the building, which Schock said he went to investigate. 'I seen a two-inch opening through the glass pane,' said Schock.

"At least 15 Fortune 500 companies, many of them worth north of a $1 billion, paid zero income taxes in 2014, says a report out last week from the Citizens for Tax Justice. According to the report, household names like CBS, General Electric and Mattel all successfully manipulated the U.S. tax code to avoid paying taxes on their massive profits. Even more shocking: some of them even received tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions. Avoidance: Fifteen Fortune 500 companies managed to get through 2014 without owing a penny in income taxes. What's more, most of those 15 were actually given federal tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions . CBS made $1.8 billion in U.S. profits last year and received a $235 million tax rebate . To put this harsh reality into perspective, imagine you're a taxpayer logged on to a tax site in your struggle to determine what you owe Uncle Sam. You pay upwards of $100 every month for the internet you're using and could well owe thousands in income tax. But if your monthly internet payment goes to Time Warner, guess what they'll be paying this year. That's right: zero dollars. In a way, you may have paid them. Again. The frequently maligned cable company made over $4 billion in U.S. profit last year and subsequently received tax rebates totaling $26 million. And, as Fast Company notes, it's all perfectly legal. One method used by these companies is called accelerated depreciation, which means the tax value of an asset may be claimed in the first years of the purchase rather than over time. Another method of tax avoidance is active financing. Put simply, this means a company classifies a taxable activity as foreign financing, putting it out of reach of the IRS. With corporate giants like Pepco, Prudential and Xerox all successfully avoiding paying income tax, Citizens for Tax Justice says American taxpayers and the U.S. government need to wake up and amend the tax code. The report's authors write: . 'As Congress focuses on strategies for revamping the U.S. corporate income tax, a sensible starting point should be to critically assess the costs of each of these tax breaks and to take steps to ensure that profitable corporations pay their fair share of U.S. taxes.' Fair? Citizens for Tax Justice wants changes to the corporate tax code and released a report last week that lists the Fortune 500 corporations that managed to squeak by in 2014 without paying a dime in income tax . Jetblue, PG&E, PEPCO Holdings and Ryder used accelerated depreciation, a tax break that allows companies to write off the cost of their capital investments much faster than these investments wear out, to dramatically reduce their tax rates . Priceline relied heavily on a single tax break — writing off the value of executive stock options for tax purposes — to zero out its tax liability not just in 2014 but in 2013, 2012 and 2011 as well. In addition, the company admits that this tax break could offset all taxes on up to $1.2 billion in profits going forward. Mattel also reports enjoying $140 million in stock option tax breaks over the past five years. Qualcomm has enjoyed more than $290 million in research and development tax breaks over the past three years. The R&E tax credit has been criticized for rewarding companies for “research” they would have done anyway, as well as rewarding research in areas such as fast-food packaging. General Electric uses the active financing tax break as one of many ways that it eliminates its U.S. income tax bill. This arcane tax break allows some multinational financial institutions to avoid paying income taxes to any government on their international financing activities.

"Polls yesterday suggested the election will be too close to call – with the Tories narrowly ahead in two, while another showed Labour edging in front. The news came as an American pollster – who predicted the results of the 2008 US presidential election almost exactly – concluded that both main parties will struggle to cobble together any kind of workable majority. The latest ICM poll for the Guardian had the Tories ahead on 34 per cent – down five points from a week ago. Labour were down one point on 32 per cent. Nate Silver, who correctly predicted the winner in 49 of 50 US states in 2008, believes that neither Labour or the Tories will be unable to get enough support together for a majority government . Meanwhile a new Populus poll found Labour unchanged on 34 per cent, while the Tories were down one, on 32 per cent. In a third poll, Lord Ashcroft found a Tory lead of four points – with the party on 34 per cent compared to Labour's 30 per cent. Pollster Nate Silver, who correctly called the winner in 49 of 50 US states in 2008, yesterday predicted a hung parliament after May 7 with the Tories winning 283 seats and Labour 274. This means that both David Cameron and Ed Miliband could find it almost impossible to secure enough support from other parties for a working majority – let alone rule on their own. Paddy Power said Mr Miliband is now more likely than Mr Cameron to be prime minister after the election . Mr Silver said Labour, who have ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP, would also be short of a majority even with the help of the Scottish Nationalists, whom he expects to gain 42 seats . Mr Silver said that even if the Tories join forces with the Lib Dems – who he believes will win 27 seats – they would still be 13 short of the 323 MPs needed for a majority. With Ukip expected to have only one MP in the projection, Nigel Farage would not be able to offer much help – and even with the support of eight Democratic Unionist Party MPs from Northern Ireland, Mr Cameron could not achieve a majority. Mr Silver said Labour, which has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP, would also be short of a majority even with the help of the Scottish Nationalists, who he predicted will gain 42 seats. That would give Mr Miliband 316 seats – seven short of a majority. He would then have to try to gain support from smaller parties such as Plaid Cymru, the Greens and Northern Ireland's SDLP – but as they are projected to win only six seats between them, Labour would still be one short of the necessary 323.","Nate Silver predicts the Conservatives will win 283 seats and Labour 274 .

"The wife of a man who was stabbed to death in a frenzied attack has revealed she is too terrified to leave home 'in case she gets a knife in the back'. Clare Else's husband Andrew was knifed more than 200 times by paranoid schizophrenic Ephraim Norman, 24, after getting off a bus close to his home in Croydon, south London, in April last year. The 52-year-old had been at the pub with friends earlier that night before the stranger pounced on him and launched an unprovoked attack, which was only stopped when police dragged him off. Clare Else (right) has been scared to leave her home since her husband Andrew (left) was stabbed to death by a paranoid schizophrenic as he got off a bus in Croydon, south London, last year . Norman had stopped taking medication for his illness because it interfered with his sex life and had heard voices in his head commanding him to kill, the Old Bailey was told. Mrs Else, 52, explained in her first full interview since the estate agent's murder that she has been left too scared to leave the house. She said: 'Andrew must have got off that bus and felt safe. He was literally a minute walk from the front door. 'Why would this person do this to him? Our lives have been turned upside down. Every time I walk in the front door I think am I going to get a knife in my back?'. Andrew Else had been at the pub with friends on the night of his murder on April 24, last year . The mother-of-one was woken by a team of police knocking on her door at 12.30am on April 24, last year. 'At first, I thought it was Andrew and that maybe he'd forgotten his keys,' she said. 'I saw torches shining outside and realised it wasn't him.' 'I threw the door open and obviously it was the police. I asked if he'd been mugged, or arrested for being drunk, but even that didn't make sense because he wasn't like that. 'He was so friendly and sociable. He wasn't the type to get into drunken arguments. 'They told me they couldn't say anything until a detective got there, and that's when I knew he'd been murdered. 'I was a rabbit in the headlights. It is almost like you shut down and go through the motions.' After the attack she fled to a family member's home, while officers took Norman into custody to question him where he admitted to a similar unprovoked attack just weeks earlier, on April 6. Armed with a knife, he had launched himself at a teenage boy, stabbing him with such ferocity that the blade went straight through the base of his neck. Miraculously, the boy survived, but a chilling X-ray shows that the knife just missed his spinal column. A post-mortem examination on April 25 counted more than 200 stab wounds on Mr Else's body and it was noted that there were no defensive wounds to his arms or hands. 'That first blow would have taken Andrew down to his knees,' Mrs Else said. 'Apparently as he turned round and said, ""Why are you doing this to me?"" Ephraim just carried on.' Mr Else (left, with his wife and their two dogs) was stabbed more than 200 times by Ephraim Norman, who had stopped taking medication to treat his paranoid schizophrenia . Mrs Else (right) said she thought her husband couldn't find his keys when she heard banging on the door at 12.30am on that night last year . Mr Else is said to have asked Norman what he was doing but he carried on his unprovoked attack for minutes . Two men who had been driving past at the time of the killing saw Mr Else lying on a grass verge with Norman crouched over him, knife raised above his head. Too terrified to intervene, they pulled over and phoned police, staying on the line until officers arrived. During Norman's trial in February 2015, Alan Kent QC, prosecuting, said he was seemingly aware that his senseless attack was being witnessed. 'He looked up occasionally and saw that he was being observed,' Mr Kent said. 'It didn't stop him from stabbing Mr Else. He continued even after police arrived. Mrs Else, pictured with Andrew on their wedding day, said Norman released a statement claiming to have 'no remorse or no sorrow for what he's done to Andrew and the family' She says her life has been 'turned upside down' since the death of her 'friendly and sociable' husband (pictured together on holiday, left and right) The trial at London's Old Bailey also heard that Norman had stopped taking anti-psychotic medication as it 'made it difficult for him to maintain an erection.' 'He wanted to have sex with a girl or girlfriends but it wasn't possible so he stopped taking the medication,' Mr Kent said. Norman pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder and one count of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, saying he'd been in the throes of a psychotic episode when he murdered Mr Else. The X-ray of a teenage boy who survived another unprovoked attack by Norman . 'It is just my madness, it is just like how my mind is,' he said. 'I know I could do that again. It is not a big thing for me to do. I wanted him to die so much I just kept on stabbing him until he was dead.' Mrs Else said Norman released a statement claiming to have 'no remorse or no sorrow for what he's done to Andrew and the family'. Norman, of Croydon, south London, is now being detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act. Meanwhile, two police sergeants connected to the case have faced allegations of misconduct after claims they failed to respond to the stabbing, despite being less than a mile away. The pair were reported to the Metropolitan Police's Directorate of Professional Standards for allegedly preventing officers under their command from attending the scene. Instead, officers from Lewisham, 10 miles away, dealt with the attack. Though the pair remain on restricted duties, they will not face prosecution and it is not yet clear whether they will face a police disciplinary process .","Andrew Else was knifed by Ephraim Norman after getting off bus last year .

"Tom O'Carroll, a leading member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (above), has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off . A leading member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s, has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off. Tom O’Carroll, a former Open University information officer and formerly a key activist for PIE, attended a Hacked Off rally in the Houses of Parliament on February 25 to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation. The organisation, set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, is campaigning against what it sees as the ‘biased and unfair’ Independent Press Standards Organisation. It wants MPs to set up a statutory body to regulate the press, as recommended by the Leveson Inquiry. The news that O’Carroll is a backer of Hacked Off will be an embarrassment to the group. PIE was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL). The NCCL lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child 'understood the nature of the act' and apparently consented. The group also wanted incest to be legalised. O'Carroll was on the NCCL's gay rights sub-committee. The 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ‘corrupting public morals’. He wrote a blog after the February meeting, chaired by comedian John Cleese, confirming his attendance. A Hacked Off spokesman said that the meeting was ‘open to and free for all members of the public to attend’.

"This was the moment a woman frantically struggled to stay afloat after tumbling from a punt in Cambridge. And the terror etched on her face is very real, because she cannot swim. The woman, who was with three friends, is believed to have lost her footing and fallen from the deck after her punt hit another boat. She disappeared under the waters of the Cam several times, screaming for help each time she resurfaced. Two of her friends leapt in to save her and staff at a punt hire operator manoeuvred one of their craft alongside to help pull her out. Scroll down for video .

The tourist, who was standing up on the punt ferrying three friends, is believed to have fallen into the freezing water after her vessel hit another boat in the university city . She was bundled into her rescuers’ punt by her friends and could be seen holding her head in her hands. An onlooker to Saturday’s drama said: ‘I heard a splash and a cheer went up, which is what normally happens when someone falls in. A woman was flapping about and two people in the punt jumped in and grabbed her. ‘It took them about 15 to 30 seconds to get to her and the whole thing only lasted a minute but she did go under a few times. It wasn’t nice to watch. For someone who can’t swim to be standing on a slippery punt is just bonkers. ‘The Cam is at least six to seven feet deep in places. Everyone involved was in shock and shaking afterwards.’ Meanwhile, Britons were  given their first taste of spring with temperatures reaching nearly 21C - marking the hottest day of the year so far.

Photos emerged of him representing the council at an event on the famous battle ship, 323 miles from his patch. Following a disciplinary hearing the Mayor of Hartlepool was dismissed from his care manager role with Newcastle City Council for gross misconduct.

A spokesman for Newcastle City Council said: 'Stephen Akers-Belcher's allegations were treated with the utmost seriousness. 'We contacted the police and called in an independent expert to investigate his claims. 'The police investigated and took no action, and following a comprehensive investigation, the council is satisfied that the level of service it provides is very good.

'When we asked him to provide evidence to show that he was at a funeral he failed to do so and subsequently failed to provide any evidence to the employment tribunal. 'He was not dismissed because of whistle blowing, and his first allegations were made after the council started its investigation into his conduct. 'Sufficient information to investigate the allegations was only provided by him three months later - after he was dismissed for gross misconduct.

"A vicious swan known for terrorising punters and kayakers on the River Cam is now believed to have a grandson following in his footsteps. The savage swan nicknamed Asbaby, which still has many brown baby feathers, has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the Cambridge river. Mr Asbo, the swan believed to be his grandfather, was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers. Scroll down for video . Watch out: Savage swan Asbaby has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the river in Cambridge over the Easter weekend . Up close: One resident who lives near the river said Asbaby 'sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers' Theft: Asbaby was seen attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag (above) Capturing the moment: Asbaby (pictured) is believed to be the grandson of Mr Asbo, who was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 . Pecking at the punters: The swan on the River Cam is said to be even more vicious than his father, Asboy, and grandfather, Asbo . Asbaby was seen at the weekend attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag. He is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather, and his father Asboy, who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer. Harry Crossell, 65, who lives near the river, said: ‘He is even more vicious than his father and grandfather. '(He) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers. I’ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics. 'Once I even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne. ‘It’s terrifying for river users and it’s making people think twice about going out on the water.’ Another resident, Simon Patterson, 52, said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour would get worse as he gets older. ‘The swan is only young at the moment, we’re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger,’ he said. Shock: The swan got up close with this woman, whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen (right) Making an appearance: The juvenile swan nicknamed Asbaby got far too close for comfort to tourists on the Cam over the Easter weekend . Naughty swan: One resident said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour on the River Cam would get worse as he gets older . ‘He swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way. We thought Mr Asbo and Asboy were bad, but this swan is even worse. ‘It’s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now, if he continues someone could get really hurt.’ But Colin Sparkes, navigation officer for Conservators of the River Cam, told MailOnline today: ‘Most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year. ‘It's mating season - they protect their territory. As far as I’m aware, it's not causing great problems on the river. ‘Swans this time of year start to look out for their nest, and indeed when the young and born. ‘It’s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans, the more aggressive they tend to become. Close to the camera: Asbaby 'swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way', according to one local resident . Worrying: Asbaby's actions are said to be 'terrifying for river users' and are 'making people think twice about going out on the water' Threatening: The behaviour of Mr Asbo (above) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises . No longer there: The Cam Conservators moved Mr Asbo about 60 miles away in 2012. His son Asboy is seen above in this file photograph . 'They get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed.’ He confirmed that there are no plans to remove Asbaby from the river, adding that the case of Mr Asbo was completely different. Mr Sparkes said: ‘That swan (Mr Asbo) was extremely aggressive - it's the most aggressive swan I've ever come across. ‘I believe that was probably down to the way he'd been brought up looking for food from various people.’ The Conservators moved Mr Asbo away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students. It has previously been reported how Asboy was seen attacking punters, birds and even a cow. He also injured a canoeist and a swimmer.","Savage swan nicknamed Asbaby attacked punters on The Backs area of River Cam in Cambridge over Easter .

"'Secret stuff': Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is a part therapist and part acting coach, known as the 'celebrity whisperer' She is known as the 'celebrity whisperer', a woman whose astonishing skill in honing Hollywood talent made an icon out of a man who used to stand on street corners dressed as a chicken. Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyoncé Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her £3 million home. Beyoncé went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyoncé was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview – one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyoncé is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyoncé's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record – it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below). We'll be donning Mango's layered mini dress with a leather biker jacket to see out the summer in style. Mango Chiffon Ruffle Dress . Visit site . Boohoo Laura Curve Column Dress . Visit site . Bec & Bridge Isis Angle Dress (now on sale for $178!) at Revolve . Visit site . Carven Crêpe de Chine Dress at Barneys . Visit site . So what did that amount to? Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity – what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful… it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible – I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window. I'm about stripping them bare. The one thing I have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings. 'It doesn't matter if you are in London or the Philippines. There's a shared human story – we all want love, we all have issues with our spouses or partners, with our parents. The key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim. 'You have to use that stuff to empower yourself.'","Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is known as the 'celebrity whisperer' and hones talent .

"The runner who won the Boston Marathon in 2013 and donated his medal to the city after the deadly terrorist bombings has been crowned this year's men's winner. Lelisa Desisa, 25, of Ethiopia won with an unofficial time of 2 hours, 9 minutes, 17 seconds and beat his previous winning time by more than a minute on a day when security was on high alert for potential threats to competition's 119th race. Thirty-thousand runners cruised through a damp Monday morning route where well-wishers drew 'Boston Strong' in chalk on the pavement to remember the three dead and more than 260 injured in  attack near the finish line two years ago. Scroll down for video . Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa, who won the Boston Marathon in 2013 before a terrorist attack, was the first-place finisher this year with a time of 2 hours, 9 minutes, 17 seconds . Desisa raised his hands in victory and exhaustion as he crossed the finish line to win the Boston Marathon on Monday . After the 2013 Boston Bombings, Desisa donated his medal to the city. Above, he accepts his trophy and crown of laurels this year . 'I'm happy for No. 1,' Desisa said. 'I am happy to win and for a strong Boston 2013.' His countryman Yemane Adhane Tsegay was second with 2:09:48 in mid-40s weather, and Wilson Chebet of Kenya took third in 2:10:22. Caroline Rotich, 30, of Kenya won the women's division after a tense final stretch. Rotich finished in an unofficial time of 2 hours, 24 minutes, 55 seconds, edging out Mare Dibaba of Ethiopia in a sprint finish on Boylston Street. 'I got to the last corner and I saw the finish line tape and I thought this is it, I'm not going to let it go,' said Rotich, who gave Kenya its fifth straight women's victory in Boston. Dathan Ritzenhein was seventh overall in the men's race and the first American in at an unofficial 2:11:20, followed by last year's winner, Meb Keflezighi, in 2:12:42. Keflezighi's triump in 2014 was seen as an inspiring and resilient victory for Boston and the marathon as the annual event continues to bring back memories of 2013. Caroline Rotich, of Kenya, won the women's division with an unofficial time of 2 hours, 24 minutes, 55 seconds . A tired Rotich smiles in jubilation after beating out her adversaries in the final section of the 26.2-mile race through downtown Boston . Champion Rotich edged out Mare Dibaba of Ethiopia in a sprint finish on Boylston Street and was given a silver trophy for the prestigious race . Carlos Arredondo, a first-responder that year, handed out American flags at the finish line on Monday, . The race comes less than three weeks after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the then-19-year-old Chechen Cambridge resident who brought bombs to the race, was found guilty of all the terrorism charges against him in a trial that saw moving testimony from victims who had lost loved ones and limbs. Tsarnaev, now 21, could face the death penalty after sentencing in federal court. Some victims of the attack have spoken out saying they are against capital punishment for the young man. Newlyweds Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes, who lost limbs in the bombing, said that they support life without parole so that Tsarnaev 'disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible,' according to the Boston Globe. 'If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant. However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance,' they said. Police presence at the Boston Marathon was high two years after the terrorist attack that claimed three lives and injured hundreds . Spectators at the event were made to pass through security checkpoints. Some victims of the attack said that they want bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to 'disappear from our collective consciousness as soon as possible' Runners including Meb Keflezighi of San Diego and Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia leave the start line on a damp and windy morning . American Desiree Linden (left) led the pack for a large portion of the 26.2-mile race, though Rotich (second from left) eventually triumphed . Carlos Arredondo, a cowboy hat-wearing first-responder who helped save victims of the 2013 bombing, passed out American flags at this year's event and held a 'Boston Strong' banner . While the events and victims of two years ago were remembered on Monday, the race proceeded as it has done since 1897. The fastest man in the Boston Marathon field, Kenya's Patrick Makau,  dropped out after the 5-kilometer checkpoint. It wasn't clear why he dropped out. The Kenyan's personal best of 2 hours, 3 minutes, 38 seconds made him one of the biggest threats to defending champion Meb Keflezighi's hopes of repeating Monday. Caroline Rotich of Kenya won the women's division after a tense final stretch. Marcel Hug of Switzerland won the men's wheelchair race with a time of 1:29:53. It was his first win at the event . American Tatyana McFadden continued her reign atop the Boston Marathon women's wheelchair race with her third consecutive victory . Dibaba's countrywoman, Buzunesh Deba, was third in the women's race, and American Desiree Linden finished fourth after leading for much of Monday's race. Marcel Hug of Switzerland won the men's wheelchair race. It took him 1:29:53 for his first Boston win. The 28-year-old finished fourth last year. Hug deprived Ernst Van Dyk of his 11th Boston Marathon victory. The South African is already the most decorated Boston competitor with 10 titles. American Tatyana McFadden continued her reign atop the Boston Marathon women's wheelchair race with her third consecutive victory. McFadden rolled down Boylston Street to finish in an unofficial 1 hour, 52 minutes, 54 seconds. Dr Bryan Lyons (center) pushes Rick Hoyt in the Boston Marathon.

Roughly 30,000 runners chose to participate in the damp 2015 Boston Marathon, which first was run through the city's downtown in 1897 . The event saw the grit of competition joined by some tenderness as Dustin Hicks, right, of Temple Terrace, Florida, proposed to Laura Bowerman after crossing the finish line. She accepted . She wore a singlet in memory of Martin Richard, the 8-year-old boy who was killed in the 2013 finish line bombing. McFadden, 25, is a four-time Paralympian and also the reigning champion of the Chicago, New York City and London marathons. The Russian-born adoptee and Maryland native also finished second in the 1 kilometer Nordic skiing sprint in the 2014 Paralympics. One small difference at this year's race was the absence of runner Dick Hoyt, 75, who instead served as Grand Master, according to Boston.com. The father became a fixture at the competition over the years after pushing his disabled son Rick, 53, along the course more than 32 times. The family has also set up a non-profit that advocates for better self-esteem among disabled youth.

"Baylee Almon should be gearing up for her first legal drink on Saturday. Probably at college, probably able to drive, she should be toasting the next phase of her life with her mother, stepfather, brother, sister and cousins at home in leafy Choctaw, Oklahoma. But no, she was one of 19 toddlers killed in a daycare center on April 19, 1995, in the worst case of homegrown terrorism America has ever seen, the day after her first birthday. The Oklahoma City bombing, planted by veteran US Army soldier Timothy McVeigh, killed 168 American people. One photograph encapsulated the terror: a firefighter emerging from the burning wreckage cradling the lifeless body of Baylee Almon. Her 23-year-old single mother saw the picture on the front page of the local paper the next day. A day later, it had swept the world. Two decades on, the shock is still raw. One photograph encapsulated the terror: a firefighter, Chris Fields, emerging from the burning wreckage cradling the lifeless body of Baylee Almon . 'It doesn't get easier': Aren Almon-Kok, pictured at the memorial for her daughter Baylee, who was killed in the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 the day after her first birthday . Then a 23-year-old single mother, Aren saw the picture of her lifeless daughter on the front page of the local paper the next day. A day later it was on the cover of newspapers across the world . Painful: Aren said she learns to deal with the grief but the milestones get more difficult every year. Baylee (pictured) had just turned one when Aren dropped her off at a daycare center before going to work . Remembering: Aren and her family throw a party for Baylee on her birthday every year . Horrific: Aren describes how she searched for hours for Baylee until eventually, in St Anthony's Hospital, she was approached by a priest and a pediatrician who delivered the devastating news . 'It gets harder every year,' Aren Almon-Kok told DailyMail.com from her home on the outskirts of Oklahoma City, where she lives with her husband and two children. 'People say ""it’ll get easier"" or ""you’ll find closure"". I don’t think it does, and I don’t think I will. 'I had to see Baylee dead every day. No one should ever have to see that. 'You learn to deal with it differently, but every year the milestones are worse. ’Sixteen was hard. Twenty-one is the worst. Everything I missed, everything I didn’t get to be part of. I’m trying not to think about it.’ As the 20-year anniversary approaches, many still feel betrayed and bemused by the attackers, who branded themselves patriots. Unlike Dzokhar Tsarnaev and the 9/11 hijackers, Timothy McVeigh had fought for his country in the Gulf War. Parking a rented Ryder truck loaded with explosives outside the Alfred P Murrah building that morning was his way of attacking the 'tyrannical' federal government. He told a court he wanted revenge for the 76 lives lost in a fire at the Waco barracks in Texas, exactly two years earlier, when the FBI ham-handedly tried to expel intruders. He was executed in 2001, and his co-conspirator Terry Nichols, now 60, remains in jail serving 161 life sentences. Even before investigators identified the American perpetrators, the country was struggling to understand the concept of terrorism in Oklahoma City. When the building exploded at 9.01am, Mrs Almon-Kok thought it was construction work. But word soon reached her office, and she spent the next two hours scouring hospitals for her only child. Eventually, sitting in the crammed waiting room at St Anthony’s Hospital, she was approached by a pediatrician and a priest who delivered the news. She didn’t know aspiring photojournalist Charles Porter had captured the moment Baylee was carried from the building, her pink socks stained red from the shards of glass, in a picture that would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize. 'I was very young at the time, I was 23,' she said. 'My parents saw the picture on the paper the next morning and tried to hide it from me. I came downstairs looking for something to read and they said ""we didn’t get any mail today"". 'I knew that was ridiculous, we always got the paper. So I went looking around for it and, yes, as soon as I saw it I said, ""that’s Baylee"". The Oklahoma City bombing, planted by veteran US Army soldier Timothy McVeigh, killed 168 people . It was the worst case of homegrown terrorism America has ever seen, and shook the nation . Unlike Dzokhar Tsarnaev and the 9/11 hijackers, Timothy McVeigh had fought for his country in the Gulf War . Then-President Bill Clinton responded to the attack days later with one of his most famous speeches: 'The loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives.’ Then-First Lady Hillary Clinton holds her face in distress at the ceremony to remember the dead in 1995 . 'For some reason I thought I would know if my daughter was going to be on the front page. It was strange, it was horrible. 'Everybody else saw it as fiction - she wasn’t a person. They made money off it like she wasn’t real.' To the Almon-Kok family, she is very much still with them. Aren Almon met Army veteran Stanley Kok through a friend soon after the attack. They married in 1997, and together they have two children: Bella, 17, and Brooks, 13. Every year they throw a birthday party in Baylee’s honor, with a cake and a family meal. Bella and Brooks know they are two of three siblings. 'My husband has been really great, he has always been supportive of what I've been through and to him, Baylee is part of our life together. 'My kids have always known that they have a sister and that she went to heaven, so they expect us to celebrate her birthday like we do theirs. 'For them, the picture is painful too. 'Bella did a paper at school the other day about commercials and how they use images. One of the photographs they were given was that picture. 'She just dealt with it the best way she can. That’s her sister, she knows what happened. So to see that picture, that hurts.' Nonetheless, the family has been the subject of scrutiny, anger and at times hatred in the wake of the attacks. With her child the 'face' of the tragedy, other grieving families felt Aren Almon and the firefighter, Chris Fields, stole the limelight from their loved ones who paled into oblivion. During the barrage of media attention, the pair grew a bond, which remains today - and it was erroneously assumed they had become romantically involved. 'We do still see each other, Chris and his wife have been very supportive, they are such good people. But they won't be coming to the ceremony, they keep themselves out of that stuff. 'That whole thing was difficult, and just something else you have to learn how to deal with.' Consequently, Almon-Kok is apprehensive about this year’s 20-year anniversary ceremony. 'We don’t all have something in common just because we lost a child,' she explains. Tough: Aren has been the subject of scrutiny, anger and at times hatred in the wake of the attacks .

Other grieving families felt Aren Almon and the firefighter, Chris Fields, stole the limelight from their loved ones who paled into oblivion after the photograph received so much attention (pictured: the memorial) 'I know after the bombing the other families didn’t like me, and I’m not looking forward to that. 'I have just always tried to represent myself the best way possible because when Baylee’s looking down at me from heaven I want her to be proud of the things I have done. 'I didn’t want any of this, to see Baylee dead everywhere every day, but that’s just the way it happened.' Between the ages of 23 and 43, Almon-Kok, has dedicated herself to ensuring daycare centers are fully secure. Congressional bill number HR 4159, or 'Baylee’s Law', became law in 2000 to ensure a standard of glass protection in public buildings. McVeigh had enlisted his co-conspirators to build a car bomb that would shatter the windows of the building - a horrific detail that severely impacted the force of the explosion. It took weeks to find an attorney to represent Timothy McVeigh after he was coincidentally detained during a traffic stop 45 minutes after the attack. Eventually, Stephen Jones agreed to defend his actions ’to ensure he had a fair trial’. Speaking this week, Jones conceded: 'We all remember what we were doing. It is the Pearl Harbor Day of Oklahoma. 'This was a scar and never-ending wrong that affected not only Oklahoma City and the people there but the nation at large,' he told Tulsa Rotary. Then-President Bill Clinton responded to the attack days later with one of his most famous speeches: 'The loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives.’ Indeed, Oklahomans earned a reputation for compassion in the wake of the bombing - a sense of charity that came to be known as 'The Oklahoma Standard'. On Sunday, in a ceremony held at 9.01am at the site of the attack, Clinton and city officials will lead tributes to the city’s resilience, and read out the names of the 168 people who lost their lives. And the picture of Chris Fields holding Baylee will be shown. Though heart-wrenching for her, she says she is attempting to compartmentalize it. ’If I saw Baylee every time I looked at that photograph, I wouldn’t be able to get past that. I wouldn’t be able to carry on,’ she said. 'To me, basically, I try to see that picture as something which represents everybody who died in that bombing. It’s everybody’s baby.'","It is 20 years since the worst case of homegrown terrorism in US history .

Graswald was taken to hospital and treated for hypothermia but her fiance has not been found. On Monday she asked friends for their prayers as the search continued. She wrote on Facebook: 'I just want to thank everyone for reaching out. Please, keep your prayers for Vince. 'Miracles ARE possible. The authorities are doing everything they can.

"Standing isolated surrounded by the vast, golden north Saudi Arabian desert is a bizarre single rock castle, which has been lying undisturbed for centuries. Qasr al-Farid or 'The Lonely Castle' has a sad tale, standing incomplete and abandoned, looking out of place in the vast, barren landscape. Believed to be constructed in the first century A.D. and situated on one of the most important ancient trade routes, linking the north and south of the Arabian peninsula, the mysterious monument was never finished. Scroll down for video . Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the ancient remains of Qasr al-Farid - a rock-cut tomb and part of an ancient Nabatean settlement - stands amidst imposing cliffs and striking rocky outcrop . The Nabatean Tomb in Madain Saleh is located in the northwestern region of the Arabian peninsula, in the middle of a vast desert landscape . Size matters! The striking structure is the largest of the 131 tombs in the area, hinting it was intended for someone of great power . Despite its misleading name, the fascinating four-storey monument was actually used as a tomb. It's intricate carving borrows decorative elements from Egyptian, Hellenistic, and Assyrian architecture. The tomb is the largest of 131 monumental tombs, which were carved straight into rock in the city of Mada'in Saleh during the pinnacle of Nabatean era. And it is famous for standing completely alone. Size would have been indicative of the person's social status and wealth, hinting it was intended for someone of power. It is remarkable how The Lonely Castle has remained so preserved against the elements for over 1,900 years and this can be attributed to the dry climate. Situated on a pre-Islamic archaeological site located in Al-Ula, is located on one of the major trading sites, which linked the south of the Arabian peninsula to the north. Unesco declared the magnificent historic collection Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage site in 2008. Nabataeans constructed their massive stone buildings mainly from single pieces of sandstone, and carved from the top down . If the smooth stone reminds you of the iconic carved site of Petra in Jordan, it should come as no surprise to learn they are linked. Petra was the capital of the Nabataean kingdom and features a 250-foot-high  sandstone slot canyon known as the Siq. Until 1812, the site was unknown to the western world until it was introduced by explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. While Petra was the capital of the Nabatean kingdom, Mada'in Saleh was its second city, explaining why the unusual carved rock architecture is so similar. Petra in Jordan was the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom. It displays similar architecture design to Qasr al-Farid, being carved out of a single stone body. It is sometimes known as the Rose City due to the color of the stone . Impressive collection! Another Saudi Arabian Nabatean tomb, Qasr al-Bint, has been perfectly preserved in the dry climate. UNESCO declared the historic series of tombs Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage site in 2008 .","Qasr al-Farid or 'The Lonely Castle' has been standing strong since the first century AD .

'I think The Good Life is doing things for yourself, not relying on someone else to do it for you. That's what the Goods did, didn't they?

"Michelle Obama's loyal chief of staff, who's been with her since she moved in to the White House, left the first family behind this month. Kristen Jarvis, 34, is moving on from Washington after seven years of acting as the first lady's  go-to gal and constant companion for nearly all her daily tasks. All except some of the famously fit first lady's more intensive workout regimes. Moving on: Kristen Jarvis (at right with Sasha and Malia in 2009) has left the Obamas after seven years as Michelle's fiercely loyal chief of staff . Jarvis, who's moving on to become the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker's chief of staff, admits she did not share Michelle's love of D.C. workout craze Solidcore. 'She can have that,' the Spelman College graduate told the Washington Post. And it's hard to blame her. Solidcore's website says it utilizes 'slow and controlled full-body movements with constant tension to work your muscle fibers to failure...to rebuild a more sculpted, stronger and [solid] you.' Jarvis, instead, got her workouts by helping carry the First Lady through her last seven years in the White House. She was with the Obamas even before that, however. Jarvis entered the family's orbit in 2005 when she joined Obama's Senate office. She went on to work on Obama's 2008 campaign and then Michelle's staff leading up to the election before becoming her top personal aide. Her relationship with the family, insiders say, was deeply familial. 'She can have that': Jarvis says she mostly kept up with fitness-loving Michelle, but drew the line at D.C. workout craze Solidcore . Jarvis's last trip on Air Force One with the family she's come to know and love was especially emotional and not just because she'd soon be leaving the presidential world behind. The trip was to Selma, Alabama where the first black family in the White House was traveling to the civil rights anniversary commemorations. 'It was so powerful. It felt like [both] the message of 2008 and how far we've come as a people,' she told Wapo. Perhaps just as personally meaningful was how that final trip ended back in Washington, where Mrs. Obama invited Jarvis to exit at the front of the plane with the family. 'As we walked down the steps, FLOTUS was holding my hand,' Jarvis said, as if the First Lady was happily leading her into her new life. Jarvis said that Michelle was an active part of her transition out of Washington. 'She has been a mentor throughout this entire process,' Jarvis said. Ten years of service: Jarvis, 34, first joined the Obamas' orbit in 2005 when she took a job in then Senator Obama's office . The Maryland native lost both parents and a brother before she was 30 and, Jarvis's deputy Melissa Winter told Wapo, 'The first lady was able to fill unintentionally some areas of Kristen's life that she was missing growing up.' Jarvis, who the Washington Post says came to embody 'the kind of deep, personal commitment the Obamas value', played her hand close even after her exit, telling a Wapo reporter recently that, with Michelle, 'honestly for her, what you see is what you get...she just really instills the confidence in you.' That confidence and loyalty has now won her a job near the top of a $10 billion corporate foundation. The Ford Foundation, created in 1936 by auto moguls Henry and Edsel Ford, funds charities and individuals worldwide that encourage and 'promote among the nonprofit, government and business sectors; and to ensure participation by men and women from diverse communities and all levels of society.' Loyal: Jarvis, a Spelman College grad, went on to work on Obama's 2008 campaign and then Michelle's staff leading up to the election before becoming her top personal aide.","Kristen Jarvis, 34, is moving on to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker in New York .

"Comedian Rik Mayall failed to leave a valid will to deal with his £1.2 million estate, which experts say could leave his family with a large inheritance tax bill. Mayall, who played scheming Tory MP Alan B’Stard in ITV series The New Statesman, and a host of other comedy characters, died suddenly aged 56 last June. But probate records reveal he had no will – even though he suffered serious head injuries and nearly died in a quad-bike accident in 1998 – which could mean complications for his wife of 29 years, Barbara, and their three adult children. Scroll down for video . Legacy: Rik Mayall is pictured in 1999 with his wife Barbara and their children after his quad bike accident . His estate could be liable for tax of tens of thousands of pounds which would not have been payable if he had left everything to his wife. Lawyers have always advised that people should have a valid will to avoid tax pitfalls. Mayall, one of the leading ‘alternative’ comics of the 1980s, surprised doctors by making a good recovery after his accident and returned to work in 1999, but he developed epilepsy and took daily medication. Rik Mayall (pictured) died suddenly aged 56 last June . His personal estate would be divided according to Government intestacy rules, which take into account marital status, children or surviving relatives. Andrew Kidd, a specialist probate solicitor and partner in London law firm Clintons, said that Mayall’s children would be automatically entitled to a share of his net estate of £1,192,701 after funeral and legal expenses, meaning they could inherit an amount liable for inheritance tax. But Mr Kidd said the amount of any tax payable would depend on the value of Mayall’s chattels or personal belongings which would go to his wife under intestacy rules. Mr Kidd said that the rules for a married father like Mayall meant his wife would be due to receive £250,000 plus all his ‘chattels’, which would include any personally owned cars, furniture, ornaments, books and jewellery. By law, Mayall’s children would then automatically get half the remaining value of the estate, creating a potential tax bill if the amount is more than the inheritance tax limit of £325,000. Mayall’s widow would have received a life interest in the remaining half – meaning she could not touch or transfer that money but could claim interest on it. Mr Kidd added that Mayall’s family could seek to avoid the tax by drawing up a deed of variation to split up his estate, reducing any sum left to the children so it was below the tax threshold. Mrs Mayall declined to discuss the estate and the apparent lack of a will. At her home in South-West London she said: ‘I haven’t heard anything from my lawyers yet.’ How the (Tory-hating) geniuses behind Alan B’Stard helped David Cameron into No 10 . He's the man behind the most roguish Tory MP of all – the arrogant, preening Alan B’Stard, star of the hit television comedy The New Statesman. Yet writer Laurence Marks also played a crucial role in getting David Cameron into Downing Street, it can be revealed. In the 1990s, Mr Marks lived in the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney, where Mr Cameron would later become MP. He and his writing partner Maurice Gran had become local celebrities owing to the success of The New Statesman, which ran from 1987 to 1994. Roguish: Rik Mayall as Alan B'Stard in the comedy The New Statesman. David Cameron is pictured right . Although Marks was a committed Labour supporter and Gran was a Liberal Democrat, the then chairman of the local Conservative Association, Joyce Sanderson, sought their views on who should contest the seat for the Tories at the 1997 General Election. Against their advice, Witney Conservatives went for the one option the pair strongly advised against – Shaun Woodward. He would cause a political storm two years after being elected as an MP by defecting to Labour. So next time the seat came up for grabs, the opinions of Mr Marks and Mr Gran were clearly more respected. When they were introduced to all five on the shortlist to fight Witney at the 2001 Election, they plumped for an ambitious young man called David Cameron, who won the seat with a majority of nearly 8,000. ‘When they selected Woodward, I told them, “You’re making a dreadful mistake,” said Mr Marks, 66, last night. ‘Out of the five they introduced to us the next time around, David Cameron was by far the best. 'He was very bright and understood things but we never guessed he would be Prime Minister. Joyce knew my political views but she thought it was good to have an outside opinion. I’m a member of the Labour Party but I admire certain Tories, otherwise we wouldn’t have created Alan B’Stard. ‘David Cameron is a lovely fellow – a really nice man. He used to come to my place for tea with his wife Samantha. We’ve remained friends. I think the nation likes him. ‘When he got into No 10, he sent us a lovely handwritten letter, saying, “Thank you so much, I wouldn’t be here without you two.” ’ Asked for his views on Ed Miliband, Mr Marks said: ‘I don’t know him. I don’t think anybody knows him. He’s an unknown quantity. If you vote for him, you’re voting blind.’","The comedian, who died suddenly at 56 last year, failed to leave a valid will .

"The family of a teenager who should have died after overdosing on a mix of heroin and Xanax has shared images of him in hospital in a bid to deter others from taking drugs. Brayden Travis, 18, was left without medical attention for seven hours after taking drugs at a friend's house in St Charles County, Missouri in early March. His lungs and kidneys failed, and he suffered a stroke and severe brain damage. Doctors warned that he will likely remain in a vegetative state, his mother, Kelly Smith-Miller, wrote on Facebook. She also shared a starling photograph of the teenager unconscious in a hospital bed with breathing apparatus and wires across his body. Overdose: Brayden Travis, 18, suffered a stroke and severe brain damage after overdosing on heroin and Xanax last month. His mother shared this photo of him to Facebook to deter others from taking drugs . 'If my son's story and picture can save one life or contribute to the education and awareness of drug abuse, then he and I are very happy!' she wrote in her post. 'He wouldn't want this for anyone else and he would tell anyone not to use drugs … ever! I can tell you he tried to fight this addiction and I pray this time it hasn't won!' The post has been shared more than 337,000 times. Brayden is now breathing on his own and wakes up and opens and closes his eyes, although his reactions are inconsistent, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. 'Medical personnel believe my son should have been dead long before he was able to get the medical attention he needed, but for some unknown reason he has stabilized,' she wrote. Addiction: His mother explained that Brayden, left before the overdose, has struggled with drug addiction since he was 15. He is now conscious in hospital, seen right, and is breathing on his own . 'He is making progress, but we have a long road to travel. Even though the outcome is not expected to be positive, as a mother I will not give up until I have exhausted all options and know that I've done everything I can.' Brayden had long been battling with addiction, she said. He first started smoking marijuana when he was 15 and eventually moved on to heroin. He enrolled in five or six treatment programs and left three of them, she told the Post-Dispatch. He spent eight months in juvenile custody for using drugs and failing drug tests, she added. As he struggled with addiction, he moved between his grandmother's home and his mother's home, and at the time of his overdose, he was living with his father in St Charles County. By his side: Mother Kelly Smith-Miller, pictured with her son left, and his father, Todd Travis, right, said they hope he will pull though so he can 'come home and have a life that will be worth living' 'He was living with me doing well, then I go in his room every morning to check on him and he is gone,' his dad, Todd Travis, wrote on his own Facebook page. 'He is my only child, my mini me, and my life! Please everyone pray for Brayden to someday have his body and and his brain healed so he can come home and have a life that will be worth living.' Speaking to the Post-Dispatch, Travis, who tried to set a good example for his son by working out and eating well, added: 'You go over what you could have done better.' But he is still hopeful that his son will recover, and shared his joy on Facebook that his son has been laughing in hospital. 'I'm looking into his eyes, man - and he's looking at me,' he said.","Brayden Travis, from St Charles County, Missouri, has battled drug addiction since he was 15 and overdosed on heroin in early March .

"The baggage handler who woke up from a nap inside the cargo hold of a flying plane did not realize until a piece of luggage fell on top of him.

He told ABC News: 'When the bags started moving and I heard the sound of the engine, I had to think fast about what to do for me to get out.' Scroll down for audio and video . Can you hear me now? This is the moment an Alaska Airlines baggage handler was pulled from the cargo hold after falling asleep. Earlier, the terrified man called 911 begging the dispatcher for help . Safe: This is the baggage handler who fell asleep aboard the Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle to Los Angeles on Monday . In a desperate bid for help, he called 911 and spoke to a bemused operator for 44 seconds before he was cut off. 'It was nothing but pitch black and a loud noise,' the man told ABC. 'So I was scared, and I didn't know what was going on.' The employee of airline contractor Menzies Aviation had dozed off inside the plane at the end of his shift and woke 14 minutes into the flight. On Thursday, the trapped baggage handler's desperate 911 call was released, revealing the man's panic and terror. 'Hello, I'm trapped in this plane!' he tells he operator. The woman ostensibly struggles to grasp what's happening and asks for an explanation. 'You're where?' the dispatcher asks. 'I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's moving in the air,' he replies. The airport worker then rattles off the number of the flight and begs the dispatcher to call for help. 'Can you please, can somebody stop it?' he pleads. The man grows increasingly exasperated on the call, telling the woman on the other end of the line that he is not at the airport, but rather inside a flying plane. As he struggles to lay out his situation, the phone begins to cut out and eventually the call gets disconnected . The operator made an attempt to call the man back, but his phone was no longer in service. A passenger on board Flight 448 recorded video of the baggage handlder's knocking that passengers could hear inside the cabin . Emergency landing: The pilot turned back to Seattle 14 minutes into the flight when he heard screaming . Luckily for the drowsy airport staffer, he had better luck with passengers aboard Flight 448 who heard his banging and screams and alerted the crew. 'Help! Help! Help!' the man screamed, according to one traveler. The airline said in a news release the captain immediately returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and declared an emergency for priority landing. The cargo hold where the handler was trapped is temperature controlled and pressurized, so he was not in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen. 'At some point the marshal kind of made himself known and started banging back and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something,'' Troi Ge, a passenger on board the flight, told NBC News. Mr Ge, a sound designer from Burbank, recorded video aboard the plane in which passengers could hear the banging from the cargo hold. After the plane landed, a ramp agent was found inside the front cargo hold. Video taken by KIRO 7 showed the worker calmly walking out of the cargo hold and putting on a high visibility jacket. He stood talking to airport staff for a few seconds before walking off towards the terminal. 'Upon exiting, he told authorities he had fallen asleep,' the airline said. The worker, an employee of Menzies Aviation, walked off the plane and appeared well, but was taken to a hospital as a precaution. He was released home after passing a drug test. The worker, who was part of a four-person crew, started his shift at 5am Monday morning and was scheduled to finish work at 2.30pm, according to the airline. After the team was done loading all the luggage onto the plane, the leader of the crew noticed that one of his staffers was nowhere to be found. He tried calling and texting him but the man did not respond, leading his supervisor to believe that he had gone home at the end of the shift, reported KOMO News. The airline says it is investigating the situation. The pilot could hear banging and screaming from beneath the aircraft as they flew from Seattle to LA . The man appeared to be well as he walked around the runway talking to airport employees . Alaska Airlines is investigating how the man managed to fall asleep before the LA-bound flight took off . Passenger Marty Collins told KOMO-TV in Seattle the flight was surrounded by emergency vehicles when it returned to the airport. She said passengers did not hear the worker banging or making noise. 'Nobody on the plane heard anything like that, nobody knew why we were turning around,' she told the station. 'They just said we were fine and we weren't in any danger. Passenger Troi Ge told the station Q13Fox that at one point a federal air marshal revealed himself and started banging back. He then yelled to the man in the cargo hold that the plane was about to land and urged him to hold onto something to prevent injury. The flight departed again at 3.52pm and was expected to arrive in Los Angeles at 6.27pm, about 80 minutes late, according to the airline's website.","Flight 448 had just taken off Monday when the pilot heard banging from beneath .

"Parents who choose not to vaccinate their children due to their personal beliefs may soon be fully blocked from accessing welfare payments and childcare subsidies. Social Services Minister Scott Morrison confirms that the government is actively researching possible legislation changes, as conscientious objectors are currently able to use a loophole to access family tax benefits. The hard-line approach to immunisation comes one month after the tragic death of 32-day -old Perth baby Riley Hughes who died after contracting whooping cough. A subsequent galaxy poll found that 87 per cent of Australians believe vaccinations should be mandatory. Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children must give up their childcare payments from the government unless care is quarantined to the home, according to the Productivity Commission's report into childcare . The national immunisation program current outlines that parents must vaccinate their children to be eligible for family payments and childcare rebates. However, people who choose not to vaccinate their children for philosophical, personal or religious beliefs are able to apply for an exemption – meaning they can still access the payments without immunising their children. They can seek exemptions if a doctor signs a form showing they understand the risks to their child if they don't get vaccinated. A form must also be filled out, declaring the individual does not vaccinate their baby due to “personal, philosophical, religious or medical beliefs involving a conviction that vaccination should not take place”, they are still able to access the benefits. Mr Morrison believes there is essentially no excuse to excuse a parent when they decide not to vaccinate their child, especially as the decision could be potentially fatal for other children. While parents are required to vaccinate their children to receive benefits, they can seek exemptions if a doctor signs a form showing they understand the risks to their child if they don't get vaccinated . “We believe that, unless you’re someone with a really deep held religious view there should be no exceptions and you should be getting your children immunised,” the Opposition leader told Nine’s Weekend Today. “The idea that your child’s going to a childcare centre and that some other parent doesn’t feel they like the science of immunisation, and therefore they come along and your child or anyone else’s child could catch something because some other parent has an opinion, that isn’t really good enough is it,” he said. It’s hoped a change to the governments benefit packages will motivate anti-vaccinators to immunise their children. “The Government is reviewing the current exemptions on vaccinations that apply to family tax benefit payments and child care subsidies as part of the families package to be delivered this year,” Mr Morrison told News Corp. The Productivity Commission's report now recommends rebates 'be conditional on the child being fully immunised, unless care occurs in the child's home' In February, the Productivity Commission handed down a report which recommended that rebates ‘be conditional on the child being fully immunised, unless care occurs in the child's home'. Childcare centres in NSW can ban children that are not immunised and other states are currently considering similar tough stances. Labor leader Bill Shorten told the Sunday Telegraph the commission's recommendation were a 'common-sense measure'. 'Kids deserve to grow up safe and healthy. I'm not comfortable with the idea of subsidising people who put kids' health at risk,' he said. 'Childcare support should go to people who are doing the right thing by their child and the children they play with. Families who do the right thing by immunising their child shouldn't have to worry about whether their child is going to pick up a preventable illness at their childcare centre.' Social Services Minister Scott Morrison said he was open to anything in the report and admitted it made some very important suggestions in the area of immunisations .","Abbott Government are actively trying to stop parents who don't immunise their children from accessing rebates .
Only parents who immunise their children are eligible to access welfare payments and childcare subsidies .
However a loophole currently allows parents who do not vaccinate their children from accessing the funds .
Conscientious objectors are people who oppose vaccinations for personal or philosophical reasons despite knowing the risks .
Scott Morrison confirms the government wants to take a more hard-line approach in the interest of the health and safety of Australian children ."
"Richie Benaud spent a lifetime in the sun and in his final years he ruefully admitted that he was paying the price for it with skin cancers on his forehead and the top of his head. The 84-year-old, who died on Friday, talked about his cancer and the treatment he was undergoing with typical candour. 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap,' Benaud told the Nine Network about growing up in Australia in the 1930s and 40s. 'I wish I had. You live and learn as you go along.' The cricket commentary box legend talked about the radiation treatment he was receiving for his skin cancer. Benaud, who hadn't returned to his commentary job for the Nine Network following a car accident in October 2013 in which he suffered serious injuries, had looked increasingly frail and had lost weight. But he had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne for 40 minutes every morning, in the hope that he could return to work. Scroll down for video . Skin cancer: Richie Benaud, pictured at the SCG in January 2013, revealed late last year that he had skin cancer and was receiving radiation treatment, admitting that 'as a kid we never ever wore a cap' but using the opportunity to advise all Australians to cover their heads . Marvellous: Richie Benaud, pictured in 1961 in Britain when he was captaining the Test series, admitted last year that he had never worn head gear as a young player because he had been influence by legendary all rounder Keith Miller, saying 'when I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap ... that's because Keith Miller never wore a cap' 'Master of the microphone': Cricket fans pictured applauding Richie Benaud as he covered his last match on English soil at The Oval in London, the Ashes Test between England and Australia in 2005 . Super effort: A victorious Australian captain Richie Benaud leads his team from the field at Old Trafford in 1961 after winning the Ashes in the fourth Test against England in which he sensationally took five wickets for 13 runs in 25 balls, instigating England's collapse . 'Morning everybody': Richie Benaud commentated  cricket for more than four decades following a stellar career as a Test cricketer during which he batted, bowled and captained Australia from the late 1950s to his retirement in 1964 . Benaud had been driving his beloved car - a 1963 Sunbeam Alpine - back from hitting practice golf balls at the Australian Golf Club in Sydney when he lost control and hit a parked car and then a small brick fence. He was hospitalised with shoulder, spinal and chest injuries and a broken sternum. He was subsequently diagnosed with skin cancer and began treatment last year, revealing that doctors were pleased with his progress. He told reporters last November he was 'coping with it very well'. The cricket legend said he believed the cancers were caused by playing cricket in the sun without a hat or sunscreen. Long history behind the microphone: Richie Benaud looks on during the fifth test match between England and Australia in August 1989, wearing one of his trademark light-coloured jackets which were his signature along with his unique commentary . Fan favourite: Richie Benaud was such a legend as a cricet commentator in his trademark cream jacket that he inspired a legion of fans dressed up in Australian cricket fans dressed up and wearing silver wigs and and carrying foam microphones at the Ashes Test at the SCG in January 2014 . The voice of Australian cricket: Richie Benaud, pictured at The Oval during the September 2005 Ashes Test, was one of Australian sport's great personalities and the boss of the commentary box at Test matches in Australia and Britain . Richie Benaud, pictured with Worcestor captain Don Kenyon before an Australia v Worcester match in England, captained Australia and played 63 Test matches in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, helping to restore the country's reputation as a cricketing nation . What a catch: Richie Benaud, pictured with his beloved wife, Daphne, at  Randwick racecourse in 2007, said that following a serious car crash and then treatment for skin cancer he and Daphne had been walking for '40 minutes a day' to ease him back to good health in the hope he could return to the commentary box . The former Australian test cricketer seized on the opportunity to encourage Australians to protect themselves from the sun. 'I recommend to everyone they wear protection on their heads,' he said. 'Eighty-four-year-olds don't seem to mend as well as they used to.' He said he was still recovering from the car accident injuries which included two fractured vertebrae. However, he expressed the belief he would make a return to cover the fourth Test against India at the SCG in Sydney, and had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne every morning in an effort to regain his health. Hero worship: Fans dressed as Richie Benaud in silver wigs and cream or beige sports jackets hold aloft imitation Nine Network microphones at the Sydney Test match in January 2014 . Legend among legends: Benaud at the SCG with fellow cricketers turned commentators Ian Healey, Michael Slater, Brett Lee, Ian Chappell and Bill Lawry dressed in pink for McGrath Foundation day  during the Sydney test between Australia and Sri Lanka in January 2013 . 'Progress is slow,' he said. 'I've been doing a lot of walking. 'We are out every morning, doing 40-minute walks every morning and it's showing beneficial effects.' Without the information on skin cancer danger now available during his playing days, Benaud revealed he was influenced by the example of great all rounder Keith Miller. 'When I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap - not a flash one,' Benaud said. 'That's because Keith Miller never wore a cap. Arthur Morris did when he went out to bat. 'We follow various people and 'Nugget' Miller never wore anything on his head, so I didn't. 'I wish I had.'

"The 11-year-old autistic boy who miraculously survived four nights alone in Victorian bushland has been reunited with his rescuers. Doctors say they are stunned with how healthy Luke Shambrook appeared, considering he had gone without food or water since Good Friday. Sitting up in his hospital bed, the young boy is seen flanked by two people from the search and rescue team who made the dramatic find on Tuesday, just three kilometres from where he went missing at Lake Eildon National Park, northeast of Melbourne. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was lost for four nights alone in the Victorian bushland and on Wednesday he was reunited with his rescuers at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne . Luke is with his family at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and was suffering from exhaustion, dehydration and hypothermia when he was found. He is unlikely to suffer any long term effects from his traumatic ordeal. Paediatrician Amy Gray said Luke was still a bit weak and tired, but asking for food. 'It's an amazingly happy outcome after what has clearly been an incredibly stressful, traumatic experience,' she said on Wednesday. 'I don't know that any of us know exactly what he's been through, but ... we think he's doing fabulously for someone who has been through what we can only imagine, and certainly in much better condition than what we'd expect.' The 11-year-old autistic boy was found just three kilometres away from where went missing at Lake Eildon National Park - north-east of Melbourne . A camera on the helicopter captured the dramatic moment rescuers reached Luke on the fourth day of an increasingly desperate search . A police officer was first on the site, and he knelt down and offered Luke reassurance he was finally safe . Dr Gray said he was improving with each hour and doctors did not expect him to have any ongoing physical problems from the ordeal. 'Aside from the dehydration he's tired and weak, again as you would expect, but there's no other real major physical issues at this stage,' she said. 'He seems very content and settled in the ward and happily interacting with the family.' A desperate search for Luke was mounted after he went missing from the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday. Other rescuers quickly followed, with one wrapping the terrified boy in a foil blanket, before he was gently taken from the bush to where he could receive proper medial attention . It ended on Tuesday when a police helicopter guiding on-ground searchers to Luke's location and captured the moment on dramatic video, . Luke is seen peering out from behind trees before a uniformed police officer him and appears to take his hand to reassure him he was finally safe. Then other rescuers join the scene, with one of them unfolding a foil blanket and wrapping it around the boy's shoulders. Luke's autism and limited speech could mean he never reveals what happened. 'He may have been wandering around lost and clocking up the k's,' Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Rick Nugent told Fairfax Radio on Wednesday. Luke Shambrook has been found alive after he went missing from the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday . He suffered from dehydration and hypothermia but has been reunited with his mother Rachel (pictured left) His parents Tim and Rachel were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance in a stretcher, with his mother giving him a kiss . Luke was found just before midday AEST on Tuesday in bushland off Skyline Road, 3km from the campsite . 'I'm not sure we'll ever know.' Mr Nugent on Tuesday said Luke's survival in the cold, wet, rugged terrain was a miracle. SES spokesman Brent Sergeant said the more days that passed during the search for Luke, the harder it became for volunteers. But finding the boy's beanie on Monday and realising he had walked away from water, rather than toward it, lifted their spirits.

"'Heartless': Alice Kovach-Suehn, 56, was arrested last Friday and charged with elderly neglect after police say they found the man in her care weighing only 89lbs . A Florida woman starved a 96-year-old man in her care until he resembled a concentration camp prisoner and fed him dog excrement, according to police and the victim's doctors. Alice Kovach-Suehn, 56, from Apopka, was arrested last Friday and charged with elderly neglect after police say they found the man in her care weighing only 89lbs. Apopka Police Sgt Ed Chittenden said it was one of the worst cases of abuse he's ever witnessed over the course of his 18-year career in law enforcement. According to an arrest report, the senior in Kovach-Suehn's care was discovered covered in filth and severely emaciated. The 96-year-old told officers he was being starved and never allowed to eat anything but meat and ‘dog feces.’ By the time police rescued him, the victim could not move his hands and his knees were locked together. 'He was skin and bones,' Chittenden described to the station WESH-TV. Kovach-Suehn was arrested after she brought the half-starved man in her care to Florida Hospital complaining of digestive issues. The staff there were so struck by his condition they contacted the state Department of Children and Families. Scroll down for video .

When offered food at the hospital, Sgt Chittenden said ‘he ate like a starving dog’ and, ultimately, he had to be spoon-fed. Police believe Ms Kovach-Suehn, who was the senior’s legal caretaker and had power-of-attorney, may have been deliberately starving the elderly man to get his money.

"It used to be as much a part of a Sunday routine as eating a roast dinner or reading the papers. But new figures show that the art of washing your own car appears to be dying out in Britain with a thrid of men admitting they have never picked up a bucket or chamois leather to clean their own motor. The study also reveals that three-quarters of women never wash their own car with drivers more likely to take it to a car wash on a local forecourt. A new study has revealed that a third of men have never picked up a bucket and a chamois leather to wash their own car (file pic) The survey of 1,100 adults by vehicle leasing firm OSV, found that 31 per cent of men have never washed their own car, with only 12 per cent of those that do saying they do it regularly. Meanwhile only five per cent of those surveyed said that had ever asked their children to wash the car, as a way for them to earn extra pocket money. Factors behind the decline vary from shops now opening on a Sunday and more live football on TV, meaning more people put off the chore at the weekend. The rise of hand car washes has been blamed for a decrease in drivers washing their own cars (file pic) Other reasons given for not washing cars include the rise of hand car washes and the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean. Brits are more likely to wash their own car during the holidays as the recent Easter break saw an estimated 15 million cars cleaned by their owners. However, one in four said they only did it as an excuse to get out of the house. Cars are most likely to be washed by their owners every week in Birmingham, Chelmsford and Sheffield and least likely in Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh. Audis, Toyotas and BMWs are most likely to be washed by their owners and Range Rovers, Peugeots and Mercedes least often. OSV spokesman Andrew Kirkley said: 'A lot of us remember seeing our streets full of men cleaning their cars every Sunday. It was a national tradition. 'But let's face it, we don't have as much time any more, the cars are bigger and even the kids don't seem to want to earn a bit of extra money doing it for us either. 'On top of that, there is now plenty of choice out there if you want to put the car through an automated machine or get a gang of enthusiastic guys to do it for you fairly cheaply.'","31 per cent of British men say they have never washed their own car .

"Shaving, waxing, plucking - many of us spend hours getting rid of body hair. But this week, singer Miley Cyrus decided to challenge convention and leave her underarms unshaved - perhaps she's onto something, as there may be health benefits to having an ample covering of fuzz. Here, with the help of experts, we explore why being hairy may be good for you. Singer Miley Cyrus this week shocked fans with this photo by challenging convention - and leaving her underarms unshaved . HOW BODY HAIR HELPS YOUR SKIN HEAL . Hair anywhere on the body is important for maintaining skin health, explains Des Tobin, a professor of cell biology at the University of Bradford. 'Each hair follicle [the tiny structure that sprouts hairs] is not just producing a hair fibre, but also has masses of blood vessels, nerves and fat around it.' Hair follicles are also rich in stem cells - cells that never lose the capacity to renew themselves - which help the skin heal. 'If you compared a wound on the outside of a man's arm, where the hair follicles are larger and more numerous, with a wound on the inside of the arm, the one on the outside would heal better, because of the increased stem cells and blood supply, among other factors,' says Professor Tobin. Similarly, a bald scalp is less able to cope with nicks, cuts and bruising than a hairy one because of the lack of healthy follicles. As we age, follicles shrink and while people who lose hair will still have some stem cells, their healing capacity may be reduced. The good news is that removing hair through shaving or waxing won't reduce these benefits because the hair follicles are still intact. ... AND PROVIDES SUN PROTECTION . Body hair harks back to our prehistoric ancestors - it was our only garment, keeping us warm and protecting us from environmental impact such as sunlight, explains Nick Lowe, consultant dermatologist from London's Cranley Clinic. While few of us have dense enough hair to serve this purpose now, someone who's particularly hairy may have an extra degree of sun protection, he says. Another historic function of body hair was to keep us warm, says Professor Tobin, who is also director of the Centre for Skin Sciences. 'We do know bald heads lose more heat, and that when we're cold, our body hair stands on end to trap warm air closer to the surface of the skin.' Body hair harks back to our prehistoric ancestors - it was our only garment. Now, experts have revealed the various ways in which being hairy may be good for us - despite our constant attempts to remove it . DON'T PLUCK YOUR NASAL HAIR . Unsightly as they may be, hairs in the nostrils do have a role - to prevent foreign material, such as dust, getting in to the nose and lungs, says George Murty, an ear, nose and throat consultant at University Hospitals of Leicester. If you want to defuzz your nostrils, trimming might be better to plucking, particularly if you have a cold, adds Mr Murty. 'When you pluck, you're pulling the root out, which leaves a hole in the skin - that's a potential source of infection, so you may want to avoid plucking when there's lots of infections around'. Surprisingly, the tip of the nose technically has the most dense patch of hair on the body. We're born with all our hair follicles - 5 million of them. As we grow into adults, the hair on our limbs becomes spaced out, but the tip of the nose stays a relatively similar size, explains Professor Tobin. DOES A HAIRY CHEST IMPLY INTELLIGENCE? Those who are particularly hairy - such as the actor Tom Selleck (pictured) - may have extra sun protection . An ample chest rug has long been seen as a sign of masculinity and good health in a man. And there may be something in it. As boys and girls go through puberty, some of the light, unpigmented hair on their bodies - called vellus hair - becomes thicker and darker, under the influence of hormones such as testosterone and its derivative dihydrotestosterone, becoming what is known as terminal hair. As men tend to have higher levels of these hormones, they usually have more terminal hair, and in more areas than a woman, such as the face, abdomen and chest. So when a man has a good smattering of chest hair it could be a sign that he has healthy levels of testosterone, says Nida Chammas, a consultant endocrinologist at BMI The Clementine Churchill Hospital, Harrow. However, not having much chest hair does not mean a man is unhealthy, she adds - it can be simply down to your genes. Someone with less obvious body hair may have perfectly healthy levels of male hormones, but the receptors in the skin are less responsive to them. Some research links the hairiness of a man's chest to his intelligence. In the Nineties, Aikarakudy Alias, a U.S. psychiatrist, claimed that hairy chests are more likely to be found among doctors than the general population - he found 45 per cent of male trainee doctors were 'very hairy' compared with less than 10 per cent of men generally. But Professor Tobin is sceptical, saying unless factors such as race, ethnicity and socio-economic status were ruled out, such findings were meaningless. Women who use hair removal creams around their bikini line may find they are more prone to thrush . WHY IT PAYS TO STAY AU NATUREL . Another function of hair is it provides a 'slippage zone', preventing chafing in areas where skin surfaces rub against one another. Ironically, these are often areas where people may be most keen to be hair-free - such as the armpits and bikini area. 'Even the finest hair coverage on the body provides this glide buffer zone,' says Professor Tobin. 'So, some people who shave under their arms find it's uncomfortable to move their arms against the side of their body - like a carpet burn.' Meanwhile, women who use hair removal creams around their bikini line may find they are more prone to thrush, a common yeast infection that causes itching, irritation and discharge, says Austin Ugwumadu, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at St George's Hospital, London. 'Some people may have allergies to these products. An allergic reaction may then precipitate inflammation which triggers an episode of thrush.' Repeated hair removal in this area, whatever the method, can sometimes cause a minor infection called folliculitis - disrupting the hair follicle may allow bacteria to get into the hair's root. 'Because there is a high concentration of follicles in this area, and increased sweat (on which bacteria feed), the chances of an infection are higher,' says Mr Ugwumadu. HAIRY TOES MAY MEAN GOOD CIRCULATION . Losing the hair on the feet - and also the lower leg - can be a symptom of peripheral artery disease . It's rarely considered an attractive feature, but hair on your toes could be a sign that your circulation is in good working order. Constantinos Kyriakides, a consultant vascular surgeon at Barts Health NHS Trust, explains: 'Losing the hair in the feet - and also the lower leg - can be a symptom of peripheral artery disease.' In this common condition, a build-up of deposits in the leg arteries restricts blood supply to the leg muscles. Patients with it are more likely to have heart disease, too. Hair follicles need a good blood supply for nutrients and oxygen. 'If you get a blockage in the circulation in the legs, it means less oxygen will reach the bottom of the leg - far away from the heart - so the hair follicles there will suffer the most.' However, some people simply aren't very hairy on their toes anyway, and they don't need to worry. 'It's only a sign of poor circulation if you had hair there in the first place,' says Mr Kyriakides. Such hair loss usually happens to people for whom peripheral artery disease is quite advanced - an earlier symptom is pain in the calves when walking. Leaving underarm hair intact may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partne . THINK BEFORE YOU PRUNE YOUR EARS . Hairs in the outer portion of the ear canal prevent dust and other particles from entering the ear. However, excess hair in the ears may collect wax, which can block the ear canal and hamper hearing - so if you are prone to build-ups of ear wax you may want to consider trimming these hairs. But this may affect your hearing, according to Dr Kewal Krishan, an anthropologist at Panjab University, Chandigarh, India. He suggests there are two types of tiny sensory hairs which help transmit sound signals to the brain. Those in the outer ear boost soft sounds and reduce the loud sounds, while those in the inner ear transmit the sound waves to the auditory nerve. Writing in the journal Medical Hypotheses, Dr Krishan suggests very hairy ears could confer better hearing. However, ENT experts are deeply sceptical. LOVELORN? HAIRY ARMPITS MAY HELP . Another argument for leaving underarm hair intact is that it may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partner. As Professor Tobin says: 'In other mammals, body hair is very important for dispersing odours, such as pheromones - chemicals that can help to attract mates. 'Whether humans have them too is a controversial area, but shaving your underarm hair could mean that odours are not dispersed into the air so quickly.' PS. GO EASY ON THE FAKE EYELASHES . Good news for bushy-browed Cara Delevingne - the thicker your eyebrows, the better protected your eyes are from sweat and other particles. Eyelashes, too, are important for keeping dust out of eyes, as well as helping them stay moist. 'They redirect air flow over the eye lid and keep it out of the eyeball, stopping it drying out,' explains Professor Tobin. However, you don't want eyelashes that are too long. A recent study from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the U.S. found that if they are any longer than a third of the width of your eye, they'll actually increase the air flow around the eye and have a drying effect.","Miley Cyrus challenged convention and left her underarms unshaved .

"Target: Groups of men and women were asked whether they would kill a young Hitler (pictured above aged 25) to prevent WWII . It is a classic question of morality - if you could travel back in time and prevent the Second World War by killing a young Hitler, would you? You could hypothetically save millions of lives - but at the cost of personally murdering someone who had yet to do anything wrong. The answer, according to a recent scientific study, has a lot to do with your gender; and women are far more reluctant to cause any harm in the short term in order to get a better result in the long run. Researchers from Germany, Canada and the United States analysed answers to the Hitler question, and others like it, from 6,100 people. They found that significantly more men than women would kill to save lives further down the line, while women were more troubled by the act itself and would often decide to do nothing. Other dilemmas tested included a scenario where a group of people were hiding from soldiers trying to kill them, but were about to be given away by a baby crying. The choice is whether to smother the child and save the group, or keep it alive and be caught. A third imagined a farming family who had fallen on hard times and had no food to eat. Their only way to avoid starvation would be to have their young daughter carry out sex work for money. The study, published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, grouped the responses into two groups. Those who chose short-term harm to get an overall better result were termed utilitarians. The other group, for whom the ends could not justify the means, were called deontologists. Differences: The study revealed that women are more reluctant than men to do something harmful in the short-term to secure a better result in the long term (file photo) Hard times: Another question imagined that the only way out of poverty and stavation was making a young girl do sex work for money (file photo) The scientists found that men were moderately more likely to fall into the utilitarian camp, while in women there was a very pronounced trend to go the opposite way. Other data also suggested that women found the decisions more agonizing than the men, who had relatively straightforward time coming to their conclusion. Rebecca Friesdorf, one of the researchers, who is based at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, Canada, said that the results seem to show women employ more emotion making their decisions, while men go more on logic alone. As the women had stronger, competing urges in each scenario, they found the dilemmas more difficult. Explaining her study to NPR, she said: 'Women seem to be feeling more equal levels of both emotion and cognition. They seem to be experiencing similar levels of both, so it's more difficult for them to make their choice.'","Researchers in USA, Canada and Germany analyzed 6,100 responses .

Whichever way they decided, women also found the decisions harder .

"A woman who launched a social media campaign in a bid to return a sentimental ring which she found snorkeling in Bali has found the owner who is amazingly from the same part of Australia. Roxy Walsh, 34, met with the ecstatic owners, Joe and Jenny Langley, in Noosa, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, on Sunday to personally return the ring to the couple after less than week of searching. 'In my mind I thought I'd be going to New York or Italy or somewhere... Instead I ended up just driving myself three hours to Noosa,' Ms Walsh told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Roxy was able to reunite the ring with the rightful owners Jenny (right) and Joe (centre) after their granddaughter, Jade (left) found the social media campaign on Facebook . The snorkeler who discovered a sentimental ring at a Bali resort has found the owner of the gold jewellery . Ms Walsh, from Palm Beach has also gotten the ring clean ahead of her meet with the couple on Sunday . Ms Walsh found the ring at the Finns Beach Club in South Kuta, Bali on Tuesday and decided to take to social media to hunt for the owner. 'In one night 600 or 700 people had shared it just from the media website, Kids in Adelaide,' she said. 'So I thought, this can go further, and it did.' After creating a 'Find Joe and Jenny' Facebook page, within a week, The Langley's granddaughter Jade, messaged the page saying she believes the ring belongs to her grandpa and that they lived under 300 kilometres away from Ms Walsh. 'The amazing thing is, out of the thousands of messages I got through the Facebook page, Jade's was the only one claiming the ring,' she said. Over 6000 users joined the page and followed the journey of reuniting the ring back to its' mystery owner . Ms Walsh met with the pair in Noosa on Sunday and returned sentimental ring . Queensland resident Roxy Walsh recovered the gold jewellery at the Finns Beach Club in Bali on Tuesday . 'I never thought that I'd find the owners or I thought that I'd really have to try so when I got her message I didn't have the feeling that I'd found them.' Ms Walsh was skeptical until the next day when she spoke to Mr Langley himself and instantly knew this man was the owner of the sentimental ring. After speaking on the phone, Joe sent photos from their Bali trip nine months ago where they had lost it in the exact same place that Ms Walsh had found it. The gold piece of jewellery was an anniversary gift from his wife,  and was inscribed with ‘Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009, Love Jenny’. Mr Langley had been swimming at the same resort in Bali when he got caught in a strong current and only escaped after clambering up some rocks. It wasn't until he later looked at a photo of himself, that he noticed the ring was missing. Roxy Walsh shared a photo of a gold ring she found on Facebook in the hope of finding its owner . Roxy Walsh (pictured in Bali) found the ring while snorkelling at Finns Beach Club in Bali on April . Ms Walsh found the ring at the Finns Beach Club in Bali on Tuesday and decided to take to social media . 'It hadn't come off his finger until that day,' Ms Walsh said. The 34-year-old credits the international Facebook shares for the finding of jewellery's owner. 'I cannot believe this, but WE have found Joe and Jenny!!' Ms Walsh wrote on Facebook on Friday. 'I have spoken to Joe and he is over the moon that this special ring has been found and I am personally handing it back this weekend. 'What a crazy couple of days with an even crazier ending.

The post has been shared more than 250,000 times, taking the search for the special ring global. ‘Sometimes hear of these things finding their way home so worth a shot,’ Ms Walsh wrote. The social media page amazingly made it to Russia, England, Malta, Brazil and Chile among others. But the incredible fact that Joe and Jenny reside a three hour drive from Ms Walsh means they will keep in touch . 'We will see each other again,' Ms Walsh said. 'They are definitely on the Christmas card list.'","Queensland woman Roxy Walsh found an inscribed gold ring in Bali .

"Russia is considering bailing out Greece in exchange for the country’s ‘assets’, it was reported last night. Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s prime minister, will meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow today, amid reports that the Kremlin will offer controversial loans and discounts on supplies of natural gas in a bid to lessen its dependence on the West . The visit will raise fears the radical left government is looking east in search of alternative sources of finance as it bids to avoid bankruptcy. Scroll down for video . Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s prime minister, will meet Vladimir Putin (pictured earlier this week) in Moscow today, amid reports that the Kremlin will offer controversial loans and discounts on supplies of natural gas . Ahead of his visit, Mr Tsipras condemned the West’s economic sanctions on Moscow as ‘a road to nowhere’. But Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, has already warned it would be ‘unacceptable’ if Mr Tsipras ‘jeopardised Europe’s common policy on Russia’ in return for Kremlin aid. Kommersant newspaper quoted an anonymous Russian government source last night saying that lines of credit were being offered. ‘We’re ready to consider the question of providing Greece discounts on gas: the price for it is tied to the cost of oil which has significantly fallen in recent months,’ the source said. ‘We are also ready to discuss the possibility of granting Greece new loans. But here we, in turn, are interested in reciprocal moves – in particular, in Russia receiving particular assets in Greece.’ Yesterday Greece demanded more than £200billion in compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War. The government unveiled its final calculation for the war reparations stemming from occupation by the Third Reich. The radical left Syriza party says Germany owes Greece nearly 279billion euros, or £204billion to compensate it for looting and war crimes. The German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago. Greece’s defence minister said it had obtained ‘stunning evidence’ to support its massive claims for reparations. Panos Kammenos said the country had obtained records held by the US military that review the extent of damage to private and public property during the Nazi occupation. Ahead of his meeting with Putin, Mr Tsipras (pictured) condemned the West’s economic sanctions on Moscow as ‘a road to nowhere’. Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt in a matter of days . The demand comes just days before Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt to the International Monetary Fund. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has said the country ‘intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum’. Greece suffered a brutal occupation at the hands Adolf Hitler’s forces in 1941. More than 40,000 people are believed to have starved to death in Athens alone. Yesterday a parliamentary committee established by Mr Tsipras for the first time put an official number on the reparations claim. It includes the cost of a 10billion euro forced Nazi loan made by the Bank of Greece and the return of archaeological treasures. The revised figures amount to nearly 10 per cent of Germany’s GDP. Mr Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month. He has called the reparations question a ‘moral and ethical’ issue for his country. The new figure was revealed yesterday by Greek deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas. ‘According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros,’ he told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece’s debt crisis. Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece’s state general accounting office. Berlin paid 115m deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation – a fraction of the Greek demand. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raised the issue of compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month (pictured) Greece says this did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan. Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990 legally and politically before Germany reunified. Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for the hardship suffered by Greeks under the tough bailout conditions imposed by international lenders. Ministers have floated the idea of seizing German assets in the country to compensate the families of victims of Nazi war crimes. A poll carried for Greek radio found more than 80 per cent of Greeks agreed with the pusuit of Nazi war debt claims. Yesterday Greek MPs also voted to establish a committee examining the circumstances of its 2010 bail-out by eurozone creditors and the IMF to the tune of 240billion euros. ‘After five years of parliamentary silence on the major issues that caused the bailout catastrophe, today we commence a procedure that will give answers to the questions concerning the Greek people,’ Mr Tsipras said. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has claimed the economy was unfairly lumbered with the liabilities that it is now struggling to pay off as its coffers run empty. He has claimed Europe dealt with his country’s bankruptcy by ‘loading the largest loan in human history on the weakest of shoulders - the Greek taxpayer’.","Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s prime minister, will meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow .

"Afghanistan's first female pilot to serve in the air force since the fall of the Taliban has been honoured with the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award. Niloofar Rahmani, 23, has defied death threats from the terror group and even members of her own extended family to become the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and the first female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Captain Rahmani and nine other inspirational women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award 2015 at a ceremony last week. Scroll down for video . Captain Niloofar Rahmani, 23, (pictured) is the first female female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 . Last week she and nine other women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award . Captain Rahmani is the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and has received death threats from the Taliban . She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit  pilots. Captain Rahmani said that ever since she was a little girl she had dreamed of becoming a pilot and spent nearly a year studying English in order to be able to attend flight school. She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant. She flew her first solo flight in a Cessna 182 and decided she wanted to fly even larger aircraft so she attended advanced flight school and was soon flying the C-208 military cargo aircraft. While women are traditionally banned from transporting dead or wounded soldiers Captain Rahmani defied orders when she discovered injured soldiers when she landed during a mission. She flew the injured men to hospital and reported her actions to her superiors who chose not to impose sanctions on her. When her achievements were publicised Captain Rahmani's family received threats from both family members and the Taliban, who disapproved of her ambition and career choices. She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit pilots and immediately applied . She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant . The family has been forced to move several times for safety reasons. But Captain Rahmani is resolute and says she eventually aims to become a flight instructor to inspire other women and in spite of the Taliban's threats says she remains determined to continue her career in the Afghan Air Force and work as frequently as her security situation permits. She is also deeply committed to encouraging other young women to join the cadre of female AAF pilots. 'You can't just see yourself as a woman, but as a human and believe in yourself,' Captain Rahmani told WTKR. 'It was not easy finishing flight school, it was very hard, but someone had to accept the risk so that other women can do what they dream.' At the award ceremony last week First Lady Michelle Obama honored Rahmani's bravery, commitment, and empowerment of women and girls in Afghanistan. Established in 2007, the annual Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award honors women around the globe who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women’s equality, and social progress, often at great personal risk.

"Robert Knowles, 68, is a serial shoplifter who has clocked up nearly 350 offences since 1959 . Britain's most persistent crook with a criminal career spanning 50 years has been jailed again after his 190th court appearance. Robert Knowles, 68, from Plymouth, Devon, is a serial shoplifter who first broke the law when he was 13 and has been in court at least once a year since 1959. The pensioner has broken the law so many times that prosecutors have lost track of his expansive record, which includes 200 thefts and dozens more for other dishonest offences. It is believed Knowles has now clocked up in the region of 350 offences over his lifetime. He pleaded guilty to stealing a watch and a pair of cuff links worth £50 from H Samuel in the city centre at Plymouth Magistrates Court in his most recent offence and jailed for 16 weeks. The court heard he had only recently been released from a six week jail sentence imposed by the same court and was told he must pay an £80 victim surcharge. Knowles, who has spent most of his adult life in prison, had been living briefly in a hostel in Plymouth before the thefts on March 14. Defence lawyers say the pensioner only goes between 24 and 72 hours before he is rearrested after each court appearance. 'Nobody knows why he does it,' his long-term solicitor Alan Harris said. 'Nobody knows whether he is effectively waiting to die in prison.' At a previous court hearing, Mr Harris told magistrates Knowles is an alcoholic who 'recognises himself as institutionalised' and steals to go back to jail. In 2013 he was caught stealing two boxes of chocolate from Thorntons but despite eating the £13 chocolates in the street, a security guard let him off with a warning. He then went to a nearby Tesco Metro and walked out with £26 of food - prompting staff to call police. And in 2011, Knowles admitted stealing two bottles of whiskey, watches and socks worth £279 from Marks and Spencer. During that hearing at the same court, Mr Harris said: ‘He can cope very easily with prison but cannot cope very well with the world outside. 'This is as bleak a plea and mitigation as this court can ever wish to hear.’ Knowles left prison six months later and committed another shoplifting offence within a week, this time stealing a watch, sunglasses, underwear and socks worth £79. He pleaded guilty to stealing a watch and a pair of cuff links worth £50 from H Samuel in the city centre at Plymouth Magistrates Court in his most recent offence and jailed for 16 weeks . The Crown Prosecution Service cannot give a full breakdown of his offences because so many of them they pre-date its creation in 1986. Knowles, who was sent to a correctional school in 1959, has been one of several criminals to win the dubious honour of being named 'Britain's most prolific thief'. Those with an even worse record include Bolton kleptomaniac Harry Hankinson, 64 - who in June blamed his 501 crimes on a blow to the head in 1970 which changed his personality. And in March David Archer, from Prestatyn, North Wales, clocked up his 343rd offence - just edging out competition from Knowles.","Robert Knowles, 68, from Plymouth, first broke the law when he was just 13 .

"An terrified asthma sufferer was left coughing up blood after accidentally inhaling an earring into her lungs. The 41-year-old woman was getting ready for a  party to celebrate the New Year when she started to wheeze. Worried her asthma would get worse and ruin the festivities, she reached into her bag for her inhaler, according to doctors writing in the journal BMJ Case reports. Her blue salbutamol inhaler was uncapped in her bag, and she heard a ‘coarse rattle’ when she shook it. Despite this, she ignored the noise, believing it was due to a loose connection inside the device. The 41-year-old Australian woman had a medical emergency on New Year's Eve after inhaling an earring into her lungs. An X-ray shows the earring lodged in her right bronchus - the airway leading to the lungs . Doctors put a thin tube with a camera on the end known as an endoscope into the woman's lung, which showed the earring was covered in mucus (pictured) She took a deep inspiration, but immediately felt a painful scratch in her throat. She began coughing up blood, wheezing and became short of breath, and was rushed by ambulance to the A&E department of St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, the report said. When she arrived, doctors ordered a chest X-ray, and saw something was wrong straight away. There was a mass that had ‘features consistent with a stud earring’, and a CT scan confirmed the earring was stuck in the woman’s right bronchus, one of the two main airways leading to the lungs. Doctors prescribed antibiotics to prevent any infection and then put a long, thin tube with a camera on the end into her throat - in a procedure known as an endoscopy. They were then able to examine the earring and remove it. They found large amounts of mucus around the earring, which was ‘the body’s attempt to expel the foreign body’ Dr Lucinda Blake, one of the doctors who treated the woman, told LiveScience. Alison Hall, 48, almost choked to death when she swallowed a false nail that shot out of her inhaler when she took a puff . If they had waited to remove the earring, the woman's body might have healed over the earring, embedding it within the bronchus, Dr Blake added. The woman made a full recovery, but in the report, doctors said her case highlights the need for people with asthma to be told about the dangers of storing their inhaler without a cap. Writing in the report, doctors concluded: ‘The importance of replacing caps on inhalers when not in use is illustrated and should be encouraged when inhaler technique is taught or reviewed.’ The news comes after MailOnline reported on the case of Alison Hall, 48, who almost choked to death when she nearly swallowed a false nail that had shot out of her inhaler when she took a breath. Ms Hall, 48, was at work when she felt her chest tightening and took out her blue salbutamol inhaler. She took a sharp breath and felt something shoot to the back of her throat where it became lodged. The mother-of-one ran outside in a panic when a neighbour came to her rescue and began pounding her back before calling 999. After five minutes of choking, a false nail finally came loose from the back of her throat and fell out onto the pavement. She believes the nail may have worked its way inside the inhaler through a gap at the top, and is now urging others to check their inhalers before use .","Australian woman felt a wheeze and took a breath on her uncapped inhaler .

"Life expectancy for older women has fallen after decades of rises as unhealthy lifestyles and cuts to social care take their toll . Life expectancy for older women has fallen after decades of rises as unhealthy lifestyles and cuts to social care take their toll. The predicted life spans of women aged 65, 75, 85 and 95 fell in 2012 – the first time since 1995 that falls in all four age groups were recorded. By 2013, the average 75-year-old woman could expect to live another 13 years and five weeks – five weeks less than in 2011, a Government report shows. For a woman aged 85, the expected span was six years and 42 weeks – two and a half months less. The study also found that increasing life expectancy for men in their sixties and seventies had stalled, and had fallen for those in their eighties and nineties. If the change becomes a trend, it could mark the end of an expectation by baby boomers that they will continue to live longer and longer. Life expectancy for English women is already among the worst in Western Europe. The findings will add to fears that the rising consumption of alcohol and unhealthy food is taking a terrible toll. Poor standards in many care homes and reduced home help could also prompt early deaths, experts say. The deterioration follows three decades in which annual average life expectancy has increased by 1.2 per cent for men aged 65 and 0.7 per cent for women. The study by Public Health England said it was too early to say whether the change was a long-term one. Professor John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said: ‘One of the issues we have seen is women living lifestyle’s becoming more like those of men over recent decades, with more smoking and drinking.’ Scroll down for video . He also suggested the falls could reflect cutbacks in social care, which he said had been ‘hammered’ in recent years. Recent governments had failed to invest in care for an ageing population, Professor Ashton said, leaving insufficient help for the frail and vulnerable. He added: ‘There has been a failure of successive governments in that we should have seen that trends were changing, that more people would be living longer and we needed to put services in place to look after them. ‘We are letting down a generation which came back from the war and built the welfare state.’ By 2013, the average 75-year-old woman could expect to live another 13 years and five weeks – five weeks less than in 2011, a Government report shows . Public Health England said the fall among women aged 65 was the first since 1995, while that among those aged 75 had not been seen for nine years. It called the falls statistically significant. Since then, the figures for women in their sixties have recovered to their 2011 level, but the 2013 statistics for older women remained worse than those two years earlier. It means average life expectancy for a women of 85 is now two and a half months shorter than in 2011. Health officials need a third year’s data to establish whether the figures from 2012 and 2013 mean life expectancy is levelling off or entering a more worrying decline. The report said: ‘Within England, although female life expectancy at all four ages fell in 2012, and for males it fell at ages 85 and 95 and remained static at ages 65 and 75, it is too early to say whether this represents a slowing in the upward trend or the start of a downward trend.’ Public Health England said the impact of the recession could be one reason why life expectancy fell in several European countries. Flu outbreaks and cold winters may also be to blame. Caroline Abrahams, of the charity Age UK, said: ‘This decrease in life expectancy, after many years of improvement, is like the canary in the coal mine. It is telling us that something has changed for the worse, so that fewer people are thriving in later life than they could or should. ‘The most likely culprit is the rapid decline of state-funded social care in recent years, which is leaving hundreds of thousands of older people to struggle on alone at home without any help. 'This decrease in life expectancy, after many years of improvement, is like the canary in the coal mine' ‘More and more older people are living with several incurable conditions and illnesses. Determined action now to sustain social care and to support older people with multiple long-term health conditions more effectively can hopefully make this a blip, rather than the start of a terrible trend.’ Despite the new figures, a 65-year-old man in the UK can expect to live 18 years and six months – still almost five and a half more years than 30 years ago. A woman of the same age can expect 21 more years – a gain of almost four years in the last three decades. Men of 75 can now expect to live 11 years and 15 weeks, with 13 years five weeks for women, while at 85, men can expect five years and 42 weeks, and women six years and 42 weeks.","Predicted life spans of women aged 65, 75, 85 and 95 fell in 2012 .

"The desperate parents of a boy whose head hangs at a 180-degree angle have admitted they would rather he died than continue to suffer. Mahendra Ahirwar, 12, from Madhya Pradesh in central India, suffers from a rare condition that makes his neck bend and his head hang from his body. His weak backbone means he can't stand or walk and is  restricted to a sitting position. Mahendra can just about crawl but needs help to eat and go to the toilet. Undiagnosed: Mahendra Ahirwar's parents say they would rather see him dead than suffer the way he is now . Mahendra's mother Sumitra Ahirwar, pictured here with her son, says watching his life is 'devastating' His father Mukesh Ahirwar, 40, and mother Sumitra Ahirwar, 35, who both work as labourers when they can, say they have consulted more than 50 doctors across India but none could diagnose his condition. ‘I cannot see him suffer anymore,' said Sumitra. 'Watching his life is devastating. 'He cannot do anything by himself. He just sits in a corner of the room all day. It's no life.' She added: 'I have to carry him like a baby everywhere but he is 12 years old, how will I carry him when he grows even older?' ‘If doctors cannot treat my son it is better that God takes him.’ Shockingly, members of the community have blamed Mahendra's condition on Mukesh's past sins and believe he is to blame for his son's disability. Sumitra, who also has healthy 16 and 10-year-old sons and a 14-year-old daughter, did not visit a doctor when she was pregnant with Mahendra. Family: Mahendra pictured with his mother Sumitra (left), sister Manisha (second from left), and brothers Surendra (second from right) and Lalit (right) Mukesh (pictured left carrying his son) has borrowed money from friends and relatives to help find medical treatment for Mahendra (left and right) Mukesh said: ‘Our other children had all been born normally with no problems so we never thought to consult a doctor or have an ultrasound done with Mahendra, and he was born at home just like his siblings.' The couple only noticed their son’s head was starting to hang when he was about six months old. 'At first we thought he was just a little weak and he'd be fine in time, but by his third birthday he wasn't able to keep his head upright at all,' his father explained. Mukesh, who earns about Rs200 (£2) a day on construction sites, has borrowed money from his friends and relatives to help find medical treatment for his son. But he said two years ago he decided to stop taking Mahendra to see any doctors, adding: 'I took him to all the hospitals that I could afford. 'Even India's premier hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences  in New Delhi, but after spending two weeks there doctors failed to tell us if my son could be treated. ‘With a broken heart we returned home and decided to raise him and try to give him as comfortable a life that we can.' Mahendra pictured with his father Mukesh (left),  mother Sumitra (seated) and brothers Lalit (centre) and Surendra (second from left) Sumitra has now lost all hope of a treatment being found for her son and says: 'If doctors cannot treat my son it is better that God takes him' Mukesh added: 'People say bad things about him, and they often laugh at him. It really hurts us. 'We cannot tolerate people's attitudes and discrimination. They say I must have committed some terrible sins and this is why he is suffering, it’s awful.' Mahendra doesn't go to school so his only friends are his siblings and his cousins. Dr Shashidhar Tatavarthy, an ear, nose and throat consultant at Delhi's Artemis Hospital, thinks Mahendra has a muscular disorder. He said: ‘This is one of the rarest of rare cases. His condition could be due to a spine anomaly or muscular disorder, but it can only be concluded after a thorough investigation.' Mukesh is still hoping for a miracle. 'If doctors can treat babies born with severe disabilities like two heads and give them lifesaving operations then why not my son?' he said. 'I still have so many hopes and dreams for him. I want to see him go to school and play with other kids. I want to see him living a normal life and I am hoping that my wish will be fulfilled one day.'","Mahendra Ahirwar, 12,  has a bent neck and his head hangs from his body .

"A French television network has been hacked by people claiming allegiance to ISIS, forcing it to broadcast only pre-recorded programmes. The hackers completely cut transmission of 11 channels belonging to Paris-based TV5 Monde and took over its websites and social media accounts for a full three hours early this morning. The channel's director, Yves Bigot, said the attack was continuing this morning. He told RTL radio that the network has restored its signal but can only broadcast recorded programs, not live content. Chilling: The ISIS hackers completely cut transmission of 11 channels belonging to Paris-based TV5 Monde and took over its websites and social media accounts for a full three hours early this morning. Sick: The hackers posted documents on TV5Monde's Facebook page purporting to be the identity cards and CVs of relatives of French soldiers involved in anti-ISIS operation in Iraq . Mr Bigot said he was shaken when he saw 11 channels with a black screen 'and when we discovered the sense of the message appearing on our social media and our websites, it both allowed us to understand what was happening and obviously worried us.' 'We can only broadcast pre-recorded programmes. We are not yet in a position to re-establish our broadcasting schedule nor to produce programmes,' Bigot added. The hackers posted documents on TV5Monde's Facebook page purporting to be the identity cards and CVs of relatives of French soldiers involved in anti-ISIS operation in Iraq. It also reportedly made specific threats against French troops. 'Soldiers of France, stay away from the Islamic State! You have the chance to save your families, take advantage of it,' read one message on TV5Monde's Facebook page. 'The CyberCaliphate continues its cyberjihad against the enemies of Islamic State,' the message added. Fear: The channel's director, Yves Bigot, said the attack was continuing this morning. He told RTL radio that the network has restored its signal but can only broadcast recorded programs, not live content . Militants: France is part of a US-led military coalition carrying out air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria, where the jihadist group (pictured) has seized swathes of territory and declared an Islamic 'caliphate . Almost 1,500 French nationals are currently fighting in Syria and Iraq - making up a staggering 47 per cent of the European fighters currently waging jihad in the region. Senator Jean-Pierre Sueur, who has led an investigation into French extremists, told local media that intelligence officials are also monitoring more than 3,000 people suspected of being involved in Syrian networks. That marks a 24 per cent increase in the five months since November, The Local reported. In total 85 French nationals are thought to have been killed fighting in ISIS-held areas in Syria and Iraq. Two more are said to be detained in Syria, although Sueur did not elaborate on who held them or why they were in the country. The most pressing concern, however, are the estimated 200 jihadis who have since returned to France after leaving Syria or Iraq. The worry is that these potentially highly-trained killers could be willing and able to carry Charlie Hebdo-style terror attacks in France. Sueur added that French prisons are currently holding 152 known Islamic extremists. TV5Monde regained control of its social networks by 2:00 am this morning but television broadcasts were likely to take hours, if not days, to return to normal. The attack would have required weeks of preparation, Bigot said. Late last night Bigot told the AFP news agency: 'We are no longer able to broadcast any of our channels. Our websites and social media sites are no longer under our control and are all displaying claims of responsibility by Islamic State.' The website was still offline by 9:00am local time today, displaying an 'under maintenance' note to visitors. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the hack was an 'unacceptable attack on the freedom of information and expression', voicing 'total solidarity with the editorial staff.' The hackers had accused French President Francois Hollande of committing 'an unforgivable mistake' by getting involved in 'a war that serves no purpose'. 'That's why the French received the gifts of Charlie Hebdo and Hyper Cacher in January,' it said on the broadcaster's Facebook page, referring to the twin attacks by Islamist gunmen in Paris that left 17 people dead over three days and deeply shocked France.

A picture taken earlier this morning shows an empty newsroom at French television network TV5Monde . Jihadists have become increasingly adept at using the Internet to spread propaganda and attack media outlets. In Feburary, the Twitter feed of Newsweek was briefly hacked and threats were made against President Barack Obama's family. And in the immediate aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, hackers claiming to be Islamists hijacked hundreds of French websites, flooding them with jihadist propaganda. France is part of a US-led military coalition carrying out air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria, where the jihadist group has seized swathes of territory and declared an Islamic 'caliphate'. More than 1,500 French nationals have left France to join the militants' ranks in Iraq and Syria, where they represent almost half the number of European fighters present, according to a report released Wednesday by the French Senate. TV5Monde is broadcast in more than 200 countries worldwide.","Islamic extremists targeted 11 television channels belonging to  TV5 Monde .

"A Pole with convictions for violence was on his way to Britain from Calais when he snatched a schoolgirl in front of her mother before raping and murdering her, it emerged today. Zbigniew Huminski, 38, has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe, yesterday afternoon in France ‘while drunk’. She was stripped naked and sexually assaulted and after being forced into Huminski’s car and then driven to an isolated wood once used as a camp for illegal migrants bound for the UK. Scroll down for video . On his way to Britain: Zbigniew Huminski (left), 38, has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe (right), yesterday afternoon in France ‘while drunk’ Horrifying: The little girl's naked body was found in the woods near Calais 90 minutes after she was taken . Chloe’s mother, named only as Isabelle, ‘heard her daughter’s screams’ as she was being taken away from outside her school in Calais - but was unable to do anything. Jean Pierre Valensi, the prosecutor of nearby Boulogne-sur-Mer, said Huminski was arrested hours later and ‘immediately recognised his involvement in the murder of the child.’ DNA evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed ‘strangulation and sexual violence’, said Mr Valensi. Tests also showed Huminski was over the alcohol limit for driving. Huminski had been banned from French territory after being convicted twice for acts of ‘extreme violence’ including attacking a frail pensioner with a knife. But he had driven to France in a Polish registered car this week, and intended to travel to Britain to stay with family who had emigrated there, said Mr Valensi. Chloe was playing with a friend on Wednesday afternoon when she approached Huminski, who had stopped his car to drink a beer, and squirted him with her water pistol. Remembered: Relatives of Chloe are joined in a march in Calais today following the nine-year-old girl's death . Walking together: The Mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart (right) and the mother (centre) of Chloe, identified only as Isabelle, leave Calais city hill with relatives today . The Pole later told French Police that he grabbed her and forced her into his red Seat Toledo before driving her three miles to the nearby Dubrulle Wood. Isabelle, who had left briefly to take her son to a sports match, began screaming the moment she saw the man, described by witnesses as bald and wearing sunglasses, pushing Chloe into his car. The car, which had Polish number plates, was found by police near where Chloe was killed. Isabelle did not even have time to reach Chloe's father so they could launch a formal missing persons appeal before her body was discovered. 'I've begun to understand I will never see Chloe again,' Isabelle told Le Parisien. 'It's tough. Very hard. Above all, I do not know when or how I'm going to tell his little sister and little brother. They are only five and four years old, I do not know if they can understand.' Huminski, who is single, originally moved to France in the early 2000s, and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the Foreign Legion as a soldier. He was rejected because of his criminal background, and then said he wanted to go and live with his sister in England. Huminski was on his way to Southampton, where his sister lives, French prosecutors confirmed tonight. Flowers: Ms Bouchart (left) comforts Isabelle (right), as relatives and people gather during a march in Calais . Emotional day: A person holds a portrait during a march in Calais in homage to the nine-year-old girl . In 2009 he was lodging in Calais with a Bulgarian immigrant when he attacked a pensioner in her own home, tying her up, before running away with the equivalent of £50 in cash. Psychiatric reports presented in court portrayed Huminiski as a ‘chronic alcoholic’ known for violent burglaries in both France and Britain. He was last convicted in France in April 2010, when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault, before being released early on March 27, 2014, when he was deported to Warsaw. Chloe is said to have pointed a water pistol at Huminski as part of a childish game before he bundled her into the back of his red Seat Toledo at about 3.30pm yesterday, the prosecutor said. The child’s body was found around two hours later, three miles away in the Dubrulle Wood. Sadness: Women place flowers at a playground in the neighbourhood where Chloe was taken yesterday . Distraught: Today people laid flowers at the place where the girl was snatched by the Polish man (pictured) Until a few weeks ago, it was the site of a large immigrant camp, made up of mainly men trying to get aboard ferries sailing to the south coast of England. Such camps are regularly razed by the French authorities, with the migrants moved on. Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, said: ‘I was informed at 4.30pm that a young girl was abducted by a man in a red car as she left school in the Chateaubriand area of Calais, at around 3.30pm. A city security chief found an empty red car registered in Poland in Dubrulle Wood, in the north of the city. ‘He then called the police, who found the body of the girl in the woods. During the same patrol, they found the person who owned the vehicle, apparently a Polish national.’ The mayor has been at the forefront of a campaign to clear out all illegal migrants from her city, saying they are behind all kinds of crimes in the region. Tragic decision: Chloe's mother had let her continue playing in Calais because it was nice outside . Shocking: Prosecutor Jean-Pierre Valensi (pictured) said forensic investigators reported evidence of 'strangulation and sexual violence', and that the Polish man in question had admitted to the killing . The mother of a child who went to school with Chloe told Agence France-Presse: ‘It's horrific. My son knew her, he didn't sleep last night. He knows he will never see her again. I can't even imagine what the parents are going through.’ French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for light to be shed on the suspect's history, saying the family and community were 'deeply shocked' by the murder. 'It is up to the legal system now to carry out the investigation and what we owe to the family is the whole truth,' he said. Calais was plunged into mourning after the killing of the girl described as 'cheerful and full of life'. Residents planned a march in memory of Chloe today. Flags in the town were already being flown at half mast. Huminski will now be kept in custody pending a criminal trial for murder.","Girl was playing with friend when Zbigniew Huminski forced her into car .

"A mother whose teenage daughter was tortured to death by her sadistic lover has spoken for the first time of her heartbreak. Margaret Bates, from Mottram, Tameside, said she is still unable to read the autopsy report detailing the 150 injuries her 17-year-old daughter Kelly-Anne suffered at the hands of her violent lover James Smith. Too traumatised to speak about her only daughter's death until now, Mrs Bates, 60, said she is consumed by one thought - that she wished she had killed Smith when she first met him. Margaret and Tommy Bates are speaking about their daughter Kelly-Anne's brutal murder for the first time . Kelly-Anne Bates enjoys time with her friends . Mrs Bates, who has two sons, Andrew, 39, and Paul, 33, said: 'I know I shouldn’t say this, but I wish I’d killed him the first time I saw him. That way Kelly would still be alive.' Over three barbaric weeks, Smith burnt Kelly-Anne with an iron, scalded her with boiling water and even gouged out her eyes. Smith also tied her to a radiator by her hair, broke her arm and knees and stabbed her all over her body with knives, forks and scissors, causing 150 separate injuries before beating her with a shower head and drowning her in the bath. Throughout the horrific onslaught, the terrified teenager was alive, begging for mercy. Smith, who was then 49, got life imprisonment and must serve a minimum of 25 years for his horrific crimes. Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Kelly-Anne's death, but Mrs Bates said even with the passage of time, she and her husband Tommy, 66, are unable to read the post-mortem report which details the injuries their daughter endured. Flashback: Kelly-Anne and her mother Margaret on holiday in Barry Island, Wales . 'Every now and again, I phone the coroner to ask for the post-mortem report but each time I back out. I can't face it - I never will,' she said. Mrs Bates said as a little girl, Kelly-Anne was a tomboy who loved playing football with her friends. She also adored children, and often babysat for neighbours. She said: 'Kelly loved children and wanted to be a teacher. She was soft-hearted and very maternal.' Sadistic killer James Smith . At 14, while babysitting for a friend, Kelly-Anne met James Smith. He began a grooming process which was so secretive that her parents knew nothing about him for two years. When Kelly-Anne was 15, she stayed out over night and her panicked parents called the police. When she finally came home, the following morning, she claimed to have stayed over with a schoolfriend called Rachel. Mrs Bates said: 'I knew she was lying. It wasn't like her, but I'd no idea what was going on. 'Kelly was a good girl. As well as babysitting, she had a job on a market stall at weekends. She played hockey and she was clever at school. She was hard-working and sensible and I could never have dreamed she was being groomed by a monster.' She said Kelly-Anne once arrived home with a black eye and told her parents she had been attacked by a gang of girls in the street. Soon afterwards, Kelly-Anne announced she had a new boyfriend, James Smith, who she said was 32 years old. 'The first time I met him, he swaggered down the stairs and it made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck,' said Mrs Bates. 'He was much older than I expected and this wasn’t the man I wanted for my daughter. I vividly recall seeing our bread knife in the kitchen and wanting to pick it up and stab him in the back. 'It was a bizarre thought - I would never normally think of anything so violent and now I wonder whether it was some sort of sixth sense. 'I’ve thought about that many times.' Kelly-Anne and her brothers Andrew and Paul have some fun on the beach . Margaret Bates said Kelly-Anne was very maternal and here the teenager feeds a baby . Margaret Bates and her only daughter Kelly-Anne as a baby . Mrs Bates called police and social services but because Kelly-Anne was 16 they could not help. She said: 'I didn’t know what do to. She was very strong-minded and she wouldn’t listen to me. And I was worried that, if I fell out with her, it would just push them closer together. 'One night she came home and her face was black and blue. Another time, her hand was bruised. I suspected Smith was hitting her, but Kelly-Anne denied it. 'I rang the police but they said there was nothing they could do without a statement from Kelly.' In November 1995, 17-year-old Kelly-Anne moved in with Smith who lived in Gorton, Manchester. Kelly-Anne gets to grips with crutches after injuring herself as a teenager . She spoke to her parents most weeks on the phone, when Smith was present, but never saw them again. Mrs Bates said: 'In addition to worrying about Kelly-Anne, our youngest son, Paul, was in hospital for weeks and I had a hernia operation too, so our lives were thrown into chaos. 'We even went round to Smith's address to try to persuade her to come home, but he was there all the time. The young Kelly-Anne smiles for the camera . 'On one visit he showed me a hole in his floor boards where he said he'd had a gas leak. 'Just a few weeks later, he kept Kelly prisoner in the hole while he tortured her.' Mrs Bates said she then discovered that Smith was 48 years old - 21 years older than Kelly-Anne. She said she pleaded with Kelly-Anne to leave him, but by now, Smith controlled all their contact. In the weeks before her death, Kelly-Anne endured unimaginable torture while her family - terrified of pushing her even further into Smith’s clutches - waited by the phone. 'In April, I got a Mother's Day card from Kelly in Smith's handwriting and I'd had enough,' she said. 'But I was torn; I didn't want to keep going round there because I thought it was making things worse. 'It haunts me to think if we had gone round there she would be alive today.' Mrs Bates said she contacted the police domestic violence unit and was encouraged to give her daughter its leaflets. Tragically, Mrs Bates was never to see Kelly-Anne again and said she still has the leaflets to this day. On April 16, 1996, Mrs Bates said police arrived to tell them that Kelly-Anne was dead. Kelly-Anne had been starved and had lost more than three stone in weight. Loving tribute: A floral tribute bearing Kelly-Anne's name at her funeral, which took place the day before her 18th birthday . Her body was so badly mutilated that police and pathologists said it was the worst case of abuse they had ever seen. The jury at Smith's trial was offered counselling due to the horrific details of the case. Kelly-Anne was buried the day before her 18th birthday. Smith was jailed for life in November 1997 and during the trial it emerged that he had a horrific history of violence towards women. Mr and Mrs Bates have now set up a local branch of the national support group Support After Murder or Manslaughter (SAMM) for other parents and have found some comfort in helping other families. 'I wish I had killed Smith myself,' added Mrs Bates. 'I want him to die just like Kelly did. Not a day goes by when I don’t think that. 'But he had her in his clutches and I couldn’t save her.'

"Gone are the days when a few strategically-placed tissues was all you needed to give cleavage a boost - now Japanese women are using ribbons. The fad involves women tying a blue ribbon under the breasts and in a loop over the arms, tying them at the back, so every time they lift their arms, their curves become more prominent. The idea was inspired by a popular 'anime' cartoon character whose ribbon-bound arms and chest has become her signature. Scroll down for video . A trend in Japan has seen young women tying blue ribbon under their breasts for a better cleavage . In the show, called Is It Wrong To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon, heroine Hestia is depicted with a cartoonish face and outsized eyes, her hair in long bunches that taper to her thighs. Like her Greek goddess namesake, she wears white - but that's where the comparisons end. Her frock is short, backless, with a plunging neckline and comes with matching white gloves. Added to this is her distinctive blue ribbon, looped tightly around her pneumatic torso, and tied with the bow resting on her upper arm. The trend is inspired by the anime character Hestia from Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon . The ribbon is tied under the breasts and over the arms so that they are uplifted every time the arms are raised . The trend has seen many Japanese women uploading pictures of their successes online . But bizarrely Hestia's signature has taken off with the fans of the show. It has not only been picked up by cosplayers, who like to dress up as their favourite anime characters, but it has also been copied by ordinary girls who have been posting their own Hestia-inspired images online. The trend has even extended to toys and collectable items, with some snaps showing dolls in a copycat costume, and even a Lego figure designed to look remarkably like the anime character. While some women opt for a single loop around their chest and arms, others tie the ribbon once under their breasts and then around once again to rest on the upper arms to give cleavage a bigger boost when lifting their arms. Fans have even created detailed diagrams on how best to tie the ribbon . Both ordinary women and those who practice Cosplay (pictured) have tried the trend .","Women are wearing the ribbon and posting pictures on social media .

"Children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky, plastic Fisher-Price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes. The popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell. But for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters. The child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground . At least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. It is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time. A large amount of research, according to Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors. This graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter . The latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green. Researchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters. They then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990. The results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set. Among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent. The colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row) Red bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent . Synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. Some people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga. There have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition. Reports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence. But among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set. 'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper. 'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.' The authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues – such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role. They also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia. Instead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors .

"A celebrated Texas-born hunter was crushed to death by a baby elephant in Zimbabwe as he tried to measure its ivory tusks for an American client. Ian Gibson, 55, was a lauded figure among U.S. safari enthusiasts, who would commission him to slaughter prized animals near his home in South Africa. On Wednesday, he was tentatively approaching the young bull elephant in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley when the animal charged, and knelt on Gibson until he died. Crushed to death: Ian Gibson, 55, was killed by a young bull elephant while measuring its ivory for a U.S. client . His American client, who was also present, has not been identified. The Dallas Safari Club is paying for Gibson's funeral. Despite only having one leg, Gibson was described by fans as 'fit and strong'. According to a statement from Safari Classics, posted on AfricaHunting.com, the group had stopped for a rest when the animal approached their group. Gibson and his tracker approached to assess its ivory. 'At very close range, Ian was able to get off one shot before the bull killed him. The scene was very graphic,' the statement read. Twitter users were widely pitiless, with hundreds of animal rights supporters commenting that he 'got what he deserved'. Lauded figure: Gibson, who lived in South Africa, was a popular figure in the U.S. safari enthusiast community . Backlash: Twitter users have been widely unsympathetic to Gibson's death in Zimbabwe on Wednesday . Tributes posted on the hunting forum slammed unsympathetic reactions to Gibson's death, describing the big game hunter as a 'magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist.' According to friends, he fired one shot at the young bull elephant, who was going through 'musth' - a period of high testosterone. The animal then charged. Gibson's trackers wrote on AfricaHunting.com: 'We know 'Gibbo' shot it once, from about 10 yards away, with a 458 [rifle]. 'He would never have fired unless he had no alternative. He was a hunter, yes, but he was also a magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist. Prized: Ivory tusks are some of the most prized treasures hunters can get, enraging animal rights supporters . 'He was so experienced and this is a most unexpected tragedy.' The news has come a month after a study was released warning that ivory hunting is continuing to diminish the elephant population in Africa. A report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is known as CITES and regulates wildlife trade, said poaching rates of elephants in areas that are being monitored still exceed their natural birth rates. Conservationists say tens of thousands of elephants have been killed in Africa in recent years as demand for ivory in Asia, particularly China, increases. Past estimates of Africa's elephant population have ranged from 420,000 to 650,000. Prince William is one of the world's most prominent voices in defense of elephants against ivory hunters.","Ian Gibson, 55, was hunting in Zimbabwe for an American client .

"Two Fast and The Furious-style crooks who stole £160,000 worth of luxury cars from homes across four counties have been jailed for more than 10 years. Roy Day, 29, and Gerard Lundie, 26, targeted 13 properties over four months at the end of last year while the owners were asleep in bed. But after the duo left their DNA at the scenes of some of the crimes they were arrested. Roy Day (right), 29, and Gerard Lundie (left), 26, targeted 13 homes over four months at the end of last year . They were each jailed for five years and four months at Birmingham Crown Court after they admitted once charge of conspiracy to commit burglary. The crime spree began on September 18 last year when a Citroen C4 and widescreen TV were stolen from a house in Calshot Road, Great Barr, Birmingham. Lundie was arrested seven days later when the stolen car was seen speeding away from officers at 100mph in Erdington, Birmingham but later let go. He was found hiding in a nearby bush after fleeing the vehicle. He admitted driving the car but denied stealing it or having any knowledge of it being stolen. Lundie was released on bail but continued to target properties in Birmingham, Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire. The duo stole a Kia car from the drive of a property in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, on October 20 which was later found abandoned. Forensic experts discovered Lundie's DNA inside the vehicle which eventually linked the pair to the crime. The pair drove an Audi A6 (pictured) and a Vauxhall Astra from a driveway in Oswestry, Shropshire . Favouring Audis, Day and Lundie stole an Audi A5  (pictured) from a house in Cannock, Staffordshire . Another Kia was stolen from the driveway in Cooksey Lane, Kingstanding, Birmingham in the early hours of October 26. Police enquires showed Day was in the area at the time. The pair organised raids on four more homes in Great Barr, Birmingham and one in Atherstone, Warwickshire, between November 15 and 20. The court heard the crooks stole a Citroen C3, a Kia and a Nissan Qashqai andforensic evidence recovered from one of the cars stolen was again linked to Lundie. The duo stole a a Nissan Qashqai (pictured) through which he crime was again linked to Lundie . Days later, the criminals stole an Audi A5 and a Vauxhall Corsa from a house in Cannock, Staffordshire. The Corsa was later found crashed into a telegraph pole in Streetly, Staffordshire, and Day's DNA was found on the driver's airbag. Lundie and Day then targeted three homes in Shrewsbury, Shropshire between. Two Audi S3s were stolen in the burglaries with Lundie's DNA linking him to the offences.The court then heard the pair drove an Audi A6 and Vauxhall Astra from a driveway in Oswestry, Shropshire . They were each jailed for five years and four months at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) after they admitted once charge of conspiracy to commit burglary . Both vehicles were later recovered nearby and Lundie's DNA was found inside the Astra. Lundie, of no fixed address, was arrested the next day after he drove away from officers in Kingstanding, Birmingham. Examination of Lundie's phone led officers to the identification of Day from Erdington, Birmingham, as a suspect and enabled them to match his DNA to the crime scenes.","Roy Day, 29, and Gerald Lundie, 26, stole £160,000 worth of Luxury cars .

"A size 24 woman who spent years gorging on discounted snacks on the supermarket she works at has lost seven stone after ditching the habit. Leanne Kenny, 23, from Northwich, Cheshire, reached almost 20 stone after repeatedly taking home end-of-the-line discounted junk food. The supermarket worker would snack on bumper bars of chocolate, baked goods and fizzy drinks going cheap because of their sell-by dates. Leanne Kenny ballooned to almost 20st after snacking on leftover goods at her place of work, but after ditching the snacks Leanne has lost 7st and now weighs in at 13st . It wasn't until she broke down in a shop changing room when she couldn't squeeze into their largest dress that she finally resolved to lose weight and cut out her unhealthy post-work snacks. Following her strict diet and fitness regime Leanne has shed seven stone and has shrunk down to 13 stone. Leanne says that she had always struggled with her weight but the real problem began after starting her job in the Co-op. Leanne worked as a check out girl at the Co-op and would snack on discounted products every day . Leanne says that she had always struggled with her weight and was teased when she was in school . Leanne says her break through moment came when she was unable to fit into the largest size in a store . 'Even as a child, I was the biggest one among my friends but my weight really became a problem when I started my supermarket job and couldn't resist the discounted treats,' she said. 'I would get teased at high school but I put on such a confident front, laughing off the hurtful comments and plastering myself in makeup just to make myself feel better.' By the age of 16, Leanne was already a size 20 and felt too embarrassed to go out with her friends so she swapped nights out with staying in wearing sweat pants and drinking fizzy drinks. Leanne started her job as a team leader at Co-op in 2010, aged 19, and she began piling on the pounds. By December 2013, she weighed 19st 3lb and went shopping for a new dress but broke down in tears when she couldn't fit into the store's size 24. Leanne said: 'When I started working at Co-op, I found out that lots of food was discounted at the end of the shift. Leanne joined Weight Watchers and took up walking in a bid to shed the weight . 'I couldn't resist the temptation. I would tell myself that I was bringing it home so that the food wouldn't be wasted or would share it between my family but to be honest I would bring home food anyway whether it was cheap or not and it would all be for me.' Aware that she was gaining weight Leanne attempted some weight-loss regimes but she would quickly give up. 'As my weight increased, I did try some diets but I just couldn't stick with any of them. I'd get hungry at work and then couldn't resist the delicious snacks that were on offer. 'My weight soared but I ignored it until I couldn't any longer - and couldn't even fit into a size 24. Leanne, now a size 14, plans to drop a further dress size by the summer. Pictured here in her old work uniform . 'It was the dress incident where something finally clicked in my head. Instead of coming home with a beautiful brand new dress I had to order a frumpy one online from a plus-sized store - I was mortified.' It was this light-bulb moment that finally saw Leanne make a dramatic change to her lifestyle. 'A week later I signed up to my local Weight Watchers. I immediately cut out bread and sugar and focused on walking. Within six months I got into the swing of it and would walk every day - and managed to lose four stone. 'Instead of stocking up on cakes, chocolate and crisps, I opted for fruit, veg and other healthy snacks instead. And I've never felt better.' Leanne says that one of her proudest moments came when she visited a department store and was able to try on clothes. Leanne credits her boyfriend Dan (pictured with her before weight loss) for keeping her motivated . 'I went to Debenhams in April and managed to fit into a pair of size 18 trousers. This time I cried tears of happiness - it was a long way from the last time I was in a high street changing room.' Leanne says that ditching her habit for after work snacks had been tricky but she had found something else to take home instead. 'The hardest thing has been stopping myself taking treats home from work, but I persevered and now take home fruit or vegetables.' Now Leanne is down to a size 14 and regularly visits the gym, running every night and visiting four times a week. She credits her boyfriend of four years Daniel Tittensor for keeping her motivated throughout her weight loss and aims to lose another stone to reach her goal of being a size 12 by the summer. 'In December 2014, I wore a size 14 dress which was a dream come true,' said Leanne. 'It made all the hard work worthwhile. The past year had been the hardest of my life, forcing myself to resist temptations, but now I can finally have bread and chocolate although in moderation.' Leanne added: 'I never thought I would be able to do it. All it takes is a heck of a lot of willpower and dedication. I've kept an old dress and pair of trousers to remind me of how big I once was. I can fit both of my legs in one leg of my old trousers now! 'I have never felt so good and for once I can look in the mirror and feel happy at what I see - no more discounted goods for me.'","Leanne Kenny reached 20st after starting work as a check out girl .

"She's better known as the eccentric grandmother from hit comedy Absolutely Fabulous - but 89-year-old June Whitfield has donned a habit for her latest role as Sister Ruth, a nun, in BBC soap EastEnders . She may be more familiar to viewers as the eccentric grandmother from Absolutely Fabulous. But June Whitfield’s next appearance will see her in a rather different role – as a nun in EastEnders. The 89-year-old is set to make a guest appearance in the BBC soap next week as Sister Ruth. Her character will offer advice to Jessie Wallace’s character Kat Moon, who is suicidal after struggling to deal with sexual abuse she suffered as a child. When her appearance was announced, the veteran actress said: ‘I have watched EastEnders for years, and have been so impressed by the standard of acting. ‘It was an absolute delight to work with Jessie Wallace and I am very excited to be part of the show.’ The actress has also starred in hit Terry and June and three installments of the popular Carry On film series. Her appearance comes after actor Timothy West, 80, who played character Stan Carter in EastEnders, criticised soaps for not valuing older characters and actors. West told the Radio Times last year: ‘I find they’re not valued so much and I suspect that’s one of the reasons why I’ve been brought in [to EastEnders].’ Whitfield's character Sister Ruth will be offering some words of encouragement to Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) As Kat (played by Jessie Wallace)  comes to terms with being abused as a child, Whitfield's character Sister Ruth is on hand. Whitfield said it was an 'absolute delight' to work with Wallace during her stint on the soap . Whitfield is best known for her role as mother of Edna, played by Jennifer Saunders, in Absolutely Fabulous . West, who was asked by the magazine if there were enough older people in soaps, added: ‘From what I hear, there hasn’t been enough interest in older characters. Or enough older characters to be interested in.’ West made his final appearance last month when his character died from prostate cancer. At the end of last year Linda Marlow joined the cast in a recurring guest role as Sylvie Carter. Before starting her role, the 74-year-old said: ‘The show has started to bring more older characters in and the ratings have gone right up so I don’t know if that is the reason. Maybe it shows that the core audience of the show are nans and mothers out there or maybe because the storylines are more exciting too. ‘The show has had the lovely June Brown for a long time but they have taken on Timothy West and Ann Mitchell in recent months. 'I don’t know if he ratings have gone up because there are now older characters in the show but I think it is very exciting to have good roles for older characters I really do. I guess the proof is in the pudding.’","June Whitfield will appear in the BBC soap next week as Sister Ruth .

"The man whose father married Tippi Hedren and who spent years living with Melanie Griffith as her stepbrother is opening up about the infamous lion film the two made with their parents, Roar. They worked, and lived, with lions for the 11 years they made the film, and now, John Marshall, son of director Noel Marshall who was married to Hedren, is saying of his father's decision; 'Dad was a f**king **hole to do that to his family.' He then added; 'It seemed like a really cool idea at the beginning, but it was dangerous.' Scroll down for video . Tippi Hedren, muse to the famed director Alfred Hitchcock, has fun with her lion Neil . Griffith, aged just 14, leaps into the swimming pool in her Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, home as she playfights with her enormous pet lion, Neil . The film Roar became infamous for the injuries received by 70 members of the cast and crew during production . 'Dad was a f**king **hole to do that to his family,' says James Marshall (left with Hedren) about making him and Griffith (right) star in Roar . The film billed, as the most dangerous ever made is making a return to the big screen nearly 35 years after its original release. Noel Marshall’s action-adventure film was originally released in 1981 and its 11-year production is infamous for the injuries received by 70 members of the cast and crew. 'You’re fine with lions and tigers as long as you don’t show any fear,” Marshall told the New York Post. 'The problem is that the plot required us to show fear. These animals who had learned to respect us were totally confused when we started acting terrified.' The film revolves around a wildlife preservationist who lives with his wife and children alongside a number of wild lions, tigers, cheetahs and elephants. Its re-release is due to be shown at a handful of cinemas in the US in April, and will be made available to the wider public on a number of platforms as well. While the plot line for the film itself – two lions putting a family at serious risk by battling for domination – is action-packed, it is in fact the back story that is the most chilling aspect of the tale. The idea for the film came about when Noel Marshall and Hedren discovered an abandoned plantation house overrun by a large pride of lions while touring wildlife preserves in Africa. Hoping to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment experienced by big cats in captivity, they approached a number of animal trainers for help make the concept for the film a reality. Hedren takes on Neil in a dangerous-looking wrestling match on the floor of their California home . A maid steps over Neil VERY carefully in the family's kitchen while the big cat rests . Noel Marshall is featured riding on a motorbike at the start of the trailer as one of the lions strikes out at him . The idea of the film arrived when Noel Marshall and Hedren discovered a plantation house overrun by lions . Neil Marshall and Hedren wanted to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment experienced by cats in captivity . The couple then began adopting and breeding lions in their home in Los Angeles and for six years the family of six lived alongside the pack. They eventually moved to a range north of Los Angeles and began filming. The trailer for the film documents some of the dangers the family put themselves through during production. James Marshall recalls what he went through first hand one day on set and he fell while running, which resulted in a lion pouncing on him. 'I looked up and there was blood on his teeth. It took six guys to pull him off me and I got 56 stitches,' he said. 'I had to work with that lion on and off for five years because we kept running out of money.' Noel Marshall is featured on a motorbike at the start of a film trailer, riding through a pack of lions as one of them strikes out at him as he passes by. Later he is tackled to the ground by another lion as a humorous review from HitFix appears on the screen: ‘It’s like Walt Disney went insane and shot a snuff version of Swiss Family Robinson’. Genuine fear can be seen etched onto the faces of the various crew members as they are confronted on numerous occasions by the pack. The video concludes with the credits and the various injuries sustained by the cast members. Hedren suffered a broken leg, Griffith needed facial reconstruction surgery and Noel Marshall was gored so many times he was eventually hospitalised with gangrene. The film’s cinematographer, Jan de Bont – who later went on to direct Die Hard – required 220 stitches after he was scalped by a lion. Hedren uses Neil as an oversized pillow while catching up on the news. Now aged 84, she still keeps lions . The film will be re-released 34 years after it debuted in 1981 and will be shown at a handful of US cinemas . No lions were harmed during the making of the film, however. Drafthouse Films partnered with Olive Films to re-release the film, which will be available on numerous platforms later in the summer, and be released on Blu-ray this summer. 'It was amazing to live through that,' James Marshall says of the experience. 'I should have died many times. But I kind of want to do it again.'","Roar, the film that took 11 years to create and was originally released in cinemas 1981 is being re-released at some cinemas in the US in April .

"Campaigners are calling for the government to implement an almost 90-year-old law that would fix the date of Easter in a bid to boost the economy. After next month's election, ministers could be asked to make sure Easter Day always falls between April 9 and 15, so businesses can plan holiday rotas in advance and allow the travel industry to better prepare for the summer season. In 1928, the Easter act was passed in Parliament to make sure that the holiday weekend would be a fixed date in April. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and his wife Samantha attend an Easter Sunday service at St Nicholas Church in Oxfordshire. After next month's general election, minister could be asked to consider fixing the date of Easter . Both the House of Commons and House of Lords passed the Act but it was unable to get the agreement of churches and therefore has never been implemented. It is thought that the Roman Catholic Church did not object to the plans although, they were never seriously discussed. But just before the dissolution of Parliament last week, Conservative Sir Greg Knight, who is defending his East Yorkshire seat at the general election, asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the Easter Act 1928. This also prompted the National Secular Society to write to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding Easter be a set date in April. Pope Francis leads Easter Mass in St Peter's Square in the Vatican. It is thought that the Roman Catholic Church do not object to the plans to fix a date for Easter . The letter by the society's executive director Keith Porteous Wood, said: 'The variation of the date of Easter by over a month causes significant and unnecessary inconvenience. This is particularly disruptive to the orderly planning of school terms and to business. 'As you will be aware, the law requires large shops, including supermarkets and even DIY stores, to close on Easter Sunday. 'The high proportion of the population that are not observant Christians, be they religiously unconcerned or of other faiths, are prevented from using them then, when many would want to do so. 'We support the rights of those who wish to observe Easter, but is is unreasonable and disrespectful to the remainder of the population for the operation of the law to prevent them from shopping then in such outlets.' Spectators gather to watch the The Passion of the Christ production on Good Friday in Trafalgar Square. But just before the dissolution of Parliament, Conservative Sir Greg Knight asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the Easter Act 1928. On the Gregorian calendar, used in the UK, Easter Sunday always falls on the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon . The Local Government Association and the Family and Childcare Trust have also backed the plan, saying that at least the two-week Easter school holidays should be the same every year to allow parents to plan childcare. However, according to the Independent Business Minister Jo Swinson said there was 'no indication' that Easter would become a fixed date. On the Gregorian calendar, used in the UK, Easter Sunday is always the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon. The Paschal full moon is the first full moon occurring on or after the spring equinox, meaning Easter weekend usually falls any time between March 22 and April 25. But since this shifts from year to year, most people follow the calendrical spring equinox, which is reckoned as March 21. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Easter is determined using the Julian calendar and is always celebrated after the Jewish festival of Passover. This year it will be celebrated on April 12, next Sunday.","Campaigners are calling for Easter Day to be fixed between April 9 and 15 .

"The hit US TV series House of Cards features Francis Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey, and his wife Claire, played by Robin Wright . So here’s the deal. Step one: book a private dining room at Washington’s Capital Grille. Step two: invite your political enemies to lunch. Step three: ask the waiter for an extra-sharp steak knife. Lunch is never just lunch when you’re dining in the shadow of Capitol Hill. It’s an exercise in power-broking and political assassination. I’d come to Washington to learn some tricks from House Of Cards –the hit US political TV series starring Kevin Spacey as Francis Underwood – on how best to neutralise your opponents. America’s capital is filled with Underwood wannabes: senators and governors with razor tongues and egos to match. The Capital Grille is a favoured venue for political plots. With crisply starched linen, glittering candlesticks and heavy silver cutlery, the decor suggests an atmosphere of civility and restraint, while the stuffed heads of deer and bison are redolent of a New England country mansion. But there’s a subtext to those severed heads: this is a place where the hunt always ends in a kill. I’ve been brought here by Alicia Malone, whose job is to sell Washington to foreign visitors. The seat of the United States Congress is in the United States Capitol, atop Capitol Hill in Washington . I ask if the city really functions as darkly as it does in House Of Cards. She swings around in her chair and points towards a closed door. ‘That’s one of the private rooms,’ she says. ‘And there’s a senator hosting a political lunch in there right now.’ My imagination goes into overdrive. A corrupt governor. A call-girl. A line of cocaine. If the host was Underwood, he’d certainly be exploiting it for political gain. Much of the action in House Of Cards takes place on Capitol Hill, home to the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are tours of the vast building and it’s a good introduction to how the city ticks. My guide is Martin, a preppy student with a smile like Matt Damon’s. The Lincoln Memorial was built to honour the 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln . He whisks me around the gilded splendour of the old Senate, as well as the still-functioning chamber of the new. It’s easy to forget you’re touring a working political building – a place where senators, advisers and policy wonks battle for influence. For more than two centuries, arm-twisting and bullying has been the reality of American politics. Even the hallowed founding fathers relied on strong-arm tactics to pass legislation. As Martin spills stories of feuds and political assassinations, I realise that men like Underwood have been controlling Washington ever since the birth of America. Giles Milton pictured at the Capital Grille . Some of those early politicians – such as the seventh President, Andrew Jackson – were so fiery that they make the players in the TV series look like amateurs. President Jackson’s solution to every problem was to fight a duel: Martin jokes that his body was so full of lead-shot that these days he wouldn’t get through the metal-detectors at the entrance to the Capitol building. Washington was chosen as America’s new capital in 1790 after months of haggling and compromise. The states of Maryland and Virginia each agreed to donate land in order that one small area – the District of Columbia (DC) – could be placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress. This holds true to this day. Despite its status, the city faces a struggle to lure tourists away from New York. Yet Washington has many more public monuments than its rival, including the two biggest hits in America: the White House (tours have to be reserved in advance) and the National Mall, home to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The latter is a vast statue built to honour Abraham Lincoln, America’s 16th President and considered by many to have been its greatest. US president Barack Obama (left) pays for his lunch at Ben's Chili Bowl restaurant (right) in 2009 . Every politician needs to connect with his or her voters: Frank Underwood and Barack Obama are no exception. Underwood’s way of connecting is to go to Freddy’s BBQ Joint and eat ribs. When Obama wants to connect, he heads 12 blocks north from the White House to the intersection of 14th Street and U Street. This rough-and-ready area, just below Columbia Heights, has been transformed into a popular shabby-chic district in recent years. More famously, it’s home to Ben’s Chili Bowl, an all-American burger and hot-dog joint and a favourite of Obama. You don’t come here for gastro-cuisine. Ben’s serves junk food with a spicy twist. A plastic sign proclaims it to be ‘a Washington landmark’. At 10am it’s doing a brisk trade in chilli-dogs dripping with cholesterol – but they certainly kick-start the morning. The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. The main building on the National Mall contains 1.5 million square feet of space and altogether is the size of 18 football fields . Washington’s biggest draw is resolutely apolitical: the Smithsonian is one of the greatest museum complexes in the world.

"The 16-year-old girl who survived a deadly axe attack that claimed the lives of three of her family, has absolutely no recollection of the horrific incident. Marli van Breda, who used to live with her family in Perth, Western Australia, was released from hospital last month after she was struck several times on the head and her throat was slashed during an attack in January. The attack took place in her family's South African home on January 27 and Marli is now suffering from retrograde amnesia. Although memory loss is not uncommon after a traumatic ordeal, doctors say the former Presbyterian Ladies' College student may never remember what happened on the fateful day she tragically lost her father, mother and eldest brother. Her extended family revealed in a statement on Sunday that, although Marli can't recall the brutal murders, she is able to walk and talk - and still has her sense of humour. Scroll down for video . Marli van Breda, 16, suffered severe brain damage when she was struck several times on the head in her family's South African home in January but has no memory of the horrendous attack . 'That she survived the attack is a miracle and her physical recovery continues to astound those close to her,' the family said in their statement according to a News Corp report. 'She is able to walk, communicates well and, surprisingly, given everything that has happened, has retained her sense of humour.' 'A long road of rehabilitation lies ahead as she learns to compensate for certain neurocognitive difficulties resulting from her traumatic brain injury. 'In some cases the situation remains for life,' her family said via their statement. Marli has been discharged from the rehabilitation care centre where she had been treated over the past few weeks for the severed jugular and brain damage. Henri van Breda (back left) escaped the attack while his father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed. Marli, 16 (front left), suffered severe head and throat injuries . The attack claimed the lives of her mother Teresa, 54, father Martin, 55, and older brother Rudi, 22. Marli's other brother Henri, 20, escaped with light injuries and rang police to report the deaths at the Stellenbosch home, east of Cape Town. Family spokesman Martin Coetzee said at the time that Marli will undergo occupational and physical therapy at the rehabilitation clinic. While her health had improved, Marli wasn't able to make a complete police statement regarding the attack during her stint at rehabilitation because she wasn't able to talk for long periods. Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call . Marli was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic on Tuesday after spending six weeks at Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town . According to reports out last month, visitors had been banned from visiting the teenager's hospital room in a bid to keep her surviving brother away. 'They fear she might go into shock, or will be traumatised further if she sees him,' a source told The Sunday Times newspaper. Marli has reportedly been crying when she sees photos of her parents and brother. 'It is heartbreaking to see tears rolling down her cheeks,' a person close to the family said. It emerged in February that an audio recording of the emergency phone call made by Henri, obtained by eNews Channel Africa , seems to reveal him 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody massacre. 'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.' When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard. A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack. Deceased: Martin (left) and wife Theresa (right) both died at their home in Stellenbosch -  east of Cape Town . Rudi (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. His younger brother Henri is currently living with his uncle . The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia . The young man's mental health has been under scrutiny since News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were negative and no further testing occurred. A doctor who examined the young man following the attack revealed his injuries were self-inflicted. He was also reportedly addicted to crystal methamphetamine, locally known in South Africa as tik, and his allowance was cut off before his family were attacked. Henri has been living with his uncle, Her Breda, since the attack and has been receiving counselling. His uncle denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply being hidden from the media's gaze. Popular: Rudi Van Breda was popular with his friends at Trinity College and the University of Melbourne . Separated siblings: Rudi (left) was killed during the attack, while Marli (right) remains in a critical but stable condition in a South African hospital . A close family friend described the van Bredas as 'a perfect family' 'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family,' he was quoted in The Times. 'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promised Henri I won't drop him.' No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli has a round-the-clock police guard. The family were based in Perth and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, before returning to South Africa in mid-2014.

"President Barack Obama announced today $200 million in additional U.S. humanitarian aid to Iraq, but declined to say whether Washington would provide Apache helicopters, drones and other arms to Baghdad to help with the ongoing fight against ISIS. 'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi. Mr. Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said the Iraqi leader did not make a specific request for additional military support during the meeting. President Barack Obama announced today $200 million in additional U.S. humanitarian aid to Iraq, but declined to say whether Washington would provide Apache helicopters, drones and other arms to Baghdad to help with the ongoing fight against ISIS . 'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, left . Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becoming prime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meant to convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has sought to be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq. The Obama administration, which welcomed Abadi's ascension after a tricky relationship with former Prime Minister Nurial-Maliki, may not agree to provide significant additional support. Obama, who was elected on the back of a promise to end the war in Iraq, is limited by public aversion to U.S. entanglement in another regional conflict and congressional constraints on his budget authority. In August, Obama authorized the first U.S. air strikes on Iraq since the 2011 withdrawal of American troops. He has also deployed about 3,000 American military forces to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State. Abadi said after the meeting that Iraq would respect other countries' sovereignty and expected the same. He also said he was eager to bring all of the fighters in Iraq under state control. 'I am aware that regional countries have their own interests and I respect these interests, but I also welcome any assistance that they would provide, and I would like to thank them,' Abadi said through a translator. 'However, we do not accept any intervention in Iraq or any transgression on Iraqi sovereignty. This is a war that is fought with Iraqi blood with help from the coalition forces and regional countries.' The U.S. president in turn warned Iran that its fighters must respect Iraq's sovereignty and answer to the government in Baghdad in the battle against ISIS. Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becomingprime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meantto convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has soughtto be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq . Vice President Joe Biden, left,  and National Security Advisor Susan Rice also participated in the Oval Office discussion of the strategic partnership between the two countries, support in fighting ISIS as well as commercial and cultural relations . Iran-backed Shi'ite militias have played a major and growing role in battling the Sunni Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, that emerged from the chaos in Iraq and neighboring Syria and which swept through northern Iraq last June. Abadi has had to rely on Shi'ite militias, some of which are backed by Iran and advised by Iranian military officers, as Iraq's regular military deserted en masse last summer in the face of the Islamic State onslaught. Obama said he and Abadi discussed the issue at length in their Oval Office meeting on Tuesday. Asked about Iranian involvement in Iraq, Obama said that he expected the neighbors to have an 'important relationship,' and recognized that the mobilization of Shi'ite militias had been necessary to counter ISIL's advance last year. But he added that any foreign-backed groups in Iraq should now be under Abadi's control. 'Once Prime Minister Abadi took power ... from that point on, any foreign assistance that is helping to defeat ISIL has to go through the Iraqi government. That's how you respect Iraqi sovereignty,' Obama said. 'It needs to be help that is not simply coordinated with the Iraqi government, but ultimately is answerable to the Iraqi government and is funneled through the chain of command.'","Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit to the Oval Office .

"Model Ciara Nugent may benefit from the right to buy scheme being extended to housing association tenants as her mother plans to buy her a property . Housing association tenants paying cheap rent to live in homes worth millions could get the chance to buy them at discounted prices under new right-to-buy plans. A number of people are currently paying around £150 a week to live in flats in exclusive parts of Mayfair and Covent Garden in London which are owned by housing associations and are now worth several million. Under Conservative plans to give tenants the chance to own their own homes, people living in these plush properties could now get the chance to buy them with discounts of up to £102,000 in London, after living in them for cheaper rents. The properties form part of affordable housing because of agreements with developers to provide low-cost provisions when new developments are built over a certain size. Many of them were built years ago in areas which have now become expensive and are worth millions of pounds. This enables tenants to occupy properties worth at least £1million for cheap rents, and many tenancies go unreviewed if circumstances change. However the value of the housing stock has raised questions over whether they should be sold to fund more housing. An investigation by the Sunday Times found that 10 properties owned by the Peabody housing association  in London are located in the expensive areas of Mayfair and Covent Garden - and are worth between £1million and £2.2million. The house used in the recent Paddington Bear film, in Primrose Hill, is also owned as affordable housing. Philomena Nugent,who lives in one of the Peabody flats in Drury Lane, told the newspaper she plans to buy her property for her pregnant daughter, Ciara Nugent, a model based in New York. Scroll down for video . One Housing, which owns 15,000 properties in London, said around 750 of these were worth more than £1million. Under plans proposed by the Conservatives the right to buy will be extended to 1.3million homes, occupied by 2.75million people. It is aimed at giving more people the opportunity to own their own homes and every house sold will be replaced on a one-for-one basis. But Housing Associations have opposed the proposals to sell their costly buildings at discounted prices, saying it will mean while individual tenants may benefit  there will be no affordable housing left for people who need it most. Housing Associations own expensive properties, such as a house used in the Paddington film in Primrose Hill . Paddington Bear was filmed in an exclusive part of Primrose Hill, a property owned by a housing association . They have also said owning property which has recently risen in value allows them to finance future developments. National Housing Federation director Ruth Davison recently branded the scheme the 'wrong' solution to the housing crisis. She said: 'Halfway through a programme of austerity and in the grips of a housing crisis, if you had £20 billion of taxpayers' money, would you just give it away as a gift to some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents?' The original right-to-buy scheme saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates, and became one of Margaret Thatcher's best known policies. At the moment housing associations, which receive public money and loans to provide affordable housing, are exempt from the scheme. Around 800,000 people have a 'limited right to acquire', and are eligible for maximum discounts of £16,000. Some tenants who are currently paying around £150 a week to live in the expensive London districts are keen to take advantage of the right-to-buy plans to try and buy their properties. However some insist even with the discount of up to £102,000 in London they will still be unable to buy their homes. How does right-to-buy work? Introduced in 1980, it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home. Labour dropped its opposition to the policy but, in 1999, Tony Blair's government cut the top discount from £50,000 to £38,000 and sales slowed. What has the Coalition done? It has sought to reinvigorate the scheme, cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of £77,000 for most areas. Are housing association tenants covered? Housing associations – autonomous, not-for-profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low-cost homes – are largely exempt. However, around 800,000 HA tenants have a limited 'right to acquire' with discounts capped at between £9,000 to £16,000. The other 500,000 tenants lack any right to buy. What are the Tory proposals? They would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right-to-buy. Tenants in houses would get a 35 per cent discount, increasing by 1 per cent for every extra year they have been a tenant. Those in flats will get a 50 per cent discount, going up 2 per cent every year. Discounts for houses and flats would be capped at the lower of 70 per cent or £102,700 in London and £77,000 across the rest of England. How will this be paid for? The Tories say they will make councils sell off expensive properties when they become vacant. Council homes that rank in the most costly third of all properties of that type in their area will be sold off. Around 15,000 such properties become vacant each year, because tenants die or move. The sell-off could net £4.5billion a year. What about the proceeds? They will be split, with a proportion used to replace on a 'one-to-one' basis the council homes sold off. The new properties would be more affordable, probably in less expensive locations, and could be built either by a council or housing association. Another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right-to-buy discounts for housing association tenants. The rest would go to create a £1billion fund, enabling councils to bid for cash to develop brownfield land for housing. It would enable them to clean up derelict or contaminated land, and could lead to 400,000 new homes in five years, Tories say.","Housing association tenants are paying £150 a week to live in £1m homes .

"A Texas highway was thrown into chaos on Friday when the  door of Brinks Armored Truck flew open, causing money to spill onto the road. Drivers pulled over on Interstate 20 in Albilene, Texas, got out of their cars and walked toward oncoming traffic to pick up the cash. A video posted on Facebook shows motorists frantically grabbing the notes in between stopped vehicles, while others were forced to slow down and veer out of the way. Scroll down for video . Chaos: A video posted on Facebook captured motorists pulling over and getting out of their cars on Interstate 20 in Albilebe, Texas,  to pick up cash that had spilled from a Brinks Armored Truck . The passenger door of the truck somehow opened as it was moving causing a plastic bag with a 'substantial amount of money' to be blown out. Police have warned that if anyone is caught with cash that was inside the truck - they could land themselves behind bars. Weatherford Police Department said all of the lost money had been picked up by citizens. Some of it had been returned, but other drivers had decided to ignore the threats and have pocketed the cash. A spokesman for the department said: 'Weatherford Police Department would like to remind everyone that the loose money is property of Brinks Armored Car Service. 'Weatherford Police will investigate and potentially prosecute any individual that has picked up any of the loose money and not returned it to either Brinks or the Police Department.' Joel Aldridge, who recorded the video, told NBC DFW: 'I saw people all over the ground picking things up, and I thought maybe it was wreckage. 'And as they started walking toward me the first guy I saw had a big wad of cash with money sticking out.' Traffic: Cars were forced to veer past the vehicles stopped on the side of the road. Police have also warned anyone caught with the money from the van will be prosecuted . He described how dozens of people vacated their cars and left their doors ajar as they dashed for the cash. 'Everybody else was picking up handfuls and running around, kinda like an Easter egg hunt,' he added.' Jose Rosas, who was searching at the scene, told WFAA: 'We're just trying to make a dollar or two. 'I'm probably going to come back tomorrow and look,' Rosas said. 'I know there's a lot of money out here.' His friend Gage Anderson said they had scoured the road but most of the money had already been picked up.","Bundles of notes spilled onto Interstate 20 in Albilene, Texas, on Friday .

"A mother-of-two who posted pictures of her post-pregnancy stretchmarks on Instagram to inspire others was horrified after they were removed for breaching the site's decency guidelines. Hannah Moore, 20, of Broxburn in West Lothian, uploaded the snaps in a bid to boost her confidence and told her followers: 'Nobody should be judged by their size because everyone is beautiful'. But only two minutes later, the mum of twins claims her account was deleted because the images were deemed to contain inappropriate 'nudity and violence'. Hannah Moore, 20, of Broxburn in West Lothian, had suffered stretchmarks after having twins, and had posted the images in a bid to boost her confidence . 'Nobody should be judged by their size because everyone is beautiful': The mum-of-twins had posted the images with an inspirational caption, and was shocked when they were removed due to 'nudity and violence' Hannah says the blocking of her account has made her think her body is 'clearly fat, ugly and disgusting and it made people feel sick'. She said: 'Two minutes after the picture was uploaded my account got closed down, my mouth just dropped and my eyes watered. 'I don't know why, it was out of the blue but I decided to post a picture of my belly on Instagram because I've had twins. 'I had written underneath the picture how unconfident I had always been, how relationships have been hard and how hard it is to find clothes that I like.' The 20-year-old had had suffered stretchmarks after having twins and wanted a confidence boost, but after posting images (pictured right), her account was immediately shut down . 'Instagram should be more careful in whose accounts they delete and look into it further': Moore was devastated by Instagram's decision to delete her account . She continued: 'I want not just myself but other women thin or bigger to love themselves and love their size because everyone is beautiful. 'Instagram should be more careful whose accounts they delete and look into it further.' Hannah suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls Lily and Grace with fiance David Johnstone, 22, in June last year. She posted the pictures on Wednesday but her account was immediately shut down. She said: 'I basically wrote that people should never get judged for the size and what they look like because everyone is beautiful'. 'The picture was up two minutes until my Instagram logged out itself and then it came up saying my account has been shut down because of violations. 'Nobody could get on my Instagram and nobody could search for it so someone had obviously reported the picture for nudity - all it was was a picture of my belly and it has just took my confidence away.' Hannah suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls Lily and Grace with fiance David Johnstone, 22 (pictured right), in June last year . She added: 'It was just me saying that nobody should ever get judged no matter what size they are. 'I felt so confident posting the picture showing my baby belly, my belly that carried twin girls for only six months.' Instagram's community guidelines state: 'We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don't allow nudity on Instagram. 'Photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed.' But Hannah believes she is not in breach of these guidelines despite her account being shut down. Instagram has admitted the incident was 'a technical mistake' and has re-instated Hannah's account . Hannah, who was bullied during school for her weight, has been left with no confidence. She said: 'It made me think that my body is clearly fat, ugly and disgusting and it made people feel sick.

"Nightclub promoters have apologised after a photo of a young woman sprawled out on a tiled-floor was used to advertise their Easter weekend event - just a week after the owner’s son was convicted of raping a teenage girl at the venue. A photo of a 'drunken' young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub’s Facebook page on April 3  - a week after Luke Lazarus was sentenced for raping an 18-year-old at the club. The 23-year-old privileged son of Andrew Lazarus, the owner of the venue in Sydney’s Kings Cross, was jailed for at least three years for the crime on March 27. The photo’s caption said: ‘We’re throwing an extra special Yeezter event Tonight. Free entry till 10pm and $5 drinks till midnight – get amongst it!’ Scroll down for video . Luke Lazarus was sentenced on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old at his father's SOHO nightclub on May 12, 2013 . A photo of a drunken looking young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub’s Facebook page on April 3 by an 'external promoter' The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter, the Daily Life reports, with one shocked social media user complaining: ‘This is how Luke Lazarus (sic) father promotes nightclub SOHO. Posted week after sentencing!’. A Twitter user told Daily Mail Australia : ‘Once it did Twitter rounds and people started commenting it was removed by Saturday.’ A SOHO management spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘The event on the night was set up by an external promoter as a one-off event. 'He was given access to the official Facebook page but as soon as we noticed he’d put that up it was taken down.' The club agreed that the photo used was ‘100 per cent inappropriate’. During Luke Lazarus’s rape trial, the jury was told that the former private schoolboy boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway. During Luke Lazarus’s rape trial, the jury were told he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway . Luke Lazarus will spend a minimum of three years behind bars. He told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement' The woman attempted to go back inside in the early hours of May 12, 2013, but Lazarus forcefully told her to get down on the ground on all fours. In sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he must have realised there was a possibility she wasn't consenting,' she told Sydney's District Court. But she said he was 'not caring in one way or another whether she was consenting'. On the night the teen was assaulted, the court heard it was the first time she had gone to Sydney's Kings Cross. The SOHO nightclub is a popular venue in Sydney's Kings Cross district . After entering the club Soho, Lazarus walked up to her, told her he was a part owner in the venue and showed her a business card. He then asked if she would like to enter a VIP area before taking her into an alleyway out back. They kissed but when she said she wanted to go back to her friends he said: 'No, stay'. He pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. Scared, she complied. During the ten minute assault that followed, the teen told him she was a virgin. The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter . The photo which caused offence on April 3 is in-line with similar photos posted the club's Facebook page . When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests in his phone that he had. He later texted a friend 'sick night, took a chick's virginity LOL so tight'. Judge Huggett said: 'It was her right to kiss the accused and it was her right to say she wanted to return to her friend. The offender ignored that.' The girl informed police the next morning who seized CCTV footage from the venue which confirmed Lazarus led the woman into the alleyway. Judge Huggett said Lazarus came from a privileged upbringing and had an inflated sense of entitlement and power when he was at the Soho. But she found he had good prospects of rehabilitation, was unlikely to reoffend and was suffering from an adjustment disorder due to a break-up in the weeks prior to the offence. She sentenced him to a maximum of five years in jail. He will be eligible for release in March 2018. Judge Huggett said Lazarus, a South Sydney Rabbitohs fan, came from a privileged upbringing . Lazarus told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement.' He also added that it made him physically ill to think that the incident was not consensual. The 23-year-old was allegedly seeing an American woman but ended the relationship due to his parent's disapproval of her not being Greek. Psychiatrist Dr. Christopher Rikard-Bell, said Lazarus was suffering emotional symptoms as a result of the break up. After Lazarus's sentencing a series of prominent public figures in the local community spoke out in his defence with character references. Waverley mayor Sally Betts, the honorary secretary of the Honorary Consulate-General of Greece in Brisbane, Tsambico K Athanasas, South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league club chairman Nick Pappas and the parish priest at the Greek Orthodox Christian Church of St George, Rose Bay, Father Gerasimos Koutsouras, spoke out to support him. Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward slammed his supporters, saying: 'Not only does this diminish their standing, it can shatter the confidence of the victim and often discourages them from seeking justice.'","Luke Lazarus was convicted of raping an 18-year-old at SOHO nightclub .

"Chantelle Doherty (pictured) was involved in a raid on the home of a 92-year-old man where she bluffed her way in and stole several bottles of whisky . The niece of Gypsy Weddings star Paddy Doherty has been jailed for two years after she and an accomplice preyed on elderly people in their homes in 'cruel and heinous raids'. Chantelle Doherty, 21, of Prestwich, Greater Manchester, was involved in a raid on the home of a 92-year-old man in which she and another man bluffed their way in and stole several bottles of whisky, a decanter and a phone. Her friend Martin Lawrence, 27, also targeted a man aged 99 claiming he owed him money for non existing paving work. The incidents occurred after Doherty was freed from jail having been in prison for 16 months for leading a gypsy girl gang which carried out a string of vicious robberies. Doherty has now been jailed for two years after pleading guilty to burglary and fraud. Lawrence, of no fixed address, was jailed for five years after he pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary, three counts of fraud and one count each of robbery and attempted theft. Police said the offending began on November 9, 2013, when Lawrence and another man went to the home of the 99-year old man in Salford claiming to work for a paving company and asked the man if he wanted any work doing. He told them he did not but over the next few days they returned and called the victim on several occasions and persuaded him to hand over a large amount of money. A few days later Lawrence returned asking for more money but the man refused. Lawrence asked him for a drink and when the man went to make him one Lawrence went upstairs, where the man found him rooting through his drawers and told him to leave. He later found his wallet had been stolen and rang the police. Lawrence also returned in February and March 2014 asking to do more work on the driveway, but the man refused and called the police. Later on December 3 Lawrence went to the home of a 92-year-old man in Salford, pretending to be a charity collector. Doherty (pictured left) has been jailed for two years and accomplice Martin Lawrence (right) for five years . The man donated £5 to what he believed to be a good cause, but while Lawrence was there he stole £130 from the man's wallet and his credit card. On December 9 Lawrence approached a 54-year-old man in his garden at his home falsely claiming to be from the police and asked the man if they could go into his house to talk about a recent crime. The man became suspicious and asked to see his ID, which is when Lawrence showed the stolen credit card. The man asked Lawrence to leave and there was a struggle between the pair before Lawrence stole his wallet which contained a debit card and Tesco mobile top up card, and made off. A short time after this incident, Lawrence and Doherty went into a pub in Pendlebury, and ordered around £70 worth of food and drinks. They left the stolen debit card as payment but this was declined, so they told staff they would return to their hotel room next door to get another card, but they never came back. As they left, Lawrence was carrying a bottle of Amigo beer. Doherty is the niece of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celebrity Big Brother star Paddy Doherty (pictured) The pair then went to the home of the 92-year-old victim from a few days previously and persuaded him to let them in, where they stole several bottles of whisky, a decanter, phone and replaced his credit card with the stolen Tesco mobile top up card. The next day a relative of the man went to visit him and noticed a bottle of Amigo beer in the living room. DNA from the bottle was later matched to Lawrence. At an earlier hearing Doherty was said to have had no formal education and was unable to read and write and her role in the community is a 'particular role handed down to females in her position.' She was previously jailed aged 18 when she led a five-strong ladette mob which ambushed and bullied youngsters in the street and robbed them of valuables. During one incident Doherty - whose 52-year old uncle won the 2011 reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother - head butted a young boy, forced a fizzy drink down another terrified boy's throat  and poured alcohol over another. In one of the five hold ups across Salford, Greater Manchester, a girl of eight was forcibly pushed up a road on her bicyle and left crying hysterically after being robbed of her mobile phone. Another young girl was told 'if you call the police, we'll kill you, we're Gypsies,' before she was robbed of her Blackberry. Doherty, the eldest of the gang, was said to have been the most aggressive of the girls - even kicking out at a police officer as she was arrested. At today's court hearing she was said to be thoroughly ashamed and felt 'she's brought shame on her family, her community.' PC Michelle Ingham of Greater Manchester Police said: 'It is difficult to convey the devastating impact these cruel acts have had on these two victims. 'Lawrence repeatedly targeted two vulnerable elderly men in the sanctity of their own homes, a place where they should feel safe and where they and their families had worked hard to ensure these two men could still enjoy a high level of independence in their old age. 'As a direct result of what happened here, one of these men has had to move out of his family home, where until this point he had lived happily, and into residential care, which is simply heart-wrenching for both him and his family. 'I hope that today's sentencing acts as a warning to others who may think they can get away with targeting more vulnerable members in our society - this sort of heinous crime is one that we take extremely seriously and we will do everything in our power to trace those responsible and put them behind bars for their actions.'","Chantelle Doherty, 21, jailed for preying on elderly people in their homes .

"Jake Shaw, 21, died after falling from the upper floor of the Scout centre in the Swiss Alps where he had been volunteering as a climbing instructor . A popular  graduate fell to his death from a bedroom window in the Swiss Alps after playing drinking games, an inquest heard. Jake Shaw was just beginning his gap year - volunteering as a climbing instructor at Kandersteg International Scout Centre - when the tragedy occurred last year. The 21-year-old had fallen 25ft (8m) from the upper floor of the building in the early hours of August 1. He was airlifted to hospital in Bern suffering severe injuries but died nine days later. Lincoln Coroner's Court heard that shortly before his death, Jake had been celebrating the Swiss National Day with friends with drinking games called 'Power Hour' and 'Ring of Fire.' After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at the centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a 'very drunk state'. It is then believed he lost his balance as he tried to open a bedroom window and toppled out of the window at the adventure camp in Interlaken, Switzerland. Today Lincolnshire Central assistant coroner Paul Smith, concluded that Jake's death was an accident. He said: 'The level of alcohol in his body was consistent with 11 standard drinks. 'It's the presumption that he was undeniably very drunk that evening - how that affected his balance is a matter of speculation. 'The most likely explanation is that in his state he took himself to bed, opened the window and perhaps overbalanced and fell. 'I'm satisfied that this was a tragic accident.' The court heard how in the game 'Power Hour', participants have to drink a shot of beer every minute for an hour and if completed two and a half litres of beer is consumed. A police report read out during the inquest, added: 'Examinations indicated that the August 1 celebrations were followed by a private party which Jake had attended. 'There were group games with drinks in the staff room. Jake had probably drank a large amount of mainly beer. After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at Kandersteg International Scout Centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a 'very drunk state'. Shortly before his death, adventure-loving Jake had been celebrating the Swiss National Day with friends with drinking games called 'Power Hour' and 'Ring of Fire' 'At some time after 2.45am he came away in an alcoholised state without letting anyone know where he was going. 'It must be presumed he returned to his room. How the fall happened can't be established in any detail.' Jake, from Welton, Lincolnshire had graduated with a maths degree from Sheffield University and had just started a gap year at the time of his death. The keen mountaineer and skier was planning to spend the winter season in the nearby French Alps. His devastated parents, Ian, 51, and Fiona Shaw, 52, wrote a joint statement about their son which was read out during the inquest. In it they said: 'Jake was intelligent, reliable, easy going and a loveable young man. He loved life, his friends and his family, and his passions were music and climbing. 'He had plans for next year mapped out to live life to the full . 'We are happy he was having a great time in the place he loved.' Jake, who loved the outdoors, was just beginning his gap year by volunteering as a climbing instructor when the tragedy occurred . The keen mountaineer and skier was planning to spend the winter season in the nearby French Alps before his tragic death . At the time of his death mother Fiona, a speech and language therapist, said: 'Jake was very gifted, the best son in the world who became my rock - he was dependable and made me laugh. 'He was intelligent and very funny, with a dry sense of humour. 'Although Jake was taken from us at only 21, they were great years and Jake was fortunate to have had so many marvellous experiences and done so much in his life.' Ian, a human resources manager, added: 'We are a very close family and we are all so proud of Jake. 'The countless messages we have received from his wide circle of friends have made us realise just how popular and loved by others he was. 'Jake was an avid reader and he really knew what was going on in the world.. He followed loads of sports, especially football, cycling and cricket. 'He did things I never achieved through his mountaineering trips abroad and we followed his achievements with pride. I'll really miss going out walking and climbing with him.'","Jake Shaw, 21, died after falling 25ft from upper floor of the Scout centre .

"Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself in 2012 after she was sexually assaulted at a party. Two of her attackers have finally apologized and admitted she was unconscious during the 'criminal act' Two teenagers have finally apologized for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl who later committed suicide after images of the attack were shared around her high school. The pair, who have not been named, admitted Audrie Pott was unconscious at the time and did not consent to their 'criminal acts' as they reached a civil settlement with her family. They also apologized for sharing false rumors spread around Saratoga High School in Northern California that 'served to shame and humiliate her'. The teenager fell asleep after drinking Gatorade laced with vodka at a friend's party in their hometown of Saratoga. She awoke to find her pants off and lewd comments scribbled over her body. Her family says she hanged herself days later after learning cellphone photos were taken of her during the assault and shared through text messages. Audrie's parents, Lawrence and Sheila Pott, filed a civil lawsuit against the boys to hold them more accountable for their actions. Their attorney, Bob Allard, said the parents decided to settle with one of the teens because he showed remorse and 'told the truth' about what happened to Audrie. Now the final two teens have reached an agreement after initially refusing to say sorry - reportedly paying $950,000 to the devastated family. As part of the settlement, they were also made to release a lengthy apology and will have to give presentations about 'sexting', sharing nude photos, 'slut-shaming' and the dangers of alcohol. The pair said:  'We apologize that we said things that made it seem like Audrie invited or encouraged these acts. 'We admit that we committed these acts and shared inappropriate images of Audrie to others. 'Audrie wasn't conscious during these criminal acts that we committed and did not consent to what we did.' They also apologized for false rumors that 'served to shame and humiliate her'. It continued: 'We would like every teenager out there to understand that words about someone's character can have a life altering effect. That taking advantage of an incapacitated human being is a crime each and every time. They also said they would participate and support a petition to to the Saratoga High School Administration to give Audrie an honorary diploma, because their 'actions contributed to prevent her from graduating. During a hearing on Friday, the boys stood up and apologized to the courtroom, including Audrie's parents, to mark the signing of the agreement. According to the San Jose Mercury, one of them said: 'I wish Audrie was still here, and I miss her a lot. She was a great person who didn't deserve anything that happened to her due to my actions. I apologize. I wish I could make it right.' Anger: Larry Pott and and Audrie's stepmother and his second wife Lisa, have finally settled their lawsuit against two of their daughter's attackers after one admitted and apologized . Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012 . Tormentors: The three teenagers (pictured with their faces obscured) pleaded guilty to sexual assault last year and were sentenced to 30-45 days in a juvenile detention facility . The second teen, who is now a senior at Christopher High in Gilroy, said that if he could, he would 'take back the pain and suffering I caused Audrie and the Pott family. This has caused a tragedy to all involved due to my actions.' He added: 'I will do everything I can to mentor teens to not do what I did in September 2012.' The teenagers also agreed to be interviewed in a documentary film already in production about the case. The three attackers, all classmates, were prosecuted in private juvenile proceedings and sentenced to between 30 and 45 days in juvenile hall. Two continue to attend Saratoga High, while the third transferred to high school about an hour south in Gilroy. Allard said that had the two other teens apologized, they might not have been sued. 'If they had simply knocked on the door of the Pott household, apologized, accepted responsibility and jumped headfirst into our quest to educate our youth by, for example, speaking at high schools about the mistakes they made and how this can be prevented, there would be no civil lawsuit,' Allard said. Audrie's parents led the campaign to pass a California law which allows prosecutors to seek harsher sentences for juvenile sex offenders who take pictures of their crimes and use them to bully the victims. The trio of teenagers whom Daily Mail Online is not identifying because they are minors, pleaded guilty in January 2014 and were sentenced to 30 to 45 days each in a juvenile detention facility. Pott, from Saratoga, California, hung herself September 10, 2012 - just eight days after the teens digitally penetrated her at an alcohol-fueled Labor Day party and took pictures of her in a compromised state. The 15-year-old girl felt humiliated after she discovered that the cellphone photos showing her naked body covered in lewd comments written in marker had been shared with students at her school. In February, Pott's parents tried to get all three expelled from their schools - which they returned to after their sentences. Cruel: Pott, right, was assaulted after a night of drinking and boys spread photos of the attack . They launched a petition on the site Change.org calling on the principals of Saratoga High School and Christopher High School to expel the three perpetrators responsible for Audrie's 'slut-shaming.' At a party in early September 2012, Audrie Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade and woke up without her shorts on, with her face painted black and with mocking comments written in indelible marker all over her body. Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault, which involved digital penetration, and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers. 'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident. She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos. 'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.' Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' Left behind: Audrie is pictured left with her father, step mother and half brother and sisters . Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house. In police interviews, the teenagers admitted to coloring half of her face black with marker, then pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals. They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images. Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school. She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images. 'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.' 'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body. She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her. 'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.' She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'","Parents of Audrie Pott reach financial settlement with remaining two teens .

"David Cameron, wearing notably clean new work boots, today set out seven key Tory policies which he said would help get people on to the property ladder . A million people will be able to realise the dream of home ownership by 2020, David Cameron claimed today as he donned hi-vis to tour a building site. The Prime Minister said seven key Tory policies would help get people on to the property ladder by building more homes and cutting the cost of saving for a deposit, moving house and paying off mortgages. The Tory leader, wearing notably clean new work boots, as he chatted to house builders, insisted 'dream of home ownership is alive'. Mr Cameron used the launch of the Conservative party manifesto yesterday to promise voters 'security at every stage of your life'. He said the 'greatest sunshine that there can possibly be' included helping more people but their own home, as well as getting a job and having dignity in retirement. Today the Tory leader set out a seven point plan which he claims will help build more houses and making it easier for first-time buyers, claiming it will help a million people become homeowners over the next parliament. Mr Cameron said: 'The Conservative Party is the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your lives. 'At the heart of that is helping people onto the housing ladder. It comes back to our values. We believe if you work hard, save up, and do the right thing, you should be able to buy your own place. 'The plans in our manifesto will open home ownership to a million more people. With us, the dream of home ownership is alive. 'And it's why we can look the working people of Britain in the eye and say we are with you. That's why we are setting out a seven point plan to help build more houses, and help more people get a home of their own.' The seven point plan includes the Help to Buy ISA, announced by George Osborne in last month's Budget, which will help first-time buyers save for a deposit. For every £200 someone puts towards a deposit, the government will add £50 up to a maximum of £12,000, meaning a bonus of up to £3,000. Savers will be able to earn hundreds of pounds in interest before paying tax. The Tories say it is effectively a tax cut for first time buyers, and will be available from this autumn. The second policy is a pledge to will build 200,000 starter homes which will be sold at a 20 per cent discount on the market value to first time buyers under the age of 40. Thirdly, the Help to Buy: Equity Loan scheme has been extended to 2020. For first-time buyers who have saved a 5 per cent deposit, the government will offer a loan of 20 per cent, with the remaining 75 per cent covered by a mortgage. The Tories expect the extension to help people buy at least 100,000 new build homes over the next five years. The Tory leader, visiting the Weston Homes Aura building site, Edgware, boasted that with him in charge, the 'dream of home ownership is alive' The fourth policy is the funding of 75,000 shared ownership homes by 2020 and the fifth is the abolition of the hated slab system of stamp duty, so it rises steadily based on the value of the home. It means stamp duty has been cut for 98 per cent of the people who pay it. For example, someone buying a house costing £275,000, would pay £4,500 less in tax. Mr Cameron announced the two final policies in his speech yesterday. It includes a new £1 billion Brownfield Regeneration Fund, to help councils clear derelict or contaminated land which can be used to build 400,000 extra homes over four years. He also announced a massive extension in the Right to Buy scheme to 1.3million housing association tenants. The existing Right to Buy allows tenants living in council-owned properties local authority tenants to buy houses and flats at a discount of as much as 70 per cent up to a maximum of £102,700 in London and £77,000 across the rest of England. Mr Cameron announced a massive extension in the Right to Buy scheme to 1.3million housing association tenants . The Conservatives plan would extend the scheme to people living in properties owned by housing associations - not-for-profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low-cost homes. Around 500,000 housing association tenants currently have no purchase rights and 800,000 who qualify only for much less generous discounts of £16,000 or less. Local councils will be required to sell off their most expensive properties as they become vacant, in order to raise an estimated £4.5 billion a year to fund the scheme. Some 15,000 houses and flats are expected to become available in this way each year, but Tories stressed that no-one will be forced out of their home.","Tory leader sets out seven point plan for boost home ownership dream .

"A cat who had been stuck in a wall at a Cairo train station for five years has been freed at last. Biso had squeezed into the hole in the wall at the Mohamed Naguib metro station as a kitten in 2010 - but then soon became to big to escape. He survived thanks to an elderly man named Uncle Abdo, who gave the trapped cat water and fed him scraps of food  every day. Scroll down for video . Biso the cat, who was stuck behind a wall in a Cairo train station for five years, has finally been freed . The cat survived thanks to an elderly man called Uncle Abdo who fed him scraps of food every day . Now, the feline in finally free thanks to a social media campaign, according to the Cairo Post. Animal rights activist Mounira Shehata told the newspaper the smell when the wall was removed was 'heinous'. She said: 'It was like a tomb. There were black worms along four meters of the edge, where Uncle Abdo was able to put in food for Biso.' Uncle Abdo, who named the cat, said Biso would regularly hide from bigger cats in the hole, but one day, squeezed inside and was not able to come out again. He added that workers had tried to rescue the cat years ago, but a scared Biso had stayed behind the wall. And Uncle Abdo even visited the station to feed Biso during the revolution in Egypt in 2011, when most stores, including his own, were closed. Uncle Abdo even came to feed Biso during the the revolution in Egypt in 2011, when his shop was closed . 'I do it for God. What is for God does not go away,' he told Masr al-Arabia. Biso's plight came to the attention of animal activists after a picture of the cat's tail hanging from behind the wall was posted on Facebook last month. A caption explained that the wall could not be broken to free the animal because it would be considered damage to public property. The picture caught the attention of Ms Shehata and her fellow animal rights activists Marwa Elgebaly and Rania el-Kordy - who all decided to go save the cat on March 12. Staff at the station told the trio they would need to return a couple of days later, when a maintenance official would be able to help. And after Dina Zulfikar, an animal rights worker, filed a report at the Abdeen police station March 13, officers arrived at the metro station. Biso's plight came to the attention of animal activists after a picture of his tail was posted on Facebook . But the terrified cat quickly ran off after his rescue from behind the wall at the Mohamed Naguib metro station . They told the head of Mohamed Naguib metro station, in downtown Cairo, of the prosecution order to rescue Biso. Workers were brought in to help - and the rescue mission took more than five hours. The terrified cat only emerged from the hole after one worker, named Amr, went inside to bring him out. Sadly, Biso then quickly ran away before anyone was able to catch him. Uncle Abdo is still looking for him inside the station.","The cat was trapped behind the wall at Mohamed Naguib metro station .

"Sheriff Mbye, who died in hospital after receiving multiple stab wounds outside a KFC on Friday evening . A second 18-year-old has been arrested today on suspicion of murder after a teenager was stabbed to death outside a KFC restaurant. Sheriff Mbye, also 18, died in hospital after receiving multiple stab wounds in a scuffle outside the restaurant in Northfield, Birmingham on Friday afternoon. Today an 18-year-old from the Birmingham area was arrested at his home address on suspicion of murder. It comes after officers arrested another 18-year-old on suspicion of murder on Friday, with officers being granted more time to question the teenager. Police were called to Bristol Road South in Birmingham just before 5pm on Friday to reports of a stabbing outside a KFC restaurant. Officers found a 19-year-old man who has also suffered serious stab wounds being treated by customers at a nearby barbershop. Police then received reports that victim Mr Mbye had been dropped off at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham in a white Audi, which then sped off. But despite the best efforts of doctors, the 18-year-old died in hospital two hours later. Detectives launched a major murder investigation and the Audi was found abandoned in Ladywood, Birmingham, late on Friday night. Bristol Road South was reopened today but a scene is being preserved at the barber shop where the 19-year-old victim was treated by members of the public. Officers are also carrying out forensic examinations on the white Audi and trawling CCTV from the area. Police were called to a KFC restaurant (pictured) in Northfield, Birmingham, shortly after 5pm yesterday after reports of a stabbing . Today police appealed for eyewitnesses to come forward and confirmed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the murder. Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Our investigation is moving swiftly and we have received immense support from the public. 'However I would still ask anyone who witnessed the incident and hasn't spoken to police to come forward. When officers arrived they found a 19-year-old with stab wounds in a barber shop being tended to by customers . Detectives believe a group of other men were involved and are currently trying to identify them . 'In particular I would like to speak to a young woman who was nearby pushing a pram as the incident happened and was clearly distressed by what she saw. 'I would like to reassure the community that we are building a very clear picture of what happened on Friday evening and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with Sheriff Mybe’s murder.

"An Ontario girl whose father chose her needier twin sister to receive his liver donation has now gotten a lifesaving new organ of her own. Vietnamese Binh Wagner, 3, and her identical twin Phuoc were left with fatally impaired liver function due to Alagille syndrome. But when Phuoc needed a donor just a little more, their adopted father Michael chose her to receive his liver, which was a perfect match. Now, thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor, Binh and her sister Phuoc are both on their road to recovery, reports the National Post. Scroll down for video . 'BINH RECEIVED HER GIFT!!!': A 3-year-old girl in Ontario recently received a donated liver after her sicker twin sister was chosen ahead of her to receive part of their adopted father's liver early this year . Binh and Phuoc Wagner of Kingston, Ontario were adopted by Michael and Johanne Wagner around a year and a half ago from Vietnam. The twins suffer from Alagille syndrome, a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life . 'BINH RECEIVED HER GIFT!!! There are not enough words to thank the amazing and so unselfish donor,' the parents wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to the girls. The post continued: . 'Binh is recovering well, at her own pace. She has been through a lot with very different medical issues from her twin who had her transplant two months ago. 'We are looking forward to all being reunited and leading a healthier life now, with both transplants finally behind us.' When Mr Wagner and his wife Johanne found out that both girls would need a liver transplant, they were relieved to find out that he was a perfect match. However, Wagner was only able to give a portion of his liver to just one of his daughters, leaving him with an impossible choice. In the end, doctors suggested giving the donation to daughter Phuoc, since she needed it the most. Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and it has so far been a success. Anonymous lifesaver: The parents have asked that media not try to track down the donor of Binh's new liver, because he or she has chosen to remain anonymous . Recovering well: 'Binh is recovering well, at her own pace. She has been through a lot with very different medical issues from her twin who had her transplant two months ago,' read a Facebook update about the girl . Five days after the operation, the family posted a heartwarming video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. 'Hey mon belle!' Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.' Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision. She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.' Months before Binh's transplant, Michael Wanger was convinced to pass her by and choose her sister Phuoc (right) to receive part of his liver . Alagille syndrome is a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life. This leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing damage to liver cells. Scarring may occur and lead to cirrhosis in about half of affected children. Symptoms including jaundice, loose stools and poor growth develop within the first three months of life. Later, there is persistent jaundice, itching, fatty deposits in the skin and stunted growth. The disease can stabilise between four and 10. It affects around one in 100,000 children. Children with the condition tend to have a prominent, broad forehead; deep-set eyes; a straight nose; and a small pointed chin. Treatment of Alagille syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver. Problems with fat digestion and absorption may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Deficiencies of these vitamins can be diagnosed by blood tests and can usually be corrected by large oral doses. Occasionally, liver cirrhosis advances to a stage where the liver fails to perform its functions. Liver transplantation is then considered. Alagille syndrome is generally inherited only from one parent and there is a 50 per cent chance that each child will develop the syndrome. Half of cases occur spontaneously.

"Nasa has released incredible point-of-view footage taken by astronauts on spacewalks of the International Space Station. Expedition 42 commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts recorded three spacewalks, known as Extra Vehicular Activities, on GoPro cameras outside the ISS on February 25 and March 1. The spacewalks were in preparation for the arrival of multibillion pound commercial spacecraft, which Nasa hope will be in operation by 2017. Expedition 42 commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts recorded three spacewalks on GroPro cameras . Nasa recently signed a contract with commercial spaceflight companies SpaceX and Boeing with the intention to produce craft capable of transporting astronauts to the ISS. The clip was recorded to give the future ISS workers an idea of what they can expect when they go into space to maintain the commercial spacecraft. In the footage Virts and Wilmore can be seen repairing the robotic arm of the space station and installing a new communication system for the future docking spacecraft. The spacewalks were in preparation for the arrival of 2017's multibillion pound commercial spacecraft . The astronauts can be seen repairing the robotic arm of the space station and installing a new communication system . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. The two men also set up antennas and routed 4000 feet (1219m) of power and data cables. The video captures breathtakingly clear images of earth as astronauts work from a distance of 250 miles. Nasa has recently relied on Russian Soyuz capsules taking astronauts to ISS to carry out maintenance work since its space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011 after 30 years’ service. But at a cost of nearly £50 million per seat, it has not been a financially viable solution. Nasa now hope that their deals with SpaceX and Boeing can cut the cost of their future transportation fees. The International Space Station is a habitable artificial satellite in low earth orbit. It is now the largest artificial body in orbit, since its first component was launched in 1998, and is often visible to the naked eye from earth.

"A bookkeeper has been sacked after calling her boss 'a complete d***' in a text message - and then accidentally sending it to him. Louise Nesbitt was employed at Perth mining exploration company Dragon Mountain Gold. On January 12 last year, she mistakenly sent a text to her boss meant for her daughter's boyfriend who was engaged as a contact plumber for the firm. A Perth office bookkeeper was fired from her job after she called her boss 'a complete d***' in a text message . In the message, Ms Nesbitt wrote: 'Now remember ... [her employer] Rob is a complete d***... we know this already so please try your best not to tell him that regardless of how much you might feel the need.' Realising her mistake, she immediately texted her boss asking him to delete the message and ignore its contents. Ms Nesbitt sent a further message explaining the insult was a 'joke within our family'. 'I need to explain ... that message came across so wrong,' she said. 'That is not how I feel. My sense of humour is to exaggerate. It is not how I feel. 'Please forget it and just go on as normal. I am very very sorry.' Ms Nesbitt - who had employed at Dragon Mountain Gold since 2004 - was fired five days after the incident, with her employer saying it was due to 'gross misconduct'. She filed a unfair dismissal complaint with the Fair Work Commission. While she cross examined, Ms Nesbitt argued the text had been taken out of context. The commission also heard she had sent an email to her employer expressing the view she did not think he listened to her or took her counsel on board. This had been causing tension between the two before the January 12 incident. Commissioner DJ Cloghan ruled against Ms Nesbitt. 'On the evidence, I am not persuaded that when Ms Nesbitt referred to Mr Gardner as ""a complete d***"", it was her sense of humour to exaggerate or, that it was ""light-hearted insult"" or it should be read in the context of the person it was meant for,' Commissioner DJ Cloghan said. 'It was far from a ""light-hearted insult"", it was a hurtful and unpleasant appraisal of [her employer], for whom she earned $95,000 per annum.'","Louise Nesbitt was employed as an office bookkeeper at a Perth company .

"From deep craters to basaltic plains, the varied surface of the moon has been revealed in stunning detail by the US Geological Survey. The two sets of maps, compiled by cartographer Trent Hare, include image mosaics and topographical views of the lunar landscape taken over a period of four years. The grey and white areas reveal higher peaks, while darker blues show deep craters. To the left of these craters, is Oceanus Procellarum, which is Latin for 'Ocean of Storms'. The two sets of maps include image mosaics (right) and topographical views (right) of the lunar landscape. Darker blue show deep craters, while the grey and white areas reveal areas of elevation . Early theories claimed this mysterious region, roughly 1,600 miles (2,600km) across, was created by an asteroid impact. Last year, however, Nasa scientists proposed that the Ocean of Storms was in fact the result of the formation of ancient rift valleys. The feature is located on the surface of the moon's near side which is characterised by low elevations and numerous ancient volcanic plains. Scientists believe the rifts are buried beneath dark volcanic plains in this area, and so far, they have only been detected in the gravity data provided by the Grail probes. The map also shows Mare Orientale, an impact crater that was partially flooded by basalts. Shaped like a target ring bull's-eye, the Mare Orientale is one of the most striking large scale lunar features. Found on the moon's extreme western edge, it is difficult to see from an earthbound perspective . Pictured on the left is the moon's south pole, and on the right, the north pole. To create the maps, more than 6.5 billion measurements were collected between 2009 and 2013 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Wide Angle Camera (Wac) and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter . Nasa's ultimate goal at the moment is to land humans on Mars by the 2030s. Exactly how to get there is up for debate, with the agency favouring a mission to an asteroid in the next decade, followed by a giant leap to the red planet the decade after. But one expert has claimed that Nasa is actually planning to go back to the moon first, as a waypoint to reaching its final goal. Writing for My San Antonio, science reporter Eric Berger explained how President Obama had, in 2010, outlined Nasa's goals for the forthcoming decades. 'I just have to say pretty bluntly here, we've been there before,' the President said in a speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the time. The goal instead was to visit an asteroid in the 2020s, and then send a crew to Mars in the 2030s - with no mission to another destination in between. Recently, Nasa revealed how they plan to do the asteroid mission - by picking up a boulder from a larger asteroid, placing it in lunar orbit, and having astronauts go and visit. But Mr Berger says that Nasa has been 'quietly' considering going back to the moon before going to Mars. He said that Nasa is, 'in internal studies, reconsidering the moon, including the lunar surface, for human activities as a significant stepping stone to Mars.' The lava-flooded rift valleys are unlike anything found anywhere else on the moon and may at one time have resembled rift zones on Earth, Mars and Venus. The map also shows Mare Orientale, an impact crater that was partially flooded by basalts. Shaped like a target ring bull's-eye, the Mare Orientale is one of the most striking large scale lunar features. Found on the moon's extreme western edge, it is difficult to see from an earthbound perspective. It is about 600 miles (950km) across and was formed by the impact of an asteroid sized object which caused ripples in the lunar crust resulting in the concentric circular features. To create the maps, Mr Hare used more than 6.5 billion measurements collected between 2009 and 2013 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Wide Angle Camera (Wac) and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The images have also been released in black-and-white image mosaic based on the same data using wide angle cameras. To see a more detailed view of the map, please click here.

"Dante de Blasio, the son of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has been accepted into several top colleges including Ivy League universities Yale and Brown, sources close to Gracie Mansion said. The mayor's son, who is 17 and a senior at Brooklyn Technical High School will make his decision by the end of the month, leaving de Blasio in a situation familiar to millions across the country. Despite his six figure salary as mayor and six figure rental income from the two properties he and his wife own in Brooklyn, de Blasio is now expected to turn to financial aid to help pay for his son's elite education. Proud family: Dante (left) with his father, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, his mother Chirlaine McCray and sister, Chiara outside their home in Park Slope, Brooklyn . 'There's going to be a big challenge in figuring out financial aid and visits and all sorts of stuff,' said Mr. de Blasio to the New York Times last week. But while Dante's choice of college is obviously a private matter, how his parents - as champions of the underprivileged - will fund it, is obviously of public interest. Indeed, the almost prohibitive cost of college for some in the United States is often pointed to as a failing of Democratic politicians and their policies. However, with a salary of $225,000 and his daughter, Chiara, already enrolled at Santa Clara University in California, de Blasio has a good case for financial aid. Ivy League: Dante has been accepted into Yale (left) and Brown (right) Universities and will make his decision at the end of the month . Home for the moment: The de Blasio family moved into Gracie Mansion on the Upper East Side of New York City late last year . Harvard:  $68,050 . University of Pennsylvania: $66,800 . Columbia: $63,440 . Yale:  $63,250 . Dartmouth: $60,201 . Brown:  $59,428 . Princeton: $58,965 . Cornell:  $47,286 . Indeed, her annual tuition, room and board fees come to $55,000 a year and if Dante was to attend Yale, that would come to in excess of $60,000. Faced with more than $100,000 a year in tuition fees, the mayor may not find himself disqualified from seeking aid said Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Edvisors.com, which works in financial aid. 'When you have colleges that are charging 50, 60, $70,000 a year, everybody is going to struggle to pay for college,' he said to the New York Times. However, Kantrowitz admitted in the case of the mayor he is talking about the 1 percent of top earners in the country. De Blasio and his wife Chirlaine McCray received $52,200 in rent from a Park Slope, Brooklyn, home his mother lived in and the family home also in Park Slope they left last year rakes in $4,975 a month. Combined, the two properties value is $2.8 million. However, regardless of how the de Blasio's pay for college, Dante appears to be a strong candidate. He is a champion debater and counts political philosophy his favorite subject according to the New York Times.","Dante de Blasio, 17, to make his decision by the end of the month .

"Barely out of nappies, this five-year-old boy was not the most likely candidate to take on six heavily armed troops. But that did not stop the Palestinian youngster, dressed in full combat gear, from attempting to pelt Israeli police with stones during violent clashes on the West Bank. The bemused officers, equipped with helmets and body armour, calmly watched as the child launched his own assault before racing away. The incident raised fears that Palestinian children are being encouraged to mimic and glorify violence. David and Goliath battle: A five-year-old Palestinian boy pelted the Israeli police with stones as violence erupted during a rally in the northern West Bank . The dark-haired child, dressed in combat gear, raced back to safety after launching a series of missiles at around six heavily armed officers . The boy's stone attack came as violence erupted  on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd after more than 100 Palestinians rallied near Israel's separation barrier in the village of Bilin, with some throwing stones. At least one protester was believed to have been injured as violence flared on the streets. Prisoners Day is marked every year in solidarity with the more than 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. 'We will not leave our prisoners in jail alone,' rally organiser Abdullah Abu Rahma said. 'We will defend their right to be released, because the majority of them have been arrested illegally by Israeli forces.' With Israel having arrested some 800,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 1967 - equivalent to 40 percent of the male population - almost every Palestinian family has been affected. During the last round of US-backed peace talks in 2013 and 2014, Israel freed dozens of long-term inmates. But after the negotiations broke down, and following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, Israel arrested hundreds more. The current number of Palestinian prisoners is the highest for at least five years, according to figures from rights groups. More than 100 protesters used catapults to fire rocks at the Israeli forces after violence erupted during  a rally to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day . The Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd that had gathered near the West Bank city of Nablus . This protester's face was left covered in blood after he was injured during the violent clashes on the street .

"Many people long to win the lottery and enjoy the trappings of wealth. But for one woman, securing a job at the Pokemon Centre in Japan would be her dream come true. Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia of all shapes and sizes. Lisa's mother had to move to the smallest room in the house to make room for her daughter's collection . Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia . Indeed the 26-year-old has amassed so many during her 17-year hobby, she now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon items, having 25,000 of them spread around the home she shares with her mother, Sharon. 'I just love Pokemon so much - there's just something about it that brings joy to me every day,' said Lisa. Her fixation with the Japanese characters started at the age of nine when she saw a picture of the cartoon's protagonist, Pikachu in a Nintendo magazine. Her collection of the Nintendo franchise has grown so large that her mother  had to move from the largest to the smallest room in their house to make room for her vast array of cuddly toys, models, clothing, badges, flannels and posters. Lisa clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia in 2009 when she had 12,113 items, but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more. The devoted fan even travelled to Japan when the 11th Pokemon movie was released to get hold of exclusive merchandise that wasn't available in Europe. Lisa Courtney searches for Pokemon items online at her home . Lisa Courtney owns the world's largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia . 'I went for the release of the eleventh Pokemon movie in an attempt to get some exclusive Shaymin merchandise - it was amazing,' she said. Despite having to sacrifice her bedroom, Lisa's mother and the rest of her family are very supportive of her obsession and even buy her more items for special occasions. 'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK,' she said. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.' For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme really helped her through a very difficult stage of her life. For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme helped her through a very difficult stage of her life . 'I started collecting when I was getting bullied at school, Pokemon was the only thing that made me feel happy.' Sharon Courtney said she did not mind moving to a smaller bedroom as Pokemon was so important to her daughter. 'I love Pokemon now. It helped Lisa through horrific times when she was at school and was kicked in the head and the back. 'Every time she came home and was tearful she would go to Pokemon and she would be smiling. 'She would love to work in Japan at the Pokemon Centre - more than winning the lottery - that would be her dream!' Lisa appears on Collectaholics on BBC2 at 7pm last night . Lisa spends seven hours a week on the internet browsing for new Pokemon releases to buy and trade, she also visits car-boot sales  hunting for rare memorabilia to add to her collection. 'I try and get new merchandise as soon as the new characters come out - it's often difficult as they are only available in Japan and America or are too expensive,' she added. Despite trying to save money where she can Lisa does own one particular item that she is sure must be worth a fortune. 'My most valuable piece is my large Ho-Oh plush toy, it was a prize in Japan, only available in raffles and in their amusement arcades. I bought mine for £60 online. 'I will always collect Pokemon, here's always something new to get. 'For me, Pokemon is like an additional family - it always lifts my spirits.'
