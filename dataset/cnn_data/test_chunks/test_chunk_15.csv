"Hannover fired coach Tayfun Korkut on Monday after a run of 13 games without a win left the club close to the Bundesliga's relegation zone. Michael Frontzek has been named as his successor, signing a contract valid for the remaining five matches of the season. The 51-year-old Frontzek worked as an assistant at Hannover from 2004 to 2005. Tayfun Korkut has been sacked by Hannover after a long winless run saw the club fall down the league table . Michael Frontzek will take over at Hannover and has five games left this season to avoid relegation . He is returning to the Bundesliga as coach for the first time since 2011, when he was fired by Borussia Moenchengladbach. Korkut's departure follows a 4-0 loss to Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday. Hannover are now only one place and two points above Paderborn, who currently occupies the relegation play-off place. The Bundesliga's bottom two clubs are relegated automatically.

"Manchester City Under 18s boss Jason Wilcox, whose side take on Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup Final on Monday, is aiming to emulate United's famous Class of '92. Wilcox, himself let go by his current employers as a teenager, could field a starting XI of players all born in Greater Manchester for the clash against the favoured opponents from west London. And, while it may be unlikely anyone will emulate a golden generation across town that yielded the likes of the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, the ex-Blackburn winger believes that is the target. Manchester City Under 18s manager Jason Wilcox wants to deliver local players to the first team . Wilcox talks with Manchester City elite development squad coach Patrick Vieira . 'It could happen again but they were freak years,' Wilcox said. 'You look at United as a one-off, Barcelona the same. 'Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge.' The first leg will take place under lights at the impressive, newly-opened 7,200-capacity stadium within the grounds of the £200m Etihad Campus, a sprawling complex aimed at kickstarting a conveyor belt of homegrown talent and defying those who claim the club have no interest nurturing growth from within. Wilcox believes those facilities, coupled with elite coaching, stand City in good stead when it comes to recruiting talent. Wilcox hopes to emulate Manchester United's 'Class of 92' but says it will be very difficult . 'We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea,' he said. 'It's up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I'm convinced once they see us it's very difficult to walk away from.' Will the final, between two clubs often criticised for spending millions of foreign players, be a chance to stick two fingers up to Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, who a year ago described the lack of English talent at Manchester City as 'pretty depressing'? Wilcox does not want to get into that. 'There’s a lot of media attention from Greg Dyke with regards to increasing the home-grown quota,' he said. Wilcox believes City's new Etihad campus will stand club in good stead when it comes to recruiting youngsters . A look inside one of the gyms at Manchester City's training complex . 'We can’t get embroiled in that because, for us, it’s a day-to-day question of how do we improve players? 'Proposals have already been put forward with regards to home-grown quotas. If he (Dyke) wants to increase it, then that is up to him. But whether you increase or lower the numbers, it doesn’t change the fact that you have to be good enough to get through.' Wilcox knows all about being good enough to get through at a club where money is no object. The Bolton youngster, who joined Blackburn at 14, was the only youth product to regularly appear in their Jack Walker-fuelled Premier League triumph in 1995. 'When I was a young player at Blackburn Jack Walker came in and brought Kenny (Dalglish),' he said. Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . 'You go two ways. Do I go elsewhere and take my chances or have I got stomach for fight and see what happens? Luckily for me I was the only homegrown player which was a great privilege. Now I'm passing my experience to younger ones.' Wilcox's arrival at Ewood Park came after rejection at none other than City. He remembers it well. 'I’d joined City at 13 and got released at 14,' he recalled. 'It’s quite fitting really because when I’m speaking to younger players I can always recall that chat if you like. I think at that time it was a case of I just got told that they were not going to retain me on a year’s contract. 'It was devastating at the time. Everything was going really well. But to be told that it is tough for a young kid. But I just recall my own experience whenever I have to tell the lads and have the younger age groups. You have to go through some period in your life like that where not everything is going to go fantastically well.' Wilcox was one of the only graduate players to feature regularly for Blackburn during title-winning season . City manager Manuel Pellegrini will be at the Etihad Campus, as will England Under 21s chief Gareth Southgate. Things have not gone according to plan for the Chilean's first team this season, but does Wilcox believe their struggles have increased the pressure on his youngsters to deliver the club's only silverware this season? 'Not really,' he said. 'At the start of the year, irrespective of what was happening at first-team level, the FA Youth Cup was a chance for our players to be put in a situation where they are being put under a bit of pressure and I think it’s great that they are being put under a bit of pressure.' Aided by Wilcox's wise head, they appear to be thriving under it.","Manchester City and Chelsea meet in the first leg of the final on Monday .

"Lucas Matthysse won a majority decision against Ruslan Provodnikov in a 12-round super lightweight bout on Saturday night. Matthysse landed the majority of the punches in the first round and opening a cut near Provodnikov's left eye early in the second. Provodnikov (24-3) put Matthysse on the ropes late in the third round and landed two hard right hook-left hook combos in the fourth before Matthysse (37-3) regained control in the fifth. He continued to use his three-inch reach advantage to keep Provodnikov at bay, giving him room to dodge the Russian's powerful left hook.

Provodnikov (24-3) put Matthysse on the ropes late in the third round and landed two hard right hook-left hook combos in the fourth before Matthysse (37-3) regained control in the fifth. He continued to use his three-inch reach advantage to keep Provodnikov at bay, giving him room to dodge the Russian's powerful left hook. Provodnikov landed several punches in the later rounds but couldn't knock down his Argentine opponent down, although he did stagger Matthysse in the 11th. 'He did, he hurt me,' Matthysse said through a translator. 'But I was able to withstand the onslaught. He's a very tough fighter. He's very strong. He just keeps coming forward.' Don Ackerman scored the fight as a draw 114-114, but Glenn Feldman and John McKaie both scored it 115-113 in favor of Matthysse. 'To me, he was better today,' Provodnikov said through a translator. 'He was the better man in the ring and, you know, it was a close fight but he won and I hope everybody enjoyed it.' The night's undercard was quickly decided when Patrick Teixeira (25-0, 21 KOs) won with a second-round knockout of Patrick Allotey (30-2) in their middleweight bout. Provodnikov admitted that Matthysse was better than him on the day in the majority decision win . Matthysse said he just wanted to rest but talked up a fight with Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao next .

'For right now I just want to rest,' Matthysse said. 'I got my daughter, my family waiting for me back home. I want to rest. I want to go back there and see them so much and let's see what happens with (Manny) Pacquiao and (Floyd) Mayweather.'

Luis' pressure and all-action style was beginning to tell on Mathews, who was more and more often going to the ropes and both men were deducted a point in the eighth, Mathews for a low blow and Luis for use of the head. Luis was in the ascendency in the closing rounds and looked to be pulling some points back on the cards but it was not enough as Mathews was handed a tight decision after a thrilling encounter.","Derry Mathews handed a unanimous points decision at the Echo Arena .

"Lukas Podolski insists he is prepared to fight for his place at Arsenal when he arrives back at the club in the summer. The German World Cup winner is currently on loan at Inter Milan having joined the Serie A club in January following a tough start to the season at the Emirates, where he scored just three goals in 13 appearances. The move to Italy appeared to signal the end of Podolski’s time in north London, but the 29-year-old is adamant he still has a role to play in Arsene Wenger’s side. Inter Milan loanee Lukas Podolski says he wants to play for parent club Arsenal next season . The German forward has yet to score since arriving in Serie A in January . ‘When I go back (to Arsenal) I think I have the chance to play there,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I have one year left so well will see what happens. I feel very well at the club and with my teammates as well. I had a great two and a half years; I scored a lot of goals there and had a lot of assists. ‘The first six months of the season were not easy, that’s why I changed clubs. But now I’m ready.’ Arsenal made it to back-to-back FA Cup finals over the weekend thanks to an extra-time win over Reading and Podolski tweeted his congratulations to his parent club, although he admitted he hadn’t seen the action. The forward was busy preparing for the derby with Inter against rivals Milan, but he was left on the bench by Roberto Mancini for the second game running as the sides played out a 0-0 stalemate. Podolski struggled for first-team opportunities in north London before leaving the Gunners on loan . Podolski has failed to score in 12 appearances since arriving in Italy, but he says there is no frustration over the lack of time he’s getting on the pitch. ‘It’s not a problem for me. I’ve been in this business of playing football long enough,’ he said. ‘Of course I want to play every game but it’s the decision of the coach, he makes the decision and picks the first XI and when he thinks the players on the pitch are better than me or in better form than me then they have to play. ‘I’m ready, I’m fit, I want to play because a derby is always a great game and it’s for these types of matches you play football. ‘I’m here now to finish the season then I have two games with the national team, then we will see.’ Podolski celebrates with Alexis Sanchez after scoring the winner against Anderlecht in October .","Lukas Podolski left Arsenal for Inter Milan on a loan deal in January .

"Terence Crawford landed a stunning right that Thomas Dulorme never really saw. Soon after that, Crawford was a two-time WBO champion, winning the latest title in his first fight since moving up in class. Crawford won the vacant WBO junior welterweight title with a sixth-round technical knockout Saturday night, knocking down Dulorme three times in quick fashion after that big blow. Terence Crawford (right) defeated Thomas Dulmorme in the sixth round with a technical knock out . 'I knew I hurt him, I felt it,' Crawford said. 'I knew he was hurt real bad. I wanted to just jump on him. ... He was woozy.' With Dulorme stunned, Crawford hit him again and knocked him down for the first time. Then Crawford delivered a flurry of punches, leading to another knockdown. When Dulorme got back up, Crawford unloaded again - and the fight was stopped as Dulorme staggered against the ropes near his corner. 'Basically a shot that I didn't see, and the shot got me,' Dulorme said through an interpreter. Crawford remained undefeated, winning as a heavy favorite in his first fight moving in the 140-pound class. He won the WBO lightweight title 13 months ago and defended in the 135-pound division twice in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. The scheduled 12-round fight in North Texas came a week before Crawford, now 26-0 with 18 knockouts, is scheduled to be in New York to accept his 2014 fighter of the year award from the Boxing Writers Association of America. The fighter celebrates after winning the vacant WBO world junior welterweight title . After the fight ended, promoter Bob Arum shouted 'That's why he's the fighter of the year!' Dulorme, the 27-year-old Puerto Rican, is 22-2. He had won his last six bouts since moving down in class after being knocked out by Luis Carlos Abregu at 147 pounds in a welterweight fight in October 2012. 'It was a great opportunity for us,' Dulorme said. 'It wasn't the best night. We were winning in the cards, it's something that basically happened. ... We did the fight that we came here to do.' Crawford seemed measured in his approach the first two rounds against the quick-starting Dulorme, who entered the ring wearing a gladiator helmet and breastplate. Dulorme was clearly the aggressor early against Crawford, who went with a red Nebraska Cornhuskers cap for his entry. Crawford dominated the fight throughout and Dulmorne couldn't handle his speed and punching power . But in round 3, there was a quick exchange of punches, and later a hard body blow by Crawford. There were times in the fourth and fifth rounds when Crawford either smiled or shook his head after taking blows from Dulorme. Crawford taunted him, and at the end of the fourth had him back into a corner and delivered two big rights. Crawford was also smiling at the end of the fifth round, then came out in the sixth and ended the fight. 'Just having fun with it,' he said. 'When I'm having fun, I don't think nobody can beat me because that means I'm in my rhythm.' Crawford knocks down the Puerto Rican following a combination of punches in the sixth round . Crawford's trainer, Brian McIntyre, said the first couple of rounds were just a matter of Crawford getting his timing down. McIntyre said they knew the punching Dulorme would wear out, though he lasted longer than they expected. Arum this week called Crawford a new superstar on the horizon, and said this fight a 'very, very crucial first step' for Crawford to join the truly elite group of fighters. Arum was at the bout halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth that came only two weeks before the long-awaited fight in Las Vegas between another of his boxers, Manny Pacquiao, and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Dulmore was unable to recover from his knockdown and the referee stopped the fight . In an earlier eight-round lightweight matchup of previously unbeaten fighters, Ismail Muwendo from Minneapolis improved to 17-0 with a majority decision over Rolando Chinea from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. One judge had the fight as a draw, while the others had it in favor of Muwendo. Chinea dropped to 10-1-1. Benjamin 'The Blaxican' Whitaker from San Antonio improved to 9-1 as a pro with a unanimous decision over Skender Halili, a boxer from nearby Fort Worth whose had won each of his previous eight professional fights by knockout. Michigan's Anthony Barnes won a unanimous decision over Fort Worth's Martinez Porter in a six-round super middleweight bout.","Terence Crawford stopped Puerto Rican Thomas Dulmore in the sixth .

"MaiquetIa, Venezuela: it's a long way from Bundoran — and a long way from the Belfast homes of Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlan. The pair mischievously claimed that Donegal's seaside town was their destination of choice for a post-Olympic break following their respective bronze medal wins at London 2012, but they have certainly travelled far and wide during the current Olympiad. Barnes may have already been well known in Ireland prior to their achievements in London, but taking up his part in a charming double act with Conlan only endeared him further to a nation that unfortunately only flirts with the amateur version of the sport every four years before medallists appear on homecoming flights. Conlan (leff) lands a right jab on Matthew Martin during his bantamweight bout in Glasgow in 2014 . The reality of making that happen is far more complex, of course, and the efforts of Barnes and Conlan to make it to Rio 2016 are unprecedented. On Saturday night, the Belfast boys are potentially both one win away from qualifying for next summer's Olympic Games, with Barnes needing to ensure victory while Conlan must do likewise and depend on another result elsewhere. Their mission takes them to Maiquetia, northern Venezuela, where they will take on native opposition, the latest stop on the road-trip that is the World Series of Boxing (WSB) — a part of the convoluted new structure that once was 'amateur' boxing. WSB boxers are part of a franchise team, fighting individually over five three-minute rounds in a pro-style format. Barnes and Conlan box for the Italia Thunder team, but the sights and sounds of Milan and Rome were not what drew them to the competition. In fact, they have fought only three of their six bouts so far in Italy and while most WSB fighters receive payment, the Irish pair signed up with Olympic qualification as their sole motivation. Upon their return to Belfast after Saturday night's fight, they will have covered a distance of over 34,000 miles over the course of their various round trips. That is the equivalent of three trips from Dublin to Melbourne. They will have each fought seven fights in 13 weeks and, as of today, Barnes has boxed 29 rounds in 12 weeks to Conlan's 28. They are burnt out, peeved off and ready for rest — but only once their mission is complete Saturday night. Barnes is one victory away from qualifying for 2016 summer games in Rio . 'I just feel tired, I'm sick of it,' laments a worn-out Barnes, who is an undefeated 6-0. 'To fight every fortnight, travelling around the world, it's doing my head clean in. I'll be glad to get out of it. Hopefully I qualify and some good will have come from it. 'I was flying to Kazakhstan and I felt like crying on the plane, I felt like pulling out. I was very, very close. I think I was in Heathrow and I was going to get a plane back to Belfast. 'If I didn't qualify for the Olympics through this WSB, I'd have nothing to do with it. I've been training from November right through and then I'd need to go to the Europeans [Games] in June — I couldn't do that, like. I physically couldn't do that, it'd be impossible.' In addition to hand injuries, which have severely limited his training, Barnes has another battle he must overcome as he bids to become the first Irish boxer ever to reach a third Olympic Games. 'I hate flying, I just hate it, it depresses me even thinking about it. I can't even sleep, I'm that scared. I can't sleep, can't watch films, can't read books, I'm just too panicky, too nervous. 'I'll not even be able to drink water, never mind a beer to relax, because I'll be making weight.' If he sounds like a touch grouchy, it is understandable. While their fixture list has included destinations as culturally and geographically diverse as Guba in Azerbaijan, Palermo, Poland's Konin, Almaty in Kazakhstan, Rome, Milan and now Maiquetia, the two-time Olympic medallist explains that they do not get to soak up the glamorous aspects of the cities. 'Far from it,' says Barnes. 'You go away and you have to go to the worst areas, there's nothing extravagant about it. It's not five star — it's one-and-a-half star. 'You can't really see too much because we're only there for a short period of time and when we get there we're training to make the weight… We're home the next day [after the fight] in the early hours. So we're more or less in and out.' Michael Conlan (left) and Paddy Barnes sport their bronze medals following their success at London 2012 . Adding to Barnes' stress is his constant struggle to make the 49kg light-flyweight limit. The 28-year-old has been boxing in the same weight division for 12 years and tales of his notoriously cranky pre-weigh-in demeanour are common, with Conlan witnessing the battle first hand as his regular room-mate. 'It does make it easier because we're mates outside boxing,' says Barnes of the benefits of being signed up to the same team as his pugilist pal. 'We're travelling together and fighting together so it is good, I'd rather that then going away on my own because I think I'd pack it in. It's too much of a strain. 'But when we're away, I barely talk to him because he knows I'm making weight!' Conlan, the laidback member of the double act, takes a far more carefree approach to travel. 'Getting on a plane doesn't bother me, if you're going to die on a plane, you're going to die,' laughs Conlan. 'A lot of the flights I try and sleep through so I'll be waking up in their [local] time.' The 23-year-old recently became a father, with his young daughter just four weeks old, while Barnes is also a father to a daughter of 11 months. The pair have also stayed neck and neck in terms of international achievements since Conlan emerged on the senior scene in 2011 and the younger member of the duo is also appreciative of his friend's presence on WSB duty. 'It's good for both of us because I know when I'm training with him, we're both training hard and pushing each other,' says Conlan. 'Everything we've done up until this WSB since 2012 has been the exact same — Olympic bronze, European silver, Commonwealth gold. The fact that this WSB has messed me up a bit is a bit unfortunate but we're still going well,' adds Conlan, who is in qualification limbo after two disputed 'away' points decisions, increasing the temptation to turn pro . 'Winning [tonight] isn't going to be a problem, I'm just waiting on other results. It's a bit of a sickener, but it has to be done at the end of the day. I have to get in there and do what I have to do and win, do my part of the job.' 'I'll try not to make any dramatic decisions after the fight if it goes against me, but I have a sharp tongue at times and say stupid things,' says Conlan. 'Hopefully it all works out. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.' For Barnes, he maintains: 'The Olympic Games is what it's all about, it's every amateur boxer's dream and if I qualify, I'll be honoured to say I qualified for my third Olympic Games.'","Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlan are competing in Maiquetia, northern Venezuela on Saturday night .

"Nicola Adams has no intention of following her former Great Britain team-mate Natasha Jonas into retirement as she focuses on becoming a double Olympic gold medallist in Rio next year. Having overcome another lengthy injury lay-off, Adams is preparing to return to an English ring for the first time since her London 2012 triumph at the national championships in Liverpool next week. And with a world gold medal still proving elusive, the 32-year-old Adams insists she has absolutely no plan to set a time-scale on when it will finally be time to hang up her golden gloves. British boxer Nicola Adams is hoping to become a double Olympic gold medallist in Rio . Adams (right, pictured during her London 2012 final win over Cancan Ren) is hoping to retain her crown . Adams said: 'I will keep fighting as long as I have the motivation to do so and there is no reason why that should not continue after the Rio Olympics. 'At the moment becoming a double Olympic champion is the only thing on my mind but I have other goals left to achieve including world gold after only taking three silvers so far. 'Despite all my injury problems I have never lost my love for the sport and as long as I keep that love of fighting and entertaining the crowd I will still be eager to compete.' Adams will face a rare challenge to her domestic dominance in Liverpool with her 51kg category also including Lisa Whiteside, who won world silver in Adams' absence earlier this year. Natasha Jonas, pictured in blue at London 2012, announced her retirement from boxing on April 7 . The Preston fighter has boiled down to the flyweight division in order to challenge for Adams' Olympic spot and they should go head-to-head for the first time in next Sunday's final. But Adams, who underwent shoulder surgery earlier this year, warned: 'I am feeling really good - my speed and timing have returned and I feel like a whole new fighter. 'I had to change my style for the Commonwealth Games because I had to hide just how much of a problem my shoulder was causing, but I came through it and took the gold medal. 'Now it is not giving me any problems at all so I can revert to the way I have always fought and hopefully the fans in Liverpool will be able to see me at my best.'","London 2012 gold medallist Nicola Adams will prolong her career .

"It is matches like this that makes one wonder just how good Gael Monfils could have been; and perhaps how good he still can be. The Frenchman is sometimes fantastic, often frustrating and always flamboyant but he brought all the good parts of his game to bear as he knocked Roger Federer out of the Monte Carlo Masters 6-4, 7-6 in a thrilling last-16 encounter. Monfils displayed the breathtaking athleticism that can make Novak Djokovic look sluggish and the shotmaking that can make Andy Murray seem conventional.

Federer started smoothly and broke with a clever chipped return. But the 33-year-old handed the break back with a double fault and the momentum swung towards the Frenchman. At 4-4, Monfils came out on top in a pulsating 31-shot rally to bring up three break points. On the second, he won another grueling point and then served out comfortably. The second set was the best of the tournament so far. Each game was fiercely contested with both men playing superb, intense tennis.

"Freddie Roach  insisted on Saturday that Floyd Mayweather does not deserve to be ranked alongside Manny Pacquiao as the leading fighters of their generation as the two boxers put the finishing touches to their preparations for the Fight of the Century in Las Vegas a week on Saturday. Roach, Pacquiao’s trainer, said he rated super-middleweight star Andre Ward and middleweight sensation Gennady Golovkin above Mayweather despite the American’s unbeaten record and his status as hot favourite for the May 2 showdown against Pacquiao. ‘Mayweather is undefeated so you have to give him a little credit for that,’ said Roach, ‘but he has picked and chosen his opponents and I don’t think he’s fought enough competition to be considered the best. You have to fight the best to be the best, I feel. He’s ducked a lot of guys. Manny Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach says that Floyd Mayweather cannot be considered best ever . Roach says that Mayweather has picked and chosen his fights during his career . ‘Manny has had some devastating losses in his career but he is a realist. He understands that losing is part of the game and if you don’t think you are going to get knocked out in this sport, you have picked the wrong sport. I’d put Ward and Triple G above Mayweather right now. They are very talented guys and very polished boxers.’ Roach has been vocal in an otherwise low-key and surprisingly respectful build-up to the welterweight showdown next month and knows that his tactics have made the stakes even higher for him. But he is adamant Pacquiao will spring a surprise in the most eagerly awaited fight for years. ‘The fight will be won and lost on the ropes,’ said Roach. ‘If Mayweather goes to the ropes and tries to rest his legs, he will get beat. If he has good movement the entire night and his legs don’t give out on him, he’ll probably win. It’s about outscoring him. If he sits on the ropes, we can outscore him. If he stays in the middle of the ring and boxes all the time he could possibly outscore us.’ Roach claimed Pacquiao is in the best shape of his life, moving faster and punching harder than ever before. ‘He trains harder than any fighter I have ever had in my life,’ said Roach. ‘I have had 33 world champions and nobody can touch him for his work ethic. His attitude is good. ‘This fight can send out a message about what we need to do in boxing. When the best fights the best, do you see how big this is? Someone needs to wake up and put the best with the best all the time. Because when that happens, we have the best sport in the world. I don’t care who likes who, you can still negotiate business. Roach rates super middleweight Andre Ward higher than he does undefeated Mayweather . Roach, who has trained Pacquiao for 15 years, says the Filipino is in the best shape of his life . ‘It’s a better fight today than it was five years ago because they were both a lot faster and more mobile five years ago and it might have been more of a boxing match but now they’re a little bit older, it’s going to be a better fight. ‘I believe Manny can win this fight. I kind of have to win this fight. I’ve been talking a lot. It’s more important than anything to me. It’s more important to me than getting my girlfriend, Maya, back. It’s that big because, I mean, I really like this girl. ‘My mother told me, “You must like her; you put her Christmas tree up for her, you bought her a car and those earrings you bought her cost £14,000 each”. ‘After this fight maybe I’ll try to get her back.’","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas on May 2 .

"Jack Nicklaus believes it is time for the 'young guys to take over' after Jordan Spieth's record-breaking Masters victory on Sunday. Nicklaus was hugely impressed by Spieth's four-shot win over Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson, which saw him set 36 and 54-hole scoring records, equal the 72-hole record set by Tiger Woods in 1997 and also become the first player ever to reach 19 under par at Augusta. The 21-year-old, who was second last year, moved from fourth in the world rankings to second behind Rory McIlroy as a result and that means the world's top two players have a combined age of 46. In comparison, Mickelson is 44 and Tiger Woods 39. Jordan Spieth (left) sent a number of Augusta records tumbling on his way to winning The Masters . The 21-year-old Spieth equalled Tiger Woods' 72-hole record and became the first man to get to 19-under par . Jack Nicklaus (right) lauded Spieth, and heralded a new golfing era led by him and Rory McIlroy . McIlroy and Spieth have a combined age of 46, where as Phil Mickelson (left) is 44 and Tiger Woods 39 . 'That was an incredible performance,' six-time Masters champion Nicklaus said in a statement. 'It was so apparent that he learned down the stretch last year, but you have to remember he was only 20 at the time. 'Now he's a grizzled veteran at 21 years old - just 21. Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about the young man. He's polite. He's humble. He handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he's obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion. I think Jordan Spieth is a great person - just as I think Rory McIlroy is - to carry the mantle for the game of golf. 'I am someone who likes the new generations. I always have. I think it energises the game of golf. We had Arnold's (Palmer) generation, then it came to my generation, then Tom Watson came along and right on down the line to Tiger and Rory. 'And now we have Jordan Spieth. There are some older players who have been terrific for a long time, but actually this might be time for the young guys to take over.' Spieth's mentor and fellow Texan Ben Crenshaw also paid tribute to the new champion after watching the final round from his home in Austin. 'I don't know what it is, but he just has this maturity,' Crenshaw, who missed the cut in his 44th and final consecutive Masters appearance last week, told the PGA Tour website. 'He's got an awareness of where's he going. He's got a plan. Nicklaus believes that the duo of Spieth (left) and McIlroy 'energise' the game of golf . McIlroy came fourth in The Masters, falling short in an attempt to seal a career grand slam before he turns 26 . Ben Crenshaw, Spieth's mentor, praised the maturity he displayed to become the new Masters champion . Greg Norman took to Twitter to praise Spieth and also revealed his excitement for the future of golf . 'When I look at him, I look into a future. He's a player with so much imagination. I cannot wait to watch him play the Open at St. Andrews. It's a place where you have to have so much imagination. It's going to be fun.' Former world number one Greg Norman wrote on Twitter: 'Golf is in great hands @McIlroyRory and @TheMasters champ @JordanSpieth plus a cast of other phenomenal players.

"Roger Federer spent less than one hour on court in his Monte Carlo opener with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Jeremy Chardy. Federer, who has changed his schedule this year to allow more time for recovery and training, played his first match since his loss in the Indian Wells final in March. And he did not look rusty, hitting 19 winners to dispatch an opponent who beat him last year in Rome. Roger Federer defeated Jeremy Chardy in his Monte Carlo opener 6-2, 6-1 to reach the last 16 .

"Saracens breathed a huge sigh of relief on Tuesday night as Billy Vunipola was cleared of intentionally headbutting Mathew Tait — leaving the No 8 free to face Clermont Auvergne in Saturday’s Champions Cup semi-final. An RFU disciplinary panel dismissed a charge that Vunipola had recklessly led with his head in a incident which left the Leicester full back prone on the ground following a clash last weekend. Saracens are the last remaining English club in the competition and would have appealed against the decision if their in-form England star had been banned. Billy Vunipola trains in the spring sunshine on Tuesday as Saracens prepare for Saturday's clash . The England No 8 had been cited for striking Leicester full back Matehw Tait with his head . ‘As a club we have respect for the disciplinary processes which are in place but at the same time we are surprised,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall on Tuesday before the verdict. ‘He’s been charged with a strike to the head. It’s got to be intentional but everyone can see that it isn’t. There are enough camera angles to see that Billy’s eyes stay firmly on the ball. ‘If it’s not intentional, the next argument is “was it reckless?” But Billy is decelerating into the contact. ‘He’s in a great driving position and his feet are in contact with the ground. There’s no recklessness involved. It was just an accidental clash of heads.’ Vunipola and his team-mates appear to be having fun in training as he awaited the RFU verdict . Leicester’s Vereniki Goneva received a one-week ban for striking Saracens flanker Kelly Brown in the same game. Meanwhile, Saracens are considering picking exciting 20-year-old forward Maro Itoje in their back row alongside Vunipola. Itoje, who captained England Under 20s’ World Cup winning side last year, signed a new contract on Tuesday and has been touted as a possible bolter for the senior squad at this year’s tournament. ‘It’s exciting,’ Itoje said. ‘I feel like I’ve progressed a lot this season.’ Former England Under 20s captain Maro Itoje has signed a new long-term contract at Saracens .","Billy Vunipola was cited for clash of heads with Leicester's Mathew Tait .

"England's new record wicket-taker James Anderson has promised there is more to come as he believes he is still improving as a bowler. Anderson induced an edge from West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin on the final day of the first Test in Antigua for his 384th Test scalp on Friday, breaking Sir Ian Botham's record which had stood for 23 years. Anderson, 32, broke the record in the same match which saw him collect his landmark 100th cap for England, although there was disappointment as England could not force a victory. James Anderson races away to celebrate after he claimed his record-breaking 384th wicket . Anderson is mobbed by his England team-mates after he broke Sir Ian Botham's long-standing record . Anderson is congratulated by Botham as he leaves the field following the day's action in Antigua . In his column in the Sun on Sunday, Anderson wrote: 'I am convinced I can still improve as a bowler and take plenty more wickets for England.' He added: 'There is no way I am going to rest on my laurels and enter cruise control just because I have the record. I'm going to work damn hard to try to get better. 'I can definitely improve, I can learn more tricks. For example, the leg-cutter with which I took my record 384th wicket was delivery I learned from Stuart Broad as recently as the World Cup.' Anderson said he had no intention of setting himself targets in terms of either Tests played or wickets taken for England because 'I don't want to put limits on anything' but said he is learning to pace himself in order to be able to play more regularly. 'I feel fit enough and strong enough to bowl in the high-80s if I need to but I'm also sensible enough to realise you can't do it all the time,' he said. 'I'm quite relieved the record is out of the way and I can concentrate on doing my job for the rest of the series.'

The Mercedes men left Shanghai after the Chinese Grand Prix arguing over the rights and wrongs of how they raced. But Hamilton, speaking ahead of Sunday's race in Bahrain, adopted an air of cool disdain for any psychological battles. 'It's not really changed much,' said the double world champion.

"Mike Tindall wouldn't have moved any quicker had he been surging towards the posts in a Six Nations clash at Twickenham. In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National . Tindall celebrates after watching his horse Monbeg Dude finish third in the National . Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost £12,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The £88,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree . Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow. But what a great day. I really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now.' He wasn't the only one. Aintree, even when you are defeated, is a place where dreams can come true.","Mike Tindall owned Monbeg Dude finished third in the Grand National .

"Australia captain Michael Clarke believes Kevin Pietersen could play in this summer's Ashes Test series. The 34-year-old has not played for his country since the fifth Test in Sydney, a match England lost to complete a 5-0 series defeat Down Under. Pietersen was described as 'disengaged' from his team-mates during that final Test by England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton. Australia captain Michael Clarke believes Kevin Pietersen could play in this summer's Ashes Test series. Downton has since left his role and Pietersen has signed for Surrey with the intent of scoring the runs which would earn him a recall. He scored 170 against Oxford MCCU recently and Clarke feels Pietersen could represent his country again. 'I do think he could be at the Ashes,' said Clarke. 'He has certainly scored enough runs. 'He has made it very clear he wants to play and now it will come down to the England selectors and England board making a decision. Pietersen has not featured for England since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . The former England star is hoping to win back his Test place with a return to red ball cricket . 'But at the moment from the Australians' perspective, I'm happy if he is not playing because he is a wonderful player.' Clarke will link up with Pietersen in the Big Bash League after confirming he will be the captain of the Melbourne Stars next year. 'It's going to be nice to be on the same side,' he said. 'To have that luxury as captain - to have a player like that in your team - is extremely exciting and I know he'll play a big part in us having success.'","Michael Clarke believes Kevin Pietersen's Surrey form warrants a recall .

"The MCC has announced the latest phase of its 'Masterplan' redevelopment of Lord's which includes the replacement of the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands. The intention is to build a single new structure in their place, with more than 5,500 seats, in the south-western corner of the home of cricket - to raise the ground's overall capacity to almost 30,000. MCC is operating to a projected budget of £80million, and hopes work can begin in autumn 2017 - subject to planning permission, consultation with nearby residents and the approval of club members. MCC reveals plans to replace the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands at Lord's, with completion scheduled for 2019 . The redevelopment will increase the overall capacity of Lord's, the home of English cricket, to almost 30,000 . If the project goes ahead, a new Thomas Lord Building and new Tavern pub will also be included - as well as enlarged dressing rooms in the pavilion and a 'more pedestrian-friendly entrance to the ground', via the Grace Gates. MCC chief executive Derek Brewer said: 'The south-western project will ensure facilities for players, match officials, supporters and MCC members are of the highest possible standard by modernising areas of the ground that have become tired. 'MCC is committed to maintaining Lord's as the finest cricket ground in the world, and this project also provides a wonderful new front door to the home of cricket.' MCC aims to submit a planning application to Westminster City Council this summer. A completion schedule for the new stand is spring 2019, in time for that summer's World Cup and Ashes. It is anticipated the remaining elements of the 'Masterplan' may take a further three years.

"Siobhan-Marie O'Connor won gold in the 200 metres individual medley at the British Championships to ensure qualification for the World Championships this summer. O'Connor's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year and came comfortably inside the World Championships qualification mark of 2:10:20. Hannah Miley took the silver medal with a time of 2:11:65 and Aimee Willmott claimed bronze in 2:13:30. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor celebrates with second-placed Hannah Miley (left) and third-placed Aimee Willmott . O'Connor, who is the reigning Commonwealth champion, was short of her 2:08.21 personal best - a British record - but said making the team for Russia was her main focus. 'I'm chuffed, the (qualifying) times are a massive challenge but it means everyone has to step up and race world class times,' O'Connor said. 'I'm really just happy to have made the team. It was really tough. I'm happy with that time, I just wanted to go under 2.10. 'I would have ideally liked to have been closer to my personal best but sometimes you're not on your best form. To get the qualifying time was my main aim.' O'Connor's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year . The performance of O'Connor, who won 100m freestyle gold on Tuesday, is particularly impressive considering the heavy disruptions to her winter training programme. The pool at the University of Bath, where the 19-year-old has trained for most of her career, has been closed for six months renovation meaning she and her group have been forced to relocate 32 miles away at Millfield School. 'It has been hard over the last six months,' O'Connor added. 'It has been a challenge but everyone has challenges in sport. 'It's just something we have to deal with. It couldn't have been any better and I'm proud to have adapted to it. 'It's definitely been tough, we've all felt that. Our pool is open in Bath after this though so I'm looking forward to getting back there and getting some consistency again.' The 19-year-old claimed two titles despite heavy disruptions to her winter training programme . Jazz Carlin followed up her success in the 400m freestyle on Wednesday with a dominant performance in the 800m freestyle to win another gold medal. Carlin clocked 8:21:58 which was enough to seal the title but she missed the World Championships qualifying time of 8:21:22. The Commonwealth and European champion is still likely to race the 800m in Russia, after finishing more than 10 seconds clear of Jessica Thielmann (8:32:19) in second and Camilla Hattersley in third (8:37:99). 'I'm not too disappointed to miss the qualifying time,' Carlin said. 'For myself I would have liked to have gone quicker but to make the worlds qualifying time yesterday I'm sure I'll get to swim the event there. 'It felt a bit tough tonight, I didn't really get into it, I felt a bit heavy in my stroke but that happens.' Elizabeth Simmonds won the women's 100m backstroke, registering 1:00:03, while Craig McNally took gold in the men's 200m backstroke with a time of 1:57:58 and Stephen Milne clinched the men's 1500m freestyle title in 14:58:25.","Siobhan-Marie O'Connor won her second title of the British Championships .

"Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is unsure whether a planned boycott by Newcastle fans will prove a help or hindrance to his side this weekend. This season, like so many in recent years, has been a frustrating one at St James' Park and that has led some fans to take action when Spurs arrive on Sunday. A number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner Mike Ashley, which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino (right) is in an upbeat mood ahead of the trip to Newcastle . Newcastle fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at St James' Park . It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own. 'You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive,' the Spurs boss said. 'Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season. 'Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and don't show their face. 'You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team. For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.' On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa. Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling out . The fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park. 'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said. 'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood. 'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood.

'When he went in the game against Liverpool, he got a good ovation and it was good to see him playing football. 'This is real life.

"Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp feels he still has plenty to offer football but only at the right club, having turned down a 'mind-blowing' offer to coach abroad. The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'.

Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match . The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February . Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago . The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time . 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club . The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining . 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.' Redknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year. He said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause. 'We are all scared that if the doctor tells you that you have something wrong, but if you get there early enough it can be cured - you can't let it just go.'

"Ronny Deila has warned television broadcasters to stop messing around Scottish football fans. The Celtic boss leads his side into a Scottish Cup semi-final with Inverness at Hampden on Sunday with a 12.15 kick-off. And after a week of turmoil and complaints – from clubs and supporters – over the unhealthy sway television has on kick-off times, Deila says the balance of power in the relationship is all wrong. Ronny Deila will take his Celtic side to Hampden Park for the Scottish Cup semi-final on Sunday . The match will take place at 12:15, a time that Scottish football fans do not agree with . 'I think TV is an issue that I don't like in terms of the kick-off times,' said the Norwegian. 'It should not be TV that controls football – it should be the opposite. 'It should be about the supporters and the clubs so that they can make money by getting people into the stands - because that is what we live for. 'I understand the economics of it are so important and that television takes over and take control. 'But I don't like that. It's not the best for people who like football.' The SPFL sparked a furious row this week when they put back the final Rangers game of the season by 24 hours for broadcast on Sky Sports – sparking outright fury from Hibernian and Hearts. Celtic players train at Lennoxtown in preparation for Sunday's crunch match against Inverness . Deila (right) believes that teams should have more of a say on kick-off times, rather than broadcasters . Both capital clubs have lodged formal complaints over the governance of the game, with chief executive Neil Doncaster under pressure ahead of a stormy SPFL AGM on Thursday. At the heart of the problem is the growing fury of fans at being messed around with late changes to kick-off dates and times to facilitate broadcasters offering Scottish football a tiny fraction of the billions paid to English clubs. None of Celtic's post-split fixtures will be played on a Saturday at 3pm, forcing season-ticket holders from Ireland and England to cancel or alter their travel plans. 'There are different traditions in different countries,' added Deila. 'In Norway, we had the best time, which is six o'clock on Sunday, but now they are doing different times. 'In the end, you don't know when games are going on. 'It's so hard to plan the weekend with the family and also get to the games. 'If Saturday at 3pm is the best for Scotland then we should play more at that time. A Celtic scarf displayed outside Celtic Park shows fans' desire for Deila to win them the treble this season . 'I would also rather play at six in the evening than 12 in the morning. 'I think football should be played at night because then you get a better atmosphere into the arena.' Addressing concerns that Celtic are being affected more than most through large gaps in the stands, Deila acknowledged: 'It's a big problem for us. We need supporters to come to the games. We need interest and television needs it, as well. 'If there are no people in the stadiums then it will be more boring to watch. 'I don't like it that television is telling us when we are playing. We want to set the time ourselves. 'Communication is very important here. It's the same when I am talking with Peter Lawwell. I want certain things and he wants his things. We both put our points across hard and then we compromise. 'I think it should be the same between the clubs and television. There has to be give and take. 'In this matter, we don't have much of a say. We have to play most of our games at 12 o'clock and that's not the best for our supporters.' Supporting the view of Hearts, Hibs and Rangers that the decision to play the final game of the Championship season 24 hours after the rest was foolish and contrary to 'sporting integrity', Deila added: 'In my opinion, in the last two rounds of matches every team should play at the same time so you can't play knowing other results.'","Celtic will play their Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness on Sunday .

"Charlie Austin is being considered for a surprise England call up for the national team’s summer fixtures after scoring 17 goals for relegation-threatened QPR. Austin is in contention because Harry Kane, who scored on his debut against Lithuania last month and made his first start against Italy in Turin, will be with Gareth Southgate’s Under-21 team.

"Southampton manager Ronald Koeman accepts it will be difficult to keep hold of Nathaniel Clyne this summer as Manchester United prepare a bid for England's first-choice right back. An unparalleled summer talent drain last year led many onlookers to predict a meltdown at St Mary's, yet they have gone on to defy the odds and produce a remarkable season. Saints are pushing for a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League with six matches to go, although that success has led the vultures to once again circle overhead. Nathaniel Clyne (left) has attracted the glances of several top clubs with his performances for Southampton . Clyne, out of contract next summer, is one such target and this week fuelled mounting speculation over a move to United by talking about his desire to play in the Champions League. Koeman twice won the competition as a player and fully understands Clyne's ambitions, and therefore the difficulty Saints may face in getting him to stay. 'It's up to the press how they take those kind of comments,' the Dutchman said. 'I like to play Champions League as well but that's the aspiration for every football player and it's a normal aspiration. If you don't mention that, there's something wrong. 'We are still in talking with the agent of Clyney, but it's difficult. I read in the press there's some interest. 'Nobody knocked on the door with an offer for Clyne, but we know (he has) one season on his contract and we want Clyne to stay at the club. Clyne made his full England debut last November . 'We need understanding for that but nothing else. 'We hope one day we will compare to the big ones, but that's difficult. We know our level, we know our possibilities. 'The club can't fight against big teams in the Premier League because the money and the possibilities of them are still much higher than we have.' Koeman's understanding will only last for so long, though, and the Southampton manager wants Clyne's future sorted before the end of the campaign. 'We don't wait until the end of the season because you know if there is a player who is left one season of his contract then you have to do something,' he said. 'Of course we have to do everything to keep the player in the team, but I like to know it as soon as possible - not in the last week of the season, but earlier on. 'I mentioned April but by the end of April, the first week of May, it's good to know something about his situation.' Clyne will be hoping to start for Saints at Stoke this weekend, having been dropped to the bench for the win against Hull. Filip Djuricic and Victor Wanyama will be absent for the trip to the Britannia Stadium, as will long-term absentees Fraser Forster, Emmanuel Mayuka and Jay Rodriguez. It is more than a year since the latter last featured for Saints, having ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in defeat at Manchester City. There is at last some positive news for Rodriguez, though, with the forward set to join up with first-team training for 'some parts of the sessions' from next week. 'I hope that he can play a part in one of them maybe last one,' Koeman said. 'Maybe it will be on one side a tough one (to return in) because it is Man City and he got this injury against them. 'That will be nice to end the season but the focus has to be next season and if he is part of one or two games this season it will be great for him, great for the team, great for the club. Adam Lallana was part of the Southampton exodus as he left St Mary's for Liverpool . Lallana was joined at Anfield by Dejan Lovren but Southampton have barely been affected by their absence . 'He is putting everything in to get back, but we are not in a hurry. If he comes back he has to be 100 per cent and that's most important.' Rodriguez's return to fitness will bring with it heightened speculation about his future. Like Clyne and Morgan Schneiderlin, the 25-year-old has been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with the likes of Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool mentioned. But Koeman said: 'Of course I expect we don't sell the player. The player didn't play in my first season as a manager. 'He's good guy, a positive one and a good player, and maybe that will be the best transfer what we can do for the next season.'","Southampton have seen several of their best players leave in recent years .

"Celtic's Treble dream died on Sunday with striker Leigh Griffiths pointing the finger of blame squarely at the officials after his side's shock Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Inverness. A blatant Josh Meekings handball in the box was missed by referee Steven McLean and his team, particularly assistant Alan Muir, at the end of the first half with the Parkhead club left to rue the decision not to award a penalty and dispense a red card. A goal down at the time, Inverness fought back and eventually emerged victorious following a pulsating period of extra-time and the Celtic players could do little to hide their fury after the match. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness . Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . Despite numerous appeals, no penalty or red card was given for Meekings' handball and Inverness won . 'We have a lot of disappointed lads inside that dressing room — we've been robbed,' said Griffiths who, more than an hour after the final whistle, was still struggling to contain his own disbelief and anger. 'It was very disappointing. We had a chance to go and make history. We didn't get the result in the end.' Celtic were a Virgil van Dijk goal to the good at the time of the Meekings incident but the game was then turned on its head in the second half as Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon was sent off for a foul on Marley Watkins. Greg Tansey equalised with the resultant spot-kick and suddenly John Hughes' men were in ascendancy. With the teams level at full-time, Edward Ofere and John Guidetti swapped goals in extra-time before David Raven grabbed a 117th-minute winner — leaving the Highlanders jubilant and their opponents distraught. Parkhead manager Ronny Deila had insisted he need not say anything about the penalty incident. Scott Brown, meanwhile, stalked past with a face like thunder, lightning and Force 10 hurricane all rolled into one angry swirling mass, damned near taking the door off its hinges as he made a dramatic exit from the depths of the national stadium. 'I have asked the centre-half in the second half if it has hit his hand or his face - and he said it hit his hand 100 per cent, so in my book that's a penalty and a red card,' continued Griffiths. 'We have probably the best penalty taker in the league in Kris Commons, who I am sure would go and tuck it away to put us 2-0 up. They'd have been down to 10 men and it would have been a mountain for them to come back. Celtic's Aleksandar Tonev (centre) is challenged by Marley Watkins (left) and Edward Ofere (right) on Sunday . Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) has words with referee Steven McLean during the Scottish Cup semi-final . 'I knew it was a penalty. I think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty. The second half has been very lucky. 'He is the one who said it hit him in the face (the additional assistant ref). I asked the ref why he didn't give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him in the face. I don't know what angle he is looking from because everyone else could see it was a penalty. 'He said the referee behind the goal said it hit him in the face and there is nothing I can do about that now. It is a game-changing decision. 'When you have officials behind the goals, they need to be doing their job. If he thinks that's him in on the face ...? 'I don't really want to say too much about the officials because I'll end up in trouble. But it's a massive, massive decision and it's cost us the game. 'Everybody was so content that we were going to win the league, we already have a trophy (the League Cup) in the bag. Everyone was saying the Scottish Cup was practically a given. But we knew we had to come here and do a job - and it's just unlucky that we never managed to get it done.' Griffiths attempts an acrobatic shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final on Sunday against Inverness . As much as Griffiths was nursing a personal grievance over being denied yet another Hampden semi-final goal, the former Hibs star felt for manager Deila, a man who has been so open about his desire to win a Treble – and his belief in this team's ability to do so. Celtic had made no bones about their determination to succeed where so many had failed, backing themselves to have the skill and strength to get the job done, whatever obstacles they might have to overcome. 'I think the gaffer is the most disappointed person out of everyone,' said the Griffiths. 'He'd only have been the third Celtic manager to have won a Treble. 'He would have made history and as players we would have become legends. But it' s difficult to do that. I said it during the week that when you are that close to winning a Treble, the games get harder. Inverness stood in our way and did a job. 'Now we have to go again and pick ourselves up for the rest of the season. We have a massive game at Dens Park on Wednesday. Dundee will be up for it, we've just played 120 minutes in a semi-final. We have three days and then we have to play Dundee at a difficult venue. But we need three points. 'This will fire us up. We aren't far away from clinching the league now. We have two hard games in the next week at Dens and Tannadice. If we go there and pick up three points from each, we will be in a real good position.' From Treble to Double, just like that. Celtic will be weary on Wednesday, certainly. But Dundee should certainly beware some kind of angry backlash. And the Dens Park ground staff may want to reinforce some of the doors. Just in case Brown takes the storm with him.

"For Inverness the latest chapter in their remarkable story featured not one, but two, plot-changing twists. One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic . Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point . 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller . Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute . 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.' There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final . 'I had a lot of great times at Falkirk. So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful . There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes. 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'","Josh Meekings handball should have been a penalty and a red card .

Eddie Howe and his Bournemouth players applaud travelling fans after victory against Reading . Howe has called on supporters to inspire the Cherries to win promotion from the Championship . 'The pleasing thing from our perspective regarding our home form is that it's improved as the season has gone on,' Howe told the club's official website. 'We have become more consistent, more adept at dealing with the different problems that we face and how teams set up against us, so we are in a good place at home. 'Hopefully the crowd can inspire us because we are going to need them more than ever. 'In these two games I'm sure there will be moments where we are either under pressure or need a lift and that's when hopefully they can do their bit for us.' Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic refuses to look beyond Saturday's home game against Birmingham as his third-placed side bid to climb back into the top two. Slavisa Jokanovic is not looking beyond Birmingham as Watford chase automatic promotion . 'There are three games more,' Jokanovic told his club's official website. 'We must continue, we must be ready. 'We know there is the chance of three more games after this, but we are not thinking of this. 'Only Birmingham City and three points on Saturday. That is the focus. We cannot talk about taking nine points because this is not what is in front of us.' Steve McClaren's Derby must improve on their recent away form at Huddersfield if they are to secure a play-off finish. The Rams, who have not won at Huddersfield since Boxing Day 1995, have won only one of their last seven games on the road, while Chris Powell's Terriers are unbeaten in their last four matches. Ipswich, Brentford and Wolves make up the four teams battling it out for the last two play-off places. Mick McCarthy will take Luke Chambers (above) to his former club Wolves at the weekend . Mick McCarthy takes his Tractor Boys to Molineux for a potential humdinger against former club Wolves, while Brentford face Bolton at Griffin Park. Wigan will be relegated for the second time in three seasons if they fail to beat Brighton at home. Relegation rivals Millwall will look to build on Tuesday night's home win against Wigan with victory at Cardiff. Leeds, who have lost their last four matches, are chasing their first win in six at Charlton, Nottingham Forest are bidding to halt their five-game unbeaten run at Blackburn and Fulham aim to edge closer to survival with victory at relegated Blackpool.","Bournemouth lead the Championship table in bid for promotion .

"Manchester United target Nathaniel Clyne admits he wants to play Champions League football as the Southampton defender continues to be linked with a move away from the south coast. The right back has been in impressive form this season as the Saints have surprised many with a challenge on the Premier League's top four. Clyne, who has earned international recognition with his performances, has courted interest from the Old Trafford club throughout the season. Nathaniel Clyne attended a fund-raising event for the Football Fighting Ebola campaign on Sunday night . Nathaniel Clyne has impressed for Southampton this season and has been linked with move away . 'It's always good to have teams looking out for you, it shows how well you've been doing all season,' Clyne told Sky Sports News. 'I am going to take that, and keep on performing and be the best player I can be. 'Right now I'm concentrating on playing for Southampton, there are still games to play, and try to push for that fourth spot. Ronald Koeman has admitted it may be hard to keep Clyne at the club this summer . The Southampton defender has been capped four times by England this season . 'I am an ambitious person and I want to play Champions League football. To win the title and the FA Cup, that is what I want.'

"Some of the Premier League's less glamorous clubs face a battle this summer to keep hold of their brightest stars who have caught the eye of the 'big boys'. The likes of Morgan Schneiderlin, Yannick Bolasie and Nathaniel Clyne are wanted men as Champions League heavyweights like Arsenal and Manchester United circle like vultures. Sportsmail looks at 10 players who could be taking a ‘step up’ this summer. MORGAN SCHNEIDERLIN (Southampton) Wanted by: Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea Valued at: £25m . Destined to be the most wanted player of the summer after an excellent season in midfield for Southampton. Arsene Wenger has long seen the Frenchman as an ideal holding player for Arsenal while Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino worked with him at St Mary's. Now Jose Mourinho is joining the chase, believing a Nemanja Matic-Schneiderlin axis will help Chelsea conquer Europe. Morgan Schneiderlin has shown this season that he is good enough to play Champions League football . Southampton convinced Schneiderlin to stay at the club last summer, but he is now ready to leave . Southampton dug in a year ago to persuade Schneiderlin to stay on the south coast but it is going to be virtually impossible to keep him again given that the 25-year-old has been putting in Champions League-standard performances all season and is coming into his prime. DANNY INGS (Burnley) Wanted by: Liverpool, Manchester United Valued at: £5m (compensation) The England Under 21 striker is out of contract in the summer and has no intention of staying at Turf Moor regardless of whether Burnley keep their Premier League status. Financially, he would make an excellent acquisition for a top club given the compensation for a Bosman would only be around a third of his true market value. Liverpool are interested - to sign a striker who turns 23 in July and who has scored nine Premier League goals this season, without having to pay a hefty transfer fee, is a no-brainer for the moneyball approach. But they face competition from United. Danny Ings is out of contract this summer and his scoring exploits have made him a target for top clubs . Burnley are resigned to losing Ings on a free and will only receive a modest compensation fee for him . NATHANIEL CLYNE (Southampton) Wanted by: Manchester United Valued at: £17m . After a season in which he made his England debut, 24-year-old Clyne is destined to follow his former Crystal Palace team-mate Wilfried Zaha to Old Trafford – but is fully expected to enjoy more success. The right back, who once helped Championship club Palace win a League Cup match at United, has been one of the revelations of the season at St Mary's this season and made it clear he won't enter talks about a new contract. Louis van Gaal has made a right back a priority this summer and Clyne is the red-hot favourite. Louis van Gaal has made Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne his top priority this summer . Clyne's impressive form for Southampton has earned him a regular spot in the England team . AARON CRESSWELL (West Ham) Wanted by: Manchester City, Chelsea Valued at: £12m . Arrived in the Premier League via Tranmere Rovers and Ipswich Town, and the left back's performances for West Ham have alerted both Manchester City and Chelsea, who need strengthening in that position and are both short of homegrown players. Liverpudlian Cresswell, 25, has been an ever-present for West Ham this season and even though he signed a new contract last summer, the London club are willing to extend it to 2020. Aaron Cresswell scored a superb free-kick against Stoke City last weekend to raise his market value . Manchester City and Chelsea are interested in the defender, but West Ham are hopeful he will stay . YANNICK BOLASIE (Crystal Palace) Wanted by: Liverpool Valued at: £10m . The 25-year-old winger has been one of the surprise breakthrough players of the season with a hat-trick at Sunderland last weekend answering the call from manager Alan Pardew for more goals to go alongside his undoubted ability. Bolasie, a DR Congo international, is one of the most naturally gifted and unpredictable players in the division and a major reason Palace are now an established force in the top flight. Liverpool and Spurs like to play with width and both need a player who is comfortable on the left-hand side. Yannick Bolasie has been in superb form for Crystal Palace this season and could be a target . Bolasie celebrates after netting a hat-trick against Sunderland and he is wanted by Liverpool in the summer . CHARLIE AUSTIN (QPR) Wanted by: Liverpool, Tottenham Valued at: £10m . Austin has been outstanding in a struggling side and his tally of 17 Premier League goals is the fourth-best in the division and only two behind Diego Costa, Sergio Aguero and Harry Kane who are with clubs at the other end of the table. It seems inevitable Austin will move on should Rangers get relegated. Liverpool need a natural goalscorer with Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli set to leave in the summer while Spurs don't want to be over-reliant on Kane. Charlie Austin is only a couple of goals short of the league's leading scorers and is a target for Liverpool . Spurs are also interested in the English striker as they look for a partner for Harry Kane up front . SAIDO BERAHINO (West Brom) Wanted by: Tottenham Valued at: £15m . The England Under 21 striker has made headlines for the wrong reasons this season and received a 12-month driving ban in January after being convicted of drink-driving. On the pitch, his 18 goals in all competitions have underlined his goalscoring potential and Spurs have taken note. West Brom's early valuation of around £25m appears overly optimistic but if the Baggies decide to be more realistic in negotiations, there is every chance he could fulfil his dream of moving to a bigger club. Saido Berahino has scored 18 times this season although his off-field actions have caused controversy . AYOZE PEREZ (Newcastle United) Wanted by: Arsenal, Manchester United Valued at: £12m . Newcastle's scouting system came up trumps when they paid £1m to Tenerife for the little-known forward in August. Since then, Perez has displayed some of the quickest feet seen in the Premier League and scored five goals, including the winner against Liverpool. At 21, Perez is far from the finished article but Arsene Wenger and Louis van Gaal have spotted his potential, particularly as this is his debut season in England. Ayoze Perez has impressed since joining Newcastle for a small fee last summer and could move on again . ROSS BARKLEY (Everton) Wanted by: Manchester City Valued at: £40m . It may be harsh for Everton fans for their club not to be included as a 'big club' but that's the reality when it comes to young international players like Barkley; they are in the bottom half of the table and have sold the likes of Wayne Rooney, Joleon Lescott and Marouane Fellaini in their prime. Barkley has been compared with Paul Gascoigne for his ability to dribble and hold defenders off. This has been a difficult season by his standards but Manchester City, always on the lookout for the best homegrown players, believe he has the ability to go all the way. Ross Barkley may not have had the best of seasons but he is still a target for some of the league's top sides . Barkley has retained his England place, and would be a key signing for clubs short of homegrown talent . JACK GREALISH (Aston Villa) Wanted by: Chelsea, Manchester City Valued at: £15m . The teenage midfielder signed a four-year deal at Villa earlier this season so it would take a big push by Chelsea or City to prise him away this summer. Nonetheless, a stand-out performance by Grealish in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool could persuade them. If Barkley gets by defenders with strength and strong running, the nimble-footed Grealish seems to escape his markers in the tightest of spaces. If comparing him with Lionel Messi is a bit exaggerated, think Middlesbrough's former Brazilian player, Juninho. Jack Grealish has broken through this season at Aston Villa and is wanted by Chelsea and Manchester City .","Champions League-chasing clubs looking to hoover up talent .

"Leeds president Massimo Cellino insists he had nothing to do with the events that led to six players pulling out of Saturday's match against Charlton. Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri, Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani withdrew from the squad on the eve of the trip to The Valley citing injuries, prompting some accusations that the players had gone 'on strike'. The club released a statement on Sunday evening looking to draw a line under the controversy which read: 'Leeds United Football Club wants to clarify that during the days leading up to the away Championship fixture at Charlton Athletic on Saturday April 17 that six first-team players suffered injuries.' Massimo Cellino insists he had nothing to do with the events that led to players pulling out of Saturday's match against Charlton . Mirco Antenucci was among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton . And Cellino, who has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, has now also distanced himself from any possible conspiracy theory, telling the Sun: 'I am not a coward and not the sort of guy who tells his players to go on strike. 'I only found out on Friday evening. I admit it looks weird. But if the players were injured, why didn't the manager inform the chairman? 'This looks like a fight between manager Neil Redfearn and the ownership of the club, which is not good.' Cellino's ban and the injury controversy are just two of a string of chaotic events that have plagued Leeds recently with Redfearn's position increasingly threatened over recent weeks . Giuseppe Bellusci, Antenucci and two other Italians were among those who made themselves unavailable . Redfearn has led the club to safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic, but he saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. The state of flux at Elland Road has led many fans to call for Cellino to leave the club altogether but the Italian insists he still wishes to take the Whites forward. 'From day one I felt I was at the right club, because I am more f****d up than the fans,' he said. 'I am 58 and my dream is still for us to do something big here. I have asked permission to go to our last game of the season against Rotherham, a day before my ban ends. Yoni Buyens celebrates scoring Charlton's second goal during his side's 2-1 victory against Leeds . The withdrawals, including Souleymane Doukara's, are the latest incident in another turbulent period at Leeds . 'If the fans want to kick me and shout at me, fine. I am used to it.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said. 'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'

"Former Chelsea defender Paulo Ferreira expects his compatriot Jose Mourinho to remain in charge at Stamford Bridge for 'a long, long time'. The Portuguese manager, 52, is leading the Blues towards their fourth Barclays Premier League title in his second stint at Stamford Bridge - two championships arrived during his original tenure. Retired right-back Ferreira, who followed Mourinho from Porto in 2004 before spending nine years in west London, believes his countryman's desire to succeed with Chelsea knows no bounds. Jose Mourinho is on the cusp of winning his third Premier League title during two spells with Chelsea . Former defender Paulo Ferreira expects Mourinho to stay at Chelsea for a long, long time . He said: 'When you are at this club you want to win titles and for next season it will be the same. The motivation is to win trophies. 'He wants to succeed and do well, for how long I do not know. I think everyone at the club wants him to stay for a long, long time. 'I think everyone would like to see him in control for many years but in football, anything can happen.' While Mourinho remains the toast of SW6 and still has two years on his latest Chelsea contract, another recently returned club favourite could be on his way out this summer. Didier Drogba has scored only three league goals since rejoining on a one-year contract last July, but Ferreira hopes the Ivorian striker, now 37, gets to experience a 10th season with the Blues. Former Portugal international Ferreira would also like to see Didier Drogba extend his stay at Stamford Bridge . Speaking on behalf of club sponsors Gazprom, Ferreira added: 'I would love to see him stay for another season but I don't know what he wants or what the club wants from him. 'Let's see what happens at the end of the season. 'He has the motivation to keep winning and keep playing and I want to hear what happens at the end of the season.' Ferreira played for Chelsea for nine years after following Mourinho from Porto in 2004 . Ferreira has been kept busy representing Chelsea as their European youth league ambassador but is also taking his coaching badges. The 36-year-old has not ruled out pursuing a role within the Blues' training set-up at Cobham. He added: 'I've just finished my (UEFA) B licence so I need two more years to finish, I hope. 'At the moment I'm just concentrating on finishing and then let's see what happens. It's just important to have it and then, who knows?' Paulo Ferreira was speaking on behalf of Gazprom, the energy behind Chelsea FC and a funding partner of the Chelsea Foundation Pimlico Premier League Kicks programme.","Jose Mourinho returned to Chelsea in 2013 for a second spell at the club .

"The collapse in Roberto Mancini's relationship with Manchester City was rooted in his dismay at the quality of English players signed by the club. When names like Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell and to a lesser extent Adam Johnson were signed, he could barely disguise his contempt, feeling none of them would help him take on Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League. 'Ask Marwood,' he would spit out when asked about the club's transfer policy, referring to the club's then-football administrator Brian Marwood who was responsible at the time for buying players. Tottenham defender Danny Rose has been linked with a move to Manchester City . Mancini was sacked in 2013 and nearly two years on, Marwood has a new role at the academy with a Spaniard, Txiki Begiristain, in his old job with the title director of football. And yet the dilemma remains the same: How do City buy enough top English players to fulfil quotas for homegrown players without breaking FPP (financial fair play) regulations again? It won't be easy and could explain why City – who have slumped to fourth in the league – are being linked with less glamorous names like Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell. Good players certainly, but good enough? Probably not. It's a sobering thought that Rodwell made only seven Premier League starts in two seasons for City after a £12million move from Everton. Sinclair started just twice after signing from Swansea and is currently on loan at Aston Villa. Plenty of things at City have been carefully planned and executed well since the club's owners from Abu Dhabi took over in 2008. (From left) Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain, assistant manager Brian Kidd, manager Manuel Pellegrini and former football administrator Brian Marwood . The Etihad Campus is a glittering monument to football development and helping the community, while two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup is an excellent trophy haul considering where the club have come from. But one weakness has been in their approach to having enough homegrown players, lagging behind most of their rivals. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers and Manchester United bought Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw as teenagers. Most spectacularly, Liverpool bought players like Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling and invested in making them better. Spurs have brought through Harry Kane and Ryan Mason from their academy. Only Chelsea face similar issues to City. Homegrown rules are complicated and differ slightly between competitions. Scott Sinclair (left) and Jack Rodwell are two English players who were bought by Manchester City . In the Premier League, you must have eight homegrown players if you fill your squad of 25. Homegrown players can be born overseas as long as they have been at a club's academy three years before the age of 21. If clubs can't find eight, they have to reduce their squad accordingly, as Chelsea have had to this season. Under 21 players can be named in the squad in addition to the 25. City's six Premier League homegrown players are: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Gael Clichy, Frank Lampard and James Milner and there lies a major problem for next season. Lampard is definitely off and Milner is out of contract too. Clichy has endured a poor season and City will want a new left-back while Boyata, a Belgian who has been at City since he was 16, is not good enough to win a regular first-team place. The feeling is he was only offered his latest contract because he filled one of the homegrown slots. Ditto, third-choice goalkeeper Wright. Manchester United signed both Wayne Rooney (left) and Luke Shaw as teenagers . The Champions League squads of 25 also require eight players to have been trained in England, but four of those must have come through the ranks at City. Boyata was their only club-trained player named this season. It will be a major problem for the club next season as their one-season punishment (for breaching FFP rules) to name a squad of 21 is lifted and they can name 25 again. These will be issues exercising the minds at the very top of the club. But whichever way they look at it, City have three options which carry a downside: . 1) Spend big on the best English players 2) Find their own from their academy or 3) Buy cheaper English players who might not be good enough. Daniel Sturridge (left) and Jordan Henderson are two players Liverpool bought to boost their English quota . For option one, supply and demand is a problem. There are probably only three England players most people would call good international-class and therefore worthy of a place in the City team should they want to win titles at home and abroad. Hart is already there, Wayne Rooney is at Manchester United and presumably unattainable while Raheem Sterling would be a premium price. 'Can you get Sterling? Maybe if you go to Liverpool with £100million you can,' complained Manuel Pellegrini recently. No wonder City appear ready to open negotiations at £50m. Kean Bryan is one of the young players at Manchester City who is tipped to go on to big things . Midfielder Kean Bryan ticks all the boxes for what Manchester City hope to achieve in the future. A box-to-box midfielder from Manchester, he joined City at the age of 11 and has gone on to be an England youth international at different age levels. Aged 18, he has played for Patrick Vieira's under-21 elite development squad this season, and played five matches in City's run to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Youth League, a Champions League equivalent for under-20s. Been compared to Steven Gerrard. The last Mancunian to play regularly for City was Michael Johnson and he had to retire early after injury problems. Of the next generation, £60m has been quoted for Everton's Ross Barkley, a huge price for unproven talent. Harry Kane would be an interesting target as would Everton's Under21 defender John Stones, who might represent the best value-for-money. Jack Wilshere has had injury problems. City's academy cost £200m but so far none has broken into the first-team squad regularly. Marcos Lopes is on loan at Lille and may move there permanently. Karim Rekik has played Champions League football for PSV. City will hope starlets like Jose Pozo, Thierry Ambrose, Mathias Bossaerts, Seko Fofana, Jason Denayer and Kean Bryan will become their homegrown first-teamers of the future, but they are unlikely to make a major contribution next season. Bryan is novel and interesting, he is from Manchester and has been likened to Steven Gerrard. Ross Barkley is one of the most hotly tipped players in England and worth in the region of £60m . The third option is to try and sign any English Premier League player who is available. It might not be the best idea for the players themselves, Johnson said after he was sold to Sunderland that the move to City can turn sour for young players. 'It is a lot different when you don't play. The novelty wears off, definitely,' he said. Rodwell is now at Sunderland too, while Sinclair will make his loan move to Aston Villa permanent provided they stay up. Rose and Cresswell be warned. Making up the numbers at Manchester City doesn't necessarily help the player or club. PREMIER LEAGUE . Eight players in the 25-man squads must be homegrown. A player counts as homegrown if they have spent three years at an English club up to the age of 21. Squads can be supplemented by as many Under 21 players as clubs want. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . Eight of the 25-man squad must be homegrown, four of whom must be club-trained ie have come through the ranks of the actual club they are playing for. Squads can be supplemented by Under-21 players provided they have been with the club for at least two years. SERIE A . From 2016, squads will be limited to 25 players (not counting Under 21s), four of whom have to have grown up in Italy and four of whom have to be products of their club's academy, similar to Champions League rules. Clubs are not allowed to sign more than two non-EU players in a season. LA LIGA . Clubs are not allowed more than three non-EU players in their squads of 25, or in matches. However, after five years, you can apply for Spanish citizenship and become an EU player, as Lionel Messi has done. There are no additional homegrown rules for EU players. BUNDESLIGA . Clubs need to include eight homegrown players, including four from their own youth academy, in their squad. But unlike the Premier League, squads aren't restricted to 25 players so they can still sign as many non-homegrown players as they like. There are no restrictions on signing non-EU players.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has written off Manchester City’s chances of signing Raheem Sterling this summer by declaring the Anfield club are bigger than their Etihad rivals and making it clear they have no intention of becoming their feeder team. Ahead of Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley, Rodgers indicated it could take two decades for Sheik Mansour’s club to reach the status of either Liverpool or Manchester United. City have been heavily linked with a £50million move for Sterling, who has two years left on his contract and is stalling on a new deal. The champions have also monitored vice-captain Jordan Henderson, who only has a season left on his Anfield contract. Brendan Rodgers says that a move to Manchester City would not be step up for Raheem Sterling . Rodgers talks to Sterling during Friday's training session ahead of FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa . However, Rodgers was emphatic that moving to City would not represent a step up. ‘If you say that City is a bigger club than Liverpool, you’re wrong,’ he said. ‘I’ve got big respect for what City are doing — they’re trying to build it the right way. But at this moment you can’t compare the size of the two clubs. ‘You’ve got Liverpool and United, the two biggest clubs in this country and the rest of them are fighting to be there over the next 20 years. I wouldn’t say we were a development ground for going to “bigger” clubs.’ City have tried to sign players from Arsenal and Liverpool hoping to weaken their rivals. They have bought Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Kolo Toure from Arsenal but failed to lure Fernando Torres when he was at Anfield. Sterling is wanted by Manchester City this summer for £50million as he stalls over new contract . Sterling has been one of Liverpool's leading lights and was nominated for PFA Young Player of the Year . This summer, Liverpool will also try to sign James Milner from City. Rodgers hopes victory over Villa will strengthen his case and increase the chances of keeping players. ‘Our vision is to win trophies,’ he said. ‘The first objective was to get into the Champions League again. We arrived there this year and could focus on winning a trophy. We just have to concentrate on performance levels, get to the final and we’ll take it from there.’ Club captain Steven Gerrard is available after a three-match ban and Rodgers has to decide whether to start with him in what could be his final appearance at Wembley before his move to LA Galaxy.

"Second-placed Preston's quest to join Bristol City in the Championship was dented after they were held to a 2-2 draw against Gillingham, who grabbed an equaliser in stoppage time through Leon Legge. Jermaine Beckford's 10th goal in his past 19 appearances and Callum Robinson's effort had put North End two goals up, but Jermaine McGlashan and Legge left the Deepdale faithful despondent. Across Lancashire, MK Dons closed the gap on Simon Grayson's men to three points as Lewis Baker, Will Grigg and Dele Alli were on target in the 3-0 victory over Fleetwood. Jermaine Beckford scored his 10th goal of the season as Preston were held 2-2 by Gillingham . Swindon remain in the automatic promotion hunt too following a 4-2 win at Rochdale, who have still never beaten the Robins at Spotland. A hat-trick from Ben Gladwin and Michael Smith's strike had put Swindon 4-0 ahead before Ian Henderson's penalty and Nathan Thompson's own goal prevented the hosts from suffering a thrashing. Dale fell seven points behind Chesterfield as they strengthened their grip on the final play-off spot by hammering Colchester 6-0. Gary Roberts and Sam Clucas both claimed doubles and Dan Gardner and Jimmy Ryan also found the net to give the Spireites breathing room in sixth position. At the other end of the table, Crewe were the only one of the sides on 47 points to pick up anything, with a 1-1 draw at Peterborough enough to move them out of the bottom four. Lauri Dalla Valle's goal had put the Alex ahead before Conor Washington's equaliser stopped Steve Davis' side earning three points on the road. Crawley replaced the Railwaymen in the relegation zone as they were thumped 5-0 by Walsall, Jordy Hiwula bagging a brace and Kieron Morris, Andy Taylor and Jordan Cook all scoring too.

"Tottenham will resist any offers for left back Danny Rose. The 24-year-old is fundamental to Mauricio Pochettino's plans and was signed up to a five-year contract last summer. Manchester City have considered attack-minded Rose as they draw up an extensive list of potential homegrown signings ahead of the close season. Danny Rose has attracted interest from Manchester City after a strong season with Tottenham . Rose is strong going forward but shows off the defensive side of his game against George Boyd of Burnley . Tottenham though believe some new additions of their own in the summer can make them greater contenders for Champions League football next season and do not intend to help their rivals. Pochettino is ready to sell some fringe players, but Rose is not one of them. Pochettino said: 'Danny has been the best English left back this season. I look at the stats and other players in his position. I also look at his performances, which have been great. But that's my opinion.' Gael Clichy, a Frenchman, is City's regular left back in a squad short of homegrown players . Although Rose was been called up to the England squad last month he has yet to receive a full cap but has 29 at U21 level. Doncaster-born Rose had struggled to make an impression at Tottenham down the years but has benfited from Tim Sherwood and Pochettino showing faith in him following a loan spell with Sunderland in 2012-13.","Manchester City have identified Danny Rose as a transfer target .

"Everyone loves a bargain, even in the mega-rich territory of the Barclays Premier League. Where else to look for a steal than in the bargain basement? That is where clubs at the top level can look down at the Championship and below to take their pick of the players trying to impress. Yet it can be a case of hit and miss. Here, Sportsmail looks at examples of players who have represented the lower leagues well in the Premier League, and others who can do so too. Aaron Cresswell (Ipswich Town to West Ham in July 2014 – £2million) The full-back is one of just five outfield players to play every minute of his team's Premier League games this season . Cresswell began at Tranmere Rovers, making his debut in November 2008. From there, he moved to Ipswich in June 2011, apparently turning down West Bromwich Albion and Doncaster Rovers. He won the Supporters Player of the Year award, and was linked with Aston Villa. Yet it was West Ham who signed the left-back on a five-year contract, spending just £2m in doing so. Cresswell has made 32 appearances in the Premier League since, and his impressive performances have reportedly caught the eye of Manchester City and Chelsea. Both clubs need to add more home-grown talent to their squads, and the West Ham regular would add to that batch. Aaron Cresswell has proved a good fit for the Premier League since signing for West Ham in July 2014 . John Stones (Barnsley to Everton in January 2013 - £3m) Stones has the best passing accuracy of any Everton player this season - 90.8% . A Barnsley youth product, Stones made 25 appearances in the Championship for the club, before leaving for Everton on a five-and-a-half-year deal. It reportedly cost them £3m, and he has made 38 appearances in the Premier League since. Despite an ankle injury which ruled him out for 10-14 weeks, Stones was nominated for the Golden Boy 2014 award alongside Gerard Deulofeu, Calum Chambers, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw. During his time in the top flight, he has earned four caps for England. Another potential star. John Stones signed for Everton from Barnsley in January 2013 for just £3m and has been a good addition . Andrew Robertson (Dundee United to Hull City in July 2014 - £2.85m) Robertson has made 40 dribbles this year, 17 more than any other Hull defender . No disrespect to Dundee United or the Scottish Premiership, but it is widely assumed that the Premier League is somewhat of a step up. Some make it, some don't. Robertson can class himself in the former category. The Hull youngster has thrived since moving to the KC Stadium in July 2014, and even scored against England for Scotland four months later. Steve Bruce, the Hull manager, admits he has already had calls from clubs interested in the Glasgow-born left-back, who has made 21 appearances in the Premier League. Andrew Robertson joined Hull from Dundee in July 2014 and is pictured a month after signing . Leonardo Ulloa (Brighton to Leicester City in July 2014 - £8m) The striker is the Foxes' top scorer in the league this season (7) while no other Leicester player has had a hand in more goals (scored seven, assisted two) Ulloa didn't come cheap. Yet just because a player costs a handsome fee does not guarantee he will be cut out for the Premier League. The Argentinian with no caps cost £8m and had plenty to prove as he told former club Brighton he felt he had to leave to try his luck in the Premier League. It proved a shrewd move at first. The goals may have dried up a little but the striker has performed admirably in his debut season in the top flight. Nine goals in total as the club's top scorer. Yet with Leicester bottom of the table, Ulloa has a task on his hands to help them survive, otherwise he may well be rendered a Championship player once more come May. Leonardo Ulloa didn't come cheap for Leicester and must help them survive to avoid dropping down a league . Dwight Gayle (Peterborough to Crystal Palace in July 2013 - £4.5m) After netting five in his first 15 Premier League appearances, Gayle has now gone eight games without a goal for Palace . Gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the Premier League. He started at Stansted, currently a club that play in the ninth level on the footballing pyramid. From there, he joined Dagenham & Redbridge, before being sent on loan to Conference North side Bishop's Stortford. Yet it was during a loan spell with Peterborough that he truly got his chance. Playing in the Championship helped him progress and he signed for Crystal Palace in 2013. He has made 46 appearances in the Premier League, scoring 12 goals, and is a regular. Dwight Gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the Premier League with Crystal Palace . Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace to Southampton in July 2012 - £2.15m) The England man has made 99 tackles, the third-highest total in the Premier League this season and the most by a defender . Clyne was a Crystal Palace youth product, and made his professional debut in October 2008. Later, Neil Warnock would state Clyne has a 'bright future in the game', and he wasn't wrong. After four years at Selhurst Park in the Championship, winning the Player of the Year award in his final season, Clyne moved to Southampton for £2.15m. It's proved a bargain. The right-back is a regular at St Mary's, and even made his debut for England in October 2014. All this has led the 24-year-old to be linked with Chelsea and Manchester United. The rise continues. Nathaniel Clyne was a Crystal Palace youth product but signed for Southampton after their promotion . Dele Alli (MK Dons to Tottenham Hotspur in February 2015 - £5m – to join next season) Alli has netted 14 goals for the MK Dons this season, more than any other midfielder for a single club . Bit of a cheat this one. Alli meets the criteria, having never played in the top flight before and signing for a Premier League club, yet he awaits his debut for Tottenham. The midfielder signed for £5m from MK Dons, but was sent back on loan for the remainder of the season. Will he follow in the footsteps of Cresswell,  Clyne, and so on? Time will tell. Dele Alli signed for Tottenham Hotspur from MK Dons for £5m before being sent back on loan . So, who could be next to move up to the Premier League? Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth) Position: Winger. Age: 25. League appearances: 40. Goals: 11. Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side. A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday . Benik Afobe (Wolves) Position: Striker. Age: 22. League appearances: 27. Goals: 22. What else can you say but Afobe has more goals than a certain Harry Kane this season? The former Arsenal striker is surely on a shortlist or two for Premier League clubs. He scored his 30th goal of the season against Birmingham City on Saturday. Time to step up? Benik Afobe has been in prolific form this season first for MK Dons on loan then for Wolves . Demarai Gray (Birmingham) Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 18. League appearances: 24. Goals: 5. Just 18 years old, Gray burst into the Birmingham team in 2013. In doing so he has began to be called up for England's youth sides, making three appearances for the Under 18s and four for the Under 19s. Birmingham had to reject four bids from Bournemouth who were keen to sign the starlet, even offering £3.5m which could rise to £4m with add-ons. Can they hold on to him for much longer, though? Demarai Gray is wanted by a host of clubs but Birmingham are determined to try to keep hold for now . Bradley Johnson (Norwich) Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. League appearances: 37. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League, where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season . Troy Deeney (Watford) Position: Striker. Age: 26. League appearances: 33. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Troy Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons . Will Hughes (Derby County) Position: Midfielder. Age: 19. League appearances: 34. Goals: 2. Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played more than 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager . Bakary Sako (Wolves) Position: Winger. Age: 26. League appearances: 35. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for £4m from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up .","Aaron Cresswell moved to West Ham from Ipswich for just £2m in 2014 .

"Steven Gerrard's hopes of a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career were shattered as his side suffered a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The final on May 30, also by coincidence Gerrard's 35th birthday, would have been the midfielder's final game in a Liverpool shirt before he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer, but - although he was handed a starting role by manager Brendan Rodgers - he was unable to influence the outcome. Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at Gerrard's performance at Wembley. Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard (left) competes for posession with Kieran Richardson . ROLE . Gerrard started the game in an advanced role behind Raheem Sterling and to the right of Philippe Coutinho in a 3-4-2-1 formation but midway through the first half, Liverpool adjusted their shape to 4-4-1-1, pushing Coutinho wide left and allowing Gerrard to adopt a more central position behind the striker. Rodgers tweaked Liverpool, and Gerrard's, shape for a third time at the interval, as the Reds went 4-3-2-1 with Gerrard playing deepest of the midfield three. Gerrard controls possession under pressure from Villa's Ashley Westwood at Wembley . Gerrard almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left, but his header was cleared off the line . POSSESSION . The first half largely passed Gerrard by as playing further forward starved him of any sustained spells of possession and Villa crowded out the space in front of their back four to good effect. Dropping back into central midfield after the interval allowed the Liverpool captain to collect the ball from his defenders but his passing was cautious and occasionally wayward. Gerrard was deployed in a number of different roles by Brendan Rodgers (right) throughout the contest . GOAL THREAT . Gerrard blazed a long-range effort over the bar shortly after half-time and curled a potentially dangerous free-kick into the hands of Shay Given midway through the second half. He almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left, but his header was cleared off the line. OVERALL . This was far from the fairytale ending Gerrard would have hoped for. The veteran looked confused by the various roles given to him by Rodgers and he failed to thrive in any of them. Gerrard leaves the pitch following his side's 2-1 FA Cup semi-final defeat by Villa .","Liverpool lost 2-1 to Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley .

"Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny admits he feels sorry for Adam Federici, insisting the Reading stopper was 'the best player on the pitch' despite his costly error in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final. Federici allowed Alexis Sanchez's driven shot to slip through his body in extra-time as Arsenal ran out 2-1 winners at Wembley to reach their second consecutive final, having beaten Hull to lift the trophy last year. The mistake overshadowed a number of strong saves Federici had made to keep his side in the game and Szczesny had only kind words for his opposite number. Wojciech Szczesny (left) says he feels sorry for Adam Federici after his mistake in the FA Cup semi-final . 'He can be very proud. It only went to extra-time because the goalkeeper was magnificent,' Szczesny told Arsenal's official website. 'We're very happy to go through but personally I do feel for the goalkeeper. 'It's a difficult moment for him. He was the best player on the pitch and in his dreams last night he was probably hoping he would get them through to the final. 'He did everything to do so but got very unlucky in extra-time. The Australian let an Alexis Sanchez effort slip through his hands and sneak over the line in extra-time . 'It was a really good performance from him and he's shown what a good keeper he is.' Arsenal looked like they might enjoy a comfortable afternoon when Sanchez opened the scoring in the first half, but Garath McCleary's equaliser galvanised the Championship outfit. 'You know what to expect when you play Championship sides,' Szczesny said. Federici was inconsolable at the final whistle despite his team-mates and staff trying to help . 'They're very solid defensively, they're not scared to put their foot or head in and they defend very well. 'Today they did that with a great performance by their goalkeeper. It was a difficult game but we just got over the line.' Arsenal are now just one win away from defending the crown they secured last year, with either Liverpool or Aston Villa lying in wait in the final. Szczesny was also at fault for the Reading goal when he let Gareth McCleary's shot find a way into the net . Victory would also see the Gunners become the most successful FA Cup team of all time as they currently sit level on 11 titles with Manchester United. 'We want to win for the fans,' Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla added. 'It's always special to play at Wembley and we have a good opportunity to get the title. 'Now we have to wait for the other team - Liverpool or Aston Villa.'","Wojciech Szczesny feels sorry for Adam Federici after his FA Cup error .

"Come the end of this season, Malky Mackay’s tenure at Wigan Athletic might just be remembered as one of the costliest appointments in the history of English football. A second relegation in three seasons would be damaging enough for a club that enjoyed eight largely successful years in the Barclays Premier League. And after failing to secure a single win at home in six months in charge — culminating in a woeful 2-0 defeat by Derby on Monday — Mackay would certainly shoulder much of the blame for that. Malky Mackay's tenure at Wigan Athletic came to an end on Monday following a 2-0 defeat by Derby . Sportsmail revealed in August Mackay was being investigated  over 'sexist, racism and homophobic' texts . Dave Whelan (right) appointed Mackay (left) as manager of Wigan in November 2014 despite the warnings . 19 - points taken from Mackay's 24 matches in charge of Wigan - five wins, four draws and 15 defeats . 0 - number of home games won by Mackay's Wigan from 13 attempts - 10 of these ended in defeat . 20.8 - Mackay's win percentage with Wigan since taking over in November . But Dave Whelan will also have to accept that his misguided decision to appoint the controversial Scot in the first place has cost him his reputation and seriously harmed the image of a fine football club too. People did try to warn Whelan when he first entertained the idea of replacing Uwe Rosler with Mackay last November. But Whelan demonstrated how little regard he had for an Football Association investigation into an exchange of racist, sexist, homophobic and anti-Semitic messages between Mackay and his former Cardiff City colleague, Iain Moody, by not only appointing him but then trying to justify the decision with some deeply offensive remarks of his own. Whelan was punished by the FA for his comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities and was left with little choice but to step down as chairman, wisely handing the reins to a grandson who can now begin the process of repairing some of that damage. It will take time, of course. Particularly when the response of too many in and around the club was to try to defend the indefensible, refusing to take any responsibility for the problems the club was enduring. It could yet prove that the ‘very difficult decision’ announced by the new chairman, David Sharpe, on Monday night has been made too late. Wigan are eight points from safety with only five games remaining, after all. This is how Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton revealed the investigation in August 2014 . Sportsmail led the way with the exclusive story about Mackay and his Cardiff City colleague Iain Moody . Mackay was appointed manager of Wigan in November 2014 but has arguably harmed the football club . Whelan's appointment of Mackay did little good for the club as they face relegation from the Championship . How the Championship table currently shapes up . But it might have become an awful lot more uncomfortable before it got better, irrespective of where Wigan finish up in the Championship. As Sportsmail revealed last month, an FA investigation first launched last August — with the publication of the Textgate scandal messages in this newspaper — was close to being concluded in February. But new evidence was presented to the FA that forced the governing body’s disciplinary chiefs to reopen the investigation, with sources suggesting it could be the summer before we have an outcome. The FA had already spent months wrestling with the issue of private and public communication, and whether they could charge an individual when the emails and text messages were exchanged between Mackay and Moody in their capacity as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff. Reports that suggested Mackay and Moody were likely to escape punishment prompted more witnesses to come forward, however, with individuals Mackay might have considered allies among those to have submitted fresh information. Despite trouble on and off the pitch, Sportsmail understands he was granted a stay of execution in February after a 1-0 away victory at Reading. Wigan were said to be content with keeping their boss until at least the end of the season and sources at the DW Stadium indicated Mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at Cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so. And hours before the Scot was sacked he talked up Wigan’s chances of Championship survival, despite overseeing a 10th home defeat in 13 matches. ‘It’s still mathematically possible,’ insisted Mackay. ‘I’ve got a team which is putting performances in every week. It’s fine lines between winning and losing in this league.’ Wigan vice-Chairman Phillip Williams, John Winstanley and Brian Ashcroft look on along with chairman David Sharpe (far right) during their 2-0 defeat by Derby . New Wigan chairman Sharpe, pictured reacting to a piece of play on the pitch, saw his club lose on Monday . Hours before being sacked, Mackay talked up Wigan’s chances of Championship survival despite the defeat . Substitute Chris Martin and Darren Bent struck for Derby as they moved up to fifth in the table. In their dugout was Steve McClaren — a man overlooked for the Wigan job in June 2013 when Owen Coyle replaced the departing Roberto Martinez. Ultimately, Mackay lost his job not because of an FA investigation but because he failed to win football matches. As a brief club statement highlighted, a return of only 19 points from a possible 72 is disastrous. But at least the outcome of the FA enquiries is no longer Wigan’s concern. At least they can now turn to someone like Gary Caldwell, Alan Stubbs or Danny Wilson — the names thought to be in the frame on Monday night — without the baggage that arrived with Mackay. The harm has been done but now begins the recovery. Derby's players celebrate after Chris Martin's goal gave them the lead in the second half against Wigan .

"Tony McCoy, the greatest ever jump jockey, is guaranteed a roaring send-off at Aintree this week as racegoers tip a fairytale ending to his glorious career. The 40-year-old from County Antrim has been bidding his farewells as he heads for retirement and has promised to call it quits there and then should his Grand National ride Shutthefrontdoor bring him a second career victory over the world's most famous steeplechase. McCoy is riding in his 20th Grand National and Aintree is busy setting the scene to make sure it is one he never forgets. The Royal Liver Building in Liverpool was lit up with a good luck message for Tony McCoy . The building was lit up with the image of McCoy winning the Grand National on Don't Push It in 2010 . Tony McCoy is guaranteed a great send-off during the Grand National at Aintree this week . On Wednesday night, one of Liverpool's most iconic landmarks, the city's Royal Liver Building, was lit up with a good luck message. The famous building was illuminated with an image of one of McCoy's finest moments – winning the world famous Grand National on Don't Push It in 2010 – together with the words 'The Greatest Jockey. The Greatest Race.' 'The AP McCoy factor is reaching fever pitch with it being his 20th and final Grand National,' said John Baker, Regional Director of Jockey Club Racecourses North West. 'We certainly plan to give him a great send off and I'm sure the 150,000 racegoers will join us in honouring the greatest jockey the sport has ever seen.' Aintree will line the parade ring with banners from AP's 20 Grand Nationals; there will be a 'Thank You AP' signature wall where racegoers can sign messages of thanks, which will be auctioned off for Alder Hey Hospital after the festival. There will also be images of AP on the media centre wall, courtesy of Charlie Barton and he will be inducted as an 'Aintree Legend' on Grand Opening Day while Baker promises 'with a few other surprises it should prove to be a great send-off'. McCoy celebrates winning the Grand National on Don't Push It back in 2010 . McCoy's solitary National triumph was on Don't Push It in 2010 but his ride this year, trained by Jonjo O'Neill, is being heavily tipped as fans sense a romantic ending for one of racing greats. 'We can't wait to get started now,' said Baker. 'We have listened to our customers and made the necessary upgrades to ensure the customer experience is superb, we have fantastic music, great new additions to Ladies Day and top-quality racing planned for all three days. Everything is ready for the biggest party in the history of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival and it's not one you want to miss. 'We expect really strong fields in every race across the three days and with ten Grade 1 races taking place, everyone who attends is going to be treated to the best our sport can offer,' he said. 'Add to that forecasts of good weather going into the Festival plus an exciting line-up of musical entertainment on offer and Aintree is going to be the place to be.' The Crabbie's Grand National prizemoney is again set at £1million with around 70,000 spectators expected on the Saturday and a British TV audience in excess of 8million due to tune in. Such is the support for McCoy that bookmakers are predicting as many as one in three of the £150m worth of bets placed on the Grand National will be supporting Shutthefrontdoor. The course itself has overseen a number of enhancements which include upgrades to the toilet and bar facilities around the West Tip area along with new grandstand seating. The Chair Pavilion will be extended this year with an extra 1,500 unreserved external seats available for racegoers. Food and drink facilities throughout the racecourse will be improved with several new additions including an extra seating facility outside the Princess Royal Stand. McCoy beats Black Apalachi ridden by Denis O'Regan over the last fence to win the Grand National in 2010 . Liverpool-based cocktail bar, Palm Sugar will also be situated in the Red Rum Garden for the first time. There is also a new grandstand along with a 60 metre-long marquee with full bar and betting facilities in the Steeplechase enclosure. Aintree has also paired up with Falkirk Council to showcase Scottish sculptor Andy Scott's award winning Kelpies Maquettes at the course this year. The Maquettes are 1/10 scale sculptures of the world renowned Kelpies situated in Falkirk, Scotland. The hand crafted sculptures in the form of two horse's heads have been displayed across the world. Musical entertainment in the Equestrian Centre will include The Christians taking the stage on Grand Opening Day; X Factor star, Jake Quickenden wowing the crowds on Ladies Day; and 'The Stars from the Commitments' entertaining the guests on Grand National Day. There will also be a short performance from Liverpool singer and X Factor star, Rebecca Ferguson on the Red Rum Lawn at 4.15pm on Ladies Day.

Before The Crabbie's Grand National race there will be a special performance of God Save The Queen by a local children's choir who have been selected from four local Aintree schools in association with Resonate Music Hub. Seventy children have been given the once in a lifetime opportunity to sing in front of 72,000 people at one of the biggest sporting events in the world. Ladies Day has also had a make-over with Aintree offering a Mini Roadster for the winner of the Style Award alongside £6,000 worth of prizes from style partner, Liverpool One – a total of £26,000 worth of prizes for the winner. The style contest has also been extended across the course with several giant frames being the focus of entries for the coveted prize. Style judges include Liverpool singer Rebecca Ferguson and Liverpool One's Jade Fung with the prize being presented by style guru, Gok Wan. Liverpool singer and X Factor star Rebecca Ferguson will give a short performance during Ladies Day . Aside from the Style Award, Ladies Day has had another addition in The Grand Women Summit. In its inaugural year over 120 delegates will meet to discuss women in racing, business and sport with the debate being led by Channel 4's Tanya Stevenson and with an expert panel including Britain's greatest ever gymnast, Beth Tweddle MBE; Rose Paterson, Chairman of Aintree Racecourse; Dr Denise Barrett-Baxendale MBE, Deputy CEO of Everton FC; and British Horseracing Authority Chairman, Steve Harman. Delegates will also enjoy a course walk by Ladies Day Ambassador and Easter Monday Irish Grand National National winning jockey, Katie Walsh as well as racing experts, Richard Pitman and Carrie Ford.

"Wojciech Szczesny must use his current spell out of the Arsenal side as a catalyst to come back a stronger goalkeeper, according to former club legend David Seaman. Szczesny has found himself demoted to the substitutes' bench in recent months due to a combination of poor performances and the form of David Ospina since the new year. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has benefited from competition for places brought by the £3.2 million signing of Colombian Ospina from Nice last summer, as eight consecutive wins have lifted his side to second in the Premier League. Wojciech Szczesny hasn't played a Premier League game since the 2-0 defeat to Southampton in January . David Ospina boasts the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances . Szczesny is expected to line up in goal for Arsenal in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley, and Seaman believes the Poland international can make the number one jersey his own once more. 'With Wojciech, it must be hard for him now to be number two, coming off the back of a season where he was a regular and had been playing at his best, but it is totally just because he had a couple of bad mistakes and Ospina has gone in and done his stuff,' Seaman said. 'Either of them could be Arsenal's number one, it is about who is on form - and if Ospina keeps his form, then he is going to stay there.' Former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman was speaking as an ambassador for the 'Know the Score' campaign against bowel cancer to Press Association Sport. Szczesny compounded his indifferent on-field performances by being caught smoking in the showers after defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day - the last time the 24-year-old started a league game for the North Londoners. But Seaman has every faith in the 6ft 5in deposed keeper, believing that if Szczesny takes the positives from a spell on the sidelines, he can emerge a far better goalkeeper in the years to come. The 51-year-old continued: 'It is not a difficult situation, but it keeps you on your toes to know that there is quality behind you. 'It is not just the games which make you play better, it is the training. 'The goalkeepers train together, and you see the other guy, you think ""I want to be better than him"" or ""I am going to show him how good I am"". That is day to day and is good because it brings the best out of you and tests you, so you become a better goalkeeper.' David Seaman is a former English goalkeeper who joined Arsenal from Queens Park Rangers in 1990 for £1.3m, a then British record transfer fee for a goalkeeper. He spent 13 seasons at the Gunners, winning the old First Division Championship and the Premier League twice. Seaman also won four FA Cups, a League Cup and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup during his time at Highbury. In all, he made 564 appearances for the Gunners between 1990 and 2003, before joining Manchester City on a free transfer. A return of 11 wins from 12 starts has turned Ospina into a fans' favourite at the Emirates, but Seaman is only too aware of how quickly things can change in football, and has urged Szczesny to think carefully before making a decision on his future. 'Wojciech has a big choice now, but he has still got loads of time, I did not join Arsenal until I was 26,' said Seaman, who left Arsenal for Manchester City in 2003 after leading the Gunners to FA Cup glory over Southampton at the Millennium Stadium. 'It is about how he reacts, and what does the player want - does he want to play as a number one? Or is he happy being at a big club as a number two? 'It is all about his ambition. If he wants to be a number one somewhere, then how long is he going to have to wait? 'But if he leaves Arsenal, then it won't be the same level, because it is not until after they go, that all these guys realise how good Arsenal is.' When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know... Ospina is brother-in-law to Real Madrid midfielder and Colombia team-mate James Rodriguez. The former Monaco star married Ospina's sister Daniela in 2011.","Wojciech Szczesny has watched on from the sidelines in recent months .

"As day two of the Grand National gets underway, thousands of ladies dressed in outrageous or elegant outfits as they compete in the style stakes and take in some high-class racing throughout the day. The popular event has seen over 45,000 descend on Aintree for the perfect build-up ahead of Saturday's main event, the Crabbies Grand National. Seven races make up the day as they saw Saphir Du Rheu, ridden by Sam Twiston-Davis, take home the Betfred Mildmay Novices' Chase and following up from his second place at the World Hurdle at Cheltenham festival. A.P McCoy rides Don Cossack and Eastlake in what is his last ever Grand National festival, as he looks to leave the racing scene and his legacy with a bang. Side boob alert! Some of the racegoers ended up flashing a bit more flesh than they bargained for . Hoping to be noticed: Ms Brown had certainly dressed to attract the attention of photographers in her newsprint dress and scarlet heels . Steady! A lady needs some help getting off Aintree's racing simulator, but a bride-to-be had no problems hanging on . Glugging on the go: Ladies enjoy a drink while moving through the racecourse ahead of the first race . Uh oh!

Great day out: Two ladies burst into peals of laughter as they enjoy their day out at Aintree . Full length: Floor-length dresses in summery floral print also proved a hit, with many ladies teaming them with summery sandals . And relax: Ladies perch on a piece of astro-turf and check their phones while enjoying a drink . Ladies in red: Along with bridal white, cheerful crimson also struck a chord with the ladies and it proved a popular choice . Nice dress! A quartet of ladies show off their stylish side as they strike a pose for photographers while making their way into the course .

Bright spark: Bold colour was a popular choice for the second day in a row with bright pink and pale blue taking an early lead .

Quite the look: A lady steps out in a floor-length orange dress slashed to somewhere beyond the thigh . Along with low-cut dresses, the clunky platform shoes that have become a Grand National staple in recent years were very much on show as were some unflatteringly tight get-ups. Most, however, were simply intent on enjoying the sunshine and, in some cases, the revels with many opting to start their day with a mini bottle of champagne, quaffed with the help of a booze funnel. But while many joined in with the fun, the sight of so many early morning drinkers has left bookmakers panicking at the prospect of a bumper payout following Coral's decision to offer odds on such wardrobe malfunctions as falling over while drunk and showing off too much cleavage. 'If some of yesterday's outfits were anything to go by, we're in for a treat today for Ladies' Day at Aintree,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady, whose company has priced falling over at 1/2 and exposed breasts and bottoms at 2/1. Cheers! A pair of ladies, both in spectacular fascinators, enjoy a bottle of Moët & Chandon champagne .

Coordinating: Several couples and groups of friends opted for complementary ensembles in a wide range of hues . Comparing notes? A quintet of ladies enjoy a chat as they arrive for a day's racing at Aintree . 'With the sun shining down, we're predicting the hemlines to shorten and the necklines to deepen so we could be in for a big payout by the end of the day if our odds are anything to go by.' Such episodes are something Aintree bosses had hoped to avoid this year, with the strict style code just one of a raft of measures designed to add some class to the image of the event which has suffered in recent years. Along with expecting 'Chanel-inspired' get-ups from female racegoers, the management has also threatened to kick out any photographers caught taking photos of drunken racegoers. 'Our event is full of character, it’s fun, and that’s generated by the personality of the Liverpool people,' said Aintree managing director John Baker in the run-up to this year's event. 'We have to absolutely protect that because it’s at the core of what we are, and we have a responsibility to our customers to project the correct image.'

"Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could play together in a UEFA All-Star match showcasing the best of European-based talent, according to reports in Spain. They would play for 'Team South' - comprised of stars from La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 - against a similar 'North' dream team from the Premier League, Bundesliga and Russian Premier League. Mundo Deportivo report that a marketing company has approached UEFA and proposed the annual fixture, which is inspired by the NBA All-Star Game between the Western and Eastern Conferences. Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo report that an All-Star match has been proposed that would bring together the cream of European talent - including Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi (pictured) The proposals raise the tantalising prospect of club rivals Messi and Ronaldo playing on the same team . Messi and Ronaldo would be the star attractions in the 'North vs South' All-Star fixture . South: Buffon; Danilo, Sergio Ramos, Pique, Thiago Silva; Messi, Pogba, Koke, Neymar; Cristiano Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic . North: Neuer; Terry, Hummels, Alaba; Robben, Di Maria, Silva, Reus; Alexis, Aguero, Hazard . The players involved would be chosen by an online fan poll, with no more than three players from any club side. But despite such restrictions, the proposed match would throw up the tantalising prospect of Barcelona;s Messi and Neymar joining forces with Real Madrid stars Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Other possible stars in the 'South' team include Paris Saint-Germain forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. The 'North' side could feature Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero, Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Manchester United winger Angel di Maria and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar could also feature in the proposed All-Star match . Zlatan Ibrahimovic would likely lead the line for the 'South' Europe dream team in the game .

See what happened in our North England vs South England Premier League clash simulated by Football Manager . The fixture would naturally draw a massive audience all around the world and the television and sponsorship rights commanded would ensure a nice payday for UEFA and the company involved. However, there would inevitably be a number of hurdles to overcome to get such a project off the ground and some clubs are likely to be unhappy about releasing their players for the game.","Clasico rivals could join forces for 'South' dream team against 'North'

"PSG will come up against an 'unstoppable' player when Lionel Messi visits the Parc des Princes for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, according to manager Laurent Blanc. Barcelona travel to Paris for the first leg and Blanc, who never won the competition as a player, is well aware of the threat posed by the magical Argentine. Messi has been in sensational form since the turn of the year and he now has 45 goals in 44 games - a total he will be hopeful of adding to against the Ligue 1 champions.

If he scores 40 goals, he's had a bad season! 'But we can't just focus on him. The solution must be collective, man marking doesn't work.' The hosts must also be wary of Messi's strike partners Luis Suarez and Neymar during the first leg, particularly with the away goals rule in place. Blanc added: 'We will need to be aggressive defensively but in the good sense of the term, to be able to stop their attackers.' The second leg will be held at the Nou Camp on April 21.

"Lionel Messi has issued an ominous warning to his opponents with the four-time Ballon d'Or winner declaring he is back to his best after a disappointing and trophy-free 2014. A string of injuries limited Messi's involvement as the Catalan giants lost the La Liga title to Atletico Madrid, the same rivals who knocked them out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals. Messi's misfortune saw the Ballon d'Or go to Cristiano Ronaldo for the second consecutive year while there was also the matter of a tax investigation that carried a potential jail term. Now though, Messi's turned the tide - Barca are top of the league, his personal goal tally's at 45 from 44 games and Paris Saint-Germain await in the first leg of their Champions League quarter final on Wednesday. Lionel Messi says he is happy again after a disappointing 2014 that was riddled with injury and off-field drama . The Argentine maestro celebrates his goal against Sevilla, his 399th for Barcelona . 'I am happy. The truth is that I started the season in another way after what happened to me last year,' he said in an interview with Barcelona's club website. 'I was inconsistent last season. I was out for a while due to injury, missing quite a few games. When I came back I didn't feel right. It was a year that I have tried to quickly forget to try and get back to my best through hard work, smiling and effort, like I always have and now, fortunately, I feel very good.' Messi says he is keen to 'get back to my best through hard work, smiling and effort, like I always have' Barca top of the league and his personal goal tally's at 45 from 44 games ahead of PSG on Wednesday . With his breathtaking 2015 form already bringing 34 goals in La Liga and eight in the Champions League, Messi will hit the 400 mark for Barcelona should be find the net in Paris. Being fit again has been key for Messi, but he also says his forward combination with new team-mates Luis Suarez and Neymar have been a calming influence. 'Barcelona have always had great forwards, not just now with Neymar and Luis. But it's true that we are taking advantage of them because they are both great world stars. They give us another thing than goals, so in that sense, I'm calm,' he said.","Barcelona face PSG in Champions League quarter-final first leg .

"Randy Lerner is expected to make a rare appearance at Aston Villa’s FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool at Wembley in what could be his last match as chairman of the club. The American owner is scheduled to fly across the Atlantic for the grandest occasion during his tenure since Villa’s 2010 League Cup final against Manchester United in the same stadium. Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner will attend their FA Cup semi-final with Liverpool at Wembley on Sunday . The American has hardly seen Villa play in person during his nine-year ownership of the club . Christian Benteke, who scored for Villa against Spurs on Saturday, will be hoping to fire them to the final . Lerner, while watching games via stream in New York, has hardly seen Villa play in person in recent years, after acquiring the club in 2006. When he attended Arsenal’s visit to Villa Park in September it was his first home match since December 2012. Lerner has been publicly trying to sell Villa since last May, and is hopeful of concluding a deal worth around £150million once the season is finished.","American to make a rare appearance at a Villa match .

"Note to all managers: if you’re top striker is misfiring, have a word with Tim Sherwood. He obviously knows the secret of getting them back among the goals. Sherwood, albeit for a short period of time, revived Emmanuel Adebayor’s flagging Tottenham career last season; now he’s replicating the achievement with Christian Benteke. Christian Benteke heads Aston Villa into the lead against Tottenham in the 35th minute of the game . Benteke celebrates the goal that gave Tim Sherwood's team the advantage at the end of the first half . Benteke continued his fine form for Villa from Tuesday, where he scored a hat-trick in the 3-3 draw with QPR . Benteke (second left) is mobbed by his Villa team-mates after scoring the opening goal against Tottenham . Benteke points to the sky as he led the Villa attack against Tottenham in the Premier League . His success in rejuvenating Benteke, who has scored six goals in eight games, will be viewed as, perhaps, Sherwood’s most vital contribution if Aston Villa win their Premier League survival battle. ‘It’s about strikers applying themselves,’ said the Villa boss, fresh from his side’s victory over former club Tottenham. ‘Like Ade, when I gave Ade an opportunity to come back into the group at Spurs, he had to earn the right and he did that by the way he trained. Christian’s no different. Tottenham (4-2-3-1): Vorm 6; Chriches 4.5 (Yedlin 79min), Dier 6, Fazio 6.5, Rose 6.5; Mason 6.5, Bentaleb 6.5; Townsend 5.5 (Lamela 79), Eriksen 6, Chadli 5.5 (Soldado 62, 5); Kane 6.5. Subs not used: Paulinho, Friedel, Stambouli, Davies. Booked: Rose, Bentaleb, Lamela. Aston Villa (4-3-3): Guzan 7.5; Bacuna 7.5, Clark 6 (Baker 18, 7.5), Vlaar 8, Richardson 7; Sanchez 7, Cleverley 7, Delph 8; Agbonlahor 7 (Cole 70, 6.5), Benteke 8.5, Grealish 7 (Weimann 63, 6.5). Subs not used: Okore, N’Zogbia, Given, Lowton. Booked: Richardson, Benteke. Sent off: Sanchez. Scorer: Benteke 35. Man of the match: Christian Benteke. Referee: Lee Probert 7. Stat: Since Sherwood took over at Villa striker Christan Benteke is the Premier League’s top goalscorer. ‘I think Christian was on the back of being dropped I think when arrived. ‘I’ve had chats with him, told him what I think of him and how everyone in Europe seemed to want him a year ago, and that doesn’t just vanish. ‘So let’s get him back firing, let’s get him back training properly, and scoring goals.’ Indeed, similar patterns are emerging from Sherwood’s spell as manager at White Hart Lane last season and his current job in the Midlands. In addition to turning Adebayor and Benteke back into Premier League forces he’s brought his fearless approach to blooding youth players with him to Villa Park. Where would the careers of Tottenham pair Harry Kane and Nabil Bentaleb be without Sherwood’s guidance last season? And we saw further evidence of the manager’s youth-minded attitude as he handed Jack Grealish, 19, only his second Villa start at a White Hart Lane on Saturday. Not only that but playing the teenager in the influential No 10 role. Villa manager Sherwood was visibly ecstatic at recording the win and getting three points upon the final whistle . Sherwood said: ‘We’ve got good young players coming through at Villa. Jack Grealish has been given his senior debut and Rushian [Hepburn-Murphy], 16 years of age, is another. ‘Jack played in a position where you need maturity but I don’t think he’s fazed. I really mean that. ‘If I thought he was going to be a gamble I wouldn’t have done it, but Jack’s got real ability, you can see that. Sherwood handed 19-year-old Jack Grealish (left) only his second Villa start at a White Hart Lane on Saturday . ‘He’s got a big future at this football club. He’s certainly at the right place. ‘So if you’re a young kid coming through, you’re not going anywhere else. You go to Tottenham or come to Villa. ‘They’re the two massive football clubs but you’ve got two managers who are going to give them an opportunity.’ Villa’s win virtually ended Spurs chances of qualifying for the Champions League. Emmanuel Adebayor (left) was rejuvenated in front of goal following the arrival of Sherwood last season . And when asked whether he’d want another campaign of playing in the Europa League manager Mauricio Pochettino provided an uncommitted answer. ‘How would we deal with the Europa League again? It’s difficult. It has been a very long season. When you do a whole season playing Thursday-Sunday maybe you arrive at the end at very difficult level,’ said the Argentine. ‘It’s not easy playing in the Europa League. When you are a young squad and you make the biggest effort during the season maybe you arrive, not physically, but mentally in a very difficult moment at the end of the season.’","Christian Benteke has scored six goals in eight games .

"These days, Gazza is a celebrity associated with tears, and battles against drink and depression. But, nearly a quarter of a century ago, Paul Gascoigne was just a footballer. Not an ordinary footballer - he was a brilliantly talented maverick, but still a footballer. And 24 years ago today, he scored what was arguably the finest goal of his career. There are some who might say it was the finest goal ever scored at Wembley. The other main contender for that prize is probably another of his, for England against Scotland at Euro 96. Paul Gascoigne hits the 35-yard free-kick that would cement his place in Tottenham legend . The Spurs midfielder struck a ferocious shot that has gone down as one of the all-time great goals at Wembley . Gascoigne's goal came five minutes into an FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham's arch-rivals, Arsenal . Gunners goalkeeper David Seaman (right) got his hands to the ball but the power on Gascoigne's shot still beat him . But April 14, 1991 was FA Cup semi-final day. Tottenham Hotspur vs Arsenal. Fierce rivals battling it out for a place in the final when the oldest cup competition in football meant so much to every club that entered. Arsenal won the league that year. But had you asked their fans at Wembley that day whether they would rather win the title or the FA Cup having knocked out Spurs, and many would have opted for the latter. They didn't get the choice, however, and that was because of Gascoigne. It took him just five minutes to make the indelible mark. Tottenham won a free-kick 35 yards from goal. Nobody suspected much. Certainly not Barry Davies, who was commentating on the game for the BBC. Gascoigne runs towards the Spurs fans to celebrate as Vinny Samways (left) joins the wild scenes . The then England star leaps into the air to celebrate his glorious strike at the home of football . Gascoigne's goal set Spurs on their way to a 3-1 victory, and they would go on to beat Nottingham Forest in the final . 'Is Gascoigne going to have a crack?,' he asked. It was a relaxed, throwaway question. 'He is you know,' came the next line shortly after, excitement barely registering. Gascoigne took a run-up at the ball, and swung hard with his right boot. He nailed it, right on the sweet spot. The shot quickly became a cannonball, bursting through David Seaman's gloves and into the top corner of the net, despite the goalkeeper getting his hands to the ball. 'Oh I say!' screamed Davies, whose commentary would now go down in legend as well as the goal. 'Brilliant!' Spurs fans celebrated wildly in the stands. 'That...is... schoolboy's own stuff. Oh, I bet even he can't believe it. 'Is there anything left from this man to surprise us? That is one of the finest free-kicks this stadium has ever seen.' It was, and still is. 24 years from now it still will be. So let's forget for a moment about the Gazza we know today, and simply celebrate the genius of Paul Gascoigne. (left-right) David Howells, Steve Sedgley, Justin Edinburgh and Paul Stewart join Gascoigne to celebrate at the end of the match .","It is 24 years to the day since Paul Gascoigne scored in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal .

"March 30, 2014. The slip hasn’t happened and Liverpool are looking strong. They are top of the league with six games to go and only Manchester City are better placed, theoretically, with two games in hand to make up a four-point deficit. There will be a slip, there will be a surge and there will be tears. Theory wins, romance loses. Life at the top, as it was then. Dejected Manchester City players during their 4-2 derby defeat to Manchester United on Sunday . Jubilant Liverpool players celebrate Raheem Sterling's opening goal against Newcastle United on Monday . Man City currently have a four-point lead over Liverpool in the race for the final Champions League place . Today, the last meaningful race among the top teams is between Liverpool and City. But the context is different. Manchester City lead Liverpool by four points and each has played 32 games. The stakes are astonishing, but only because the Champions League is an extremely big deal and they are currently in a pursuit for that last spot in the top four. Times have changed. These days it is Liverpool doing the chasing. They have had their own problems this season but the nitrous balloon has not burst. So, what of Manchester City? The numbers are woefully inadequate. Some examples: City have nine points fewer than at this stage last season; their 4-2 defeat against Manchester United saw them concede four for the first time since 2009; they have lost four of their past six Premier League games and five in 2015, which is one more than in the whole of 2014. They have gone from being champions to contenders to weak also-rans, a side that has amassed two wins, three defeats and three draws in eight games against the rest of the current top five. City profited from a Liverpool collapse to claim the Premier League title last season . Steven Gerrard's infamous slip against Chelsea was the moment the title pendulum swung towards City . Liverpool's surrender of a three-goal lead at Crystal Palace also cost them the title last season .

That, perhaps more than the result, could be what crushes Manuel Pellegrini in the final analysis. They are a team seemingly without spirit or direction. Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri are free to leave in the summer, which would indicate an acceptance from the rulers above that major changes are needed. Which brings us back to Liverpool, a team that had far less of a choice in its major change to personnel last summer. Luis Suarez went and the void became a black hole, apparently sucking the energy out of the rest of them. Liverpool fell, but Liverpool climbed again and here they are. It says plenty about each side’s season that on December 28 the gap between them was 18 points. Brendan Rodgers faced heavy scrutiny and he still does – questions over the use of the Suarez money not least among them. But it is a measure of the manager that they have kept their gloves up. They were poor in recent defeats against Arsenal and Manchester United and they were far from their best in the subsequent wins against Blackburn and Newcastle. But they found ways to win and, as such, will contest an FA Cup semi-final and hold an outside chance of a top-four place in the league. Certainly, and rightly, Rodgers will face flak if success is not found on either front. Manuel Pellegrini has come under mounting pressure following a poor run of results . Influential players such as Yaya Toure could be going through the Etihad exit door in the summer . Brendan Rodgers has masterminded Liverpool's return to form at the perfect time . Rodgers will hope the controversies over Raheem Sterling's contract and hippy crack taking do not affect the youngster's performances and Liverpool's run-in . But what he has proven again is that he can inspire this dressing room; he can still generate motivation in a group that has had a mediocre season and among whom is a leading player unhappy with his contract situation. The longer serving among the squad at Swansea still talk of a man who ‘knows the name of every cousin’. An exaggeration, certainly, but it is worth noting that almost two years after his departure, players and staff from Swansea were still using his man-management as a reason to suggest life under Michael Laudrup, a cup winner at the club, was not as good. There are few such testimonies for Pellegrini, whose job surely depends on the outcome of this run in. City face West Ham, Aston Villa, Tottenham, QPR, Swansea and Southampton. Four of those are at home. Liverpool play West Brom, Hull, QPR, Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Stoke, as well as an FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa. Four of those league games are away from Anfield, but like City, it is not a run-in that would have one cursing their luck. It is a shootout, then, between a side that still has a spark and another that appears desperate for the season to end. From this point last season, City took five wins and a draw from their last six games to take the title. They were storming towards the line. A year on, they look as if they would blow over in a decent breeze.","12 months ago, it was Man City who reeled in Liverpool to win the league .

"No gilet; no problem for Tim Sherwood. Make no bones about it, the Aston Villa manager enjoyed this victory. Beating the club who ruthlessly relieved him of his duties last summer, on their home patch, as his side took a giant step towards Premier League survival — it does not get much better than that. He knew it, too, ecstatically saluting the Villa faithful with both fists clenched at the final whistle before shaking Mauricio Pochettino’s hand. Christian Benteke heads Aston Villa into the lead against Tottenham in the 35th minute of the game .

Sherwood went back for more, striding on to the pitch he called home last season for another double-fisted celebration as Villa supporters cheered wildly. All this without his trademark body-warmer on a mild day in north London. ‘This is my most satisfying victory as a manager, because it’s at such an important stage of the season and no-one gave us a chance,’ said Sherwood. ‘This week I’ve had so many people tell me, “You can’t win at White Hart Lane, Villa never win there”. ‘I’ve been in the pressure of a title race as a player, but this is worse. When you’re a player you only think about yourself. As a manager you’ve got the expectations of the whole club — and this isn’t a little club, it’s massive.’ Villa manager Sherwood was visibly ecstatic at recording the win and getting three points upon the final whistle .

Villa midfielder Carlos Sanchez was sent off for committing a second bookable offence in the final exchanges against Tottenham . As for Tottenham, they can kiss the idea of Champions League football goodbye after this lacklustre defeat. This display suggests they do not deserve a top-four finish. Federico Fazio, alongside Eric Dier in central defence, was handed the unenviable task of taming Christian Benteke after Jan Vertonghen missed out through illness. The Belgian striker’s run of seven goals in five games had given Villa’s survival hopes a shot in the arm. By the final whistle Fazio was probably wishing Vertonghen had taken a shot of something to cure his illness as the brilliant Benteke fired Villa to victory. Spurs carved out the first clear-cut chance in the 27th minute, Brad Guzan saving well after Harry Kane had played in Danny Rose down the left. That was as good as it got for Tottenham, though, as Benteke’s influence grew. Crowd reaction . All was going well until his exuberant celebrations at the final whistle, which prompted an angry reaction from the home fans in the West Stand but he merely shook his fist at them and disappeared down the tunnel. Got an easy ride during the game, though, and gave the Villa fans a wave after they asked for one in the 16th minute. Touchline behaviour . The spring weather allowed to him leave his gilet indoors so there were no flying jackets this time. He did not leave his seat until the eighth minute then remained standing for the most part. Little more than a subtle fist pump when Christian Benteke scored the winner but his emotions poured out at the final whistle. Told someone on the Spurs bench to ‘shut the f*** up’ as tempers flared in stoppage time. Tactics . Sherwood has shown once again that he knows how to get a striker scoring. Benteke, who fronted a three-pronged attack, scored the winner before the manager set his side up perfectly to deal with the second-half Spurs fightback, although it never seemed to come. Verdict . Low-key return for Sherwood who nailed the game plan and left with three precious points. Looks a different, more relaxed man, although he showed a glimpse of the old Tim at the final whistle.

Gabriel Agbonlahor should have been allowed to go one on one with Michel Vorm as he sprung Tottenham’s offside trap, but he was wrongly flagged in the 31st minute. The decision sparked the first animated complaint from Sherwood, who had been unusually subdued to that point. Four minutes later, Sherwood was back on his feet. Not in anger this time, but in delight. If Villa preserve their top-flight status they will owe it to Benteke. They will also have Spurs defender Vlad Chiriches — filling in at right back for the injured Kyle Walker — to thank. The Romanian, who has been a peripheral figure for Pochettino, was having an uncomfortable afternoon, and the home fans were letting him know it, too. Chiriches’s carelessness led to Villa’s winner. After he sloppily conceded possession around 10 yards outside his area, the ball eventually fell to Bacuna, from whose cross Benteke out-jumped Fazio and directed his header past Vorm. Villa deserved their lead; without being easy on the eye, there was an intensity to their game that Tottenham could not handle. And in first-half stoppage time they very nearly doubled their advantage. Not for the first time, a long pass found Benteke, whose header released Agbonlahor, who cut inside Dier before watching his low drive from the edge of the area hit the post. Any faint hopes Pochettino still harboured of a top-four finish were fading fast. Tottenham did step up the tempo in the second half; Rose and Kane both went close with speculative efforts. But if Benteke was Villa’s first-half hero, their central-defensive partnership of Ron Vlaar and Nathan Baker took the honours after the break as Sherwood’s men soaked up the pressure.

But it was Villa who missed two glorious chances to wrap up victory, Vlaar and Fabian Delph spurning gilt-edged opportunities in the closing stages. To add to Sherwood’s anxiety, Villa had to play the final few minutes with 10 men after Carlos Sanchez picked up a second yellow card for a late challenge on Rose. The match descended into farce as both teams were involved in a melee just before the final whistle. Soon afterwards, though, Sherwood and Villa erupted.","Christian Benteke headed Aston Villa into the lead in the 35th minute against Tottenham at White Hart Lane .

"Alexis Sanchez is the only current player good enough to get into the great Arsenal teams of yesteryear, according to club legend Frank McLintock. The Chile international has been a smash hit since arriving from Barcelona last summer and his 20 goals in all competitions have powered Arsenal's season. The Gunners are second in the Barclays Premier League following an eight-match winning run and face Reading on Saturday in the semi-finals of the FA Cup.

And McLintock, the Scottish defender who made 403 appearances for the club between 1964 and 1973, has praised his debut-season contribution. He told Perform: 'I heard it said recently how many of the Arsenal side would get into past Arsenal sides? 'They said probably Sanchez and that's not too far away.

In all, he played 403 matches for the club, scoring 32 goals. And McLintock believes the club need to raise their expectations ahead of the next campaign. He said: 'I think we have to be a bit better than we are. But they're doing well, I'm happy they're doing well - it's a good sign. 'I don't want to see Arsenal talking about getting top four, I can't believe they're setting their standards that low.

"Bayern Munich may have been ravaged by injuries ahead of the Champions League game at Porto on Wednesday but the squad's sense of unity is stronger, Thomas Muller said on Tuesday. The Bavarians, chasing three titles this season, are without Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba among others for the quarter-final, first leg in Portugal.

"John Carver has challenged his Newcastle players to relieve the pressure on their shoulders by adding another dent to Liverpool's Champions League hopes. The Reds have slipped to seven points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City as a result of successive defeats by Manchester United and Arsenal, although things could have been worse had the champions managed to emerge from Monday night's trip to Crystal Palace with something to show for their efforts. Brendan Rodgers' men ended their mini-slump on Wednesday evening with a 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final replay victory at Blackburn, and Carver knows they will will determined to add three points to that to keep alive their hopes of a top-four finish when the Magpies head for Anfield on Monday evening. John Carver says his players need to relieve the pressure of their shoulders with a win against Liverpool . He said: 'They are only seven points off it, I think, and they'll think they have still got a chance, seven points off it with seven games to go. 'I remember our football club having a huge gap for (to win) the championship and it dwindling away, so anything is possible. 'They'll think they've still got a chance of getting into that top four, and I'll be very surprised if the manager doesn't prepare his team thinking like that, so we know we are going to have a difficult game. Brendan Rodgers and his side have slipped out of the top four and out of Champions League contention . 'But there's a bit of pressure on ourselves as well.' That pressure comes specifically because of Sunday's 1-0 derby defeat at Sunderland, the Magpies' fifth successive reverse in the fixture, but more generally as a result of a run of 13 games in all competition under their current head coach which has brought just two victories. Newcastle have not added to their points tally of 35 since they beat Aston Villa on February 28, some four games ago, and have scored just once in the process. The Newcastle boss looks increasingly unlikely to get the job, with his results failing to impress . They remain nine points clear of the relegation zone, but with European challengers Tottenham heading for St James' Park next weekend, the situation could get worse before it gets better. Carver's cause has not been helped by an injury and suspension list which at some points has robbed him of an entire XI, and while there is light at the end of the tunnel for midfielders Rolando Aarons and Siem de Jong, the trip to Merseyside will come too soon. Carver said: 'I would say Rolando is certainly ahead of Siem de Jong at the moment, but neither of those guys will be available this weekend.'

"A bullish performance by Exeter tighthead Tomas Francis could trigger a tug-of-war between Stuart Lancaster and Warren Gatland after the 21st 2lb prop helped end Northampton’s three-month unbeaten run in the Aviva Premiership. Against a side who pride themselves on the set-piece, Francis dominated his scrummaging contest against Alex Corbisiero and put down a significant marker for his inclusion at the World Cup. The 22-year-old — who qualifies for both England and Wales — is yet to pledge his international allegiance, despite having been called up to Gatland’s training camp during the RBS 6 Nations.

Chiefs prop Tomas Francis, who qualifies for England and Wales, impressed up against Alex Corbisiero . ‘Tomas is a young man and will only get better through regular exposure,’ said Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter. ‘He’s been to a Welsh training camp, but he’s English.’ With Wales suffering from injury problems in the front row, Francis (right) could be fast-tracked through the ranks to face England in the World Cup pool match. But his performance at Sandy Park may tempt Lancaster to make a late move for the youngster, with Chiefs moving back into the play-off positions with three games to play.

"As the World cup draws closer, it is not just in the rugby heartlands that they are beginning to feel the excitement. Twickenham, as the home of rugby, may be gearing up to embrace the sport’s biggest tournament, but on the other side of the capital, the Olympic stadium – built for athletics and destined to be a football ground - is also quietly preparing to get in the oval-ball act. In Newcastle, St James’ Park, usually a footballing stronghold, is another ground about to host Rugby’s premier competition, and as former Bath, Saracens and England prop David ‘Flats’ Flatman has been finding out, from the north east to east London, England is getting rugby-fever. David 'Flats' Flatman has been driving around the Rugby World Cup venues preparing for the tournament . London's Olympic stadium may not be a traditional rugby ground, but the buzz around the game is palpable . ‘Going to all these places and seeing the buzz around the World Cup already, is great,’ says Flats on the drive between Stratford and Twickenham, as he tours around the country visiting the stadiums that will host matches come this autumn as part of BT Sport's Tour de Flats. ‘You kind of expect that kind of a buzz in rugby cities, like Cardiff and Exeter. But when you arrive in Newcastle and the guy who is fixing the cabinet comes over to you to talk about rugby, you realise there’s a proper enthusiasm in places that are normally dominated by football.’ Building that enthusiasm, with the prospect of high-calibre sport on the horizon, is one thing. But as everyone connected with the Olympic stadium knows, maintaining it after the competition is gone is another matter altogether. But Flats is confident that, long term, this World Cup is going to have a lasting effect. ‘There are bound to be studies that come out, or bits of research, 15 minutes after the final whistle of the World Cup final, and say there are only seven more children in Europe playing rugby than there were on Tuesday,’ he jokes. Flats talks to Sportsmail's Jonny Singer on arrival at Twickenham at the end of his 'Tour de Flats' England came up short against France in the Six Nations, but their style of play earned plenty of plaudits . ‘But I think what it needs is a concerted effort to make as much noise, constructive noise, about the Rugby World Cup as possible.’ At the heart of the ‘legacy’ debate, as it was with the Olympics, is the discussion over grassroots sport, and it’s something that Flats’ tour has been focused on. ‘We went to a club in Leicester, with Mike Tindall and Ben Kay, and this is a club, with nothing,’ he recounts. ‘They have absolutely nothing. Part of the World Cup legacy is they will receive upgrades to their facilities. Now, at Wasps or Harlequins, that means 5,000 extra seats. For them that means a shower. ‘Not shower rooms. A shower. They don’t have one. All this sort of stuff, that’s the grassroots.’ Of course, as well as investment and infrastructure, what this World Cup will bring, Stuart Lancaster will hope, is an England team playing with confidence in front of their own fans. For the World Cup to be the inspiration it has the potential to be, England’s performances will matter. If Stuart Lancaster's side can repeat their flowing rugby at the World Cup, they can win the sport fans . Flatman says picking the likes of Danny Cipriani is key to England bringing in new fans during the tournament . ‘A lot of the buzz and the legacy around the World Cup will be how England play,’ admits Flats. ‘How far they get is one side of it, another side is how they perform. ‘They didn’t do enough against France (in last month’s Six Nations) because they didn’t win, but they were fantastic, and everyone loves it, and everyone forgives that. ‘So they want to win, first and foremost, but how they do so will have a big impact.’ Playing attractive rugby is not just a question of attitude, it also depends on personnel, and that is why the former England prop is so glad to see the return of one of the country’s most exciting players, Danny Cipriani. Cipriani may have a reputation as a ‘pretty boy’ but, for Flats, that can’t mask the fact that he is a top player. ‘He’s not a prima donna. Someone gets photographed at a fashion show, and has nice hair, and they say you’re a prima donna. ‘Sam Warburton’s got nice hair and big guns; If he went to Cardiff fashion week he wouldn’t be a prima donna because he’s a hard-nut flanker, and he’s not a fly half. Cipriani was recalled for the Six Nations after impressing at club level over the past few seasons . Flats says investment in the grass-roots will also be important if the Rugby World Cup is to have a legacy . ‘You can’t have a prima donna in the forwards. Why is Danny Cipriani? Just because he’s prettier and smaller. He’s a good bloke and an amazing rugby player. ‘We talk about inspiring young people, who do you think the kids “are” in the playground now, playing rugby? ‘A lot of them will be saying, “I’m Danny Cipriani”. I thought he deserved to get back in the England squad and I’m glad they picked him.’ So, if England play at their fluent best, and the grass roots get the funding they so badly need, could the rugby World Cup produce a new generation of players and fans? Flats thinks so, but only if the tournament is made accessible. ‘There’s a big responsibility of commentators and pundits, without dumbing things down, to simplify things a bit,’ he explains. ‘Offer clarity, and make people who might be first time watchers, like they understand it more. ‘ . If that understand can join the enthusiasm that is clearly building, England could have a tournament with lasting legacy – and not just in south west London.

"Sale's hopes of qualification for next season's European Champions Cup were dealt a hammer blow as they went down to a surprising 25-23 defeat at the Madejski Stadium. Sale still remain in seventh position but they lost ground on most of their rivals and have only themselves to blame for this disappointing result as they made too many critical errors. Irish scored three tries through Alex Lewington (two) and Andrew Fenby with Chris Noakes adding two penalties and two conversions. Sale Sharks winger Tom Arscott dives over for a try during the first-half at the Madejski Stadium . Tom Arscott scored a brace of tries for Sale as Mike Haley claimed the other with Danny Cipriani kicking two penalties and a conversion. Prop, Richard Palframan, made his first Premiership start the hosts with Jebb Sinclair recalled in the back row. Shane Geraghty was an absentee with Chris Noakes included at fly-half and Fergus Mulchrone in the centre. Scott Steele was a late withdrawal after failing a fitness test with Darren Allinson coming in at scrum half. Sale's starting line-up was unchanged from their win over Gloucester but hooker, Marc Jones, returned on the bench. Exiles centre Eoin Griffin is tackle by Sale powerhouse Sam Tuitupou . Straight from the kick-off, Irish made simple errors, giving the visitors a platform to attack and with Cipriani pulling the strings, Sale created an overlap providing Arscott with an easy run-in. Irish missed an early opportunity for points by declining to take a kickable penalty and it proved the wrong option as their attacking line-out failed to provide any dividend. Irish suffered a blow when they lost lock Richard Skuse to injury with Luke Narraway coming on as his replacement. The opening period was played at a frenetic pace with Irish struggling to cope as Sale were all action, moving the ball at every opportunity, displaying some extremely slick handling. However against the run play, Irish produced an excellent movement with Allinson, Narraway and Fergus Mulchrone all prominent and they succeeded in winning a penalty, which Noakes kicked to leave his side trailing 5-3 at the end of the first quarter. Noakes then rewarded a period of pressure from Irish to kick his second penalty as it was now the turn of the visitors, to make the elementary errors. Sale were also conceding a number of penalties at the scrum area and from one of these, Noakes should have put Irish further ahead but his attempt was off target. Sale scrum half Chris Cusiter attempts to make a clearance kick under pressure from the Exiles defence . After 33 minutes, Irish prop, Tom Court, was sin-binned for dragging down a driving line-out and Sale took immediate advantage when Haley outflanked the Irish cover defence to score a well-created try. With the last kick of the half, Noakes attempted a penalty from inside his own half. It fell short but for some inexplicable reason, Cipriani chose to run the ball from within his own 22 and his pass to Haley was fumbled by the full back. Irish capitalised with Fenby seizing the loose ball to race away for the try, which Noakes converted for a 13-10 interval lead. Tomas O'Leary and Griffin contest for a high ball during a frenetic Aviva Premiership contest in Reading . Court returned but Irish were soon back down to 14 men when Blair Cowan was yellow carded for a deliberate offside with Cipriani making no mistake with the resulting kick to tie up the scores. Sale took further advantage of Cowan's absence to score their third try and Arscott's second. The wing again outflanked the home cover but the scoring pass from Haley looked suspiciously forward. Irish fought back and they appeared to have scored when a driving maul crashed over the visitors' line but the TMO was unable to confirm the grounding. It did not matter for long as Sale's Chris Cusiter was yellow carded which give Irish a hance to score their second through Lewington. Topsy Ojo was the next to receive a yellow card, this one for dangerous play but Irish overcame this setback when Lewington brushed aside some weak tackling to score his second. Noakes converted to give Irish a 25-20 lead at the end of the third quarter. Cipriani kicked his second penalty to set up a tense finish but Sale continued to make mistakes at crucial times as Irish held on.","Sale remain seventh in the Aviva Premiership despite their defeat .

"Brendan Rodgers is ready to unleash Jordan Ibe on the Barclays Premier League once more after his sparkling return to training. Ibe has been absent for the last six weeks after he damaged his knee ligaments during a Europa League tie against Besiktas in Istanbul. Before that, though, he had said he had been in outstanding after Rodgers had to thrust him into the spotlight. The young England international spent the first half of the season on loan at Derby County but he returned to Anfield in January and made an immediate impact, with a Man-of-the-Match performance in the Merseyside derby on February 6. Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe in action for Brendan Rodgers' side in the Europa League against Besiktas . Liverpool initially thought Ibe would be out for no longer than four weeks but they have been careful not to rush him; in recent weeks, however, his training has been to a high level and Rodgers will include him in his squad to face Newcastle on Monday. Liverpool’s manager said: ‘Young Jordon will come back in and I've got to say he's looked absolutely sensational in training. He's been out for a while but he's been a couple of weeks now out on the field doing his preparation work and he's joined in the training. ‘Absolutely outstanding, he’s looked. He's got real natural fitness and he'll come into the squad for Monday night.’ Ibe was awarded the Man-of-the-Match having performed magnificently in the Merseyside derby in February . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers dishes out the instructions during training on Saturday . The 19-year-old (right) has done well since breaking into the Liverpool first team and is seen as a key member . There will not, though, be a return for Mario Balotelli. The striker has been sidelined for the last two games, first with a knee problem then with illness and Rodgers is planning for the game without the Italy striker. ‘We'll assess that over the next couple of days,’ said Rodgers. ‘He was injured against Arsenal and has been ill since the midweek and continues to be. We'll see over the next 24 hours.’ Liverpool have dropped off the pace in the race for a top four spot following back-to-back defeat against Manchester United and Arsenal but if Louis van Gaal’s side beat Manchester City and Rodgers sees his team beat Newcastle, there will be a glimmer of light.

Wednesday’s win over Blackburn in the FA Cup has lifted the atmosphere at Melwood and Rodgers has urged his players to focus on their job. ‘The performance and the result the other night puts us back on track again,’ said Rodgers. ‘Hopefully from that result we can build the momentum through until end of season. It was excellent performance and a good result in a tough tie. We’ll just take each game at a time now and really focus on the Newcastle. ‘The teams in there now have the advantage. You're looking at them slipping up and building momentum until the end of the season. It will be interesting watching it.

"Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge believes Raheem Sterling will only be happy if he plays regularly and hopes he will remain at the club to do that. Sterling is stalling on a new £100,000-a-week contract offer, although he insists it has nothing to do with money and he will reassess his options at the end of the season. The 20-year-old, who has been linked with a number of Europe's top clubs, was one of four players at the Anfield launch of next season's New Balance kit in front of over 1,000 fans, with one shouting from the crowd 'Make sure we see you in it next season'.

Sturridge uploaded this to his Instagram account as he posed with Sterling, Mignolet and Skrtel at the launch . Sturridge posed with his team-mates and uploaded these snaps to his Instagram account . That made the youngster slightly more uncomfortable than he already was perched on a stool on stage, and speaking afterwards Sturridge said having regular football - which he is virtually guaranteed at Liverpool but possibly not elsewhere - was a key consideration for Sterling. 'I don't know what Raheem wants to do but it is just important to be able to play regularly,' he told Press Association Sport. 'As long as he is playing regularly he will be happy - I don't think it is anything to with anything other than that and I hope he will stay at the club. 'It is important, regardless of who you are, to show what you can do - not just for Raheem but any young player. 'It is important to play games and gain experience so whatever decision he makes I am behind him 100 per cent.' Sturridge experienced something similar himself when he left Manchester City for Chelsea aged 19 but things did not pan out how he would have liked at Stamford Bridge and he left for Liverpool in January 2012 after 63 appearances in four years. As he matured he has enjoyed greater success at Anfield, scoring 40 goals in 67 appearances but his good form was interrupted this season by a five-month absence with a thigh problem. Since returning in January he has scored four times in 15 games and some of his performances have drawn criticism simply because he has not matched the heights of last season when, playing alongside Luis Suarez, he scored 24 times. Daniel Sturridge is bidding to return to his best form following a lengthy spell out through injury . However, the England striker knew he would not rediscover his best form immediately, which he believes will only come with a full pre-season under his belt. 'It has taken time to get back into the groove. I have missed a lengthy time and gaining sharpness while playing games is not easy in a league like the Premier League - you can't ease yourself back in because the games are very fast,' he added. 'It has been a difficult season in terms of the injuries but I know I will come back strong and get back to exactly how I was performing before. 'It is going to take time, it is not going to happen overnight, I understand that. 'It is the sharpness and fitness side of things. It takes a long time and that is the whole point of having a long pre-season. 'I am looking forward to helping the team this season and towards next season I will be right back to where I was, because I would have had a pre-season I will be back to the sharpness and fitness levels I had before.'

"There will have been eight Madrid derbies by the end of this season, no city showdown has been played more in recent years. MailSport looks at the reasons why Atletico Madrid’s meeting with Real Madrid can also lay claim to be the greatest city derby in world football. Opposites attract . The clash of styles is always fascinating. Carlo Ancelotti must accommodate Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema and that leaves him little choice but to play a 4-3-3. Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema must all be accommodated, leaving little choice but 4-3-3 . Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are meeting for the fifth and sixth time in European competition that brings them level with Inter and AC Milan in number of city duels. Chelsea and Arsenal have met twice, as have Barcelona and Espanyol and Rapid and Steaua Bucharest. It’s a system that leaves Real Madrid short in midfield especially when you consider none of the first choice midfield trio are defensive players. This plays perfectly into Atletico’s hands. Diego Simeone will flood the midfield on Tuesday night as he has done in recent meetings between the two sides and see if his 4-4-2 with Arda Turan, Mario Suarez, Gabi and Koke can’t over-run Rodriguez, Luka Modric in midfield. Atletico’s two banks of four are also very good at closing the space down for Bale, Ronaldo and Benzema. No wonder Ancelotti said on Monday that playing Simeone’s team is always a problem. Midfielder Koke will be deployed to try and smother the Real Madrid midfield during their last eight tie . The coaches . Simeone never tires of his ‘one game at a time mantra’ Ancelotti was on Monday talking about the challenge being not to beat Atletico but to win the 11th European Cup – the complete opposite of one game at a time. This meeting has added spice because it's the chance for last season's beaten finalists to avenge their victors. Borusia Monchengladbach had the same opportunity against Liverpool in 1978 as did Juventus against Ajax in 1997 and Inter Milan against Bayern Munich in 2011. Simeone’s burns more calories on the touchline than some of his players while Ancelotti’s activity tends to get no more anaerobic than opening another packet of chewing gum. The Italian has won the lot in club football, Simeone is on his way to equaling that feat – he has already won the league and cup in Spain, and the European and Spanish Super Cups along with the Europa League. He almost got the European Cup last year but Ancelotti denied him. For as long as the pair stay in Spain their futures will be linked. Diego Simeone raises his players one game at a time and the games against Real Madrid are no difference . Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti and Atletico boss Simeone often have their careers compared . The Real stars against the team with no stars . When Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Atletico Madrid in the league in February it wasn’t the Atletico players who went out partying. Real’s players are the footballing glitterati and Ronaldo’s high-profile birthday bash was part of that. Atletico’s players take great joy in beating their pin-up rivals. Mario Mandzukic, Diego Godin and Raul Garcia are happy to play it ugly if it gets results. Diego Godin and Mario Mandzukic are happy to play ugly to achieve winning results for their side . Goals and golazos . Koke’s thunderbolt shots, the inspiration of Turan, a moment’s magic from Antoine Griezmann – Atletico Madrid are about more than just graft. And with Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema, James Rodriguez and Isco all capable of moments of brilliance the derbies have thrown up their fair share of great goals. Ronaldo and Gareth Bale's moments of brilliance have thrown up their fair share of goals in the game . Atletico Madrid's Turkish midfielder Arda Turan has scored his fair share of wondergoals in his career . Well-matched . They used to hold a sarcastic banner up behind the goal at the Santiago Bernabeu for the Madrid derby. It was written like a classified ad and read: ‘wanted – decent rival for city derby’. Those days are long gone. Atletico Madrid ended a 14-year run of not beating Real when they won the Copa del Rey against them two years ago. Sergio Ramos celebrates a goal against his rivals in the Champions League final in Portugal . The game is a chance for Simeone to get his own back on Ancelotti for the defeat in what is to date their only meeting in European competition. Although some would say with four wins and two draws in the six games in other competitions between the two since then, he has already done that. And they haven’t looked back since. At the start of the season they beat them in the Spanish Super Cup and knocked them out of the Copa del Rey both times over two legs. The one blip in the recent run came when it mattered most in last year’s Champions League final and they will hope to put that right on Tuesday night. Most City derbies have one side up and the other down – right now Atletico as Spanish Champions and Real as European Champions are a match for each other in every sense.

'Last season Luis Suarez was Liverpool's main man, the go-to man. But as this season has progressed, and for the future, Coutinho is Liverpool's.' It was Coutinho who scored Liverpool's only goal against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the FA Cup last week to book their place in the semi-final. The Brazil international signed a new five-year contract with Liverpool in February after completing a £8.5m move from Inter Milan in January 2013.

"Marouane Fellaini has emerged as an force to be reckoned with in Manchester United's midfield of late, and Jamie Carragher says Jose Mourinho will be drawing up a special plan to stop him. Chelsea face United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday in the Barclays Premier League and both Sportsmail columnist Carragher and his fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville believe Mourinho will bring Kurt Zouma into his midfield to neutralise Fellaini. The French centre back started in the middle of the park in last month's Capital One Cup final and has become an emergency option for the league leaders in that unfamiliar role of late. Marouane Fellaini has emerged as an force to be reckoned with in Manchester United's midfield of late . Jamie Carragher believes Jose Mourinho will bring Kurt Zouma into his midfield to neutralise Fellaini . Carragher and Gary Neville agreed that Mourinho would have a special plan to stop United's run of form . Carragher and Neville were speaking as part of Monday Night Football ahead of Liverpool vs Newcastle United . But with United on such good form, having won their last six league games, Mourinho will need to find a way to put a stop to Louis van Gaal's team and Carragher and Neville see Fellaini as the main target. Carragher sees the Special One retreating into his shell with a midfield incorporating Zouma, Nemanja Matic and Ramires as they look to deny Fellaini and the rest of United's midfield that they have thrived in. 'Jose Mourinho very rarely gets done tactically in a big game. His record is fantastic,' Carragher said. 'There's no doubt, he won't go in with just his normal set-up, he'll use something different. I'm convinced of it. 'Jose Mourinho very rarely gets done tactically in a big game. His record is fantastic,' Carragher said . Fellaini could be targeted by Mourinho in midfield as he looks to find a way of stopping United on Saturday . Gary Cahill, John Terry and Zouma (L-R) could all be involved from the start in the game at Stamford Bridge . Zouma has emerged as an emergency option for Chelsea when they need strength in the midfield area . 'I think there's a case for bringing Zouma into midfield, maybe get him on Fellaini, because Matic is left-footed and he won't want to put him on the right side of central midfield. 'I imagine he will maybe play Ramires instead of Willian and tuck him right in to fill spaces around there. (Mourinho will) play Zouma as more like a third centre back, but slightly ahead of (Gary) Cahill and (John) Terry just to look after Fellaini. 'I'm convinced he won't allow the space and the problems they cause down that left side to happen. He will set up and stop it, I'm convinced of it.' Mourinho will not want to give United space and that means that he will set up to stop them, says Carragher . Ramires was also picked out as a potential player to be used in midfield, with Willian missing out . Neville agreed, and went as far as to say that Mourinho would focus on 'destruction' before hoping to win by taking advantage of set-pieces or the skill of Eden Hazard in his analysis on Monday Night Football. The former Manchester United captain also made it clear that while he expects Mourinho to have a plan for the game, he does not see his charges winning their next three games against United, Arsenal and Leicester City to take the Premier League title at the earliest possible opportunity. 'I think he'll just think destruction first and foremost, he'll think how I'm going to stop them and then how I'm going to win the game,' Neville said. Neville commented on how Mourinho would be focused on 'destruction', having Zouma 'sacrificing himself' 'I think Zouma coming in is a good point, it will be alongside Matic in midfield. Zouma will sit a little bit to the right and just sacrifice himself in the game. 'That will then give them (Branislav) Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Zouma, Matic, (Didier) Drogba potentially, and he'll think: ""I can win this game either by a bit of magic from Hazard or by set-pieces"". He'll play the long game. 'His team aren't playing very well, United are playing better than them at this moment in time. But he'll stop that pattern on the left-hand side and more often than not, when he pays attention to things, he does.'","Chelsea face Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon .

"Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United team-mate Marouane Fellaini has gone from Old Trafford scapegoat to one of the most dangerous forwards in Europe. Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option. 'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player. Wayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment . Fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool . Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope. 'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney. 'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in. 'We have been working really hard. 'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.' 'We are confident going to Chelsea. 'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea. Louis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth . 'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can. 'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue. 'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'","Marouane Fellaini has drawn plaudits for his recent performances .

"Sampdoria have revived their interest in Mario Balotelli should he choose to take a pay cut. Eccentric club president Massimo Ferrero says the talented but frustrating 24-year-old has lost his desire for football and needs to go to Stadio Luigi Ferraris to re-discover himself. Liverpool have been willing to sell Balotelli since January but could find no takers after signing him for £16m. Mario Balotelli has only scored once in the Premier League since his switch to Liverpool last summer . The Italian striker is set to leave the club at the end of the season and Sampdoria want to sign him . The Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero says that Balotelli has lost his hunger . Ferrero said Balotelli should be put on a diet of bread and water and given a Bianchina (a small car from the 1960s) instead of a Ferrari . His agent Mino Raiola has also hinted Liverpool would have to pay him off first after saying he wanted to finish his contract and prove to the Anfield crowd he was good enough. Tentative loan offers have been proposed and Sampdoria would likely offer a cut price permanent move. Ferrero said: 'I’d sign him. If he came to Sampdoria, he would come back to his usual standards. Here nobody would bother him if he missed a goal, he would be quiet and happy.' Talking to Gazzetta TV, Ferrero added: 'In my opinion he’s not hungry anymore, he earns 4 million euros (£2.9m) a year. We should put him on bread and water, give him a Bianchina [a small car from the 1960s] rather than a Ferrari… then I’m sure he would score again.'","Mario Balotelli joined Liverpool for £16million from AC Milan last summer .

"Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy hailed the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of players after a determined 1-1 draw at his former club Wolves moved Town closer to securing a place in the SkyBet Championship play-offs. Despite Wolves bouncing back to take a point through Benik Afobe's 31st goal of the season in the 50th minute after a Richard Stearman own goal had given Ipswich a first-half lead, Town's play-off hopes are now in their own hands with two games remaining. Former Wolves boss McCarthy was delighted with his side's determined display and he said: 'It was a good performance and a good point. It is very pleasing. Mick McCarthy's Ipswich were denied three points as rivals Wolves fought back to draw 1-1 on Saturday . 'Wolves were in the ascendancy in the second half but we have had a great, stubborn, belligerent, professional performance - all those horrible words people don't like in football but I do because you win games and win leagues by doing that. 'We are always hard to beat and hard to play against. 'The first thing I said to the players in the dressing room after the game was what a belligerent, stubborn, hard working, tough, horrible bunch you have turned out to be and I love you and I am proud of you because you need all those qualities to be a good team. It is lovely to have. 'A lot of those qualities are probably the reasons why we are where we are. 'It takes a lot of things to be in the top six and there will be teams below us who are all playing sexy football but we are winning games and we are in the top six and we still have a chance of being promoted. 'So to anyone who cocks a snook at the way we are doing it I laugh at them and think it is comical because I think what we do we do well and isn't that what having a job is all about?' Tommy Smith's header (right) rebounds off Wolves defender Richard Stearman for an own goal . McCarthy, who was sacked by Wolves in February 2012 after almost six years in charge of the club, insisted that he did not have anything to prove on his second return to Molineux. He added: 'I think I am very much liked and respected by the Wolves fans and I love the club and the people here so I don't think I have got anything to prove and I always appreciate getting a nice warm welcome coming back. 'But I have taken the point and I am happy with that.' Although they trailed at the break, Wolves needed only five minutes of the second period to draw level when Afobe stabbed home at the far post and they could have gone on to snatch a winner with Nouha Dicko carrying their greatest. McCarthy hails the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of Ipswich players . They could not find a second goal, though, and their play-off hopes are now hanging by a thread. However, coach Kenny Jackett insisted they will not be throwing in the towel. He said: 'It is out of our hands and now we will need to win our final two games and other teams will need to lose. But you don't know what will happen. So we need to make sure that we go again next week. 'It is a tough call, we understand that. We will have to see how the table looks but one way or another we have to put in a good performance and give it everything we have got next week at Wigan. Kenny Jackett is still hopeful his Wolves side can secure a Championship play-off spot despite the 1-1 draw . 'If the door is still open through other people slipping up we have to make sure that we are there.' He added: 'We gave it everything against Ipswich. I thought that we showed a lot of spirit, effort and energy in the second half when we pushed Ipswich all the way. The attitude and tempo was there.' 'Ultimately it is a better point for Ipswich than it is for us. We needed to win and I felt that we built up very well in the second half. We got a goal back early on but couldn't break down a very determined and well organised and resolute Ipswich defence. 'The number of times that they got blocks in was high and for us not to break them down in that period was our undoing so I am disappointed with the draw. We needed three points but Ipswich are very, very resolute.'","Ipswich denied three points as Wolves fight back to draw 1-1 on Saturday .

"More than 400 extra officers have been drafted in by British Transport Police with rivals Manchester United, Liverpool and Leeds United all in London this weekend. The force hare been faced with a unique set of circumstances and have acted swiftly to ensure they will be ready to deal with any flashpoints. United head to Stamford Bridge on Saturday to take on Chelsea in a 5pm kick-off while Roses rivals Leeds are at Charlton Athletic for a 3pm start. British Transport Police have drafted in 400 extra officers to help with crowds in London over the weekend . Liverpool take on Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday with thousands of fans of both sides expected to descend on the capital 24 hours earlier. Sportsmail understands officers will be stationed on trains travelling down from the north and the Midlands. Extra officers will also be present at mainline and underground stations. Rivals Manchester United, Leeds and Liverpool will all be in the capital over the weekend . Chief Superintendent Paul Brogden, of British Transport Police (BTP), said there would be a visible presence from his officers. 'With two FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley, and several other football matches taking place across London, this weekend is set to be a busy one for the transport network,' he explained. 'The public can expect to see BTP officers at stations and onboard trains, ensuring everyone travels safely to and from the games. Trains can become busy during big sporting events such as this and we would urge fans to consider other passengers at all times. Officers will be stationed on trains travelling from the north and the Midlands ahead of the weekend . 'We will not tolerate intimidating or anti-social behaviour by those intent on spoiling the day for genuine supporters and the wider travelling public. BTP officers will deal robustly with anyone caught committing crime.' This season has seen a number of high-profile incidents at stations and on trains. After the Capital One Cup Final in March a number of Chelsea fans were accused of racist behaviour on a service from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly while Leeds United supporters were named as the worst offenders for causing problems on trains while United had the worst record in the Premier League.","400 extra officers drafted in by the British Transport Police this weekend .

"Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has called for realism in their survival quest and insisted that their remaining fixtures will make it extremely tough to avoid relegation. They will escape the drop zone for the first time since November if they beat Swansea at home on Saturday by three goals and Burnley fail to win at Everton. They also have to face relegation rivals Sunderland and Burnley away while welcoming QPR to the King Power Stadium on the final day of the season. Back-to-back wins revived Leicester’s hopes of top-flight survival but Pearson wants to keep a lid on expectations. He said: ‘We believe in ourselves but we have seven left, five at home and one against Chelsea. They are still extremely tough fixtures. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson is not taking anything for granted in the chase for survival . Wes Morgan trains with team-mates ahead of Leicester's game against Swansea at the weekend . ‘We are aware we have had some bad luck from time to time. It’s that belief in ourselves that has kept us going.’ Burnley, meanwhile, have collected eight points from a testing run of eight games but now have to start turning some gritty displays into more positive results. Having won only once since January, it could be the wrong time to be running into an Everton side that are unbeaten in four at Goodison Park but manager Sean Dyche is not looking at form. He said: ‘You can’t govern other people’s situation. We have to focus on ourselves whether it’s good or not good. When the whistle blows, we have a plan and are more looking at how we are going to operate. Jamie Vardy celebrates scoring against West Brom as the Foxes record back-to-back wins . ‘We’ve done a lot of work after being written off. We’re certainly in the pack. Performance-wise I’ve been pleased but we have to win games.’ Everton manager Roberto Martinez sees a fearlessness in Burnley similar to that displayed by his Wigan team in surviving against the odds in the Premier League. The Clarets head to Goodison Park having beaten Manchester City, drawn against Tottenham and narrowly defeated by Arsenal in the last month. Argentinian ace Esteban Cambiasso is one of several players whose contracts expire at the end of the season . They are two points from safety but Martinez believes the fact they have been scrapping to get out of the bottom three all season — much like his Wigan side in the four seasons he spent with them — gives them an advantage over teams who have been dragged into the race for survival. Martinez said: ‘When you are in a situation as clear as the one they have, they are only one step from getting away from the bottom three and that is an incredible incentive.’ Martinez believes Dyche will help Burnley survive. ‘Sean has been an incredible leader and has set very good direction for his team,’ he added. ‘When you get into a new league you sometimes don’t get positive results after a successful season in the Championship and you start having doubts and wanting to change week after week.’","Leicester remain at the foot of the Premier League table after 31 games .

"Dundee boss Paul Hartley has warned that Paul McGowan may not feature in any of the team's remaining six games this season because he fears playing the troubled midfielder could see him break his police curfew and end up in prison. After his third conviction last week for assaulting a police officer, McGowan escaped a jail sentence but was placed under a restriction of liberty order and confined to his home from 7pm to 7am for 16 weeks. That has already ruled him out of the evening matches with Celtic at Dens Park on Wednesday and at Parkhead on Friday May 1, but Hartley fears that even playing in the three remaining games in the City of Discovery, which kick off at 3pm, could leave the player at risk of breaching his order. Dundee rogue Paul McGowan has been handed his third conviction after assaulting a police officer . Dundee manager Paul Hartley says he will not risk playing the troubled midfielder again this season . Hartley is worried that if McGowan was, for example, called up for after-match drug testing, required hospital treatment for an injury or was caught in traffic on the 80-mile journey back to his home in Coatbridge, he would run perilously close to his 7pm curfew. And he admits the only game in which McGowan would be able to safely feature is the final-day derby at Tannadice which kicks off at 12.30pm on May 24, but even then he may not be risked. 'Paul McGowan is available for selection but there is no guarantee he will play,' conceded Hartley yesterday. 'He has a curfew and we don't want him to break it. 'This is something I will need to look at between now and the end of the season. And we need to look at all aspects of this - where he is playing, what time he will leave after the match, travelling times and whether he gets an injury. 'There are all sorts of things that could happen. Heavy traffic, or his car could break down, or he could be called in for drug testing - which can often take a long time. 'Paul stays in the central belt so there are times when the journey could take longer than an hour and a half. And the last thing we want to see is Paul getting into trouble because he misses his time zone. 'The last game of the season is definitely one he can play in because of the early kick off. We've not asked (the courts) for any special dispensation. But it's something we might look at.' McGowan has been fitted with an electronic tag on his ankle and, if selected by Hartley, it's understood the match-day referee would need to inspect the device before each game to ensure there are no health and safety risks. Law 4 in the Laws of the Game states: 'A player must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous to himself or another player (including any kind of jewellery).' Hartley said: 'There's been a suggestion that he can't play with the current tag he has got but I am sure he could. I've seen it happen before in English football and it's something we've been looking into. We are just waiting for confirmation.' Meanwhile, Dundee have agreed a pre-contract to sign Aberdeen midfielder Nicky Low on a three-year deal. The 23-year-old had been a peripheral figure at Pittodrie. Dons boss Derek McInnes told the Aberdeen official website: 'The option to sign an extended contract with a fellow Premiership club was one which Nicky felt he couldn't turn down.'

"There is an image of Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola deep in conversation during a Barcelona training session that did the rounds on social media a few years ago. Mourinho was Bobby Robson’s assistant at Barcelona and Guardiola was in his final years as a player at the Camp Nou at the time. The picture became the perfect ‘guess the caption’ competition the best one having Guardiola say to Mourinho: ‘I’ll be Barça coach one day and I’ll win the treble’ and Mourinho replying: ‘yeah right, and I’ll manage Real Madrid.’ Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola in deep conversation following a Barcelona training session . No sooner had Luis Enrique joined Barcelona at the start of this season and the photo libraries threw up an even better shot – one of Luis Enrique, Pep and Jose in their time at Barcelona. Then the archive scanners began to notice something about some of the other faces in the pictures from this era – isn’t that current PSG coach Laurent Blanc? And isn’t that current Porto coach Julen Lopetegui? And aren’t four of the coaches of the last eight in this season’s Champions League from the same club at the same time? (From L-R) Barcelona's Juan Carlos Busquets, Luis Enrique, Mourinho and Guardiola at training . Laurent Blanc comes up against Enrique at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday in the Champions League . Blanc was a huge part of the Barcelona XI that won the Spanish Super Cup under Bobby Robson in 1996 . Luis Enrique comes face to with Blanc in the Parc des Princes stadium on Wednesday night and both will have plenty to catch up on. They were both in the Barça team that started the 1996-97 season by winning the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid 6-4 on aggregate. With Robson in charge and Mourinho’s assisting him the team that won the first silverware of the new season included not just the French World Cup winner and the 62-times Spain international and the aforementioned Lopetegui and Guardiola but Albert Ferrer, who started the season as Cordoba coach; Abelardo Fernandez, who is now coaching Sporting Gijon in Spain’s second tier; and Sergi Barjuan, who has just taken over at Almeria.

Also in the team were Hristo Stoichkov who has coached Celta Vigo and Bulgaria among others and Juan Antonio Pizzi, who managed Valencia last season and is now at Leon in Mexico. Even those players from that team who never went on to manage have stayed in football with Giovanni now working as a scout for Olympiakos and Guillermo Amor a former director of Barcelona’s youth academy who is now director of football at Adelaide United FC. Among the squad players that season were Roberto Prosinecki and Emmanuel Amunike now coach with Azerbaijan and Nigeria’s Under-17s teams respectively.

Enrique travels to Paris to take on Blanc's PSG side at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League . Ahead of his meeting with Blanc on Wednesday, Luis Enrique crossed swords with old friend and former team-mate Sergi Barjuan two weeks ago when Barça played Almeria. “It was the last thing we looked like becoming,” he said when I asked the Barcelona manager if both he and Sergi had looked like coaches-in-waiting in their playing days. “You change the way you look at things once you retire.” Luis Enrique believes those who played in positions where they had the pitch in front of them for most of the game – the full-backs, the centre-backs, Pep Guardiola in holding midfield – went on to coach in part because of how tactically astute they had had to become to be successful in their positions as players.

It’s perhaps more of a surprise that so many attacking players also graduated to the technical area. Some will have got jobs because they played for Barcelona rather than because of all they learned at Barça – it’s the irresistible pull of giving a Barça old boy a job in the hope he will be able to build a side in his former team’s image. But for every failure there has been a success and there is a 50 per cent chance that whoever wins this season’s Champions League, via the coach, Barcelona’s prints will be on the trophy.","Four of Bobby Robson's 1996 squad are still in the Champions League .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has the most difficult job in football, according to West Ham boss Sam Allardyce. City entertain the Hammers at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday with speculation over Pellegrini’s future mounting after a difficult season and a run of six defeats in their last eight games. But Allardyce believes the pressure of going for back-to-back Barclays Premier League titles, plus the introduction of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, have made the Chilean’s job the hardest in world football. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has come under fire following their title race capitulation . West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce believes Pellegrini has the most difficult job in football . ‘The hardest thing to do in the game is win the title back-to-back,’ Allardyce said. ‘It’s hard enough winning it in the first place but going back-to-back has always been that bit more difficult. ‘On the basis of a lot of the conversations I’ve had with Sir Alex (Ferguson) over the years in terms of the motivation of the squad, the hardest part of the job is the season after, to try and do back-to-back victories in a very difficult league. ‘They’ve found it difficult to raise themselves to that level again consistently.’ UEFA imposed a £49million fine on City as well as restrictions on their squad and transfer spending after they failed to comply with the new FFP rules, and Allardyce says the potential sanctions put even more pressure on managers. The champions spent a combined £44m on Porto pair Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando last summer in a move that has been largely unsuccessful – talk that has brought more scrutiny on Pellegrini. ‘Everybody will look at what Financial Fair Play is going to bring to us in the next few years,’ Allardyce said. ‘That’s halting their spending power. ‘We all have to get a bit more shrewd with our spending and the players that we bring in and make fewer mistakes now than ever before because of that financial restriction. The £44m spent on Porto pair Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando last summer has been less than successful . Dejected Manchester City players look on as they are dealt yet another blow in their hunt for the league title . ‘You’ve got to move players out to create funds to help you bring players in and that has obviously made life and the job a little bit more difficult that it was before.’ Asked whether he City should stick with Pellegrini, Allardyce said: ‘Yeah, I do. If he’s proven himself last year, in his first year, then maybe the owners will stick with him and revamp the squad rather than changing him. That’s the way forward. ‘But my only concern is us trying to make life very difficult for them on Sunday and to continue trying to win.’ West Ham are without Diafra Sakho on Sunday with a thigh injury, but Allardyce said he could make it back before the end of the season after it was initially feared he would miss the rest of the campaign. West Ham United striker Diafra Sakho limped out of the draw against Stoke City last weekend .","Sam Allardyce believes Manuel Pellegrini has the toughest job in football .

"Football in Turkey has been suspended for one week following the armed attack on Fenerbahce's team bus on Saturday. Meanwhile, a Turkish official says police have detained two people suspected of involvement in the attack. Trabzon Governor Abdil Celil Oz said the two suspects were detained early on Tuesday and that one of them is believed to have followed the convoy while the other fired shots with a rifle at the bus. The decision to suspend football in Turkey affects both next weekend's Super Lig fixtures and the midweek cup quarter-finals, although Besiktas' match against Istanbul Basaksehir, the last of this weekend's Super Lig matches, is scheduled to go ahead on Monday evening. Fenerbahce's bus came under armed attack as it drove to the airport following an away match at Caykur Rizespor, which Fener won 5-1, in Turkey's Super Lig. Five round marks can be seen on the windscreen of the Fenerbahce team bus after the attack . The window nearest the driver was smashed during the attack on Saturday night . The injured driver, with blood seeping from a head wound, seeks help  after the attack . Fenerbahce on Sunday demanded that football be suspended until the incident was dealt with and the perpetrators punished, and on Monday a one-week suspension was announced by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) following a meeting with sports minister Akif Cagatay Kilic. 'This was a cowardly and treacherous attack,' Kilic said in comments on the TFF website. He added: 'I think it's important to make this response. This was an attack not just on Fenerbahce, but an attack on Turkish sport and Turkish football. I believe we will stand as one against it.' Kilic also wished a speedy recovery to the bus driver, named as Ufuk Kiran, who was injured in the attack. The club had posted several pictures of the bus on their website after the attack which showed a shattered side window and damage to the front windscreen. The pictures also showed blood on the driver's seat and the steering wheel. The attack followed Fener's 5-1 win away to Rizespor. The bus was going over a viaduct on its way from the city of Rize to the airport in Trabzon to return to Istanbul when the incident occurred. Fenerbahce had temporarily gone top of the league with Saturday's win, although Galatasaray returned to the summit on Sunday by beating Karabukspor 4-2, and they sit two points clear with eight matches remaining.

"Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan has revealed what goes through his mind while he's waiting for his opponent to finish at the table - and it's usually whether he will make it to dinner or not. 'The Rocket' is widely regarded as one of the most naturally talented players in history, although he has openly questioned his commitment to the sport during a career that has brought him five World Championship titles. Speaking to Forever Sports magazine, the world No 2 explained how his dedication can be personally tested by slow players, especially if he's feeling hungry. Ronnie O'Sullivan relaxes with a cuppa while waitingfor his turn at the 2015 Dafabet Masters . The world No 2 admits that waiting makes his mind wander to whether he's going to make his dinner or not . O'Sullivan is Forever Sports' May cover star . 'In snooker if you're not at the table, you're sitting in the chair and there's nothing you can do. You can't get to your ball and talk to your caddy and say: ''he's playing a bit slow this f*****g idiot here'',' he said. 'In snooker you have to sit in your chair and watch some f*****g numpty poncing about. Do you know what I mean? You just think to yourself: come on mate. But there's nothing I can do! I can stand up and go: 'look, boom boom boom' but the ref will say: ''sit down Mr O'Sullivan, it's not your shot. Just chill out, man. Wait until he's finished.'' I'm thinking: finished? I wanna get some dinner in. 'Oh s**t mate. They put me on an evening match and I've got some geezer poncing about, I think: I aint gonna get no dinner. Because of him! And I'm starving and I'm thinking: the restaurant shuts at half nine, ten. It's like quarter to nine now and we aint even at the interval. Come on mate. 'And then you think to yourself, come on, well, if you really want it that bad you can have it. Pffft! Good luck to you. But, no, I used to do that quite a lot but now I'm just like, come on, I'll get through this match and the next match won't be so bad.' While waiting to play his next shot may cause O'Sullivan's mind to wander, the 39-year-old doesn't get as worried about making a mistake when he's at the table hunting a 147 maximum.

The five time world champion can cut a bored figure while waiting to play his next shot . 'If you've got one opportunity, and that's all you've got, then you're going to be under pressure; if you thought: this is my one and only chance to win a world title. But I've never thought like that. I've always thought, if I lose this one, I'm gonna win the next one. 'If I don't make the maximum here, there's one round the corner mate, I just know. So I never get under pressure. In fact I thrive on it. I weren't even gonna pot the black on one. I made 140 and thought, you know what: fuck you and your four grand highest break [prize].

"Joe Hart bemoaned one of his 'worst days in a Manchester City shirt' following Sunday's derby thumping by Manchester United. The England number one appeared devastated after the final whistle at Old Trafford and acknowledged that City's bid to retain their Premier League title was over. 'That's one of my worst in a Man City shirt, definitely,' Hart said after a morale-sapping 4-2 defeat saw under-fire Manuel Pellegrini's men go four points adrift of neighbours United and 12 behind runaway leaders Chelsea.

Hart was unable to keep out goals by United's Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling . Manchester City are four points behind rivals United . The 27-year-old has even given up on knocking Arsenal out of second place. 'It's essential to try and finish third,' he added. 'We've got to get our heads down and win these massive games.' City had looked dominant in the early stages, racing into a 1-0 lead that they could have extended before Ashley Young's equaliser triggered a derby demolition. 'Not many teams have put us to the sword like that,' Hart said. 'United know what they are doing, they took their chances. Hart, pictured saluting the travelling City fans, does not understand why his side are struggling for form . 'It's hard to take. We've won enough of them to know how to lose properly though and we weren't good enough after the first 15 minutes.' Hart added that City had let their fans down and revealed he was at a loss to explain a dramatic loss in form since the turn of the year that has seen them take 18 points from a possible 39. 'It would be easier to win games if I knew what was wrong with us but we've played well and been unfortunate in some games,' he said. 'I'm hurting from this defeat. There's a lot of emotion running through me. Let's see how it feels on Monday, we'll think about it and we'll go again.'","Joe Hart conceded four goals in Man City's 4-2 defeat at Old Trafford .

"Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta accepts the fallen champions are facing a battle to finish in the top four. Zabaleta admits confidence is low with Sunday's derby loss at Manchester United having continued a dismal run which has seen City capitulate in the Barclays Premier League title race. Manuel Pellegrini's men crashed 4-2 at Old Trafford, a sixth defeat in eight games in all competitions and a result which leaves them fourth and clinging onto a Champions League place. Wayne Rooney leaps onto Fellaini's back after United take the lead through the big Belgian, who has had an excellent renaissance recently . It is a far cry from the situation on New Year's Day, when the defending champions pulled level with Chelsea at the top with a 3-2 win over Sunderland. Having been eight points behind just over a month earlier, City appeared to be clicking into gear - but all has suddenly gone wrong. They now trail the leaders by 12 points, having played a game more, and their form continues to offer encouragement for the likes of Southampton and Liverpool below them. A dejected Yaya Toure and Fernandinho look on following their defeat to rivals Manchester United . Zabaleta said: 'It is time to analyse what we are doing wrong and try to improve for the next few games. There are still 18 points to play for and we must be honest with ourselves and start to push hard, play better and win games, so we can get in the top four. 'When you lose those games it is always really hard, but that is football sometimes. Football is about momentum. 'It seems you lose confidence when you cannot get results and it was a really tough afternoon.' City were chasing a record fifth successive derby win and the occasion initially seemed to rouse them from their recent troubles as they made a blistering start. Sergio Aguero was the rare highlight in an otherwise dismal Manchester City performance at Old Trafford . Aguero scored twice, but he had very little to cheer about as Manchester City left the Eitihad empty handed . Their movement and energy was superb and they claimed a well-worked opening goal through Sergio Aguero after just eight minutes. But that was as good as it got as United equalised through the excellent Ashley Young and then took complete control. Further goals from the impressive Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling secured a convincing win before Aguero's 100th City goal came as a late consolation. 'It seems we lost confidence and were nervous,' said Zabaleta. 'Then it was hard for the team to react and we conceded the second goal. Manchester City's manager Manuel Pellegrini issues instructions as his side lose to their rivals . All of United's outfield players congratulate celebrate as they score in the derby at Old Trafford on Sunday . 'In the second half we didn't create many chances and when United scored the third goal the game was over.' Winger Jesus Navas was at a loss to explain City's failure to impose themselves after United pulled back level. The Spaniard said: 'I don't really know (what happened). They scored the equaliser and they were back in the game. We started strong but it wasn't our day and we need to focus on the upcoming games. It's Champions League (qualification at stake) so we have to fight until the end to be in the top four.'

"When walking into the backyard of your seaside condo, the only things you would hope to find are the waves lapping at the shore, or a sunset over the ocean. However, one Florida homeowner was shocked to find a nine foot bull shark swimming right past his back door. This incredible video captured the moment the extremely dangerous predator prowled past the property at the north end of Hickory Island, in Bonita Springs. This is the moment a nine foot long bull shark, considered among the deadliest in the world, was captured swimming past a condo back yard on Hikcory Island in Florida . The beast can be seen just under the the water, with its distinctive pectoral fin breaking the surface. Residents in Bonita Springs told NBC-2 that sharks began swimming up to their condos about a week ago, and have been spotted several times since. They say fishermen have been chumming the water - throwing in bait - which has been luring the animals back. Property owners are now asking the city to designate the area for swimming only, which would outlaw fishing there and, they hope, drive the sharks back out to sea. Bull sharks, along with great whites and tiger sharks, are generally considered among the most dangerous sharks in the world, and among the most likely to attack humans. Homeowners say fishermen throwing bait into the water nearby are attracting the predators to their homes, and are calling for fishing to be banned in the area . Adult bull sharks can grow up to 11.5ft long, live up to 16 years in the wild, and along with great whites and tiger sharks, are said to be the most likely species to attack humans . Their natural habitat is the warm, shallow ocean waters around the equator, though they can just as happily swim through freshwater, and are often found hunting far up rivers and estuaries. They will eat almost anything they can kill, including fish, dolphins, seabirds, and other sharks. Humans are not naturally part of their diet, but they have been known to attack out of curiosity. They get their name from their short, stubby noses, aggressive disposition, and tendency to headbutt their prey before biting. According to National Geographic, adults can reach anywhere between 6ft and 11.5ft in length, and can live up to 16 years in the wild. Hickory Island juts out into the sea from mainland Florida and is surrounded on both sides by ocean, meaning sharks are able to swim very close to the houses .","Homeowner in Florida filmed as nine foot bull shark swam behind condo .

"Manchester United's humiliation of their noisy neighbours City at Old Trafford led the club's official website to claim the city was turned red once more in the space of 90 minutes. Yet was this the case? Was that 4-2 win a sign that United are the dominant force in Manchester again, or should we just chalk it off as nothing more than a bad game for the defending champions? City had, after all, beaten United four consecutive times going into the derby, so should the red half of Manchester be so confident sitting four points ahead? Here is Sportsmail's verdict on the issues. Is Manchester red again? Of course not, it is neither red or blue. United’s website declared this to be the case and they will rightly revel in Sunday’s victory for a while. What perhaps best sums up City’s current plight, meanwhile, is that they have been dragged back in to this parochial little squabble at all.

Yet here we are in April with City already being lapped by league leaders Chelsea and United now easing away from them in third. It’s a remarkable state of affairs even if a look at the fixture list does offer City some semblance of hope. United’s next two games are at Chelsea and Everton, and they still have a home fixture with Arsenal and a visit to Crystal Palace to follow. City, on the other hand, have four home games you would expect them to win and away matches at Spurs and Swansea. Can City take maximum points between now and the end of the season? In theory they could but that would take some doing from a team that looks to be on the floor. At the Etihad they spoke of ‘trajectory’ the day they hustled Mark Hughes out of the door in 2009 and it is a word that neatly works to sum up the differences between red and blue. Apr 18 - Chelsea (a) Apr 26 - Everton (a) May 2 - West Brom (h) May 9 - Crystal Palace (a) May 17 - Arsenal (h) May 24 - Hull City (a) Apr 19 - West Ham (h) Apr 25 - Aston Villa (h) May 3 - Tottenham Hotspur (a) May 10 - QPR (h) May 17 - Swansea City (a) May 24 - Southampton (h) United won the battle against City but the war is still ongoing with six Premier League games remaining . United manager Louis van Gaal thanked supporters for their patience after Sunday's victory . Why do United suddenly look like a good team again? Their manager Louis van Gaal has not been too proud to learn from his mistakes. He was the only person in Manchester, for example, who thought that Wayne Rooney was a central midfielder and Ander Herrera a substitute. Eventually he recognised his folly and United have improved. Van Gaal has also had the courage to pick players on form not reputation. This is why we now see Radamel Falcao on the bench, Daley Blind playing ahead of the expensive Luke Shaw – regardless of Shaw’s recent injury – and Juan Mata ahead of Angel di Maria. At times, Van Gaal’s hand has been forced by injuries but his faith in players such as Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia – players whose Old Trafford career looked over during pre-season – has its roots in what he has seen on the training field. In many ways, this United team now resembles his Dutch team of the World Cup. It seems to lack depth and real quality but still it manages to get the job done. Mata runs away in celebration after scoring one of United's four goals against their great rivals City . Rooney, Young and Mata celebrate as they all rightfully earn their first-team places for United . Angel di Maria (third right) and Radamel Falcao (right) were left out of the starting XI by Van Gaal on Sunday . What has been the secret behind the renaissance of players like Ashley Young and Marouane Fellaini? Van Gaal is a coach’s coach who believes in the value of the training ground. A man who swears by systems and training ground drills, the United manager has followed a mantra of ‘repeat, repeat, repeat’ ever since he arrived in Manchester and, at last, it has paid off. In his early days at the club some of the United players worried that their new manager’s love of endless passing drills would eventually bore them to death. Some even thought they were contributing to the squad’s spate of muscle injuries. Over time, however, Van Gaal’s belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like Young, Fellaini and indeed central defender Chris Smalling have particularly benefited. United do not play predictable football but it is a game hung very firmly to a structure. That is one of the reasons why, for example, a back four without a single stellar player has conceded fewer goals than everybody bar Chelsea and Southampton this season. Marouane Fellaini celebrates scoring in this brilliant photograph taken by Sportsmail snapper Ian Hodgson . Young celebrates after bringing United level having earlier trailed against City from the eighth minute . Players once moaned about, such as Fellaini and Young, are now pivotal parts of United's team . Van Gaal’s belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like Young and Fellaini have benefited . Didn't Louis van Gaal consider selling Fellaini last summer? Yes, he did. Oddly, it was only an injury that prevented the Belgian joining Napoli in loan last August but again Van Gaal’s treatment of Fellaini has illustrated the value of flexibility and objectivity when it comes to managing players and teams. Van Gaal certainly has an ego but it isn’t allowed to get in the way of decision making. He began the season convinced that 3-4-1-2 was the way forward for this United team and certainly there would have been no room for Fellaini in that system. But time – not to mention performances – persuaded Van Gaal that there was greater value in other methods. At City, Pellegrini has been rather more stubborn. Over the course of the season the South American has refused to recognise the problems of using Yaya Toure as part of a central midfield pair and indeed the fact that his favoured 4-4-2 system can lead to his side being overrun in the middle of the field against really good teams. Fellaini helped as United tore City apart at Old Trafford to move four points clear of their noisy neighbours . Fellaini has illustrated the value of flexibility and objectivity when it comes to managing players and teams . It was only an injury that prevented Fellaini from joining Napoli in loan last August from United . Should Manuel Pellegrini be worried about his position at City? 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of their last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. Yes, he should. As has been reported here before, City do not wish to sack their manager and it is still highly possible they may not. However, footballers’ body language can undo a manager almost as quickly as results and, from that point of view, the signs were bad for Pellegrini at Old Trafford. For all United’s improvement, they are not a side that should be putting four past the champions but this was a City team seemingly unwilling to run, chase and do the ugly stuff on Sunday and the club’s hierarchy have noticed. It remains fashionable to blame players such as Toure for City’s failings and it seems inevitable the Ivorian will leave this summer. However, when players like David Silva, Pablo Zabaleta and James Milner start to disappear from the battle then you know you have a problem. There was a time when Pellegrini’s level approach to life was viewed as one of his assets but at the moment there are those at City who are beginning to wonder when the Chilean is going impose himself on a dressing room that has sleep walked its way towards calamity in recent weeks. Manuel Pellegrini could be worried about his position at City after losing against their fierce rivals . Segio Aguero, Yaya Toure and James Milner look dejected as they await kick-off after a United goal . Frank Lampard applauds the travelling fans off at Old Trafford as he and goalkeeper Joe Hart leave the pitch . What does the summer hold for both clubs? United will spend heavily on key positions such as central defence and centre forward and also buy a right back. The future, meanwhile, does not look bright for players such as Falcao and Adnan Januzaj. City will also be back in the market, with executives confident that increased revenue from commercial activity and sponsorship will allow them to operate within the constraints of Financial Fair Play and still spend on players such as Paul Pogba from Juventus. Van Gaal’s insistence on a reduced pre-season tour will see travelling kept within reason and it would appear the Dutch coach has won a key battle with the club there. Pellegrini, meanwhile, may wish he had put his own foot down in that area. City will visit Canada, New York and one other venue on a post-season trip – though there will be no actual game in NYC – while a pre-season venture to Australia and Indonesia looks set to total somewhere in the region of 21 days. In this area, the two men are different. Van Gaal – not without his own flaws – has developed in to a manager of his football club in a way, for example, that David Moyes never did. Pellegrini, for his part, remains a head coach. Falcao came on as a second-half substitute for Fellaini at Old Trafford against City .

"Carl Frampton has branded Eddie Hearn's £1.5million offer to fight Scott Quigg as little more than a 'publicity stunt'. Hearn made the offer live on television on Tuesday after talks between him and Frampton’s promoter Barry McGuigan had stalled. But Belfast's IBF super-bantamweight world champion has called on the Matchroom chief to make him a more realistic offer. Super-bantamweight world champion Carl Frampton (left) has dismissed a fight offer from Scott Quigg . Quigg (right) offered £1.5m to Frampton for a British super-fight, via his promoter Eddie Hearn . 'It’s the biggest publicity stunt I’ve seen since that incident between Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson at Superbowl XXXVIII (when Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Timberlake),' Frampton wrote in his News Letter column. '[It] is undoubtedly a lot of money. But does that mean I should snap it up with both hands? 'Absolutely not, and there are a number of reasons why. 'It’s a flat rate offer, which means that no matter how well this fight does at the box office, this is the most I’ll receive. 'If pay-per-view targets are reached this fight can bring in £10million and potentially as much as £12m. 'So please, the next time you make an offer, make it a realistic one.' Quigg showed off a £1.5m cheque ready to hand to Frampton on Sky Sports earlier this week . But Frampton has branded the gesture a 'publicity stunt' and ridiculed the offer . Hearn was quick to respond on Twitter, saying: '[The] fact is we are putting offers on the table and you aren't! If the offer is that bad then make us one? 'Also, if it makes as much money as you stated in your link, why have you also turned down 60-40 for the winner?'

"The Aboriginal teenager who was arrested after anti-terror raids in Melbourne on Saturday has complained he was a victim of police brutality. Eathan Cruse, 19, one of the five men taken into custody after raids on Saturday morning, said officers assaulted him after he had been handcuffed. 'He grabbed me, handcuffs me, is like 'What's your name?'... and I said Eathan,' the man told Nine News. Scroll down for video . Eathan Cruse, 19, one of the five men taken into custody after raids on Saturday morning, said officers assaulted him after he had been handcuffed . 'He said 'yeah, that's the one'... he kicks me right across the face as my hands were cuffed.' Eathan was released later in the day. His father, Glen, also said he was brutally attacked by police during the raid, and  his son was hospitalised as a result of injuries he sustained.

"Clearly baffled and obviously just the tiniest bit irked, Alan Stubbs simply didn’t know what to make of Peter Houston. Or, more accurately, the Falkirk manager’s sudden escalation of post-match comments into an all-out conflict. Back-track or snap right back at him? Stress the good intentions and best wishes he feels towards Falkirk, or defend his team against the insinuation that they’re a bunch of weak-willed tippy-tap merchants who can’t defend crosses? In the space of 10 minutes on Monday, the Hibs boss did placatory – ‘I have a lot of respect for Peter and what he’s done’ – and followed it with accusatory, as in ‘I think you need to ask Peter what he said when he came into my office after we got beat 1-0 in the first game; it certainly was not what he said in the press (on Saturday).’ Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs did not know what to make of Peter Houston's recent post-match comments . However you choose to interpret everything Stubbs said both on Saturday *and* after reading Houston’s sharp response, a lot of people will be watching their next meeting – Falkirk host Hibs on the last day of the Championship season, inevitably enough – for signs of enmity. ‘It’s funny the way football works,’ said the Hibs manager, looking ahead to that crucial fixture on Saturday week. ‘People will make something of it and what has happened. But, for someone who is so inexperienced, I am not soft. ‘My comments are never made to disrespect people. I honestly thought, with our performance, that we played well enough to be in the final. I don’t see anything that is wrong with that. ‘Everyone in the press conference room after felt we played well but listen, the facts of the matter are that we’re not in the final. What happened as well, everyone in that press conference witnessed me saying good luck to Falkirk, I didn’t see that come out. ‘I wished Falkirk all the best and good luck in the final but Peter’s made his comments. He’s a really experienced manager, one that I respect and I’ll take his comments on board about how he scores against us. I’m obviously learning, this is my first season but I’m not doing too bad. ‘A lack of respect? Not at all, it was my honest opinion that I felt we had done enough in the game to get into the final. I don’t think anyone would deny that or say I was talking gibberish. ‘Our goals-for is the third best in the table, our goals-against is the second best in the table. We have a goal difference that is 27 better than Falkirk’s. When you put that up against a real experienced manager and me being a novice, then I’m doing okay.’ Stubbs and Falkirk manager Peter Houston shake hands before the match at Hampden Park . You see? Amid the attempts to play down any ill will, Stubbs can’t help himself. Houston’s jibe about his Falkirk team scoring all of their goals against Hibs from crosses clearly struck a nerve. Does he have a point? ‘I need to be careful what I say here,’ said Stubbs, who takes his team to Livingston for yet another crucial Championship game tomorrow night. ‘I think we all concede goals from crosses. I think if Peter looks at his own team here, they have conceded a lot of goals from crosses as well. ‘Whether it is crosses or open play, that’s football. You score goals in different ways. We have scored more than most this season and I won’t change. But I will take his comments on board. ‘It is up to Peter if he wants to state that. I did not say anything about Peter’s team. It’s up to Peter. ‘Our relationship in general has been very good. I don’t see why it should change. We are emotional. You say things after games in the heat of the moment, more so now with the Press and TV, when you have a microphone stuck under you straightaway. The Falkirk players celebrate taking the lead against Hibernian in the Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden Park . ‘I won’t change. I still have a lot of respect for Peter and what he has done. He has done a really good job at Falkirk, so no complaints. I don’t think I have said anything different to what most manager say every weekend.’ Despite scoring 60 league goals in 33 games, there have been a number of days when Hibs have felt profligate. Forever wanting to walk the ball in, as their critics would put it, rather than simply having a dig. Insisting he has no concerns despite Saturday’s loss, Stubbs said: ‘When you play like that, more often than not you are going to win games of football. You don’t rely on a bit of luck because you are performing well. ‘I will take the team playing like that every day of the week because I know they will win games of football. On Saturday it just was not to be, that’s cup football. Sometimes it goes in your favour, sometimes it doesn’t. Saturday was one of those times when it didn’t go in our favour. ‘On Saturday, I felt momentum building. Scott Allan was top drawer for a period in the second half. He nearly won it by himself. That is why we are disappointed, players like that, you’d like to see them in showcase finals, to show their talents. But it was not to be. They will have another opportunity.’","Alan Stubbs felt Hibernian did enough to reach Scottish Cup final .

"Andy Lee will be onto a winner no matter what happens on Saturday night. The 30-year-old arrived in New York on a crest of a wave, a newly crowned world champion eager to lap up the first defence of the title he won so superbly before Christmas. And his future took the most unexpected of twists on Friday night after American Peter Quillin, the undefeated former WBO middleweight champion, failed to make required 160 lbs weight ensuring the battle at the Barclays Center will have no title on the line. Andy Lee (left) lines up with (L-R) Danny Garcia, Lamont Peterson and his opponent Peter Quillin in New York . Lee's bout on Saturday will no longer be a title fight after Quillin failed to make the 160lb weight . Lee was hoping to make his first defence of the WBO middleweight title he won against Matt Korobov last year . Lee works out with trainer Adam Booth at the Barclays Centre ahead of his showdown with Quillin . Quillin says he has faced struggles his whole life and that this fight will just be the latest in a long line . Quillin, who had been out for a year, initially hit the scales at 161.9 and despite a quick run and hope session on the treadmill saw him register 160.6, it was not enough. Naturally, the Irishman still wants to impress, especially with the event screened live on US TV to an expected audience of millions. Yet when the bells goes, he knows nothing can destroy his own title dream. 'He came back onto the scales and in the end it was just too much for him to lose, ' said trainer Adam Booth. 'You can lose three pounds in a short space of time but it didn't happen. Andy still has to go out and do a job. 'I think he knew he wasn't going to make the weight but he still tried. He lost 0.8 of a pound knowing that he wasn't going to make it. He tried his arse off. 'He couldn't make it. That's not our problem. All Andy can do is his job. And his job is to make weight professionally. To be fit, strong and ready for everything that can happen in this fight – and he is.' 'I am still happy that I can fight Andy but it is disappointing,' added a dejected Quillin who had not fought for a year after vacating his belt to tend to his dying uncle, a factor which clearly worked against him when aiming to reach the desired fighting weight. 'I didn't want to let down any of my fans or family who wanted me to get my title back. This won't effect my confidence. Nothing will break me and I will always stay in the eye of the storm.' The Irishman took his world title chance by beating Korobov for the WBO middleweight title . The 30-year-old admits he may have retired from boxing had he not beaten John Jackson in June last year . Lee celebrates his world title win in December . Providing Lee comes through unscathed, London's Billy Joe Saunders is the mandatory challenger - while a lucrative fight against Puerto Rico legend Miguel Cotto is also a potential option. It was two hours of unexpected drama but no matter – it simply means Lee has even longer to bask in the spotlight. What a difference 10 months makes. Last summer 30 year-old Irishman was struggling to get a shot at the big time. The end of his career was lurching into view. Trainer Booth sat the man from Limerick down and laid it on the line. If John Jackson wasn't beaten, and beaten well, it could have been time to call it a day. Not only was Jackson superbly put to the sword, he then went on to scoop the big one. A brilliant flurry of right hands in Las Vegas before Christmas sent the previously unbeaten Matt Korobov crashing and the new WBO middleweight champion of the world was crowned. It was just desserts for an underrated fighter who chiseled his inner grit, strength and dynamism on the mean streets of Detroit under the legendary guidance of Emanuel Steward in his famous Kronk gym. On Saturday comes the chance to take another huge bite out of the Big Apple and back up promoter Lou Di Bella's claims that the Irish warrior is a superstar in the making. Quillin, who boasts a record of 31-0 with 22 ko's says his 12 months out of competitive action have seen him adopt a new found freshness and desire which should ensure one hell of a tussle at what should be a rocking Barclays Center in Brooklyn. There is a permanent glint in his eye. Lee, though, is ready. 'Kid Chocalate' Quillin (left), pictured with Gabriel Rosado, has not been beaten in 31 professional fights . Lee's next fight could be a lucrative contest against legendary Puerto Rican Miguel Cotto (right) 'I have lived and fought in the US for years so this holds absolutely no fears for me. Some fighters from the UK may look at coming to the States and be thinking what a big platform it is and that could weigh on their mind,' he said. 'I don't have those problems. Detroit was a tough school to learn my trade. The gym was a 'kill or be killed atmosphere.' There was no regard for reputation and you had to prove yourself every day. 'I have fought in tough gyms before but this was the toughest. It's not just about the technical aspects, people there are trying to knock your head off. 'I was the King of the gym but it has helped me become the fighter I am. There would be young lads ready to have a go but I took it all. Competition like that breeds success. 'I am sure he has trained well but activity is an important thing for a fighter and could be a factor. I am not banking on him being rusty but when you are fighting and making weight regularly, everything comes more naturally. Being as active as I have been is an advantage for me. 'If it hadn't gone to plan against Jackson we would have had to make some tough decisions. Boxing is a hard game and it's tough way to make a living. I am so proud to be an Irishman from Limerick defending my title in New York City. 'It doesn't get much better than this.' Trainer Booth (right) has been holed up with Lee in Monte Carlo ahead of the big fight on Saturday . Holing up with Booth in Monte Carlo has got Lee in tune for the biggest night of his life. 'Looking back, did I think it was going to happen for him ? No,' admitted the man who helped David Haye become world champion. 'I knew he would be able to win a title but it's whether or not that opportunity would have ever come up. 'The pressure of him achieving something has been lifted and he's expressing himself like never before. It's a joy to watch.","Andy Lee was set to defend his middleweight title against Peter Quillin .

The home favourite also picked up the vacant WBC International title which should improve his current ranking as he chases a world title shot within the next 12 months. Tubieron fought for the same belt last December when he drew with Carlo Magali and the Filipino's record of 19 wins from 24 fights suggested he would struggle against Warrington who is now unbeaten in 21 contests. The 24-year-old has been billed as the next Ricky Hatton due to his impressive fan base . Warrington admitted he was bored by the end of his fight against Dennis Tubieron (right) Tubieron, a year older than his opponent, had previously boxed at both bantamweight and lightweight before opting to settle for the division in between. And he was certainly the smaller man in the ring as Warrington made a fast start, picking the visitor off with punches to both head and body. Tubieron had previously been stopped twice and was content to fight on the back foot, his face marking up in the second round although the Filipino did attempt to mount a response. He briefly threatened midway through the third session with his first sustained attack but Warrington finished the stronger. Tubieron of the Philippines looks to land a punch during the bout at the First Direct Arena in Leeds . After an even fourth, Tubieron stepped on the accelerator in the fifth before Warrington fought back. Bizarrely, the bell to end the stanza did not ring until four minutes had passed, allowing the home favourite to drive home his advantage. Tubieron looked exhausted as he retreated to his corner but was given a brief break in the sixth round when a beach ball thrown from the crowd interrupted the action. The timekeeper then stopped the action almost 60 seconds early, attempting to rectify his earlier mistake. Judges awarded Warrington a landslide victory by scores of 119-109 twice and and 119-110 . Tubieron looked ready to fold several times during the seventh and eighth rounds before showing remarkable heart to find a response. If there has been a criticism of Warrington's career to date it is that he lacks the power needed at the top level and despite throwing everything at Tubieron, the Filipino was still standing at the start of the penultimate round. And he deservedly heard the final bell as Warrington failed to deliver the stoppage in the last session before the judges awarded him a landslide victory by scores of 119-109 twice and and 119-110.

"Australian Olympian Jana Pittman is believed to have given birth to her second child just days after a video surfaced of the elite athlete training while eight months pregnant. The two-time world champion hurdler has been congratulated by the official Australian Olympic team's Twitter, and Pittman's former agency PACE Sports Management has also offered congratulations on the new addition. Pittman's seven-year-old son Cornelis is now the big brother of a little girl named Emily, who was introduced to her mother's athletic ability while still in the womb. Australian Olympian Jana Pittman is believed to have given birth to her second child, a daughter named Emily . The two-time world champion hurdler has been congratulated by the official Australian Olympic team's Twitter . Footage of the heavily pregnant hurdler showed Pittman doing a training run on Sunday, just a day before going into labour, reported 9news. Emily was  born at a healthy 3.1 kilograms on Monday, reported The Brisbane Times. The 32-year-old plans to compete in both the Beijing World Championships and the 2016 Rio Olympics, which means that she was chose to incorporate training into her pregnancy right up until the final trimester. Pittman continued to train while she was pregnant with Cornelis, and won her second world title for hurdles seven months after he was born in 2006. The athlete's coach, Mike Hurst, said that Pittman trained every second day and was careful to monitor her core temperature throughout her training program. The 32-year-old was filmed training for the 2016 Rio Olympics the day before she went into labour . The 32-year-old plans to compete in both the Beijing World Championships and the 2016 Rio Olympics . 'Jana said when she came to train that she wanted to go to Rio and she was trying to get pregnant. That was the plan from the outset and that was how she has managed it,' he told The Brisbane Times. 'Jana is a two-time world champion and she is doing third-year medicine and one of her interests is in obstetrics. She has been very careful in how she has managed her training.' 'She also knew her body and said some days she could not train,' Mr Hurst said. Pittman's new daughter was conceived with an IVF donor, and opened up about her second child to Woman's Day, telling the publication this week that she feels 'extraordinarily lucky.' 'I can't wait to meet my baby girl, she's my little miracle!' She turned to IVF to conceive her second child, falling pregnant with an anonymous sperm donor, before she met her current partner James Gurr. According to her website , Jana's 'success key' is her son Cornelis (right), who she says changed her life .

"Late-sleeping Lilly Pulitzer fans found out the hard way that if you snooze, you lose - literally - when Target's complete stock of Lilly Pulitzer merchandise sold out almost immediately early Sunday morning. The 250-piece collaboration - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. Now officially sold out by the retailer, pieces from the diffusion line have popped up on eBay - but those cruising the bidding site shouldn't expect to see the same original low prices paid by Target customers. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . Luckily for more patient shoppers who are looking for a second shot at buying from the preppy line, the outrageously-priced items that first became available on eBay have since been joined by more reasonably-priced pieces. Speedy re-sellers started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . The thousands of pieces available on eBay aren't just from buyers unhappy with their purchases, however. In fact, many re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of re-selling them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party . But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. While Target won't be restocking the limited-edition collection, customers who refuse to shell out more than the retail value still have a shot at scoring Lilly Pulitzer pieces at low prices: Target has instated a 14-day return policy for the line, meaning rejected items will start popping back up in stores within the next two weeks.","The designer diffusion line went on sale Sunday morning but was nearly sold out online before noon, with stores selling out minutes after opening .

"Diego Simeone has admitted his surprise at the fact there are no English clubs left in Europe as he prepares Atletico Madrid for their Champions League quarter-final second leg. The are no Premier League clubs in the last eight of the competition after Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City were eliminated at the last 16 stage, while Everton were dumped out of the Europa League in the previous round. And Simeone, who takes his side to the Bernabeu to face local rivals Real Madrid on Wednesday, believes the failure of English clubs in Europe this season should kick the country's top-flight into gear. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has admitted his surprise at the plight of English clubs in Europe . Chelsea's players look dejected during their costly draw at home to Paris Saint-Germain last month . Barcelona's Luis Suarez beats Joe Hart during his side's 2-1 win against Manchester City at the Etihad . Click here to read Simeone's column in full . In an exclusive column for goal.com, Simeone wrote: 'I am surprised there are no English clubs left in the Champions League - English football has enormous potential with its footballers and also its financial clout. 'The fact that there is no English team left in the last eight of the Champions League or in the Europa League is a wake-up call for the Premier League to look at why it is that, despite their great economic power and with all the many great footballers playing in England, Chelsea are so far ahead of everyone else and why they have no teams left in Europe.' Despite his shock at the plight of Premier League clubs in the Champions League this term, Simeone believes that Spain is still home to the two best teams in Europe. La Liga leaders Barcelona are on the verge of reaching the semi-finals after a 3-1 win at Paris Saint-Germain last week, while Real have home advantage against Atletico following a 0-0 draw at the Vicente Calderon. Arsenal's Mesut Ozil sits on the turf after his side's last 16 Champions League exit at the hands of Monaco . Simeone believes his side will face one of Europe's top two teams when they take on Real Madrid . Beating Barca to the title last season was harder than winning the Champions League, according to Simeone . Simeone added: 'I believe there are many great players in the Premier League and the financial conditions allow a number of teams to bring in top talents. That said, the Spanish league still has the two best teams: Real Madrid and Barcelona. 'So for us at Atletico, we are competing against two teams with the obligation of winning the Champions League. At the very least, Madrid and Barcelona are among the last eight in Europe every season and usually the last four, so for Atletico to win La Liga last season was a tremendous achievement.' Atletico will fancy their chances in Wednesday's second leg after stopping Carlo Ancelotti's side from scoring a potentially vital away goal in last week's opener. The hosts will be without the injured trio of Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Luka Modric, while Marcelo is suspended after being booked in the first leg. Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid drew 0-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final .

"FC United of Manchester, the club set up in protest at the Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United, are now two promotions away from the Football League. On an emotional night in front of 3,588 noisy fans the Rebels, soon to celebrate their 10th anniversary, sealed the fourth promotion of their short history with this nervy win over Stourbridge saw them crowned Evo-Stik Northern Premier champions. Hundreds of ecstatic supporters invaded the pitch at the final whistle as the breakaway outfit secured elevation to the sixth tier after the heartbreak of no less than four play-off defeats. VIDEO Scroll down to see pitch invasion as FC United of Manchester win Evo-Stik North title . FC United of Manchester players celebrate securing promotion following a 1-0 win over Stourbidge . The club's fourth promotion in their short history sees them come within two more of the Football League . FC will move to a new 5,000 capacity stadium of their own in May, ending a nomadic existence spent entirely on the road. And it was the Tameside Stadium, home of neighbours Curzon Ashton, that hosted the latest chapter in an already significant history. In a tense first-half winger Craig Lindfield, a building estimator, headed against the bar as the home side struggled to break down a resolute Stourbridge defence. And it appeared not to be their night when sub Shelton Payne had a volley cleared off the line. But on 69 minutes student and full back Greg Daniels rose unmarked to head home the impressive Lindfield's cross and spark joyous scenes. It was the perfect finish from the former Macclesfield apprentice who was last week painting houses while on holiday from university. FC came into existence in 2005 when a group of United supporters, despairing of the debt-burdening Old Trafford takeover by the US-based family, decided enough was enough and created their own democratically-run club which kicked off at the bottom of the pyramid in North West Counties Division Two. From an initial meeting of a dozen at a curry house in the Rusholme district of Manchester they now boast more than 4,000 members, each of whom can claim to be an owners. Many of those were in fine voice here. Meanwhile, 30 miles down the road the Class of '92's Salford City celebrated promotion from the Evo-Stik Division One after title rivals Darlington 1883 could only draw 1-1 at Warrington Town. That result means the club, partly owned by United legends Phil and Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, were crowned champions in the high-profile quintet's first season at the helm. FC United manager Karl Marginson, who has been with the club since day one, believes 'anything is possible'. 'We've got a ground of our own,' he said, before a fan planted a kiss on his cheek. 'There's no reason why the league is not possible. We have to provide that for these supporters because they deserve it.' Marginson admits he did not know what to expect when he took over the fledgling club. 'I didn't know what to think,' he said. 'I didn't have a clue. But it's something I'm immensely proud of. It's something we have to hold onto.' Fans storm the pitch as the breakaway outfit celebrates a significant moment in their short history . When asked how he was going to celebrate Marginson added: 'I'm going to go to the Nag's Head if it's open when I get home.' General Manager Andy Walsh, who has also been with FC from the beginning, echoed his manager's comments. 'We will assess where we are going to go,' he said. 'We're not in a hurry and we've always been about building for the long-term. This is a football club that is built on the ambitions and beliefs of its supporters. 'I think the Football League is very possible. We have a manager and coaching staff that have shown they can challenge. I firmly believe they can manage and coach in the Football League and I hope it's with us.' Players carry a champions banner across the pitch as the club sets their sights on the big-time .","FC United of Manchester was set up as a club in protest of the Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United .

"Real Madrid's last win against Atletico Madrid came in the Champions League final less than a year ago, but in the time since that memorable night in Lisbon Carlo Ancelotti's side have failed to win any of their last seven games against their city rivals. Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final second leg will be the eighth time the two teams have met since last season's final, with Diego Simeone's men emerging victorious on four occasions over the previous eight months. Real needed a late equaliser from Sergio Ramos and extra-time to beat Atleti at Benfica's Estadio da Luz in May last year but Los Rojiblancos have gained a measure of revenge since. Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't find the back of the net as Real Madrid drew 0-0 with Atletico Madrid last week . Gareth Bale scores in extra-time during Real's Champions League final win against Atletico last season . Real Madrid have not beaten rivals Atletico since victory in Lisbon, losing four games and drawing three . Real Madrid wins - 0 . Atletico Madrid wins - 4 . Draws - 3 . Real Madrid goals - 4 . Atletico Madrid goals - 12 . Atletico's dominance began with victory in the Spanish Super Cup, a two-legged tie played between the winners of La Liga and the Copa del Rey. A late equaliser from Raul Garcia cancelled out James Rodriguez's opener at the Bernabeu before Mario Manduzkic netted the only goal of the game at the Vicente Calderon to seal a 2-1 win on aggregate. Less than a month later and Simeone's men were at it again, this time defeating Los Blancos in their own backyard in La Liga. A penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo got the hosts level after Tiago's early header but Arda Turan popped up in the 76th minute to sweep the ball past Iker Casillas and secure a 2-1 triumph. Atletico's third win against Real this season arrived in January when the two sides met in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey. With the first leg on home soil, Fernando Torres made a winning return to his boyhood club as he helped the hosts earn a 2-0 win courtesy of goals from Garcia and Jose Maria Gimenez. Arda Turan (left) and Raul Garcia (right) celebrate after scoring winning goals against Real Madrid . Fernando Torres scores his second goal during Atletico's 2-2 draw with Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey . Atleti finished the job at the Bernabeu with goals in the first minute of each half from Torres helping them to a 2-2 draw on the night and 4-2 victory on aggregate. Real's most humiliating result in their seven-game winless streak arrived at the Vicente Calderon on February 7 as Gareth Bale and Co suffered their heaviest defeat in over four years. Goals from Tiago, Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann and Mandzukic earned the reigning champions a 4-0 win to maintain their hopes of a second consecutive title. The two sides played out a goalless draw in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final last week, with Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak widely praised for denying Real a crucial away goal.

"Diego Simeone is made for England. Though his collapse under the weight of a mere brush with David Beckham’s boot in 1998 saw him characterised as the antithesis of Anglo-Saxon values, he is, in reality, more English than the English. For that night in St Etienne - almost the last time an England team truly thrilled a global audience at the World Cup, even if they did so in defeat – is remembered by Simeone for more than his notorious role in Beckham’s sending off, which left England down to ten men for most of the match. 'That game was the best international match I've played in,' said Simeone, remembering the World Cup knock out match, which Argentina won on penalties after a 2-2 draw. Given that he played 106 times for his country that is some compliment. Diego Simeone is hoping to lead Atletico Madrid to second successive Champions League final . England's David Beckham kicks out at former midfielder midfielder Simeone during the 1998 World Cup . 'I love playing against the English,’ Simeone added. ‘They're so passionate, so aggressive, so committed. They were incredible that night. Alan Shearer and Paul Ince were extraordinary. At times it seemed Shearer was fighting us on his own. You have to remember they played for 70 minutes with 10 men.’ And as Simeone stalked out on to the pitch at the end of the Champions League final last year, in full confrontational mode, seeking out Raphael Varane, who had kicked the ball at the Atletico bench in celebration of Real Madrid’s 4-1 win, it was hard to not to get the image of the warrior footballer out of your head. There is much more to Simeone than that of course. He had come within two minutes of winning that Champions League final on a wage bill which was famously less than QPR’s. Since that defeat, he has exacted his revenge at every turn. Real Madrid were beaten in the Spanish Super Cup over two legs, then knocked out of the Copa del Rey, also over two legs, by Atletico, beaten at the Bernebeu and then, most spectacularly , beaten 4-0 at the Vicente Calderon last February. Beckham looks towards the referee during the World Cup clash between England and Argentina . The former England man was shown a red card for lashing out at Simeone during the knock-out match . Last week the teams drew 0-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final; on Wednesday they resume hostilities at the Bernebeu. Real may be marginal favourites but under Simeone, Atletico have gone from the side that could never beat Real Madrid – they hadn’t won for 14 years against them – to the side that (almost) never loses to them. What is always unclear to outside observers is how the man famed for his confrontations and aggression became one of the most tactically astute coaches in Europe. Of course, he always had leadership qualities and undeniable charisma. In his native Argentina they always assumed he would be a manager, such was his dominance of the national team as a captain. But his early results were very mixed. He looked innovative and the man to watch at Estudiantes, where he was one of the first to use motivational video clips from films to inspire his players. It worked: they chased down Boca Juniors for the league title even if he was, in those days, criticised for being overly focused on attacking players. At River Plate though, it looked as if fighting talk and charisma only got you so far. He finished bottom of the league and had to resign. The Atleti boss confronts Raphael Varane during Real Madrid's 4-1 Champions League final win last year . Simeone speaks to referee Bjorn Kuipers during the showpiece final at the Estadio da Luz . He revived his reputation somewhat at Catania and Racing but when he was given the Atletico job in 2011, it seemed more like the old boys’ network at work – he was an iconic player there in the 1990s – than the result of a meticulous recruitment process scouring the best tactical minds in Europe . Of course, the success has been unrelenting, with a trophy every year: the Europa League in 2012; the Copa Del Rey in 2013, beating Jose Mourinho’s Real in the final; and the extraordinary feat of wining La Liga ahead of Barca and Real last season. This year he is comfortably-placed for another Champions League spot but the title is out of the question. Carlo Ancelotti though is right to be nervous ahead of Wednesday’s quarter final. If there were a team for the big occasion, it is Simeone’s Atletico. The 44-year-old got the better of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho during his side's 3-1 victory at Stamford Bridge . He makes a habit of out-witting Europe’s best minds. It isn’t just Ancelotti who has been his victim. Mourinho, too, back in that 2013 cup final and then again last season, when Atletico stunned Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Having brought the game back to 1-1 and being ahead on away goals, you might have expected Simeon’s side to sit back. But they came out for the second half pressing even harder, pushing forwards whenever they could. In effect, Simone did precisely what the opposition least expected and were rewarded with a 3-1 win. And yet there is something very English about Simeone’s style. It’s not just the frequent use of 4-4-2, the wide men, the directness of their play at time and the physicality - it’s their fighting spirit which characterises them and which might be stamped: ‘Made in England.’ It’s why Simeone so related to Shearer and Ince and their performance in that extraordinary 2-2 draw in St Etienne. Ince, Shearer, Simeone; they’re all cast from the same mould. The Argentine manager is understandably adored by the Atletico faithful despite his team's combative style . The Atletico players circle around Simeone as they prepare for the Champions League clash against Madrid . He’s not about to move, having just signed a new contract with Atletico until 2020 and we may never see him in the Premier League. The problem for Simone is that his English values are no longer fashionable in England. When Manchester City choose a new manager, it will be someone who can help to bring tiki taka football to the club, from academy to the first team, under the direction of Txiki Begiristain. When Arsenal appoint, pretty football rather than fighting spirit are likely to be high up the agenda of the new coach. Manchester United, now establishment, might baulk at a street fighter as manager, though they had one once before and he didn’t do so badly. He would be adored at Liverpool, but it would be another gear change from the Brendan Rodgers style that the club has embraced. Chelsea, too, though falling back on Mourinho, also have had the Barcelona model in mind and are thought to be unimpressed with Simeone. Maybe he has simply made too many enemies over the years. But Simeone is useful antidote to those who think English football’s traditional strengths have no place in the modern game. Perhaps he’s just become too English for the new England .

Simeone is tossed  in the air by his players as they celebrate their Spanish league title last season .","Diego Simeone has worked wonders with La Liga side Atletico Madrid .

Victory for the current holders could prove to be a good omen. If Arsenal triumph at Wembley again this year they would become the most successful side in FA Cup history, surpassing the record of 11 wins they currently share with Manchester United.

"Punched, elbowed, apparently bitten. Just another night for an Atletico Madrid striker. Yet this was not Diego Costa circa 2010 to 2014. This was Mario Mandzukic involved in bust-up after bust-up as he shed blood and sweat against great rivals Real Madrid at the Vicente Calderon. When Atletico allowed Costa to sign for Chelsea on July 1, 2014, Diego Simeone may have fretted about losing his street fighter. Not for long, however. Just nine days later, he bought Mandzukic from Bayern Munich, and the Croatia international looked every bit as aggressive on Tuesday night. Blood pours from Mario Mandzukic's face during the Champions League quarter-final first leg in Madrid . Sergio Ramos and Atletico Madrid striker Mandzukic continually clashed on Tuesday night during the tie . Mandzukic proved he is a warrior with his performance against Real Madrid, just as Diego Costa was . Costa gives John Terry, who is now his Chelsea team-mate, a stern look during a Champions League tie . Nobody elbowed their way to the top quite like Costa – from the streets of Brazil, to Spain, to England – and the same went for Mandzukic in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. The 28-year-old came to blows with defenders Sergio Ramos and Dani Carvajal  – drawing blood after an elbow to the face from the former, while receiving a punch, and possibly a bite, from the latter. ITV pundit Paul Scholes said Mandzukic 'made a meal of things' yet the evidence was there for all to see, pouring down his face. Round two awaits at the Bernabeu next week. Yet Mandzukic was as culpable as he was the victim. He committed seven fouls, compared to 11 in total by Real Madrid, and it was more than any player has managed in a Champions League game against the winners of La Decima before. The long-ball tactic by Atletico was not working, nor did Mandzukic have enough pace to beat a defence boasting Raphael Varane. He had zero shots on or off target, completed just 18 passes over 90 minutes, and lacked the pace and darting runs Costa delivers. Yet this was about playing rough, rather than scoring goals, and he played the role of warrior to perfection. So much so that Simeone – albeit riskily – substituted his partner, Antoine Griezmann, after 77 minutes instead of the man on thin ice. Mandzukic clashed with Dani Carvajal during the quarter-final first leg and played rough all night . Mandzukic's heat map, who had zero shots on or off target, and completed just 18 passes over 90 minutes . Mandzukic, despite failing to conjure a chance on Tuesday night, is a natural striker. His CV includes Dinamo Zagreb, Wolfsburg and Bayern Munich, and he was imposing at every club. Fifty-six goals in 132 appearances in Croatia's Prva HNL. Fifty-three  in 110  in Germany's Bundesliga. All that added to Simeone feeling Mandzukic was next in line at a forward-thinking club that have a history of great strikers which stretches back decades. No sooner had Fernando Torres left in 2007 for Liverpool, for example, than El Nino was replaced. Sergio Aguero turned up, alongside Diego Forlan, and Torres was old news. Aguero was deemed irreplaceable, until those in Madrid were introduced to Radamel Falcao the same year Kun left. Then, when Falcao left for Monaco in 2013, it was Costa's turn, and so on. Sergio Aguero signed for Atletico in 2006 and scored 74 goals in 175 appearances in La Liga in five years . Radamel Falcao kept up an impressive 0.76 goals-to-game ratio during his time with Atletico from 2011 . Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink proved a great striker for Atletico as the club produce top forwards continually . No sooner had Fernando Torres left in 2007 for Liverpool than El Nino was replaced at Vicente Caldero . Mandzukic's tattoo on his lower back was on show, and it read: 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' Trouble for the striker is his ink – written in Hebrew – is backwards AND has grammatical mistakes so makes no sense! The Spanish club don't fret losing a striker. They regroup, consider it a temporary inconvenience, and buy a replacement. They have been doing so ever since Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in 1999, and Christian Vieri the year before, and even further still. It's the Atletico way. It is not unlike what has happened with goalkeepers at the club. David de Gea left in 2011 and was replaced by Thibaut Courtois, only for the previously-anonymous Jan Oblak to take over this year. Much like their record with strikers, it looks inspired, as the 22-year-old who cost €16million (£11.5m) thwarted Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and James Rodriguez almost single-handedly. And so when Simeone lost Costa to Chelsea, he signed Antoine Griezmann and Mandzukic. And if the latter's showing against Real is anything to go by, then the Atletico manager bought just about the closest thing he could find to replace the Barclays Premier League's joint-top goalscorer. Mandzukic and Ramos exchange words during a heated battle between the Madrid rivals on Tuesday night .

"Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon has long been a fortress with no team scoring there in the Champions League for 663 minutes. Last season the now Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was the reason for that but now the man keeping the clean sheets is Jan Oblak. Sportsmail looks at the 22-year-old who has made Atletico fans forget about Courtois... and David De Gea. No one knew too much about him last season outside of Portugal and Slovenia so was it a gamble? You only have to look at his price tag to see how highly-rated he was. He cost €16million (£11.5m) and that is a La Liga record for a goalkeeper. The 22-year-old was already Slovenia's number one when he left Benfica for Madrid in the summer. With experienced goalkeepers such as Petr Cech and Pepe Reina potentially available, going for a young relatively untried keeper looked a gamble but he already looks to have been money well spent. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes . Oblak gets down low to keep out a shot from Real Madrid's James Rodriguez in the second half . A success right from the start of the season? No. Simeone likes to ease in new signings especially when they are young and 31-year-old Miguel Moya was signed from Getafe in the close season as back-up. But the back-up became first choice because Oblak had a right hip injury in pre-season and wasn't 100 per cent when the campaign started. Moya played in the league with Oblak coming in for Champions League games but in his first match in Europe he conceded three goals from three shots. He has recovered brilliantly and now the clamour is for him to start all matches. Cristiano Ronaldo is thwarted in his attempt to open the scoring against rivals Atletico Madrid . He has convinced everyone in Madrid? Simeone's number two Mono Burgos is a big fan. The Argentine is a former Atletico keeper and although he doesn't train the goalkeepers he is convinced Atletico have found someone who can keep goal for them for years to come. Pablo Vercellone who is the club's keeping coach is just as excited and even Iker Casillas is a fan. The Real Madrid keeper said after Tuesday's game: 'He was fantastic in the first 45 minutes. We deserved more reward from all the chances we had but we didn't get it because he played so well.' Oblak put in an impressive performance for Atletico against their great rivals Madrid on Tuesday . And it really was a very special first half. Atletico have not allowed a team to get six shots on target in one half of football all season but he stopped them all. He also made two more stops in the second half when most of the football was being played at the other end and he had to stay awake. Has he fitted into the dressing room? He speaks some English, some Portuguese, and some Spanish so he can make himself understood without problems. Still only 22 and living his first year in Spain he is predictably introverted but has a strong enough personality to impose himself on his defence. Oblak  stops Bale's attempt on goal during the Champions League quarter-final first leg on Tuesday . Other strengths? We saw the shot stopping on Wednesday but his distribution is also a weapon for Atletico. They were camped in their own half in the first 45 minutes against Real unable to get their passing going. Oblak's long – and importantly accurate – throws and kicks forward to Mario Mandzukic were an important release. How good can he become? So good he'll be sold? Atletico have already lost two brilliant keepers in De Gea who they could only keep for one season and Courtois who they were not able to take from Chelsea. They will not want to lost Oblak and with foreign investment from the Wanda group in China the club does not have to sell it's best players – he's at Atletico for good.

"On loan Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez is ready to lead the line in their pivotal Champions League quarter-final second leg tie against bitter city rivals Atletico, according to AS. The Spanish publication reports that the 26-year-old links up well with Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo - where in his last two appearances for the club he has scored a goal and created an assist. Hernandez, who is on a season-long loan from Manchester United, is set to start up front for Carlo Ancelotti's side - with the club going through an injury crisis at present. AS report that Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez is 'ready' to lead their attack vs Atletico on Wednesday . Hernandez (right) took part in Real's training session on Tuesday as they prepare to face their bitter rivals . The 26-year-old (left) will be hoping to carry on his recent Real form at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday . Spanish papers preview that match (left) and Barcelona's second leg against PSG on Tuesday night too . Regular first-choice forward Karim Benzema, who has 15 La Liga goals to his name this season, missed Madrid's 3-1 victory against Malaga at the weekend with a knee injury which he is struggling to recover from. Continuing to look ahead to the Madrid derby on Wednesday night, Marca leads with the headline that while Ancelotti deals with several selection issues at Atletico, 'There are no problems, only solutions,' as  manager Diego Simeone has a fully-fit squad to choose from. Meanwhile Mundo Deportivo previews Barcelona's second leg encounter against French outfit Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night. Barca take a 3-1 lead going into Tuesday's tie at the Nou Camp but face an opponent that will welcome back Marco Verratti and former striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic into their starting line-up after missing the first leg. However, Mundo note that the Catalan club are not 'fixated' on the duo's availability for PSG and will go all out to make sure they reach the semi-finals. 'Redeem Yourselves' is the headline in French paper L'Equipe as PSG look to restore some credibility from the masterclass they were given in the first leg by Luis Enrique's side. Over in Italy, the paper's focus is very much on Serie A giants Juventus as they prepare to take on Monaco in Europe's elite club competition. Juve take a 1-0 advantage to the French Principality on Wednesday night and Corriere dello Sport leads with an exclusive headline from Ancelotti wanting his former club to reach the semi-finals of the tournament. The Italian press preview Juventus' Champions League second leg trip to Monaco on Wednesday night . 'If they eliminate Monaco it would be a boost to all of Italian football. Maybe they could face my Real?', he is quoted as saying in the paper. Sticking with Juventus, La Gazzetta dello Sport focuses on the future of Carlos Tevez. The Argentina international has made no secret of his desire to return to his homeland and Boca Juniors in the future, and the publication reports that the South American club will make a £3.6million bid for his services at the end of the season. And finally in Portugal, A Bola looks ahead to Porto's second leg encounter at Bayern Munich on Tuesday night. The Portuguese giants take a 3-1 lead to Bavaria and A Bola reports that the 2004 Champions League winners are fully prepared for the threat of Pep Guardiola's men - which could see the return of maverick winger Franck Ribery. In addition, the paper adds that Porto travel to the Allianz Arena without any fear.

"Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp does not expect any particular reaction from his players or the fans to his announcement that he will be leaving the club in the summer. Klopp revealed on Wednesday that he will not be fulfilling the remainder of his contract, which was due to expire in 2018. Instead, he will be terminating his agreement with the Westphalians in the summer to seek a new challenge, but he has vowed to win as many games as he can before bringing his seven-year reign to an end. Jurgen Klopp (centre) speaks to Mats Hummels (left) during Borussia Dortmund's Thursday training session . The Borussia Dortmund coach leads the team's training session as they prepare for a German league match against Paderborn this weekend . And he expects the players to do the same, insisting they will be fully focused for Saturday's Bundesliga clash with Paderborn. 'We can draw strength from this story together,' Klopp said at Thursday's press conference. 'We've always been able to find reasons to do something quite special.' Klopp relayed the reactions of the players to his decision to the assembled press, saying: 'Nobody applauded me - so I guess that's a good thing. You need a moment to deal with such information, which is why I didn't really assess much of what happened in training (on Wednesday), but that's over now. Klopp announced his departure from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday after seven years . Klopp said he believed Dortmund needed a change of manager, but has urged his team to keep smiling . 'I want to see the players smiling, even if then somebody might write that the players are glad Klopp's leaving.' The fans will have had a few days to digest the news too, by the time Dortmund run out at the Westfalenstadion on Saturday, and Klopp expects the atmosphere to be no different to usual. 'If somebody feels they need to give me or my coaching team three cheers, then they would be wrong,' he added. Klopp has already been linked with a number of leading clubs around Europe . Klopp won the Bundesliga title twice during his seven years as Dortmund manager . 'I don't expect it and I don't need it. The important thing is that they get behind the team for 90 minutes.' Earlier on Thursday, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger refused to add to the speculation over whether Klopp's next assignment will be in the Barclays Premier League. Klopp insisted on Wednesday that he had had no contact with any clubs, but stressed he did not plan to take an extended time-out from the game. The German has been installed as favourite to replace the under-fire Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City, but Wenger was keen not to add fuel to the fire when quizzed on the matter. 'I'm not an agency to place managers and I like every manager and respect everybody, but I find that circus a bit ridiculous,' the Frenchman said. On whether Klopp would suit Arsenal, Wenger said: 'I already answered this question.' Wenger does not believe Dortmund players will necessarily look to follow the charismatic 47-year-old out of the Westfalenstadion. The emotion was clear to see as Klopp announced he was leaving the club at a Wednesday press conference . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger branded the 'circus' around Klopp's decision as 'ridiculous' 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund,' he said. 'Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, and has the ability to keep their best players. 'They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements, so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.' Klopp has enjoyed a hugely successful spell in charge of Dortmund since taking over in 2008, leading the club to two Bundesliga titles, DFB-Pokal success and the Champions League final. This season has been more of a struggle, with the club battling it out at the bottom end of the league for much of the campaign and currently sitting 10th. Asked about any advice he would give to foreign managers heading to the Premier League, Wenger replied: 'Try to get your ideas through and adapt as well to the local culture, and respect it.'","Jurgen Klopp announced that he will leave the club in the summer .

"Bayern Munich sporting director Matthias Sammer believes his side must start focusing on the future in order to cope with the eventual loss of players such as Philipp Lahm and Xabi Alonso. Sammer, who joined Bayern's hierarchy in July 2012, has warned manager Pep Guardiola that the club have to 'make plans for the future before it is too late'. The 47-year-old, speaking to BT Sport in an interview which took place before this week’s Champions League defeat at Porto as part of a special documentary 'Inside Bayern Munich with Owen Hargreaves', said: 'There will be a new generation, not now and not tomorrow but Bayern need to be conscious that it will happen. Bayern Munich sporting director Matthias Sammer was speaking to BT Sport pundit Owen Hargreaves . Sammer stands on the touchline along with Pep Guardiola during Bayern's win over Eintracht Frankfurt . 'Philipp and Basti (Schweinsteiger) are in their early 30s, Xabi Alonso is older, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery are over 30 - all in the midfield and wing positions. 'If you have big players then you have to discuss these matters - as it influences the future of the club. 'It is true that Lahm is contracted until 2018 as are Alonso and Bastian until 2016, but we have to make plans before it is too late.' Sammer, who himself played at the top level for the likes of Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund, has laughed off the suggestion that you can play until you are 45. Sammer insists the Bundesliga giants must make plans to cope without the likes of Philipp Lahm . Bayern duo Xabi Alonso and Bastian Schweinsteiger are also approaching the latter stages of their career . He added during the interview which airs this Saturday on BT Sport 1: 'We must intervene earlier. We both know that big players avoid the subject as in their heads they think they can play until they are 45. But that is unworkable. 'I have spoken to Karl-Heinz (Rummenigge) in the attempt to change this perception. Let's get the players on board. They will respect this. 'You gain openness and trustworthiness. The club has a responsibility to itself to explore a future without Lahm and the others. The club must continue beyond these players. That is Lahm's duty as well as the club's.'

"Relegation-threatened Romanian club Ceahlaul Piatra Neamt have sacked Brazilian coach Ze Maria for the second time in a week. Former Brazil defender Ze Maria was fired on Wednesday after a poor run, only to be reinstated the next day after flamboyant owner Angelo Massone decided to 'give the coaching staff another chance.' But the 41-year-old former Inter Milan and Parma right back, capped 25 times by Brazil, angered Massone again after Ceahlaul were beaten 2-0 by mid-table FC Botosani on Saturday. Ze Maria represented Brazil on 25 occasions during an international career spanning five years . The result left Ceahlaul 16th in the standings, six points adrift of safety. Ze Maria replaced Florin Marin in January to become Ceahlaul's third coach this season.

"As Zlatan Ibrahimovic famously believes the World Cup is 'nothing to watch' without him, he's unlikely to be quaking in his boots about facing Lionel Messi in the Nou Camp on Tuesday night. For most people, Barcelona's progress into the Champions League semi-final looks a formality given they beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 in the first leg in France. The only man bound to disagree is the one who modestly called his autobiography 'I am Zlatan'. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is put through his paces with Blaise Matuidi (left) and Zoumana Camara at the Nou Camp . Ibrahimovic and his PSG team-mates, including David Luiz, pictured, face Barcelona on Tuesday night . The Sweden international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against Chelsea . At 33, Ibrahimovic is past caring what other people think of him. With an ego that makes Louis van Gaal look like a shrinking violet, he'll walk down the tunnel at the Nou Camp convinced in his own mind that Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez will be in awe of him. When asked to name a dream team of team-mates he'd played with, he named himself up front with Messi – ahead of Thierry Henry and Alessandro del Piero. 'Football isn't something you plan in advance. It just happens,' he says. His 30-yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he's ever seen. To be fair, Ibrahimovic's CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax, Juventus, Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he's trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe's greatest football club. They agreed to pay him £200,000-a-week, even though France's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to £50million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a 's**t country' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self-awareness. Despite domestic dominance, Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player, and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca. Ibrahimovic is PSG's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club Barcelona on Tuesday . The former Barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against Bastia in the French League Cup final . Ibrahimovic, pictured celebrating with Marquinhos, will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . For Paris to pull off one of European football's greatest comebacks, Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique's men under pressure. His balletic left-footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona, Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them. He called Guardiola a 'spineless coward' after Barcelona were beaten by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League. Ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for Paris in Barcelona in a group game earlier this season. But this is the big one. Nobody will give him a chance – except for Zlatan himself.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic will line up against former club Barcelona on Tuesday .

"Benik Afobe insists he feels 'unstoppable' as he bids to beat Harry Kane to become the country's top scorer this season. The striker has scored 31 times for MK Dons and Wolves - just one ahead of Tottenham hotshot Kane. Afobe bagged 19 goals on loan at MK Dons before January - including two in their 4-0 League Cup win over Manchester United - and has added 12 more since joining Wolves from Arsenal on a permanent deal. Benik Afobe says he feels 'unstoppable' at the moment as he aims to become the country's top scorer . The Molineux hitman is expected to make his 50th appearance of the season at Wigan on Saturday and after his breakthrough campaign Afobe's confidence is sky high. 'I had self belief but when you play week in, week out you're going to get more confidence - it's a different type of confidence - it's one to know you're unstoppable,' he told Press Association Sport. 'At the moment we do analysis on the other team, the defenders, the keeper, and you hear this player was playing in the Premier League and has experience but I don't care at all, not one bit. 'It doesn't matter what league I'm playing in I'm going to score. 'It's the mentality you've got to change to be a top goalscorer and I've realised that. The former Arsenal man since been in top form since joining Wolves on a permanent transfer . 'All the top goalscorers who score week in, week out like (Lionel) Messi and (Sergio) Aguero, they believe they are going to score before they've had a chance and that's the only difference between a top goalscorer and an average striker.' Wolves have two games left in the Sky Bet Championship and are three points outside the play-offs after Afobe's goal rescued a 1-1 draw with Ipswich on Saturday. Kane has five matches left in the Barclays Premier League with Spurs but Afobe is focused on scoring himself and is not jealous of Kane's success after he dropped out of the top flight for regular football. Harry Kane has been in red hot form this season and scored the third away to Newcastle on Sunday . 'He has five games and I have two,' said the confident but grounded 22-year-old. 'I have played with a lot of these players Harry, Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere who's my friend, but everyone has their own destiny. 'I have never looked at one player and thought 'that could have been me'. I think that's another reason why I'm doing well. 'I never compare myself to any player. The way people don't succeed in life is that they worry about other people too much. 'I wanted 30 goals. I got to 30 and now I want to keep scoring, I want to get to 35. People have asked 'what's my favourite goal?' I always say 'the next one'.'

"Five baggage handlers have been sacked by Saudi Arabian Airlines after a video showing passengers’ luggage being carelessly tossed onto a conveyor belt caused outrage online. The 90-second clip was filmed by a witness in an indoor area restricted to workers at King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh. It shows two male employees in blue uniforms recklessly hurling large suitcases onto the belt and against a wall as they unload a truck. For nearly two minutes the men are filmed throwing or flinging several suitcases without care . They appear to be unaware they are being filmed by someone standing on an elevated walkway. It is not clear if the person who filmed the shocking moment on a mobile phone is a colleague. As the video begins it shows one man throwing a large suitcase, which lands on the belt with a heavy thud. Seconds later the men grab either end of a bag and throw it so hard that it hits a green barrier, causing it to shake as the suitcase bounded off of it and lands on the belt. For nearly two minutes the employees of Saudi Arabian Airlines, also known as Saudia, toss suitcases or fling them behind their backs without care or caution, apparently in an attempt to unload the truck as quickly as possible. An object that appears to be fragile (left) is thrown; the workers throw two bags simultaneously (right) Some appear to be quite heavy or wrapped as though they contain fragile objects. It is believed at least one other employees, who is not seen on camera, is inside the truck to move luggage closer to the pair doing the throwing. In a statement posted on its website Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Civil Aviation (GACA) confirmed that two supervisors and three baggage handlers have been sacked after the video surfaced online. It expressed regret over the incident and said it will not tolerate such behaviour. The men throw the bags with such force that they land with a heavy thud or hit a green barrier against the wall . Titled ‘Saudi Airlines baggage handlers hard at work’, the video was uploaded to LiveLeak, where it has nearly 100,000 views. The person who uploaded the clip wrote: ‘Looks like they are trying very hard to break things. And not such a fun job.’ Rough handling of baggage is a fear shared by many passengers, and dozens of LiveLeak users wrote that they were upset or not surprised at all. One user wrote: ‘They don't appear to be trying to break anything. They appear not to care if anything breaks or not. I doubt any other airline is much different. Don't pack crystal when you travel.’ Another added: ‘Airlines might as well just use a dump truck to load and unload luggage. It's quicker and your luggage would be treated a little better.'","Two baggage handlers were caught on camera at the airport in Riyadh .

"Covered entirely in crystals, it may not be to everybody's taste - but a new £420,000 piano is possibly the most bling musical instrument in the world. The custom-made piano features half a million Swarovski crystals and was created following a request from an unnamed buyer described as an 'influential Sheikh' in Doha, Qatar. Goldfinch, a Cambridge-based piano maker, took six months to build it, with every crystal applied by hand. Scroll down for video . A £420,000 piano has been hand decorated with half a million Swarovski crystals . Company director Tomas Norman, whose family has been handcrafting high-end pianos for more than 40 years, said: 'It's been a delight to bring another customer's dream to reality. 'We love nothing more than blurring the lines between timeless tradition and contemporary British art, but it's not all about good looks - our craftsmanship is combined with cutting-edge technology for that seamless finish and ultimate musicality.' He claimed the company is the only piano manufacturer in the world which offers an almost limitless selection of shapes, sizes, colours, materials and textures. The piano was made in collaboration with British contemporary artist Lauren Baker. The sparkling piano was created for an 'influential Sheikh' in Doha, Qatar . When the light hits the crystals they shine in different colours . Previous projects have included a piano colour-matched to an RAF fighter plane and a baby grand piano that appears to melt down three flights of stairs. The company typically produces pianos priced between £100,000 and £1 million and has shipped instruments to Hong Kong, Dubai and Los Angeles in the past. Artist Lauren Baker added the half a million crystals by hand saying she has an obsession with working with the shining gem stones . Lauren said her work: 'I'm really drawn to working with crystals. My imagination runs wild with ideas. 'I've got an obsession and a fascination with crystals so this is the perfect project. It's every little detail that counts. 'It's the meticulous minute detail of the pieces that form the beautiful final outcome. It's all about the way the crystals catch the light and refract into a prism of colours. That makes it so extravagant.' Even the name of the piano was done in crystals, placed on with tweezers .

"HSBC has apologised after a link on its official website directed visitors to a pornographic page. Anyone trying to access the bank's page for the Young Entrepreneur Awards - which has since been shut down - was greeted by images of women posing naked or having sex. The porn site took over the address after the awards were scrapped in 2011 and the organisers allowed its registration on HSBC.com.hk to retire. Blunder: HSBC has apologised after a link on its official website directed visitors to a pornographic page (pictured) For that reason, the website's URL address which would usually connect to a third-party website transferred visitors to the porn business instead, a banking source told the South China Morning Post. HSBC yesterday removed the hyperlink from its main website after realising its embarrassing mistake. A spokesman denied the bank had any associations with the external site and offered its apology to the public. In a public statement dated April 20, HSBC said 'a link to an external third-party website has been removed' from its community projects webpage.

"On a fenced-in artificial pitch, on the edge of one of Salford's most notorious estates, a group of men with what you could call lived-in faces are finishing a game of football. Some are dressed in jeans and shoes - they have no kit or boots. Stories of strife are swapped. 'I'm only here so I can get a shower,'  says one as he rolls a cigarette. 'The wife booted me out a week ago and I've been on a settee since.' Jesper Blomqvist helped coach youngsters from Manchester United Foundation's Street Red project . Another is reflecting on how this kickabout, for those who may have suffered from mental health issues, is the latest tentative step on a long journey back from the brink. 'I was on a bridge over a motorway,' he says as he looks into the distance. 'They sectioned me for five years.' Into this environment walks a man who knows all about adversity. Jesper Blomqvist, he of hand in sleeve and knee often in cast, is back in Manchester. The Swede, now 41, was a key cog in Sir Alex Ferguson's treble-winning machine, making 38 appearances in that memorable season following a £4.4m switch from Parma. The midfielder (left) was a crucial player in Manchester United's treble winning season of 1998-99 . But his 67 minutes in the late, late Champions League Final win over Bayern Munich in Barcelona would be his last in a red shirt. Three operations and two gruelling years of rehab later he was on his way to Everton but would continue to be haunted by injury before eventual retirement. He is here on Sunday to coach youngsters from the Manchester United Foundation's Street Reds project, but given his background he may also be well suited to having a word with those vacating the pitch. Blomqvist now helps his brother lecture people on how to handle setbacks using his previous experiences . The years have been kind. Blomqvist's long hair remains and is now accompanied by a beard which makes him look suited to the role he currently performs. 'I lecture with my brother,' he explains. 'He's a psychologist so he talks about how to handle setbacks and how to keep on performing. I can relate to that and give some real life examples from my career both good times and bad times. We speak to people from companies who have team building days.' Blomqvist celebrates their semi-final win over Juventus with Steve McClaren (centre) and Dwight Yorke . Blomqvist had the world at his tricky feet when he signed for United in 1998. He was one of few players Sir Alex Ferguson had to try more than once to convince to move to the club, after he spurned the Scotsman's advances to sign for Parma and Carlo Ancelotti after a frustrating year on AC Milan's bench. 'I liked Italy,' he explains, apologetically. 'It was nothing to do with Manchester. I had learned the language and I had settled in. I enjoyed the life and I enjoyed Parma, but then Carlo Ancelotti left.' Blomqvist revealed that he rejected Sir Alex Ferguson the first time and signed for Parma in 1997 . Sir Alex Ferguson came back again and managed to sign up his man to compete with Ryan Giggs . Back came a determined Ferguson and this time he was successful, bringing Blomqvist to the club to compete with Ryan Giggs on the left. It went well. In that treble-winning year Blomqvist picked up three medals, although one was almost consigned to Catalonian turf in the celebrations that followed United's belief-defying victory over Bayern at the Nou Camp. 'I don't remember much about that night,' he reveals. 'It was high tension. Afterwards it was joy. I lost my medal on the pitch jumping around and I had to start looking for it. I was scared but I found it in the end.' The Swede (bottom left) started for United in the Champions League final victory against Bayern Munich . The Red Devils were involved in one of the most exciting comebacks of all time after winning the trophy . United have a quite sensational season, winning the FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League . Then came injury. Blomqvist went under the knife three times and it was here where he learned the lessons he now passes on. 'You try to get your head down,' he says. 'Small goals. In a few weeks I can go on the bike, then a few more and I can go running. But it's hours and hours of rehab and you feel like an outcast. You lose the connection with everyone, especially if it goes on for a long time.' Eventually Ferguson called him into his office for the inevitable chat. Blomqvist in action for United during the 1999 Champions League final where they completed the treble . 'I remember that last discussion because I felt quite guilty,' he says. 'I had been injured for so long and they kept paying the wages. He said 'don't worry, this is football - you gave me one excellent year and we won everything'. 'When he said that it was as though a stone fell off my heart. It meant a lot to me that he could feel like that. 'Of course he phoned Water Smith and helped me to get a deal with Everton - it spoke volumes of him.' Blomqvist enjoyed his time at Goodison Park where he was restricted to 17 appearances. The 41-year-old had an injury hit time at Everton and only managed 17 appearances for the club . 'Without wanting to be disrespectful it was a smaller club,' he says. 'There were fewer people working there which made it feel more like a family and I enjoyed that.' During Blomqvist's nine months on Merseyside, Smith was replaced by David Moyes. 'I enjoyed playing for him,' he says. 'He was, is, a good coach. That's why I was surprised it didn't work (at United). It was always going to be really hard to take over from Sir Alex. Sometimes it's about getting the right job at the right moment. 'Maybe it was bad timing. The only thing I think he may have done wrong was to change too many of the staff. When you have such a winning concept its very dangerous to change too much. Of course he wanted to put his mark on the club so you can understand it but I think it backfired.' Blomqvist worked under Ferguson and David Moyes (right) and spoke highly of them both . After Everton, Blomqvist endured a short stint with Charlton Athletic ('I enjoyed London but I was injured all the time') before heading back to his homeland. He will, however, be back in the red shirt of Manchester United in when the club's legends team recreate that 1999 final against Bayern's veterans at Old Trafford on June 14. 'It's always competitive with Manchester United,' he says (Blomqvist set up Andy Cole for the equaliser in the 3-3 first leg at a packed Allianz Arena). 'I play with lots of the old teams I have been involved with but there's a difference with United. 'Nobody wants to lose. They are fit and ready.' Now, at last, so is he.

"Internet users were left scratching their heads after an old hoax video showing a wave rider surfing in front of the Sydney's Opera House started trending for a second time. The video was uploaded to Twitter on Tuesday morning by popular Sydney radio duo Fitzy and Wippa, before quickly being reposted by a spell of other sources. The posting of the video comes in the wake of heavy storms which battered Sydney overnight, with parts of the city experiencing the heaviest rainfall in 100 years. A hoax video showing a wave rider surfing in front of the Sydney's Opera House has gone viral for the second time . Some users have referenced the weather as the trigger of the strange phenomenon, with musician Fortafy uploading the video with the following caption: 'storm brings out surfers in Sydney Harbour.' The video was originally posted by Sydneysider Darren Johnson following strong storms and tandem heavy swells in June 2012. YouTube commenters were quick to point out inaccuracies in the video, such as the appearance of rocks around the Opera House and the cardboard-esque appearance of the man in the final shot. It was also rebutted by several wave experts who vowed it was a sham. Ben Macartney, a swell forecaster, told News.com 'the only way you'd get waves in there would be a giant tsunami coming out of the Pacific.' 'Even the most powerful ocean waves known to man, I think, would still really struggle to make it up there.'

"She might be a new mother to twins but that didn't prevent a fresh-faced Charlene of Monaco from cutting a glamorous figure as she presented a sports prize this morning. Resplendent in an edgy navy leather jacket and a matching tailored dress, the 37-year-old was all smiles as she presented tennis ace Novak Djokovic with his Sportsman of the Year prize. The presentation of the award, which was bestowed on Djokovic by the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, came during the Laureus World Sports Awards. Scroll down for video .

Among the big names celebrating with Djokovic, albeit from a distance, were actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Henry Cavill and model Karolina Kurkova. While Cumberbatch, who was hosting the main event, and 31-year-old Cavill have no clear links to sport,  Charlene's own sporting pedigree is impeccable. A successful swimmer, she burst onto the scene in 1999 at the All Africa Games in Johannesburg where she picked up three golds and a silver for her native South Africa.

"You don't become one of the most successful designers that Italy has ever produced without causing some controversy. But Giorgio Armani's latest comments will undoubtedly raise a few eyebrows. The 80-year-old fashion designer, who has dressed everyone from Beyoncé to Adele, has made a name for himself putting A-listers of all shapes and sizes in his creations, but it turns out he has harsh criticism for a few body shapes in particular. Scroll down for video . Giorgio Armani, 80, admitted in an interview that he disapproved of women with breast enlargements and men who worked out too much . In an interview with The Sunday Times, the Milan-born designer spoke of his disapproval of women who resort to breast enlargements, as well as men who work out too much. Armani, who has amassed a personal fortune of £5billion over the length of his 40-year-career, emphasised his appreciation of a 'healthy' look. He said: 'I don't like muscle boy. Not too much gym! 'I like somebody healthy, somebody solid, who looks after his body but doesn't use his muscles too much.' Interestingly, the aesthetic for the brand seems to somewhat differ from the designer's views - with several of the Armani underwear adverts featuring muscly boxer-clad male models. Kelly Brook's ex, David McIntosh, 29, is one celebrity that may not agree with Giorgio Armani's disapproval of men who work out too much . Jodi Marsh, 36, is another celebrity that would lock horns with Armani and his view of plastic surgery as 'idiocy' Interestingly, Cristiano Ronaldo, 30, has modelled underwear for Giorgio Armani before, showing off his unashamedly muscly body . The designer himself, who has never denied claims that he is gay, was also outspoken about the way that certain gay men dress. Mr Armani declared that a homosexual man doesn't need to dress in a camp manner.. He said: 'When homosexuality is exhibited to the extreme to say, ""Ah, you know I'm homosexual,"" - that has nothing to do with me - a man has to be a man.' The Milan-born designer has never denied that he is gay, but in the interview he condemned men who 'dress homosexual' A Beyoncé fan! In the interview, Giorgio Armani admitted that he preferred the 'natural look' on women, rather than women with breast implants . And his criticism wasn't only reserved for men. When questioned on women opting for plastic surgery, the designer described it as 'idiocy... A small breast does not have to become big.' In the interview, the designer highlighted his appreciation of women with natural beauty, in particular those who chose to age gracefully. He said: 'I prefer to look at a natural woman. A woman should be courageous to become older, not be desperate to look younger than her age.'","In an interview, Armani, 80, described cosmetic surgery as idiocy .

"Property portfolio: Sol Campbell and his wife Fiona . The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck – but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property – leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour’s mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over £2million comes into force. Earlier this year it was revealed he had taken the apparently bizarre decision to sell a £20million London townhouse to a company owned by himself. Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for £6.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for £4.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents’ in the hope of securing it for his family – his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan. It has since been extensively renovated by his wife, an interior designer and granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. An advert for the property states: ‘There are few properties within Chelsea that can offer the combination of views, spacious accommodation and exquisite finish.’ Yet Campbell, 40, seems to be keen to rid himself of the flat before the election. Eye for detail: The living room inside Campbell's £6.75million Chelsea flat boasts lavish furnishings . Nice touch: The former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender's kitchen is filled with marble . Sumptuous: Gilded mirrors line the hall in Campbell's luxurious flat, which is in an exclusive neighbourhood . Last year the former Arsenal and Tottenham defender blasted the proposed mansion tax, describing it as a ‘cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well’. He told The Times: ‘With a mansion tax, you’re taxing me for being prudent ... If Labour gets in, I’d leave. I’d have to say, “Sorry, I want to ship out”.’ Campbell has also said: ‘I’m not earning what I was earning five years ago.’ Experts have said that properties worth between £5million and £10million could incur an annual charge of up to £25,000 under a Labour government. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property commentator, said: ‘Sellers like Sol Campbell face a financial dilemma: to take a certain hit now or await the potential tax bill that a Labour or Lib Dem Government may generate.’ Since 2009 Campbell has also owned Grade II-listed Hallington Hall, an 18th Century mansion in Northumberland.","Sol Campbell has put his flat in Chelsea on the market for £6.75million .

"Porto will need to hit top form to advance against five-times champions Bayern Munich on Tuesday despite holding a 3-1 first leg advantage in their Champions League quarter-final, coach Julen Lopetegui said on Monday.

Bayern are also without Javi Martinez and Mehdi Benatia, while winger Franck Ribery looks set to miss the game with a nagging ankle injury.

Bayern are chasing a treble of titles and their fourth straight Champions League semi-final appearance. Twice winners Porto have not reached the last four since winning the trophy in 2004. Lopetegui had the luxury of resting nine players who had played against Bayern in their 1-0 league win over Academica on Saturday.

"Video footage of a creepy doll has been wreaking havoc on a string of paranormal enthusiasts around the world – reportedly causing one British woman to suffer a heart attack. Paranormal investigator Jayne Harris, based in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, said she has received an influx of messages from people describing chest pains, nausea and crippling headaches after viewing photos and videos of Peggy, who she believed to be possessed with an evil spirit. Some reported flashing visions of 'mental institutions and treatment bordering on abuse' and overwhelming feelings of anxiety. Scroll down for video . Video footage of Peggy (pictured) has been wreaking havoc on a string of paranormal enthusiasts around the world – reportedly causing one British woman to suffer a heart attack . One woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, even suffered an alleged heart attack after watching a video of Mrs Harris and Peggy in a car together on March 16. 'If I had to guess, I'd say close to 80 people have came forward with experiences,' said Mrs Harris, who has been studying spirit attachment since the death of her  cousin Kelly in 2000. 'Some are small, like computer screens freezing, sharp headaches or a sense of dread, but others are more disturbing. 'One lady said that when she opened a photograph of Peggy, her computer froze on the picture and the room went cold. 'She then said she felt someone in the room with her and could hear them moving around.This lady was messaging me at the time via Facebook asking me to quickly advise her on what to do. 'I took Peggy down into an isolation area and requested that she cease her tormenting. Apparently everything returned to normal.' Paranormal investigator Jayne Harris (left) said she received an influx of messages from people describing chest pains, nausea and crippling headaches after viewing photos and videos of Peggy (right) Mrs Harris continued: 'Another lady yesterday said she had been experiencing light bulbs blowing and a presence in her home after she had been speaking about Peggy. 'With Peggy, it's not only while people are looking at her or watching her, it seems to be afterwards too.' Mrs Harris, who has herself experienced migraines and feeling drained after working with Peggy, said she has never seen a case of this intensity before. She runs an organisation called Haunted Dolls, and often gets random items in the post with no prior background. Mrs Harris uses an array of gadgets and experiments to piece together the puzzles surrounding them. Mrs Harris, pictured conducting a ritual with the doll, has experienced migraines and feeling drained after working with Peggy, and said she has never seen a case of this intensity before . Peggy was sent to her recently after her previous owner reported a series of terrifying nightmares. 'She’d wake feeling hot and shaken,' Mrs Harris said. 'No matter where she moved the doll to in her home, the nightmares persisted. She apparently sought the help of a local priest but two visits later and there was no change. 'In September she became quite ill with a fever and began suffering hallucinations. 'When she recovered, she saw no other option but to get rid of the doll as she was convinced it was at the centre of all that had been happening. 'I think she Googled ""haunted dolls"" and came upon our website. She didn’t want us to go to her home to conduct experiments as we usually would, but instead sent the doll to us.' There is still a shroud of mystery surrounding Peggy’s religion, according to Mrs Harris, but she appears to have an aversion to a crucifix necklace she was previously made to wear . The team, along with members of Haunted Dolls’ social media groups, have been trying to put together a clearer picture of the spectre inhabiting Peggy. It is thought she is possessed by the spirit of a woman born in 1946 in London’s Holland Park who died of a chest-related condition - possibly an asthma attack – and strongly dislikes clowns. Four different psychic mediums have ‘read’ Peggy, all invariably picking up that she is restless, frustrated and was persecuted in life. 'We have been told she can affect people’s dreams,' Mrs Harris said. 'She recently visited a lady in her dreams, warning her about one of her cats. 'The next morning, the lady found her cat very ill and he sadly died that day.' There is still a shroud of mystery surrounding Peggy’s religion, according to Mrs Harris. She appears to have an aversion to a crucifix necklace she was previously made to wear, suggesting she is not a Christian. 'A lot of people, including two mediums, have said they feel she has links to the Holocaust and was possibly Jewish,' said Mrs Harris. 'We have conducted automatic writing sessions with her in which the words ""star"" and the name ""David"" came up, so there is possibly a link there.' After a recent session with Peggy during which Mrs Harris made notes, she left the room and returned to find that Peggy had moved the notebook high up to the joists of her ceiling (pictured) It was during the automatic writing session – a ritual whereby a psychic will communicate with a spirit, producing any messages they have without consciously writing – that an cryptic instruction was passed on to a member of the Haunted Dolls community. The woman in question, a developing medium known as Lindy, had experienced paranormal activity related to Peggy before when her Facebook page kept posting comments about the doll over and over again. 'When I commented my thoughts and feelings [about Peggy] all my comments were duplicated – no one else’s, just mine,' she said. 'I tried commenting on other threads and nothing happened, but I soon as I went back to that one the same thing happened. My dog started barking and my face became very hot and flushed. I felt like I wasn’t alone. 'I ended up apologising to Peggy as I felt maybe she disproved of us chatting about her and my symptoms stopped.' Mrs Harris uses a K-II meter (pictured) during her paranormal investigations, which pick up ghostly 'activity' Three days later, another Peggy video inspired Lindy to have an overdue conversation with her daughter about how they were to deal with her mental health issues. 'My daughter has been unwell for months and things were strained and stressful,' she said. 'Late that morning, I found myself having a much needed heart-to-heart with her. 'All the things I had wanted to say for months were just flowing from my mouth. 'I’ve found it very difficult communicating in such a way with her due to her illness. I felt that Peggy had helped me.' Lindy did not know that the automatic writing session with Peggy was taking place, but when she logged onto Facebook and saw images of the messages received during the session, one seemed to be for her. 'The words LINDY GIRL EXPLANATION DRAW A LINE were written on the paper. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was basically what had just been talked about between me and my daughter,' she said. Mrs Harris consulted a physic who 'communicated' with Peggy by writing down the cryptic messages she was conveying (right) Though they have had offers from other psychics to rid Peggy of her spirit, Mrs Harris and the Haunted Dolls team are going to research her case. 'I’ve been asked to take her along to various paranormal events and investigations at haunted locations but, for now, I want to continue my private studies into her case,' she said. 'In order to do the work I do well, I have to approach each case as a sceptic initially and look for 'normal' explanations for things. If it were one or two occasions that things were happening on, I could do that, but with Peggy I just know there’s something more. 'Just the other night we held a session with her and I made lots of notes as the pendulum was going crazy. 'The next morning I couldn't find my notepad anywhere, and when I did find it, I couldn’t even reach it. 'It had been placed up in the joists of the ceiling in our basement. My husband had to use a ladder to get it. Many people who saw the picture felt that she did not want me to tell people the information I had gained.” 'What Dwells Within’, a book detailing some of Jayne Harris’ most memorable paranormal encounters, co-written with Dan Weatherer, will be released in June.","Peggy was given to a paranormal investigator by her terrified former owner .

"Gary and Phil Neville, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes will no doubt partying hard on Tuesday night after Salford City clinched the Evo-Stik League First Division North title, with the club gaining promotion on a very fitting 92 points. Title rivals Darlington 1883 could only draw 1-1 with Warrington Town, meaning the Manchester-based club won the title without having to kick a ball. The Evo-Stik League Northern Premier League is what awaits Salford, with the Conference North just one league above but they won't be playing local rivals FC United of Manchester next season after they gained promotion from the division.

Gary Neville (centre) and Paul Scholes watched Salford's last home match against Clitheroe Town . The Neville brothers both took to Twitter to express their delight at gaining promotion, with a few beers likely to be consumed over the week. Scholes and Gary were in attendance for Salford's victory against Clitheroe Town before they made made it eight wins on the bounce the following week away to Burscough. Salford knew that a 1883 win would take the title race to the final game of the season but they were unable to get the better of Warrington Town - handing the trophy to their rivals. Darlington's manager Martin Gray showed a real touch of class by personally calling Gary and joint-manager Anthony Johnson to congratulate them of their achievement. Following this, Phil showed the same sort of courtesy and wished Gray's side well in the play-off's. Salford clinched the title on a fitting 92 pointsand with one game to spare after their eight-game winning streak . The Class of '92 bought into the club last year and their investments have worked wonders, with the club earning instant success in their first full season at the helm. But recently the co-owners admitted that it wasn't all plain sailing after former manager Phil Power was sacked in January, with Phil conceding that were turning into something they had always said they wouldn't. The former Everton man said: ‘We had become the meddling owners, everything we didn’t want to be.' With the Football League just three more promotions away, Salford's fans and very famous owners can dream about that prospect.

"England will no longer compete in the Victory Shield as the Football Association does not believe the competition suits the needs of its young players. Wayne Rooney, Sir Stanley Matthews, Duncan Edwards and Peter Shilton are all veterans of the long-contested Under 16 tournament between the different associations within the United Kingdom. England are the most successful team in the history of the Victory Shield, but it has been announced that they will not be fielding a side in the competition. The Football Association have taken the decision to withdraw from future Victory Shield tournaments . Wales are the current holders of the Victory Shield while England are the most successful country . 2010-11: England . 2011-12: England . 2012-13: England . 2013-14: Scotland . 2014-15: Wales . A statement from the Football Association says the move 'ensures consistency with a key element of the England DNA', with the move borne out of the desire to aid development by facing opposition from further afield. It is understood the decision has been sped up by Sky Sports' move to withdraw funding and propose an altered format, with Gareth Southgate, the FA's head of national teams at St George's Park, saying player development is the key reason. 'We are reviewing our fixture programme at all ages and it is important that with England we are able to give players an international experience that compliments their club development and attempts to expose them to something different,' he said. 'At Under 16 level we may only have the boys for between 10 to 15 matches per season. Within that programme, it's important to prioritise exposing them to European and world opposition. 'We feel that within their club programmes, they face many of the boys that they would face in the Victory Shield and so these fixtures, whilst competitive and exciting, do not expose our boys to different playing cultures. 'Although we recognise the historic interest in these matches, we are intent on maximising the football learning of our young players, while forming the programme of fixtures for the year around the crucial academic commitments our players face at this age group. 'We also feel that due to the changes in format, uncertainty around the Victory Shield and the potential changes suggested by Sky, it is a good time to review our fixtures and make an early decision so everyone can plan their 2015-16 fixtures with certainty.'

"Visitors will be able to travel through time when One World Trade Center opens next month. Those taking the elevator to the observation deck will watch an incredible time lapse video of the growth of Lower Manhattan from the 1500s to the present day as they ascend to the top. The video, shared by The New York Times on Monday, will play during the 47 seconds it will take visitors to reach the 102nd floor observatory. At the start of the ascent, the film shows the city as an expanse of wild vegetation and marshes before it was settled by the Dutch in the 1600s. Houses, churches, markets and bustling ports begin cropping up across Lower Manhattan as the Europeans make the city their home before high-rise buildings start jutting into the sky throughout the 1800s. The Brooklyn Bridge can also be seen stretching across the East River to Brooklyn. But it's throughout the 20th century when the skyline begins to change most dramatically, with scores of skyscrapers emerging, including the Woolworth Building and the Singer Building. From the end of the 1960s, the facade of the doomed south tower of the former trade center begins to appear on the screen - before it vanishes less than four seconds later. David W. Checketts, the chairman of Legends Hospitality, the company operating the three-level observatory, said including the tower and a reference to the tragedy on 9/11 seemed necessary. 'The event is certainly a key part of history,' he told the Times. 'We did not think you could ignore it. View: An image shows how the 102nd floor observatory will look when it opens to the public next month . As visitors travel up One World Trade Center, pictured last week, they will see an incredible time lapse video of the growth of the city between the 1500s and the present day, including the construction of the towers . 'Having it appear in the year it did and disappear in the year it did was the respectful way of addressing the fact that it was part of the landscape.' The final part of the ascent shows scaffolding around the elevator, signifying the developing new building, before the journey ends and visitors step off into the newly-finished observatory. The  panoramic images are displayed on three high-definition monitors on the sides of the elevators, and on the way down, visitors will watch a different film. On the video played during the descent, the elevator cab appears to leave the tower and sail around it before re-entering through windows that ultimately slide apart, the Times reported. The observatory opens on May 29. Tickets went on sale last week.","Elevators at the World Trade Center will show visitors the growth of Lower Manhattan as they travel to the observatory when it opens next month .

"Four Royal Navy sailors charged with the gang rape of a young woman at an alcohol-fuelled party at a Canadian barracks must stay in Nova Scotia until they have been tried. The four men appeared in turn in a courtroom in Dartmouth, near Halifax, where they were given identical but unusual bail conditions that could see them having to live on a Canadian naval base for the next few years. Bail was set at over £2,000 for each of them but they also agreed to surrender their passports and live at the nearby Stadacona naval base in Halifax. Accused: Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer from Stockbridge, Hampshire, arrives at court today . Two of the accused, Simon Radford, 31, of Gosport, Hampshire and Craig Stoner, 24, from Stonehouse, Gloucestershire hid their faces as they were led to a provincial court in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia . Darren Smalley, 35, of Gosport, Hampshire, and his co-accused were ordered to surrender their passports as part of their bail conditions . In a deal agreed with the British government, they will also continue to work for the Royal Navy and draw their current pay. It was not clear last night how they will keep themselves occupied thousands of miles from their shipmates and a representative from the British High Commission who was in court refused to elaborate. The four – Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer, Craig Stoner, 24, Simon Radford, 31, and Darren Smalley, 35 – had been playing for the Royal Navy ice hockey team in a tournament at the Shearwater naval base just east of Halifax. The alleged sexual assault, in which police sources say all four men had sexual intercourse with their victim, took place on April 10 after the sailors had returned to the barracks from a hockey game. Sources say their victim, who is aged in her early 20s and lives in Halifax, had accompanied a friend who had been invited to attend the party by local Canadian servicemen. Yesterday, all four men – three of them wearing black Royal Navy ice hockey team hoodies – looked relieved to be getting out of custody as they respectfully answered Judge John MacDougall’s questions. Charged: Royal Navy sailors Joshua Finbow, 23, (left) and Simon Radford, 31, (right) appeared in court . Held: Craig Stoner, 24, (left) and Darren Smalley, 35, (right) are being held by military police in Canada . They all said they understood their bail conditions and Crown prosecutor Eric Taylor said outside court that the accused had not asked to be returned to the UK. They were ordered to return to court on May 27 and given the names of seven people – the victim and six witnesses – who they were forbidden to contact. They must not leave the province of Nova Scotia and cannot apply for new passports. They must remain employed by the navy and must not resign without the court’s permission. The four, no longer trying to hide their faces, later filed out of the court building and were driven away together in a large white SUV to their new home on the close Stadacona base. They ignored a question over how they might plead in the case. Commander Michael O’Sullivan, the air and naval advisor at the British High Commission, has spoken to the four and described the alleged offences as ‘serious’ but stressed they were as yet only allegations. Naval base: The East Coast Navy base at Halifax, Nova Scotia, near to where the alleged incident occurred . Military base: An aerial view of the Shearwater military base where four British sailors are accused of assaulting a civilian . The Commander, who drove the car the men left the court in, added: ‘We’re assisting the Canadian authorities with their investigation.’ The four are charged with sexual assault causing bodily harm and group sexual assault – offences that are punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Crown prosecutor Eric Taylor said the investigation was still at an early stage and the results of forensic tests could result in additional charges. ‘It will be up to the Royal Navy to decide now how to employ them while their charges are working their way through the court,’ he said. Canadian military investigators have described the alleged offences as ‘a disturbing accusation of sexual assault’.

"Bryony Hibbert (pictured), 25,  the girlfriend of the footballer caught having drunken sex in the dugout, has slammed those responsible for the clip . This is the first picture of the girlfriend of the semi-professional footballer caught having drunken sex with a female supporter in the dugout after his team's 4-1 defeat. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness. The 73rd minute substitute for non-league Clitheroe FC, in Lancashire, today admitted he had no idea who the woman was and reached out to Wayne Rooney on Twitter for advice. Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did. 'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at clitheroe. 'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught. 'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony . 'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there. 'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.' His team had just suffered a 4-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage. Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart, 24,  could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs . One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident. His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine. 'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said. Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde . 'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible. 'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday.

"Southend United's promotion charge continued on Tuesday night  at Bury when a David Worrall free-kick enabled them to leapfrog their hosts into fourth place. Former Bury player Worrall struck from 25 yards in the 74th minute with a superb curling effort  from a set-piece courtesy of a yellow-carded foul by Adam El-Abd. It put manager Phil Brown’s late-goal specialists, who pinched an added-time winner at Exeter on Saturday, behind third-placed Wycombe only on goal difference. Phil Brown's Southend United move into fourth after a 1-0 win over Bury on Tuesday night . While Bury dominated for long spells, Brown’s men were rarely in trouble. Bury began the night a point ahead of the Shrimpers after winning 1-0 at Portsmouth on Saturday but despite chances they couldn't hit the target. They were backed by one of their biggest crowds of the season - 8,396 - having offered free entry after the initial fixture was postponed. Less than 10 minutes was played of the first attempt at the match in March but the open gates saw the club enjoy its biggest home crowd for almost 18 years. A saved from Southend keeper Daniel Bentley from Ryan Lowe late in proceedings ensured his side's seventh clean sheet in a row.","David Worrall scored a 74th-minute free-kick after a foul by Adam El-Abd .

"MK Dons boss Karl Robinson hailed the patience of his team as they beat Doncaster 3-0 to keep the heat on Preston at the top of League One. Robinson’s team needed a freakish goal by Dean Bowditch, 25 minutes from time, to break Doncaster’s resistance and stay within a point of the automatic promotion places with two games to play. Substitute Bowditch had only been on for a few seconds when a clearance by defender Mitchell Lund hit him on the head and looped into the net. MK Dons midfielder Carl Baker celebrates scoring the second goal . League One player of the year Dele Alli of MK Dons goes past them . MK Dons winger Samir Carruthers goes on the attack during his side's 3-0 win over Doncaster . ‘It’s our first time this season we’ve had a fluke goal, it’s overdue,’ said Robinson after Carl Baker, another substitute, had secured the win with two fine goals. ‘We never lost patience. We showed great maturity and quality and that’s 12 goals in out last three games. ‘To be on 85 points is sensational. If we win one more and get to 88 that will be a magnificent season. If we win them both and get 91 that’s unbelievable. If it’s not good enough to finish second we’ll go into the play-offs as the form team.’ Meanwhile, Preston remain in pole position to join champions Bristol City in the Championship next season as they stay a point ahead of the Dons after a 3-1 win at Notts County, who are staring relegation in the face. First-half goals from Jermaine Beckford and Joe Garner set up the success, before James Spencer got the Magpies back in it. But Beckford's second sealed it in the final 10 minutes to leave County two points adrift of safety with two games left. Swindon look destined for the play-offs after only managing a 3-3 draw with Walsall. The Robins will have to win their remaining three games and hope that Preston and the Dons lose their last two to have any chance of gatecrashing the top two. Jermaine Beckford scored a brace for Preston to help his side defeat Notts County 3-1 on Tuesday . Joe Garner (right) netted a first-half goal to double Preston's lead and set them on their way to a perfect win . Goals from Kieron Morris and Jordy Hiwula put the Saddlers two to the good only for two quickfire penalties from Ben Gladwin to bring Swindon level. Romaine Sawyers' effort 16 minutes from time looked to be decisive but Jordan Turnbull levelled late on for the Robins. Rochdale kept their faint play-off hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Leyton Orient, which leaves the O's in dire straits at the other end of the table. Ian Henderson's 66th-minute goal won it for Dale who are five points adrift of the top six with two games to play and need Chesterfield or Sheffield United to drop points to get in the play-offs. Orient, who were beaten play-off finalists last season, are two points adrift of safety. Elsewhere, Scunthorpe virtually guaranteed their third-tier status after a 1-1 draw at home to Bradford. Gary McSheffrey put the Iron ahead midway through the first half only for Billy Clarke to cancel it out just after the hour. However, Mark Robins' men move six points clear of the bottom four with two games left and a superior goal difference to those teams below them.","Preston defeat Notts County 3-1 while MK Dons beat Doncaster 3-0 .

"Liverpool defender Kolo Toure insists a 'sad' Steven Gerrard will deal with the reality of being denied a fairytale FA Cup final farewell. The former Ivory Coast international said the team was probably more disappointed at not being able to deliver a trophy for fans, who this season had seen their side fail to progress out of the Champions League group stage and lose to Chelsea in the last four of the Capital One Cup. A 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa at Wembley ended the club's last hope of silverware and meant Gerrard would not be given a perfect send off ahead of his summer move to Los Angeles Galaxy with a cup final appearance on his 35th birthday on what would have been his very last for his boyhood club. Kolo Toure (left) admitted Steven Gerrard was 'sad' after the loss but he also felt sorry for Liverpool's fans . 'You feel bad. It is always difficult when you lose a semi-final like that,' Toure told Press Association Sport. 'The defeat is the thing. Of course we wanted to do very well for the last game of Stevie for the club but at the end of the day, we wanted to do it for the fans because this club deserves to have a trophy. 'He (Gerrard) is fine. Of course he is sad, like all the dressing room, but he has been in this game for a long time and he knows how to deal with these situations.' Gerrard was able to start the match after an injury to Lucas Leiva in training, which denied Liverpool some much-needed control in midfield. The former England captain looks dejected after the final whistle and his hopes of a final trophy ended . However, Toure insisted they should have had the ability to cope without their only genuine defensive midfielder. 'Lucas is a great player but we had players who could do the job,' he added. 'Collectively we were not very good. Villa really fought and gave everything to win the game.' As a result, Brendan Rodgers became the first Liverpool manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy in his first three years. Gerrard didn't get his fairytale ending at Wembley as he leaves the club at the end of the season for LA Galaxy . With the club's Champions League qualification hopes looking increasingly distant after Manchester City's win over West Ham on Sunday increased the gap to fourth place to seven points - although Liverpool now have a match in hand - the Reds boss will find his record coming under more scrutiny over the final six games of the season. The Northern Irishman insists he and his players will not give up while there is still a mathematical possibility. 'There's an obligation here to fight to the very end,' he said. 'We have to fight in every single game now. Of course there will be disappointment over the next couple of days but we're going to have to get ready.' Brendan Rodgers became the first manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy in his first three years . Despite an impressive run of form since the turn of the year, Liverpool have looked ineffective in the big games, with back-to-back defeats to Manchester United and Arsenal putting a huge dent in their top-four hopes just when it seemed they were about to make the breakthrough, having worked so hard to get within two points of the top-four. 'The start of the season was not so good for various reasons then we picked it up,' said Rodgers. 'We played very well and had great rhythm to our game then we've had a block of games where the performance level hasn't been what we'd like. 'The team in the last couple of years have shown great energy, attitude and commitment - I thought our energy was low (against Villa). The Reds boss admitted that Aston Villa deserved the victory as they progressed to the FA Cup final . 'They had a good start to the game and we were too passive in the game. 'We changed the system, got some joy and got in front but we didn't keep the lead long enough. 'In the second half we hoped to play better but we just didn't create enough. 'We needed to change the game to get more thrust going forward but even then the numbers getting forward weren't what we're normally used to.'","Kolo Toure admitted that Steven Gerrard was sad after the FA Cup defeat .

"A frustrated Arsenal fan who jumped over a barrier and ran towards the manager during an away match at Southampton has been banned from going to games for three years. Luke Bryant, 25, was sat with Southampton fans when he ran onto the sidelines of the football pitch during a game at St Mary's stadium, where Arsenal were losing 2-0. Bryant admitted 'going onto an area adjacent to a playing area' of the Football Act 1991, where he shrugged his shoulders at Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. The fan, who Arsene Wenger thought was from the Southampton end, runs to the dugout and gestures . Stewards quickly led the man away as Arsenal manager Wenger shows little reaction to the confrontation . Wenger was confronted by an angry fan during the poor performance at St Mary's on New Year's Day . The father-of-two, who works in retail, said in court that he was frustrated with his club and 'just wanted his voice heard'. Bryant, who has been a football fan since he was six years old, said he went over an advertising board - which stood at around two feet - to get onto the side of the pitch. He said: 'It was sheer frustration at how the club was doing. I just wanted my voice heard.' Bryant told Southampton Magistrates Court he put his arms out and shrugged at Arsenal manager Wenger before being taken away by the stewards during the match on January 1. He said: 'I got to the front of the subs stand. I was there for a few seconds. 'I stood there and shrugged my shoulders. I pointed towards the pitch to say it was not good enough and that was it.' Bryant, who has no previous convictions, said he had been contacted by 'unhappy' Southampton fans who made threats and which made his partner fearful for them and their two children and that he had reported the incidents to police. He added that he had his car keyed and was due to promotion to supervisor but was unsuccessful as a result of the incident. Bryant, a 'fully fledged' Arsenal fan of Lymington, Hants,, said: 'This experience has not been a pleasant one. 'The moment I stepped onto that pitch and saw the Arsenal manager, I felt guilty. 'It was stupid - five minutes of madness.' Wenger feels the strain as Arsenal succumbed to a two-goal defeat against Southampton . Wenger gestures towards the fourth official on the touchline during a frustrating afternoon for Arsenal . Prosecuting Simon Jones said: 'If Mr Bryant's frustration is with the way the club is being run then the court have to decide about further behaviour, as he said himself there is not going to be a change in management for the foreseeable future.' Defending Stephen Tricker said: 'He is saying 'I have learnt my lesson.' 'Mr Bryants says 'the mere experience of everything that is happening is significantly terrible for me not to make the same mistake twice'.' Judge Anthony Carloway said: 'In the case of Bryant it is common ground, he unwisely decided to leave his allocated seat, mount an advertising board some two feet high and approach the manager Mr Arsene Wenger with outstretched arms. 'I understand from Mr Bryant the purpose of that activity was to reflect his opinion of the club also that he says the club is divided and his unhappiness at the club's structure and performance and so on.' He added that a journalist who interviewed the manager after the match asked him about the incident. Wenger answered that he thought the 'young boy' was a Southampton fan and was 'not aggressive at all'. He said that Bryant's actions were 'emotional' rather than planned. Bryant was placed under a banning order for three years and fined £500. He was also ordered to pay £200 court costs.

"Chelsea striker Didier Drogba has been forced to withdraw from a charity match after picking up an ankle injury that leaves the Barclays Premier League leaders with no fit strikers ahead of their game against Arsenal on Sunday. Drogba has withdrawn from Monday's 'Match against Poverty' in St Etienne to add to the Blues' injury woes upfront after Diego Costa and Loic Remy both missed Saturday's 1-0 win over Manchester United. The Ivorian centre forward played the full 90 minutes in Chelsea's last two games, wins over Queens Park Rangers and United, but is now a potential doubt for Sunday's trip to the Emirates Stadium with the ankle problem. Chelsea's Didier Drogba has been forced to withdraw from a charity match after picking up an ankle injury . Drogba has withdrawn from Monday's 'Match against Poverty' after playing against Manchester United . Ander Herrera is tackled by Drogba during an all-action performance in the 1-0 win at Stamford Bridge . Drogba posted on Twitter: 'Disappointed not to be able to play the #MAP2015 because of an ankle injury but still supporting #EbolaResponse.' When one follower claimed Drogba was pulling out to avoid an injury before the end of the season, the 37-year-old replied: 'I'm already injured if you can read well my friend.' Costa returns to training with the first-team squad this week, but Chelsea may be reluctant to throw him in from the start against Arsenal, given how he broke down with the hamstring problem that has troubled him for much of the season against Stoke City. Remy was not even on the bench against United despite manager Jose Mourinho saying he had a better than 50/50 chance of appearing at Stamford Bridge. Dominic Solanke, a 17-year-old with just one first-team appearance, was the only recognised striker among the substitutes. The Blues need nine points from their remaining six games to guarantee a first Premier League title in five years, although they could be celebrating as early as April 29 if they win at Arsenal and then against Leicester City.

"Justin Rose will try to take a leaf out of Rory McIlroy's book after kickstarting his season with his share of second place in the Masters. Rose arrived at Augusta National having missed the cut in three of his previous five tournaments on the PGA Tour, but left with renewed enthusiasm and a 14-under-par total which has only been bettered six times in Masters history. 'I'm really excited about the rest of the year now. It's a good momentum starter for me,' said Rose, who was looking to become the first European player to win the US Open and Masters. Justin Rose was unable to take victory at the Masters, despite carding 14-under-par for the tournament . Rose believes that his finish of second at Augusta can boost his season with some big events ahead . Rose wants to follow the lead of Rory McIlroy, who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 . 'I tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about April to September when the big tournaments come around and that's when I want to play well. 'You look at Rory's year last year, it was all about how he played in the summer (winning the Open, Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA in the space of four weeks). I was trying to keep telling myself it's a long year. Very happy it turned around this week in a major championship. 'The thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that I have not been in contention and I haven't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw. 'I was really pleased at how comfortable I felt in that situation, last group in the Masters on Sunday. I think that's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon.' Rose began the final round four shots behind Spieth and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine, but was never able to get any closer. 'There's two ways to look at it. You can think that 14 under par, I'll take that next year and I'll take that the year after and I'll take it the year after, so I have to take a lot of confidence from that,' he added. Rose had struggled to hit top form going into the Masters but now hopes to sustain his Augusta form . Rose (left) congratulates tournament winner Spieth and praised his performance level for the week . 'But you've got to play it on the day, too. I felt like there were a few moments out there where I could have done better and I'll learn on that and think about that. 'Jordan didn't really open the door and I didn't really expect him to. Really the one time on the back nine where it got interesting for me was the 16th hole. I felt that if I make my birdie putt and Jordan misses for par, it's a two-shot swing and I'm two back with two to play. But my putt just slid by and he made a great eight- footer to there to keep his momentum as he did all day, really.'","Justin Rose finished joint runner-up at the Masters 2015 on 14-under-par .

"Will Stevens has followed the lead of England's elite footballers and taken to using the world-class facilities at St George's Park to help him climb the Formula One ladder. Manor driver Stevens was introduced to St George's Park by Michael Johnson Performance, the training company founded by the four-time Olympic champion and which has a partnership with the Burton-based centre where all 24 England teams train ahead of international fixtures. The 23-year-old was a regular visitor last year as he looked to step up his fitness in preparation for a potential F1 drive, which came his way with now-defunct Caterham in the final race in Abu Dhabi. Will Stevens has been using the facilities at St George's Park to help him climb the Formula One ladder . Stevens has access to an exercise bike, treadmill and rowing machine, located in the altitude chamber . Stevens continued over the winter as he held talks with Manor prior to the South Yorkshire-based marque finally exiting administration in early March. Due to Stevens' grand prix commitments he has been unable to visit St George's Park as much as he would like these past few weeks, although he is planning a trip over the summer months. 'The facilities they have there are great, better than anywhere,' said Stevens.

The Hydrotherapy suite has a main pool (background), ice bath (centre) and jacuzzi (foreground) 'This year is a lot different because we need to manage the schedule to keep up my energy levels, when to train hard and when not to. 'I'll probably go there during the break because obviously the German Grand Prix has gone. 'There is a lot longer break in the middle compared to what it would be normally, so I'll probably spend a week or so there. 'I'll have a fitness assessment for the first couple of days, and then after that I'll work on the areas where I need to improve. Stevens was a regular visitor last year as he looked to step up his fitness in preparation for a potential F1 drive . 'They've a heat chamber which is good and a really good underwater treadmill so you can do a lot more non-bearing stuff on your body. 'If you're training solidly for more than a week it's good to do that kind of stuff. 'If you are out running or whatever it's obviously a lot harder on your body, and you can train a lot longer over the duration of the day rather than a few hours.' Past use of the heat chamber will have a bearing for Stevens this weekend as he competes in the Bahrain Grand Prix. Although an evening/night race when temperatures will be in the mid 20s centigrade compared to searing day-time highs of 36, it will still be of benefit. The Manor driver is preparing to race in the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday . 'Hydration is the number one thing. If you're not hydrated you can lose concentration,' added Stevens. 'Stuff like that is obviously something I need to keep on top of, which is why I've people here to help me to manage everything like that. 'I've spent the last three days in Dubai where the temperature was identical to here.

"Jockey Andrea Atzeni has an early chance to promote the Classic claims of a contender owned by his new Qatar Racing bosses when he partners Terror in Wednesday’s Landwades Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket. The 1,000 Guineas hope, trained by David Simcock, is one of six out of the nine entries to hold an engagement in the Guineas. Terror finished fourth place in the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at the Rowley Mile last September prior to her landing a Listed event there five weeks later. Jockey Andrea Atzeni will ride Terror in Wednesday’s Landwades Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket . Simcock said: ‘Terror has had a trouble-free preparation and done well physically over the winter, her recent work has been solid. She is not a bad filly – she would have to be good to finish fourth in the Cheveley Park on only her second start – and she has done nothing wrong. ‘Although she is quite clean-winded it is difficult to know where you stand fitness-wise until you get her into a race scenario. Trainer Richard Hannon is represented by Osaila and Marsh Hawk in the Nell Gwyn at Newmarket . ‘She might prefer a bit of dig in the ground but she has already proved that she handles fast ground, and I don’t think that this step up to seven furlongs will be a problem for her.’ Other Nell Gwyn entries include two fillies from the Richard Hannon – Osaila, winner of the Group Three Princess Margaret Stakes winner, and Marsh Hawk, who has not run since finishing fourth in the Group One Dubai Fillies’ Mile in October.

"Graeme McDowell believes Jordan Spieth may not be the only rival Rory McIlroy has to face as he looks to complete the career grand slam and add more majors to his collection. McIlroy's fourth place in the Masters is his best finish in seven appearances, while his 12 under par total was 12 shots better than last year and beat his previous best by eight shots. But the world number one never threatened to claim a first green jacket to become only the sixth player in history to win all four major titles and saw Spieth follow up his second place at Augusta 12 months ago with a record-breaking victory. Graeme McDowell watches his tee shot on the fourth hole at Augusta on Friday . Jordan Spieth wears his green jacket after a sensational victory at the Masters on Sunday . 'There are a lot of potential eras evolving,' McDowell said. 'Guys like Rickie Fowler and Dustin Johnson and Patrick Reed. I feel like the young blood is certainly strong here in the States as opposed to the rest of the world. I feel like they certainly have the young potential coming through and it's very good for the game. 'When you look at Ryder Cups I think it makes it very interesting for them. I think our nucleus remains the same going forward but they have a lot of potential young blood coming through which could really change the shape of their team. 'Jordan and Rory are very difficult to compare because they are so different. I think it's a good thing to see a guy coming through who is not Dustin or Rory, guys like that who are dominating with physicality. Spieth celebrates on the 18th green after sealing his maiden major at Augusta National . Rory McIlroy waves to the crowd by the 18th green as his bid to win all four major titles ended . 'We see a guy coming around who is average build, average size, hits it average distance. He's not short but he's not the longest player on the planet and he gets it done other ways. That's exciting.' Spieth was ranked 44th in driving distance with an average of 282 yards, with Johnson (315 yards) top and McIlroy seventh at 297 yards. 'Rory's comparable to Tiger but I don't think Jordan is necessarily comparable to Tiger because of the way he plays the game,' McDowell added. 'I think Jordan is more comparable to a (Jack) Nicklaus or someone like that which is pretty cool.' Rickie Fowler walks off the second green after making a birdie putt during the third round on Saturday . McDowell shows his frustrations after hitting an approach to the second green on Friday . McIlroy added: 'I played well. I can take a lot of positives from it. It is my best ever finish here. I played the last 45 holes in 15 under par. I did a lot of things I wanted to do. 'I played the par-fives well (14 under). Just left myself too much to do after 27 holes of this golf tournament. Forty on the front nine on Friday, that really left me with an uphill battle.

"A defence of his crown will be a priority for Grand National hero Many Clouds next season, and trainer Oliver Sherwood has also floated the possibility of a rematch with his Cheltenham Gold Cup conqueror Coneygree in Newbury’s Hennessy Gold Cup. That race in November has already been identified as a likely target for Coneygree and, even allowing for a rise in his handicap mark, Many Clouds would receive weight from his rival. With 11st 9lb on his back, Leighton Aspell’s mount carried the biggest weight to victory on Saturday since Red Rum won his second National in 1974 at under 12st. Many Clouds, winner of Saturday's Grand National, is shown off during a parade in Lambourn on Sunday . Fans line the streets to pay their well-wishes to the Grand National winning horse . Has AP McCoy finally found his nemesis in Oliver Sherwood? Trainer Sherwood, a Chelsea supporter, and Arsenal fan McCoy have had a regular bet on whose team will finish highest in the Premier League. Sherwood, who ensured the retiring McCoy did not sign off with Grand National glory, said: ‘We have had double or quits, but I have never had to give him anything!’ Sherwood’s desire to return to the National with Many Clouds — the 2014 Hennessy winner who also came sixth in the Gold Cup — rather than prioritise the Gold Cup, is influenced by the fact that with a weight ceiling of 11st 10lb, the gelding will have to carry only an extra pound. Sherwood said: ‘He has nothing to lose by going for the Gold Cup as there is no point me protecting his handicap mark over hurdles. But, having said that, and having seen all the novices that Willie Mullins has, we might just train him for the National and if Coneygree goes for the Hennessy, it would be a very interesting option.’ The training centre of Lambourn in Berkshire was packed on Sunday to welcome its first winner of the £1million Crabbie’s-sponsored race since Jenny Pitman’s Royal Athlete 20 years ago. Among the well-wishers at Sherwood’s Rhonehurst stable, where 1938 National winner Battleship was trained, were Flat trainers Charlie Hills and Jamie Osborne as well as Sherwood’s brother Simon, best known as one of the jockeys to ride the great Desert Orchid. Aspell, the first to ride back-to-back winners on different horses since the 1950s, having landed the race 12 months ago on Pineau de Re, was in action at Market Rasen, where he was unplaced in one ride, but Many Clouds owner Trevor Hemmings, who also owns the Blackpool Tower and Preston North End, as well as a third Grand National winner that he bought for only €6,000 (£4,350), flew in by helicopter from his Isle Of Man home. Many Clouds held his nerve over the closing stages ahead of AP McCoy who was riding Shutthefrontdoor . Winning jockey Leighton Aspell (left) and Many Clouds owner Trevor Hemmings (right) celebrate after victory . The resurgent Sherwood, eighth as a jockey on Venture To Cognac in Corbiere’s 1983 National, had saddled four previous National runners but none had finished. He joked: ‘My record was s*** — it could only get better.’ Fifth-placed Shutthefrontdoor will also be looking to return to Aintree next year, but not, of course, his jockey AP McCoy. He is expected to return to action at Cheltenham on Wednesday and now has only 11 possible racing days until he retires after Sandown’s seasonal finale meeting on April 25. One of the most memorable sights at Saturday’s race was Ruby Walsh becoming a temporary flag man to help wave the field around the Canal Turn on the second circuit.

But a third National with no fatalities since the fences were given softer cores is proof that welfare changes have made a difference to the track. That is underlined by the fact that in that time, in all races over the fences, there have been 395 runners and only one horse has suffered fatal injuries as a result of a fall.","Trainer Oliver Sherwood already has one eye on the 2015 Grand National .

"They came to see the great AP McCoy deliver the Hollywood ending to his record-breaking career, but instead it was left to a jockey previously regarded as a popular journeyman to secure his place in Aintree folklore by winning the Crabbie’s Grand National. Having won last year’s race on Pineau De Re, 38-year-old Leighton Aspell, who once walked away from the sport for 18 months after becoming disillusioned, became the first rider since Bryan Marshall, who won on Royal Tan and Early Mist in 1953 and 1954, to land the biggest jumps race of the year in successive years on different horses. How grateful he is now that that spell away recharged his batteries. Many Clouds was a third winner of the race for owner Trevor Hemmings. The man who owns both Blackpool Tower and Preston North End has also won the race with Hedgehunter in 2005 and Ballabriggs in 2011. Many Clouds, ridden by Leighton Aspell, jumps a fence on the way to winning the Grand National at Aintree . AP McCoy on Shutthefrontdoor (left) congratulates Aspell after Many Clouds' victory on Saturday . While the gelding, whose participation in the race had been in doubt after his disappointing sixth in the Cheltenham Gold Cup last month, also provided a massive change of National luck for his Lambourn trainer Oliver Sherwood. None of his four previous runners in the race had managed to complete the course and two of them — 1988 favourite Sacred Path and Eric’s Charm in 2010 — had fallen at the first fence. Many Clouds passed the line one-and-three-quarter lengths in front of Tom George-trained 33-1 shot Saint Are, with 40-1 chance Monbeg Dude running a massive race in third for his trainer Michael Scudamore and his trio of former international rugby-playing owners Mike Tindall, James Simpson- Daniel and Nicky Robinson. In fourth for the second year running was Fergal O’Brien’s Alvarado, whose finishing position meant jockey Paul Moloney has remarkably been placed seven times in the race. But he never had a chance to lay a glove on Aspell and Many Clouds, who had struck for home well before the home straight. One of the first to congratulate the winning jockey was McCoy. Aspell said: ‘He is as good in defeat as he is when he is winning. I think the only people here happy he has been beaten are me and Andrew Cooper [the supremo at Sandown where McCoy will now end his career on April 25]. I can’t imagine what this place would have been like if he had won. ‘Last year I had to work hard at certain points of the race and I was a very tired man at the end but this time it was very smooth.’ Winning jockey Aspell holds up the Grand National trophy as the 38-year-old celebrates a famous victory . Many Clouds won the National for trainer Oliver Sherwood (centre) and last year's winning jockey Aspell . If Aspell was not fatigued, his mount certainly was and Many Clouds had to be dismounted on the track on welfare grounds to aid a speedy recovery in the wash-down area. He was later paraded in front of the grandstands after the final race of the day. Resurgent trainer Sherwood, whose wife Tarnya rode Numerate and pulled up in the 1989 race, added: ‘He was foot-perfect, I don’t think that he made a mistake. ‘I thought that the race was a year too soon and Trevor knows that. It was his decision to run. ‘It wasn’t my decision, so he must get all the credit, not me. I am in cloud cuckoo land.’ “To this day, I don’t know what happened in the Gold Cup - he didn’t run his race. ‘Something wasn’t right that day, maybe he got out of bed the wrong side. ‘I have done nothing with him since the Gold Cup, just literally one school and he hasn’t seen a National fence on purpose. All we have done just to freshen him up.’ Nineteen of the 39 starters finished the race and all horses emerged unscathed, although Balthazar King was still under veterinary observation last night after a heavy fall at the first Canal Turn which caused the fence to be bypassed by the field on the second circuit. Aspell, riding  Many Clouds (right), goes toe-to-toe with second placed Saint Are (centre) along the final straight . Last year's winning jockey Aspell celebrates his victory as Many Clouds slows to a halt after the race . Early exits included Al Co, one of three to get no further than the first fence, and Unioniste, who fell at the fifth. If there was an unlucky horse in the race it had to be The Druids Nephew, who was bowling along powerfully in the lead under Aidan Coleman when falling at the 26th fence. By then the writing was on the wall for well-backed 8-1 shot Rocky Creek, who faded into 17th, and last year’s winner Pineau de Re, this time ridden to 12th place by Daryl Jacob. But there still seemed a big chance of glory for McCoy, who had positioned Shutthefrontdoor close behind the leaders throughout. McCoy said: ‘He ran a blinder. I was delighted with him. He was just a little fresh and didn’t get home.’ The Aintree course, packed to the rafters with 72,000 fans, has been the backdrop to some remarkable stories in its long history and many had arrived in this suburb of Liverpool with both hope and expectations of witnessing a piece of sporting folklore unfolding. Winning horse Many Clouds is doused with water shortly after winning the Grand National in Liverpool . Many Clouds (far right) leaps over the water jump during the Grand National at Aintree on Saturday afternoon . The mass plunge predicted by the bookmakers on McCoy’s mount didn’t quite materialise and his failure to secure the 4,348th victory of his career on the Jonjo O’Neill-trained 6-1 favourite saved the bookmakers up to £50 million.They had predicted successful McCoy and Shuthefrontdoor, carrying the money of thousands of once-a-year punters would cost them in the region of £50million. There had even been speculation that some firms might have been so dented by the avalanche of bets on the retiring hero that they will have to issue profit warning come Monday morning. Instead of profit warnings being issued on Monday morning, the sound of popping champagne corks will be echoing around boardrooms. Dave Stevens of Coral said: ‘The victory of Many Clouds would certainly have been cheered by some punters, but we have absolutely no complaints about the result, and would place it in the “very good” category.’ A disappointed McCoy after finishing fifth in his final Grand National before retiring . McCoy opens the newly named McCoy's bar before the race on Saturday . Before racing, McCoy, inducted into the Aintree Hall of Fame on Thursday, had been honoured when the bar created out of the old weighing room was renamed in his honour. On Saturday may not have gone to script but, for years to come in McCoy’s, they will toast the patron saint of punters and his never-say-die attitude. Plenty would argue his achievements make him worthy of mention in the same breath as the great Australian batsman Sir Don Bradman, who, back in 1948, needed to score only four runs in his final Test innings to end with a batting average of 100. He was out for a second-ball duck — an example of just how hard it is to script the perfect denouement. Driving away from Aintree last night, the great McCoy will have known exactly how The Don must have felt.","Cloud Nine ridden by Leighton Aspell won the Grand National at Aintree .

"Brian O’Driscoll believes Roman Abramovich style investment is needed to turn English clubs back into a European force but admits that scrapping the salary cap would be dangerous. With the French league becoming a honeypot for billionaire financiers – comic book tycoon Mourad Boudjellal has used his chequebook to turn Toulon into double European champions – the gulf between clubs from the Aviva Premiership and the Top 14 is bigger than ever. Saracens are the only English team featuring in this weekend’s Champions Cup semi-finals and, with the west London side being major underdogs against Clermont Auvergne, Ireland legend O’Driscoll believes the domestic game needs to readdress the balance. Brian O’Driscoll believes huge investment is needed to turn English clubs back into a European force . O'Driscoll says it's a money issue for English sides and they need Roman Abramovich style investment . ‘When you walk about French dominance, the teams are coming from France but the players aren’t,’ said O’Driscoll. ‘It’s a money issue – players are not just moving to France for a tan. The English utopia is that each club gets a Roman Abramovich, who makes it their little pet. ‘Then they are able to extend salary caps and attract better players. That married with the best of the English academy players coming through – of course they’d then be competitive again. But certain English clubs are being squeezed and the cap is there to save them. Not many clubs are profitable and you have to be careful because the long-term picture could be trouble.’ While Toulon have flexed their financial muscles by recruiting international stars such as Brian Habana, Matt Giteau and Leigh Halfpenny, English clubs have found themselves priced out of the market for southern hemisphere superstars. The trend looks set to continue after the World Cup, with All Black trio Dan Carter, Ma’a Nonu and Conrad Smith among those already signed up by Top 14 clubs. Clermont, who face Saracens in Saint Etienne on Saturday, have an impressive raft of imports including Jonathan Davies, Zac Guildford and Napolioni Nalaga. The Massif Central outfit, according to O’Driscoll, are the best club to never have been crowned European champions and should be the favourites for the title. New Zealand's Dan Carter has already signed with Racing Metro for after this year's World Cup . Saracens (pictured training this week) are the only English team left in the Champions Cup . Among those expats is full-back Nick Abendanon, who shone in the quarter-final victory over Northampton. O’Driscoll believes that, along with Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage, the Englishman should feature in this year’s World Cup - calling for the RFU to activate the ‘exceptional circumstance’ clause geared towards overseas players. ‘From a player point of view: yes they should both be be picked,’ said BT Pundit O’Driscoll. ‘They are the players playing the best at the moment and you pick on form. But when you set out your stall early and you then have to backtrack a bit, I don’t know if you lose a bit of face. You create your own stick to be beaten with. ‘It’s better to have guys coming in during the autumn than guys coming in now for the August matches: hurry, hurry, get to know one another, get some chemistry. That’s difficult. But class is class. What is the balance you go for? Personally, I think you play the best players.’ Watch Clermont Auvergne v Saracens exclusively live on BT Sport 1 this Saturday from 2.30pm.

"England wing Christian Wade has been slammed by Wasps team-mate Andy Goode after he failed to show up to a charity function on Tuesday night. Goode accused the 23-year-old of having ‘bad values’ for dropping out of a fundraising event for the Matt Hampson Foundation — set up by and named after the paralysed former Leicester Tigers prop — because he was ‘too tired’. Danny Cipriani, Shaun Edwards and Mark Cueto were among the stars at the ‘Beers with the Boys’ night in Birmingham, where guests were also treated to a Haka performance by Leicester team-mates Manu Tuilagi and Logovi’i Mulipola. The Matt Hampson foundation's event was on Wednesday, named after the former England U21 prop (left) Andy Goode tweeted: 'Bad values from @ChristianWade3 agreeing to come to a charity event for @Hambofoundation then saying he's too tired, poor culture & no trust' A host of rugby stars attended the event for former England U21 prop Hampson but Christian Wade did not . Wade, 23, did not attend and clearly infuriated veteran  Goode, who will join London Irish in the summer . Sportsmail understands that Wade pulled out because of an injury rehabilitation session the following morning but, despite the event’s success, Goode did not hold back with his public criticism. The 35-year-old No 10, capped 17 times by England, tweeted: ‘Bad values from @ChristianWade3 agreeing to come to a charity event for @Hambofoundation then saying he’s too tired, poor culture & no trust.’ Wade did not reply to the message that split opinion among supporters and Wasps refused to comment. Wade, who missed out on the RBS 6 Nations, is recovering from a hamstring injury and was sidelined for the recent Champions Cup quarter-final defeat by Toulon. Wasps’ European exit highlighted the financial gulf between English and French clubs, with Ireland legend Brian O’Driscoll claiming that Roman Abramovich-style investment is needed to boost domestic sides. With French outfits such as Toulon becoming a honeypot for billionaire financiers, the gulf is bigger than ever. Hampson tweeted as his charity aims to inspire and support young people seriously injured through sport . Former England fly half Goode slammed his Wasps team-mate Wade (pictured) on Twitter afterwards . However, with Saracens taking on Clermont Auvergne in Saint-Etienne tomorrow, the BT Sport pundit stressed the importance of the salary cap for smaller clubs. ‘When you talk about French dominance, the teams are coming from France but the players aren’t,’ said O’Driscoll. ‘It’s a money issue — players are not just moving to France for a tan.

"France legend Serge Betsen tells Sportsmail where he thinks Clermont's clash with Saracens at Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be won... HEAD TO HEADS . Wesley Fofana v Brad Barritt . If there is one genius in French rugby at the moment, it’s Wesley Fofana. The kid is so talented and skilful that something happens every time he gets the ball so Saracens will need to focus on him. He is up against Brad Barritt, who is not as easy on the eye but is a very solid unit for Saracens — hence why they have made him captain. He reminds me of former British Lions flanker Richard Hill — someone you don’t really notice but is so important for the team. Clermont centre Wesley Fofana was in scintillating form during his side's recent destruction of Northampton . Brad Barritt is back to anchor the Saracens midfield against the Top 14 giants . Julien Bonnaire vs Billy Vunipola . Julien Bonnaire may be a flanker and Billy Vunipola a No 8, but when you play flanker, you’re the first man who is going to tackle the No 8. Saracens will be looking to launch Vunipola as chief ball-carrier from the back of the scrum and Bonnaire will be there to stop him. Fritz Lee performs a similar running role for Clermont, but Vunipola is key to Saracens’ game plan. No 8 Billy Vunipola is a Saracens' most devastating ball carrier and his power will be needed on Saturday . Brock James v Charlie Hodgson . How will Brock James handle the occasion? His skills and game management are second-to-none, but he has been known to succumb to the pressure on the big stage. Saracens will try to get in his face early to disrupt the rhythm. Charlie Hodgson has been around for a long time now and is enjoying some good form. KEY AREAS . Rush defence . A red and black wall of defenders stopped Clermont from scoring a try in last year’s semi-final, which Saracens won so ruthlessly. Their defensive line was up so quickly and Clermont were taken by surprise. When you play against that sort of rush defence, you need to stand deeper in attack and maybe exploit it by kicking over the top. But Clermont are most effective with the ball in hand, especially with their back-three combination of Noa Nakaitaci, Naipolioni Nalaga and Englishman Nick Abendanon. Former Bath full back Nick Abendanon is just one of several dangerous backs at Clermont's disposal . Breakdown battle . In France, training is geared more towards flair and creativity so less time is spent working on the breakdown. During my time with Wasps, we spent hours focusing on the post-tackle area. Clermont will fear Jacques Burger after his performance on the flank last year and they must work hard to nullify him around the edges of the breakdown. The key for the French is to keep their discipline and not concede penalties. Clermont will be wary of Saracens flanker Jacques Burger following his tour-de-force in Twickenham last year . Silence the crowd . Although this game is being played at a ‘neutral’ venue, it will still feel like a home game for Clermont. The Top 14 side have the best supporters in French rugby and it’s only a 90-mile journey to the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in St Etienne for their fans, who follow their side everywhere. Saracens must be wary of the reception they’ll get but they can keep the fans quiet by building an early lead. When Clermont are behind, their heads can drop. But my gut tells me they will come away with the win today. Clermont warm up in front of their fans at Stade Marcel Michelin before their Top 14 game against Oyonnax .","Saracens skipper Brad Barritt will line up opposite Wesley Fofana .

The Board of Control for Cricket In India confirmed on their official Twitter account that 20-year-old Ankit Keshri had passed away after suffering 'a cardiac arrest following on-field injury'. According to reports, Keshri colleded with a team-mate as they both attempted to take a catch in a senior one-day match match in Kolkata on Friday, and though he regained consciousness afterwards, he died in hospital on Monday. Keshri was only playing as a substitute fielder having been the 12th man. Ankit Keshri had passed away after suffering a cardiac arrest following an on-field injury in Kolkata .

"Ian Bell insists England did not underestimate the West Indies ahead of the first Test, despite some injudicious comments from the incoming chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board. Outgoing Yorkshire chairman Colin Graves, who starts work as Giles Clarke's successor next month, upped the stakes before the tour started by declaring the hosts 'mediocre' and promised 'some inquiries' if England did not win the series. The West Indies hung on for a draw on an unresponsive pitch in Antigua last week and the prospect of a similar deck in Grenada on Tuesday means fulfilling Graves' expectations could be a tough task. Ian Bell says he never expected England to win the series in the West Indies without a struggle . But Bell, after 106 Tests and 11 years on the international circuit, never expected anything different. 'We're not in control of those comments (from Graves), but we know and respect this West Indies side incredibly,' said the 33-year-old. 'I certainly didn't turn up here expecting for them to roll over and this to be an easy series. You never expect that in any international cricket, let alone a Test team. 'I'm not surprised at all. I expected competition. 'There's some good young players in that West Indies side. We saw the way Jason Holder played at the end, in a fantastic maiden hundred, and the way Jerome Taylor bowled, in particular with the new ball, showed we have to play good cricket here. 'Do we believe we can win the series? Yes, but there's a lot of hard work needed to do that.' Bell may have said all the right things but Windies opener Devon Smith, who will become the first Grenadan to play Test cricket on the island, revealed that Graves' comments had not gone unnoticed. Bell scored a magnificent hundred in the first Test, but England failed to see out the win . 'They said in the press they would win three to love, that's the first one down and we're looking forward to the next two to come,' he said. 'It motivates me, and the whole team, to go out there and prove them wrong for whatever they said. 'Sometimes it's good to be underdogs. At least you have nothing to lose and something to prove. 'We have no pressure now. England have the pressure because they are looking for the victory.' There is no doubt that the home team were more content with a shared game at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium and two more draws would be seen as a move in the right direction under new coach Phil Simmons. That places the onus on England to move the matches forward, but Bell believes the West Indies are harbouring their own hopes of victory. 'They are out here to beat us. They have had opportunities to put us under real pressure,' he said. Bell was full of praise for Jason Holder (right) who dug in to help save the Test for the West Indies . 'Would we be disappointed if it was 0-0 going home? Yes of course we would. 'In any series we played we would be disappointed not to win it but we are out to do that and hopefully this is the start here and then we go on and finish it in Barbados. 'Mentally we have to start again. The scoreboards are back on nought and we've got to work hard for five days to get a result.' England's batsmen netted for the first time at the National Stadium in St George's on Sunday, though the bowlers were given a rest day following a long day in the field on Friday. Moeen Ali was present, batting and bowling in a bid to prove his fitness following an abdominal injury sustained at the World Cup. The all-rounder played one LV= County Championship match for Worcestershire before being added to the original 16-man squad and looks certain to play in the second Test. His presence, probably ahead of James Tredwell, would give England's batting line-up explosive depth down to number eight, with Moeen, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler all jostling for position. While the exiled Kevin Pietersen attempts to force his way back into the Test side with Surrey, Bell is focused on the young talents who are currently wearing the Three Lions. West Indian batsman Devon Smith admitted his side were inspired by Colin Graves' comments . 'Mo is a quality batter and a quality bowler so we will have to fit him in somewhere. With Joe Root, Stokes and Buttler that is an exciting lower order,' said Bell. 'If we can get off to a good start, they're going to be worth watching, especially if Stokesy plays like he did the other day. 'They'll give a lot of entertainment over the next few months. To be a senior player in the middle of that exciting young group is a nice place to be.'","Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves called West Indies 'mediocre'

"England must decide whether to stick with the attack that failed to force a first Test win or twist and freshen things up for a second match that is already upon them. The sight of Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood impressing in the nets here on Sunday, and Moeen Ali bowling apparently without discomfort after joining the squad, was a reminder that England have options for the second Test which starts on Tuesday. It would be harsh to blame the bowlers for their inability to take the eight wickets they needed on the final day of the Antigua Test because they threw everything at West Indies on a pitch that refused to deteriorate. Liam Plunkett, pictured with Chris Jordan, is pushing for a place in England's attack for the second Test . Mark Wood (pictured) and Plunkett impressed in the nets on Sunday ahead of the second match of the series . Yet there is no doubting that they were missing an X-factor, with strike bowlers Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad down on pace and England refusing to gamble on the inconsistent leg-spin of Adil Rashid. Chris Jordan was the fastest bowler in the first Test, clocked at 91mph, and while it would be a huge surprise if England dropped either Anderson or Broad, there is a case for Plunkett or the impressive Wood to feature. ‘Over the next 12 months we are going to need a squad of bowlers who can win us Test matches,’ said vice-captain Ian Bell after England’s first look at the National Stadium here. ‘Both Wood and Plunkett are bowling with really good pace and that’s important with so many Test matches to come.’ Moeen Ali has joined up with the England squad after missing the first Test in Antigua through injury . Moeen provides an option for the England selectors while Jonathan Trott appeared in good spirits on Sunday . If Moeen convinces England he is fully fit after recovering from a side injury he will probably replace James Tredwell, who took five wickets in the first Test but is now nursing a shoulder injury. That would add even more depth to an England middle order who all contributed in Antigua, with either Moeen, Ben Stokes or Jos Buttler batting as low as eight on the spice island. Meanwhile, forme rAustralia captain Steve Waugh has urged the ECB to end the ‘circus’ surrounding Kevin Pietersen’s potential England recall. Waugh said Pietersen, who was dismissed for 19 in Surrey’s first innings against Glamorgan yesterday, is ‘no longer a great player’ and does not deserve to play in this summer’s Ashes series. ‘It’s all chaotic,’ said Waugh. ‘The ECB have got to clear it up. Just make the decision and stop messing around because you’re creating a circus which is distracting everybody else.’","Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood both impressed in the nets on Sunday .

"Jonathan Davies has warned Saracens that Clermont Auvergne are ‘sharpening the blade’ ahead of Saturday’s Champions Cup semi-final having made easy meat of Northampton. Clermont thrashed the English champions 37-5 in the last-eight tie at the Stade Marcel-Michelin and - with a place at the Twickenham final in sight - the French outfit are now plotting the downfall of the Aviva Premiership’s second best side. Both clubs are going in search of their first-ever European crown and, after leaving Wales in search of continental success last summer, Davies is determined to deliver another perfect performance in Saint Etienne. Jonathan Davies says Clermont are relishing Champions Cup semi-final against Northampton . ‘The plan is to replicate the Northampton display,’ said Davies. ‘People talk about it as the complete performance, but we should always expect to deliver that sort of intensity, accuracy and execution. It wasn’t a surprise to me. ‘There is an expectation on us but we can use that as a positive - we’re in a good place at the moment. We got some quality training in at the start of this week and we can really sharpen the blade on Thursday and Friday. When Saturday comes, everyone is on the same page to deliver and execute.’ Despite this weekend’s fixture being played at a ‘neutral’ venue, Clermont are expecting more supporters than at a typical sell-out fixture at their 18,000-capacity home ground. It is a 90-mile drive from the industrial town to the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, where the Top 14 side are aiming to make amends for last year’s semi-final defeat at the hands of Saracens. Clermont are aiming to make amends for last year’s semi-final defeat at the hands of Saracens . ‘For 18,000 people to make that much noise in the quarter-final was quite special,’ said Davies. ‘Hopefully they’ll be even louder in St Etienne. The home crowd put out a rallying call; it’s a very proud area and there are expectations. ‘It’s nice to have that burden of making sure you deliver. Over the last few years we haven’t done that, but this year there is an edge and clarity. It’s good to draw on past experiences to help with the now. We all know what we want to achieve.’ According to Davies, the Clermont gameplan is simple: build an early lead, ease the pressure and force Saracens to run the ball rather than kick. The 27-year-old wants to nullify the aerial threat of half-backs Richard Wigglesworth and Charlie Hodgson, with Owen Farrell’s return to the bench adding to yesterday’s good news that George Kruis has signed a long-term contract extension. Clermont thrashed English champions Northampton in the previous round . While Saracens are flying the English flag in Europe’s premier competition, Exeter are preparing to face Gloucester in the second-tier Challenge Cup. Having overcome Lions and Northampton front-row Alex Corbisiero in the scrum on Sunday, it will be another chance for Anglo-Welsh tight-head Tomas Francis to impress.

Warren Gatland has earmarked the 22-year-old for the World Cup but - while his loyalties now sway towards Wales – 21st2lb Francis would be open to a phonecall from the England coaches. ‘I have spoken to England in the past but no real conversations,’ revealed Francis. ‘Back in the autumn, they said I was on the radar. Wales were in touch around the same time, but my body was not ready for the next step up from the Championship. ‘At the minute, Wales are the ones in touch. If it came around then I would be happy to speak to Stuart Lancaster and I would have to think about it again.

"Kevin Pietersen's attempt to impress the England selectors ended in failure in Cardiff on Sunday afternoon. In the same Swalec Stadium arena where Pietersen hopes to be batting against Australia in the first Ashes Test this summer, the Surrey batsman fell for 19 after appearing to be ready to build on the 170 he made against the Oxford students last week. Pietersen was making his first LV= County Championship appearance since June 2013 in the hope of finding a way back into the England set-up.

The former England star's expression tells the story as he sees the ball held at first slip . The 34-year-old came to the wicket just after lunch with Surrey well placed on 111 for two and he was soon into his stride with two boundaries - one through the legside and the other a fine cover drive - in the same Andy Carter over. Pietersen was fortunate to escape with a mistimed hook off Graham Wagg, which just beat the fine-leg fielder, but he picked up the fourth boundary of his innings when he drove the ball over the head of left-arm spinner Dean Cosker.

Selby, despite being just two months older than Maflin, is an old hand at the tournament, having made his first World Championship appearance 10 years ago. They shared the four frames before the mid-session interval, Maflin making runs of 96 and 60, before Selby opened a two-frame lead and then also claimed the seventh after a re-spotted black. It looked a pivotal frame, as Maflin twice attempted to double in the black but on the second occasion left Selby a long pot, which he fired assuredly into the centre of the pocket. Selby match against Maflin concludes on Saturday, the only clash to finish on day one of the tournament . Back came Maflin with an 88 break, but when Selby bustled through the last of the session he had a commanding advantage to take into the concluding session, needing just four more frames to reach the second round. Hong Kong cueman Marco Fu took the final frame of the session with a break of 66 to nudge 5-4 in front of Bexhill's Jimmy Robertson. Robertson was mauled 10-1 by Selby when making his World Championship debut four years ago, but after qualifying for the second time was making a stronger fist this time. The 28-year-old Englishman briefly threatened to make a 147 maximum break, which would have been the 11th in the tournament's history, but missed the 11th red in the fifth frame.","Mark Selby leads Kurt Maflin 6-3 and needs only four more frames to win .

"The SRU have clinched the biggest shirt sponsorship deal in their history after agreeing a £3.6million contract over three years with BT. Sportsmail exclusively revealed last year that BT had agreed to pay £20m over four years for the naming rights of Murrayfield — and that the telecommunications giant would follow that up with a deal to have their trademarks on the famous dark blue jersey. Now that has come to fruition and, come the summer, they will take over from ousted backers RBS. The SRU insisted the combination of the initial BT investment coupled with the new cash injection from the strip deal had already started to transform Scottish rugby. The Scotland shirt, worn here by David Denton, will have BT on it rather than RBS from the summer . ‘I am delighted BT will be the new strip partner of the Scotland teams and although I cannot confirm how much the deal is worth as it is commercially sensitive, I can confirm it is the largest ever shirt sponsorship deal we have done,’ said Dominic McKay, the SRU’s Director of Commercial Operations, Communications and Public Affairs. ‘BT is now very much under the skin of Scottish rugby and their cash has allowed us to invest in a way we have not been able to ever before. Their brand will now be seen by millions of fans around the world on the iconic dark blue jersey of the Scotland team, which shows their further commitment and desire to help us develop all elements of our game.’ All form of jersey advertising is banned during the forthcoming Rugby World Cup in England later this year but Scotland will have BT branding on their training tops. The SRU say that the Scotland Under-20 side will be the first team to run out with BT on their jerseys when they compete in the World Rugby Under-20 Championship in June and the senior side will first wear the logo on their jerseys during their World Cup warm-up fixture against Italy in August. The Scotland Women’s team will also wear the national jersey with the BT logo on it as will all age-grade sides. McKay said the cash was being spent from pro level down to the grassroots, with clubs all over Scotland set to benefit under the long-term sponsorship deals. A general view of Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh ahead of an RBS Six Nations match in February . ‘BT’s initial investment was around Glasgow and Edinburgh when they became their principal shirt partners,’ he continued. ‘Since then, that investment has gone into Scottish rugby to enhance and develop both those brands and help pay to bring in new players and bring on younger ones. ‘You can see the success of Glasgow who are sitting top of the PRO12 table and part of that is a result of their investment. Edinburgh are going for a place in the European Challenge Cup final and that will be live on BT sport on Friday night. There is a demonstration at the partnership in action. ‘At club level you have seen clubs participate in the BT Scottish Cup and BT Premiership. They are also dipping in to the funds for clubs we have set up to enhance their premises and pitches that has around £400,000 a year available and we are going through the new applications for money just now.’ McKay added that bringing on the next generation of Scottish rugby players was vital, which was why much of the cash would be spent setting up and running regional rugby academies over the duration of the BT deal. One has already been created in Aberdeen with others to follow to cover Edinburgh and Glasgow as well as the Borders. Brendan Dick, Director of BT Scotland, added: ‘This will showcase our partnership on a global stage and demonstrates our support of Scottish Rugby. Our partnership with Scottish Rugby touches all levels of rugby within Scotland and it is fantastic to see the investment become a reality for communities and families across Scotland and to start to make a difference.’","The SRU have agreed a £3.6m contract over three years with BT .

"The Crucible Curse will be one weight on the mind of Mark Selby on Saturday, but the mercurial talents of a debutant capable of ‘absolutely murdering anybody’ will be another altogether. The world champion will have to negotiate both if he is to make history in Sheffield. It is one of the quirks of this venue that no first-time winner has retained his title the next year. While that statistical curiosity has added an element of pressure to Selby, so too has the presence of Kurt Maflin, one of four men making their first appearance in the main draw. Mark Selby poses with the trophy after winning the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible in 2014 . What an intriguing figure he is, a Londoner based in Norway who was once a child star but has reached the age of 31 without making any great dents on the game. That appears to be changing with his recent appearance in the China Open semi-final, where he lost 6-3 to Selby. He is one of only 21 players in history to have hit multiple 147 breaks in professional competitions. Maflin’s chances against the world No 1 appear slim in the extreme, but six-time runner up Jimmy White told Sportsmail: ‘He has got one of the biggest talents I have seen in the game. If he produces his game he could absolutely murder anybody. Let us see how he gets on against Selby. He is the one who could produce something magical. He is very exciting and very attacking. If they go in he can beat anyone.’ Maflin demonstrated those gifts in demolishing Steve Davis 10-1 in qualifying. But Selby ought to be a significantly different proposition, having won two titles this season ahead of his defence, which starts this morning. Selby (above) will face tournament debutant Kurt Maflin in the first round on Saturday . Maflin (above lost to Selby in the semi-final of the World Snooker China Open earlier this month . White has tipped Selby as one of his ‘three to watch, with Judd Trump and Ronnie O’Sullivan, my big favourite’. Referring to the hoodoo surrounding first-time winners, Selby said: ‘It is a curse and it is going to be difficult but I will just try my best. It shows how difficult the tournament is to win. It is in the back of my mind, you can’t take that away. Just to win it once as I did last year was a fantastic achievement for me but to win it twice and break the curse would be outstanding. ‘Even if I wasn’t defending champion I’d be nervous. It would be wrong if you didn’t get butterflies because it is such a great tournament and such a great venue. But hopefully the nerves will inspire me and I’ll play better.’ O’Sullivan begins his bid for a sixth world title against debutant Craig Steadman on Tuesday.","Mark Selby plays Kurt Maflin in first round of the World Championnship .

"Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata insists his side can be proud of their performance during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea and congratulates his former side as they close in on the Premier League title.

Juan Mata escapes clutches of Cesar Azpilicueta during clash between Chelsea and Manchester United . It was Mata's first return to Stamford Bridge since he left Chelsea in January last year . But United dominated possession  and limited Chelsea to just two shots on target and Mata, who returned to Stamford Bridge for the first time since leaving the club in January last year, claims his side can take many positives from the game. 'I had mixed feelings,' Mata wrote on his blog on Monday. 'I was angry about the defeat, I was thrilled after seeing some old friends, but especially I was proud.' 'I felt proud of the game the team had played, keeping the ball possession, controlling the game and creating chances to score, and all this at Stamford Bridge against the leader. 'As our manager said after the game, we were loyal to our football idea, and despite the score didn’t show that, if we keep playing like this there will be many more wins than defeats, I’m pretty sure of that. Mata embraces former team-mate Eden Hazard, who scored the winning goal, before kick-off . 'Besides, the team showed personality by playing that way against such a tough opponent, who gave no space in their half of the pitch and defended with so many players.'

"The first double hundred of Alex Hales' career helped Nottinghamshire into a position of strength on the opening day of their LV= County Championship match against Yorkshire at Trent Bridge. The England international was unbeaten on 222 not out as the home side reached 393 for seven by stumps, having been invited to bat first. Hales scored his runs from 250 balls, with 37 fours and a six and having shared in a third wicket stand of 171 with James Taylor, who scored 59. Steven Patterson, with two for 58 and Jack Brooks, two for 90, returned the leading figures for the Yorkshire bowlers on a tough day for the defending Champions. Alex Hales, pictured in action for Nottinghamshire earlier this month, completed a double century on Sunday . Hales' passed three figures for the 10th time in his career, spoiling the return of Andrew Gale, back skippering Yorkshire again after serving a four match suspension. Gale rotated all seven bowlers at his disposal but all found it difficult to put the brake on Hales' scoring. In general, too much width was offered to the 26-year-old and he capitalised fully to reach his century from 131 balls and his 150 from 173. Taylor was a perfect foil for his World Cup team-mate, content to play the supportive role in reaching his own 50 from 89 balls, with nine fours.Yorkshire's spirits were lifted just before the tea interval when Brooks struck twice in an over, snaring Taylor with an lbw decision and then providing enough temptation for Samit Patel to nudge one into the hands of Alex Lees at first slip. Riki Wessels made 18 before falling just before the taking of the second new ball, guiding Nottingham-born Will Rhodes to second slip. Hales, in action during an England nets session in Australia in March, hasn't given up on playing Test cricket . Hales went past his previous best of 184, made against Somerset in 2011, and then had his only two scares of the day, against the bowling of Patterson. An uppish chip to mid-on was totally missed by Rhodes, who claimed he lost the flight of the ball. On 197 a huge shout for lbw was turned down by umpire Russell Evans, to the dismay of the entire fielding unit. A four off Bresnan eased home nerves, though, and a standing ovation was duly afforded Hales for reaching the 200 landmark from 234 deliveries. He will return on the second morning, after the final over of the day was cut short following the dismissal of Will Gidman, also caught in the slip cordon, off Patterson. Nottinghamshire's openers both made 27 before the visiting attack struck twice during the morning session. Steven Mullaney was given out lbw to Patterson, beaten by one that came back and missed the inside edge. Brendan Taylor, who had scored centuries in both of his first class appearances this season, became a notable first scalp for Matthew Fisher, who at 17 years 161 days is Yorkshire's sixth youngest debutant, but it mattered little once Hales got to work. Hales hopes his brilliant knock against Yorkshire sends a message to the England selectors . Hales said: 'It's a very proud day for me to make that score against the county champions and against a very good attack. 'I'm very pleased with how the day has gone, it has been one of those days where all the shots I've tried have come off. 'They bowled pretty well at me in the morning session but I knew if I got through it, it would become easier and I'd be all right.' Asked if his knock had sent any sort of message to the England selectors, he added: 'I hope to show that I can make scores in all three formats. 'This year I want to make as many big scores as I can in this format because it's still my dream to play Test cricket.' Yorkshire captain Gale said: 'We weren't at our best today but fair play to Alex Hales. 'I thought he played really well - a chanceless innings really - but we only bowled to 60 or 70 per cent of our potential. 'It was a good toss to win, there was plenty in the wicket in the first session but we didn't utilise it. 'It was just nice to get back out over the white line and get 96 overs in the legs. I hope we can get it right in the morning and bowl them out quickly.'","Alex Hales was unbeaten on 222 not out for Nottinghamshire who reached 393 for seven by stumps in their clash against Yorkshire .

"West Brom manager Tony Pulis will receive a hero's welcome when he returns to Crystal Palace on Saturday but in the midst of yet another relegation battle for the 57-year-old, he must wonder if he'll ever be successful at the right end of the Premier League. For all the expertise Pulis has in keeping clubs in the top flight, a talent that has the everlasting gratitude of Stoke City and Palace supporters, his overall record is one of the worst of any long-serving Premier League manager. This is his seventh season in the top flight and he's never finished in the top half of the table. If, as expected, Garry Monk's Swansea City don't drop lower than 10th, Pulis will be the only manager in the Premier League with more than 12 months experience who has never finished higher than 11th. Tony Pulis has never managed to guide a team into the top half of the Premier League . To add to his frustration as he takes the applause of the Palace fans who remember him for masterminding their great escape last season, Pulis will know he isn't yet guaranteed preserving his proud record of never being relegated. West Brom's home defeats against QPR and Leicester City have left them stuck on 33 points. That is still seven points above the bottom three but with four of their final five fixtures after the weekend coming against Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, there is not much wriggle-room. For many, producing statistics to suggest Pulis could have produced better results is heresy. He won promotion with Stoke City and got them to an FA Cup final. He turned Palace's season around 12 months ago and is still favoured to keep Albion up this time. Pulis did an excellent job in turning around Palace's fortunes last season . Palace fans were pleased with the job Pulis did in his time at Selhurst Park . He is known as a good organiser, a smart tactician and someone who is able to get the best out of players and bend the laws of the game to his advantage. And yet, why has he never finished higher than 11th, achieved in 2009/10 with Stoke and 20013/14 with Palace? It is right to say he has never had the best clubs with the most money to manage and yet Sam Allardyce finished sixth with Bolton, Mark Hughes sixth with Blackburn Rovers, Mauricio Pochettino eighth with Southampton and Monk is currently eighth with Swansea City. None of them giants of the game. Pulis took Stoke into the Premier League and turned them into an established team . Pardew, who has achieved a similar miracle at Palace this season to what Pulis achieved last season, has a top-five finish at Newcastle United on his cv. Two years ago, Stoke City effectively sacked Pulis, acknowledging the huge contribution he made to the club but feeling he couldn't take them any further. Hughes now has the club sitting in 10th place, higher than Pulis achieved, and on a smaller wages budget. Alan Pardew could guide Crystal Palace into the top half of the table just as Mark Hughes could do at Stoke  - something Pulis never achieved . Pulis will remain plain-speaking til the end. The Welshman won't be able to enjoy his visit to Palace given the importance of the game. 'We need a 90 minutes from the players. I don't care what anyone says, everyone has a go in this division and the lads have to understand that. 'What we have to do is get back to basics and defend properly. Lower league mistakes cost you goals.' You'd back Pulis' message to keep West Brom up. Whether he can take them to a higher level next season is another question. Arsene Wenger (Arsenal) – three-time winner 1998, 2002, 2004 . Jose Mourinho (Chelsea) – two-time winner 2005, 2006 Manuel Pellegrini (Man City) – winner 2014 .

"Hull boss Steve Bruce has admitted his side need to pull off a couple of 'crazy results' if they are to preserve their Premier League status in a frantic end-of-season run-in. The Tigers head to Southampton on Saturday without a win in five games and perching just two points above the bottom three after wins last week for QPR and Leicester. And Bruce hopes the unpredictable nature of this season's top flight will continue into the final weeks, with the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United still due to visit the KC Stadium. Steve Bruce admitted his side need some 'crazy results' if they're going to avoid relegation from the league . Bruce said: 'We have just witnessed over the last week all sorts of crazy results can happen and we need to make sure we get one or two of those, that's for sure. 'We've proved this year that we're capable but we're under no illusions how difficult it is going to be. It is all to play for and it is another big weekend but we have been saying that for the best part of four months. 'The way it's gone all season I wouldn't be surprised if it goes right down to the wire. Last week people were saying QPR and Leicester were gone but all of a sudden they've produced a result and they're back in it again.' Hull face high-flying Southampton knowing that they can't afford to slip up with the bottom three closing . Bruce's biggest selection dilemma for the trip to the south coast is whether to keep faith in goalkeeper Allan McGregor after a pair of high-profile blunders in recent weeks. McGregor was at fault for the opening goal in the 3-1 defeat at Swansea last week and also made a mistake in the loss to Chelsea a fortnight ago, but Bruce sprung to the defence of the under-fire 33-year-old. Bruce said: 'When you're a goalkeeper the one thing the Premier League does is highlight mistakes and unfortunately Allan will be the first to admit he has been disappointed over the last couple of weeks. Allan McGregor (right) could lose his place in the side after a pair of blunders in Hull's recent defeats . 'I haven't made a decision one way or the other, but Allan is a very, very good goalkeeper. Despite his mistakes he is still a top-class keeper.' Veteran Steve Harper is pushing to replace McGregor in Bruce's starting line-up while midfielder Tom Huddlestone is also set to make a welcome return from suspension. However David Meyler is ruled out after his red card last week, Gaston Ramirez is ineligible to play against his parent club and Curtis Davies is an injury doubt. Tom Huddlestone (left) and Andrew Robertson are in line to return for the Tigers after suspension and injury . And Bruce acknowledged his side face a major battle to boost their survival prospects against Ronald Koeman's high-flying Saints whom he rates as the best outside the traditional 'big guns'. 'We will have to be somewhere near our best if we are going to get anything out of them because I rate them very highly,' added Bruce. 'They lost three or four players for big money but they have bought well. They have maintained their position at the top end of the league so fair play to Ronald Koeman and the way the club is run from top to bottom.'","Steve Bruce admits Hull need to pull off 'crazy results' to avoid the drop .

"Liam Phillips knows he must expand his repertoire to aid his bid for Olympic glory. The 26-year-old from Burnham-on-Sea won the 2013 BMX world title and was the World Cup series champion in 2014. Phillips, who races in the Manchester World Cup event this weekend, plans to use 2015 to experiment with tactics in a bid to arrive at the start gate in Rio full of confidence. Liam Phillips in action during the 2012 Olympics, and the 26-year-old is hoping for glory in Rio . 'There are certain areas I need to improve to get on the gate in Rio and know that I've done everything I can to be as good, if not better, than my competitors in every single area,' Phillips said. 'The sport is continuing to improve and I need to continue to improve. 'There's challenges this season that I would love to accomplish, which don't necessarily mean going to a race and winning. 'Last year in Argentina I was in second and almost passed the reigning Olympic champion (Latvia's Maris Strombergs) for the win. 'That's something I feel I'd like a little bit more exposure to - not being out in front and having to try to pass some of the best guys to come back and win. That would add to my box of tricks come the Olympics.' Phillips would dearly love to reclaim the world title he won in Auckland two years ago at this year's World Championships in Belgium in July. 2013 World Champion Phillips hopes to use this year to hone his tactics ahead of the 2016 Olympics . The Somerset ace was the taken out by an ill-thought manoeuvre by France's Damien Godet in Rotterdam last year, ending his stint in the rainbow jersey. Phillips knows his performances in recent seasons mean he is a key rival others will do anything to beat. 'I do have a target on me, because I have performed at a high level over the last few years and I have been world champion,' he added. 'Last year's World Championships was so frustrating because I sacrificed doing a few races before then because I wanted to chuck everything at retaining that title. 'I was absolutely flying and I know that given the opportunity to continue racing I would certainly have been more than capable of retaining that, but that's BMX. 'It's just the nature of it. I don't like to dwell on that. I want to push forward now.' Phillips won the Manchester World Cup event in 2014 and knows he will be expected to perform once again on his home track in Saturday's time-trials and Sunday's Super Cross, where eight riders race at the same time. Phillips failed to defend his title last year, but is determined to take it back this July in Belgium . He added: 'I look back at the World Cup last year and I've never experienced pressure like that. Being reigning world champion, everybody expects you to win. 'There's 150 guys in the race, but everybody is looking at this as my race. It's something I seem to be able to manage and thrive on in some respects.' Phillips leads a five-rider British team, which also features 2014 World Championships bronze medallist Tre Whyte, Kyle Evans and Quillan Isidore. Charlotte Green is the only female representative, although three-time BMX world champion Shanaze Reade is back in the British Cycling set-up, training with the track team.","Liam Phillips was World Cup series champion in 2014 .

The British Olympic Association (BOA) announced on Thursday morning that they had ratified the 24-year-old's move - issuing a statement to confirm the news. Taekwondo fighter Aaron Cook's application to switch allegiances to Moldova has been approved . Three time European champion Aaron Cook (right) has refused to fight for Great Britain since May 2012 . Cook has felt aggrieved at the decision to leave him out of the 2012 London Olympic squad . 'Following a request from taekwondo athlete Aaron Cook to change his sporting nationality from British to Moldovan, the British Olympic Association (BOA) today announced that Cook's request has been approved,' it read. 'The board of the British Olympic Association met on Monday 13 April 2015 to discuss Aaron Cook's request to change his sporting nationality.' There had been long-standing animosity from Cook towards GB Taekwondo after he felt he had been kept out of the squad for London 2012 because he had decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Lutalo Muhammed was selected instead and won the bronze medal, but Sweeney says the door was open for Cook - who has instead opted to represent Moldova. 'We are very disappointed,' the BOA chief executive told BBC Radio Five. 'He is world number one and Olympic-ranked number two. He is a great athlete... and we are saddened to lose an athlete of that calibre who is British. 'For him to move from his country of birth and home nation to represent another country - we are disappointed. 'I can promise you we have been working really hard not only in recent months but for a long time now, both with Aaron and his representatives and British Taekwondo. It has been well documented that there have been some difficulties in that relationship that go back to pre-2012. 'We have been looking to find a solution where we could broker that deal. We have worked hard to make sure there is a robust and fair selection policy in place. He was the name quota athlete to go to Baku European Games in June but in his mind he feels his best opportunity to get to the Olympic Games in 2016 is with another country.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, announced his intention to change nationality in a statement on Facebook at the start of April, saying: 'Although I am upset and disappointed I will not represent my country of birth at another major championships, I felt I had no other option. 'Having received no funding or support from the GB system and financing myself since June 2011, this was not a situation that was acceptable to me and I did not want to put myself, family, friends, supporters or sport through the same situation we were forced to endure at the London 2012 Olympic Games.' Jeremy Beard, the chairman of GB Taekwondo, said in a statement: 'Having secured his place at the upcoming European Games, we are naturally disappointed that Aaron Cook does not wish to represent Great Britain in Baku, nor at the Olympic Games in Rio. 'We have made exhaustive efforts to engage with him and his team for some time, but sadly it seems that he has made the decision that his future lies elsewhere and we wish him well. British Olympic chief Bill Sweeney says there was nothing that could have stopped Cook switching . Cook competes against Mauro Sarmiento at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 . Jamie Cunningham, Cook's former agent, is pleased he has a pathway to the Olympic games . 'Our focus now is on providing the best support we can to the athletes striving to achieve medal success for Great Britain in Baku, at the upcoming World Championships in Russia next month and ultimately at the Olympic Games in 2016.' Cook has previously said he hopes to represent Moldova for the first time at the inaugural Baku European Games in June. His former agent, Jamie Cunningham, tweeted: 'Delighted @aaroncooktkd has clear route to #Rio @& opp to show 2012 was personal. Pity that he won't be @TeamGB but.... #moveon #road2rio.'","Taekwondo star Aaron Cook has changed his nationality to Moldovan .

"Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has been warned he risks creating a lost generation of supporters if he fails to invest in the club. Thousands of fans stayed away from Sunday's Barclays Premier League defeat by Tottenham at St James' Park in protest at the way the sportswear Tycoon is running the club, with the official attendance of 47,427 - the capacity of the stadium is in excess of 52,000 - understood to include many season ticket holders who did not attend. Protesters are calling for a repeat when Swansea head for Tyneside on Saturday, but Mark Jensen, editor of online fanzine www.themag.co.uk, fears longer-term consequences. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has been urged to invest in the club or risk losing a generation of fans . Newcastle fans hold up 'Ashley Out' banners, mocked in the style of his Sports Direct chain of stores . Thousands of Newcastle fans boycotted the club's last game, a 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs on Sunday . Jensen, who himself stayed away from Sunday's game, said: 'I feel sorry for young people, what they are watching now and this lack of ambition. At least when I was young, the team might have been rubbish and we were going nowhere, but it was exciting to be on the terraces. 'There was so much more wrapped up in it, whereas now if the football is rubbish, I'm not quite sure what the lure is. 'That's a long-term danger. Whether Mike Ashley is here in the future or not, there's a danger that you are turning all these people off Newcastle United and going to the match, especially with the rival attraction of being able to watch it in your local pub.' Unofficial estimates have put the actual attendance for the 3-1 defeat by Spurs at significantly lower than 47,000, although some have seemed wildly optimistic. However, there is little doubt that those who answered calls for a boycott made an impact. Jensen said: 'I thought it was a massive success. Comparing it with the walk-out at the end of last season, basically it's always going to be symbolic. 'It's not going to bring Mike Ashley to his knees, but to have thousands and thousands of people, or whatever figure you want to put on it, who have already paid for something not going to the match... 'Imagine thousands of people going to Tesco or Sainsbury's and buying £30 worth of shopping and saying, 'Hang on a second, I'm not happy, you can have your shopping back'. It's a massive statement.' Last week's revelation that the club banked in excess of £34million as well as recording a profit of £18.7million for the last financial year has simply served to increase anger among fans, who have seen a squad assembled on a budget struggle to compete during the second half of the current campaign, and not for the first time in recent years. Tottenham striker Harry Kane nets his 20th league goal of the season to round off a 3-1 win over Newcastle . A fan holds up a sign protesting against Ashley's ownership as Newcastle slump to a sixth straight defeat . Newcastle midfielder Remy Cabella (left) jostles for possession with Tottenham's Paulinho (right) on Sunday . They have not been placated by head coach John Carver's insistence that there will be investment during the summer, and an increasingly vocal lobby are demanding that Ashley sells up. Jensen said: 'When you see the benefits that he's getting, as well as now profits in each of the last four years and the way that the TV income is going, to those people who say, 'Why isn't there a buyer? There isn't one' - why wouldn't there be a buyer? 'The climate of Premier League football has totally changed due to these TV deals, and so if you have got a sustainable Premier League club, especially one with the third biggest attendances, at the right price - and with a willing seller - there is definitely a buyer out there.' In the meantime, Carver faces the task of attempting to end a run of six successive league defeats, which has left the club just seven points clear of the drop zone, against the Swans. He said: 'I think there's enough experience to deal with it, yes. But we have got to stop losing players, though, sendings-off, injury...'

"Somehow, to the backdrop of supporter unrest, protests and a worst-ever start to a Premier League season, Alan Pardew managed to excavate five straight victories from a Newcastle side which ranks as their most uninspiring of recent years. Many fans may be loath to admit as much – others readily do – but without that freakish run manufactured by an embattled Pardew, they would be headed for a second relegation in seven seasons. Remove those five wins and United would have just 20 points – the autumn run, then, has saved them from the fall. Alan Pardew's five-game winning run was crucial to Newcastle's season, who would only be on 20 points . Newcastle's fans protested for the board to sack Pardew as manager and were delighted when he resigned . When Pardew quit for Crystal Palace at the end of December, Newcastle were ninth. They were seven points off fourth and 10 from danger. Today – on the back of six consecutive defeats - they are lucky that seven points still separate them from the bottom three, while the gap to fourth has extended to 29. The 35 points on which they currently reside will probably be enough to renew their top-flight status. Pardew won 26 of those. Three weeks before embarking on that winning stretch, Pardew had appeared on the brink of dismissal. Behind the scenes, owner Mike Ashley was never going to dispense with his manager on the say-so of fan fury. Nonetheless, Pardew cut a resigned and wounded figure following a 1-0 defeat at Stoke which left Newcastle joint bottom with Burnley. Since his departure the players have look uninterested and unhappy playing for the club and John Carver . From the negativity, however, was born a perverse positivity, driven by Pardew’ s determination to repair a reputation so badly stained that his next posting would surely have been outside of the Premier League. Crucially, he kept his players on side – no mean feat given their current levels of disinterest – and so emerged a siege mentality which, on reflection, was to yield a season-saving 15 points. Reputation restored, Pardew’s exit plan was in place. He’d had enough of playing politician, caught at the centre of a toxic relationship between Ashley and the club’s fanbase. The 53-year-old appeared to have hit rock bottom against Stoke but picked up the players for the winning run . Replacement John Carver – like Pardew, the sole public face of the crisis club – is discovering just how poisonous that atmosphere has become. It has now permeated a playing staff which, like the thousands of supporters who boycotted Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs, have failed to turn up for the best part of 2015. Pardew, of course, was not without some serious flaws, and it was he who presided over six straight losses last season. But in his absence the club has begun to unravel. The squad has shown its true colours – a depressing grey which lacks energy, passion and invention. Carver is proving he's not cut out for top-level management, with two wins in the last 14 games . This sad situation, however, is the cause of a hierarchy which has stripped the club of ambition and meaning. With each passing defeat and demonstration, it becomes more apparent that perhaps Pardew was not the problem. In fact, without him, their problems could have been far worse.","Newcastle would be on 20 points if Alan Pardew's five wins were removed .
