"Cameron Hooker, who kept a hitchhiker as sex slave for seven years, was handed a 104-year sentence in 1985 . A man branded the 'most dangerous psychopath ever encountered' after he kept a young hitchhiker as a sex slave for seven years has been denied parole. Cameron Hooker, 61, was handed a 104-year sentence in 1985 for the kidnap, torture and rape of Colleen Stan. The case made international headlines and Stan was known as 'the Girl in the Box' after it was revealed that she was forced into a coffin-like structure for 23 hours a day during for much of her captivity. Despite Hooker's century-long jail term, he was allowed to request parole  seven years earlier than under the normal rules, USA Today reported. In an attempt to reduce its prison population, California has recently introduced the Elderly Parole Program which allows a parole hearing from inmates older than 60 who have served at least 25 years. But the parole board at Corcoran State Prison, where Hooker is incarcerated, denied the request and have stated the inmate won't get another hearing for 15 years. Luis Patino, a spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said Hooker had been given the longest delay period until his next parole hearing as the board found he was 'far from suitable' for being released. Scroll down for video . In May 1977, Stan had been hitchhiking along Interstate 5 near Redding, California. Despite the high risks involved - it just a few years after the arrest of a serial killer in Santa Cruz who preyed on young female hitchers - the then 20-year-old stick out her thumb and accepted a ride from a young couple traveling with a 7-month-old baby. Colleen Stan was known as 'the Girl in the Box' after it was revealed that she was forced into a coffin-like structure for 23 hours a day during much of her captivity . Stan was tortured, raped and left for days in a head box (right) or another coffin-like box under the couple's bed . The Coffin-like box in which Colleen was held for up to 23-hours a day under Hooker and his wife's bed . Within hours, she was tied up and naked in the basement of Hooker's home 30 miles away. It would be the start of seven torturous years as a captive of the 'psychopath'. Stan was starved, whipped and burned by Hooker, a 23-year-old lumber mill worker. He would tie her to the ceiling by her wrists or leave her for days with a 20-pound hinged wooden box around her head, blocking the outside world. At other times she would be forced into another, coffin-like box under Hooker and his wife Janice's bed, or tied to a rack. The specially-made torture device caused permanent damage to her back and one shoulder. She was also forced to sign a 'slavery contract' which meant she had to do anything Hooker wanted, from sex to the more mundane such as household chores or looking after his children. In 1978, Janice gave birth to a second baby on the water bed above Stan. Hooker had convinced her that if she ever ran away a powerful organisation known as The Company would find her, and would hurt her family. To avoid painful punishments, she said she tried to be a good slave and that due to this she was allowed out to jog, work in the yard, and care for the Hooker children alone in the mobile home. Video courtesy KXTV . Colleen Stan reads about her experiences being held captive by Cameron Hooker in the 1970s and 1980s during a crime victim's ceremony on Thursday in California . Even with an open door, neighbors, and a telephone, Stan made no attempt to escape; she said that her fear of ""The Company"" kept her from seeking help. Neighbors for years believed she was she just the family's helper. In 1981 she was even allowed to visit her family alone but then returned to Hooker, such was the extent to which she was under his control and feared 'The Company'. In 1984 she she was allowed to take a job as a maid at a local hotel. The turning point came in 1984 when Hooker told his wife Janice that he wanted to make Stan his second wife and bring in more female slaves. She told Stan that Hooker wasn't part of The Company and helped her to escape. Stan called Hooker from the bus stop and told him she was leaving him. He was said to have burst into tears. Despite escaping his clutches she continued to call him and refused to report him to the police. She said she wanted to give him the chance to reform. Once back home, Stan went to school for an accounting degree, married, and had a daughter. She also joined an organization to help abused women. It was his wife Janice who finally went to the police and in return for immunity agreed to testify against him. Despite Hooker's (pictured in 1984) century-long jail term, he had qualified for a new prison program which allowed him to request parole seven years earlier than under the normal rules . To the outside world she was simply a live-in housekeeper for the couple. No-one could imagine the horrors that went on behind closed doors. Stan, who was the subject of a best-selling book, Perfect Victim, finally escaped with the help of Hooker's wife Janice in 1984. Now living under a new identity, Stan said she had begun having nightmares that she was under Hooker's control again in the run up to the hearing. After Hooker's request for parole was refused, Stan told KXTV: 'The hearing went really well and I'm really pleased with the results. 'He didn't show any remorse. Basically he's wasted his life, 30 years in prison and hasn't done anything to try to improve himself or change himself or figure out why he did this.' 'I don't know what his health issues are physically or mentally,' Stan said. 'But I don't think he's a feeble old man that couldn't do this again.'","Cameron Hooker had kidnapped young hitchhiker Colleen Stan in 1977 .

"David Letterman stunned his Late Show audience into silence with a joke branded 'disrespectful to women' David Letterman stunned his Late Show audience into silence with a joke which has been branded as 'disrespectful to women'. The veteran host was attempting to warm up the studio audience ahead of his show on Monday when he made the off-colour gag. Letterman had just opened up questions to the floor, and fielded the first query of the night from a college employee, reported the New York Post. They asked what advice the scandal-hit comic would give to this year's graduates. Letterman, who was in 2009 forced to admit to string of affairs, said: 'Treat a lady like a wh–e, and a wh–e like a lady.' But the joke received a frosty reception from the shocked crowd. After being met with stunned silence, the host attempted to recover by offering further advice to graduates to 'eat salad' and 'always be nice'. However, several audience members at the Ed Sullivan Theater were furious over the sexist joke. Retired Jerry Stockton, from Virginia, called it 'disrespectful to women' while another, who would not be named, said it had been an 'odd choice' for the first joke of the evening. The gag is thought to have been a reference to a saying by 1930s screenwriter Wilson Mizner. Scroll down for video . Joe Logan, 41, from Pennsylvania, told the New York Post: 'Younger people watch his show. We already live in a culture that objectifies women, it's not right to make a joke like that.' A Letterman spokesman said he could not 'confirm the accuracy' of Monday's failed joke and would not comment further. But a source close to the show insisted 'It got a big laugh.' Letterman carried on with the show which had guests including John Travolta and Amy Schumer, star of her eponymous Comedy Central show, 'Inside Amy Schumer.' Old friends: David thanked John for being his friend over the decades during Monday's show. It was during a Monday warm up that he made the gag . The Grease actor, 61, had tried to bring his son Ben on to meet his 'old friend' Letterman but the nervous youngster had fled the stage into his mother's arms. The host later offered some advice to Schumer and instructed her to 'do something now that you'll regret.' So the comedienne immediately lifted her dress and flashed... her surfing scar to a relieved-looking Letterman. In October 2009, the veteran host of the Late Show had been forced to admit to a string of affairs live on air  by a blackmailing producer. The host made the shocking revelation on his show that he had cheated on his wife, Regina Lasko, whom he had only married that March. He made the confession after becoming the victim of an extortion plot concocted by a then-CBS producer, Robert Halderman, who demanded $2 million in exchange for his silence over the affairs. Letterman is now planning to retire from the show after more than 20 years of hosting on May 20. Good times: David rubbed his forehead while Amy cracked up after he told her to do something she'd regret .","David Letterman made the joke while warming up his Late Show audience .

"The amount of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, the corporation’s boss has admitted. Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust’s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. ‘He noted…that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,’ the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. ‘But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people ‘tune in’ in new, digital ways. ‘[Those ways] aren’t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here – like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.’ BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today’s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. ‘He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,’ the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC’s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new ‘digital first’ strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to ‘learn lessons’ if they want to ‘compete with organisations that were born in the digital age’.","Figures show that while millions still tune in they listen for shorter bursts .

The BBC Trust has cleared the way for firms to buy their way into lifestyle programmes on the World News channel in a product placement experiment. For example, publishers could pay to have their books reviewed on Talking Books. The BBC Trust will review the scheme in a year."
"Embarrassing footage has emerged of a missile launch going spectacularly wrong in Russia. The minute-long clip shows the S300 rocket barely managing to take off before plummeting back down to earth. A small thud can be heard and bits of debris fly off as the weapon makes a feeble attempt to launch at the military base in an unknown part of Russia. Lift off: The rocket just about launches with debris and a plume of smoke clearly visible next to the Russian flag . Up and down: The S300 rocket barely manages to take off before it starts plummeting back down to earth . It scarcely gets off the launchpad and is followed by a small plume of smoke, before it can be seen dropping out of the sky as shouts can be heard from those watching. Seconds later, the rocket goes out of view as whoever is filming takes cover and a huge explosion can be heard. The shaky camera returns to a massive plume of smoke. The leaked footage will be of some embarrassment to Vladimir Putin who as grown the Russian defence budget has grown by 33 per cent to £54billion over the past year. It comes not long after shocking footage emerged of failed another rocket launch which killed six Russian ballistic missile technicians. Bang: A loud explosion can be heard before plumes of smoke are clearly visible following the failed launch of a rocket in Russia . Footage of the accident, which happened several months ago but officials tried to keep quiet, was posted on social network sites. It happened near Donetsk in the Ukraine where it is believed the missile was about to be fired against government forces. A second OTR-21 Tochka missile was successfully launched a few seconds later from the wreckage, but there is nothing left of the launch site controlled by Russian backed militia. It shows a deafening explosion in a field with plumes of white smoke rising quickly into the atmosphere. A second missile, which would also have been programmed, is still launched from the wreckage a few seconds later, presumably heading towards its intended target.","S300 barely takes off before plunging back to the ground .

"The disabled pensioner who received donations from around the world after being beaten by a drug addict outside his home has got the keys to a new house. Alan Barnes, who is partially sighted and just 4ft 6in tall, was left too scared to return to his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear earlier this year after he was knocked to the ground by mugger Richard Gatiss. The crime shocked Britain and led to a fund being set up by local beautician Katie Cutler, 21, which raised £330,000. Mr Barnes, 67, was today handed the keys to his new two-bedroom terrace house where he says he will feel safer. Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes picked up the keys for his new home today after strangers raised £300,000 . Mr Barnes said it felt 'fantastic' to be in his new home as he showed off its modern kitchen . The 67-year-old said that he felt safer in the two-bedroom terraced property which he was able to buy after receiving donations from around the world . 'It's fantastic to finally be in the house after all this time,' he said. 'I was living a bit further up the hill before but this house is better and more handy when I need to go the Co-op and the shops. 'I haven't shown Katie the house yet but I'm looking forward to telling her about it. 'It's lovely to have my independence back. I'm looking forward to seeing the locals again and having a chat with them.' The £150,000 property boasts two bedrooms, a spacious living room, modern kitchen and large bathroom. It also has an outside barbecue area for entertaining and is just a short walk from the local shops of his native Low Fell, Gateshead. Mr Barnes now plans to use the remainder of the donated money to furnish his new home. The Victorian terrace is a far cry from his previous address, a sparse one-bed bungalow with no garden. Mr Barnes said that it was 'lovely to get his independence back' after picking up the keys to his new home . Mr Barnes said he was 'looking forward' to telling beautician Katie Cutler, who launched the fund, all about his new home . Mr Barnes said he was 'grateful' to everyone who helped him get the property, including Miss Cutler, pictured . 'I'm about 15 minutes away from my other house but it's down lots of different streets and turns as well,' said the pensioner. 'I think I'll go for a walk tonight round the area and get my bearings again. 'I've had a couple of visitors and my sister brought me over today, to help me move in. It has been a busy day. 'I'm very grateful still to everyone who helped me get this house, especially Katie. 'I'm glad I've put the money to good use. 'I haven't spent it all in case I need some extra to refurbish the house.' Mr Barnes, who was born with disabilities after his mother contracted German measles while she was pregnant, had previously told of his plans to move near Ms Cutler. He wanted to make sure the pair, who have become close friends since the incident, could stay in touch. Richard Gatiss, 25, was jailed for four years at Newcastle Crown Court for targeting Mr Barnes . 'I considered where Katie lives but after thinking about it there's two reasons I haven't,' he said. 'One was I would've had to depend on my family to do things and I didn't know if Katie would be moving somewhere else so I thought just take this option and go to Low Fell.' He also revealed dreams of going on a break to Barbados. Earlier this month Richard Gatiss, 25, was jailed for four years at Newcastle Crown Court for targeting Mr Barnes to fund his addiction. During the attack in January, Gatiss crept up on Mr Barnes in a dark alley while the pensioner was putting his bin out. When he was arrested they found his DNA on his 67-year-old victim. Gatiss told police he was so desperate for drug money he would have 'targeted anyone'.","Alan Barnes, who is partially sighted and just 4ft 6in, picked up keys today .

"A boldfaced student at Mississippi State, who refused to go hungry during his college lecture, brought a George Foreman grill to class and proceeded to cook bacon for his sandwich - while sitting in the front row of his class. Roman Ehrhardt became an internet sensation after one of his classmates shared a hilarious photo of him grilling his lunch in class - however according to a Buzzfeed Community posting, the senior communications major was actually completing project, in which had to violate a societal norm. But that didn't stop his unknowing peers from relishing in his outrageous act. 'Y'all this guy is making a sandwich with a George Foreman in class. #hailstate [sic],' Britt Reynolds tweeted on Monday while sharing a photo of Roman grilling his food. Hilarious stunt: Britt Reynolds shared this photo of her classmate Roman Ehrhardt grilling bacon on a George Foreman during class on Monday . Classroom experiment: Roman (pictured) was secretly completing a project, in which he had to violate a societal norm . The candid snapshot has been retweeted nearly 1,000 times since it was posted, with many commenting on how Roman is their hero. While one Twitter user called him a 'future leader', another applauded him for his 'progressive thinking'. And one student branded Roman the real life Jeff Spicoli, a character who battled his uptight history teacher Mr Hand by having pizza delivered to his classroom in the in the classic 1982 film Fast Times at Ridgemont High. '@brittkelso that dude is Jeff Spicoli X 10. Too bad Mr. Hand was not instructing [sic],' he joked. Money's worth: The college senior shared this photo after he used the grill at his lecture, tweeting: 'The George Foreman that started it all' American icon: The snapshot has been retweeted nearly 1,000 times since it was posted, with many people calling Roman a 'hero' for his brazen actions . Britt continued to live tweet the moment, writing: 'The whole room smells like bacon now and I couldn't be more happy [sic].' Although Megan Pickle tweeted her to ask if Roman was making food for a 'speech or presentation', Britt told it was 'neither'. 'I've never even met him and I couldn't be more proud to be his classmate,' Britt added. Meanwhile, another student joked about the professor's reaction, commenting: 'I bet John Nicholson had a field day with that', with Britt adding that her teacher's 'balding head was smiling from ear to ear the whole time'. But that's because he was in on the joke. No manners: Karen Howell tweeted that Roman was being 'inappropriate' - which was actually the point . Great idea: Patrick Netherton lauded Roman for his ingenuity . Get it right: David Covuccu commented that Roman was actually making a pannini - not a sandwich . A week before, Roman asked Dr Nicholson, his introduction to communication theory professor, if he could pull the stunt in class after a friend suggested that he go all out for his project. Not only did the teacher agree, he helped Roman with the small details. Two days after his project was competed, Roman took to Twitter to share a link to the 'real story', which was posted on Buzzfeed. And although he isn't quite the bold hero his fellow classmates made him out to be, he seems to be enjoying his newfound celebrity status. Roman has changed his Twitter bio so that it now reads: 'Here for the Love who saved me. Be it through music and people! And I'm the George Foreman Guy. #Unashamed #free [sic].'

"A transgender South Carolina teenager who was told to remove her makeup for a driver's license photo has settled her lawsuit over the incident and a state agency has agreed to handle such cases differently, according to court documents. Under the terms of the settlement, the state DMV is changing its policy on how male and female license applicants may dress or wear makeup in their official photos. Agency employees will also get training on how to handle transgender customers and people who don't identify with either gender. Transgender teen Chase Culpepper, 17, who was born male but identifies as female, was told by DMV officials that she had to remove make-up (left) for her license photo last year (after taking off make-up right). After a legal battle, the policy has been changed and Miss Culpepper was allowed to wear makeup for her ID . The 17-year-old transgender teen won her legal battle against the state DMV to appear in her license with make-up and jewelry . Chase Culpepper, 17, who was born male but now identifies as female, regularly wears makeup and androgynous or women's clothing. After passing a driving test last year, she was told by officials at a DMV office in Anderson, about 100 miles northwest of Columbia, to remove her makeup because of a policy that bans license photos when someone is purposefully altering his or her appearance. After several attempts, Culpepper says the makeup was removed to the satisfaction of DMV employees, and a license photo was ultimately taken, a process the teen called degrading and humiliating. Culpepper and the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New York legal defense group, wrote to DMV officials, asking that Culpepper be allowed to take a new photo. They eventually sued the agency, calling the policy unconstitutionally vague. In a release from the defense fund, Culpepper said she was pleased with the settlement, which also includes a requirement that the DMV officially apologize to her and allow her to take a license photo with her everyday makeup. 'My clothing and makeup reflect who I am,' Culpepper said. 'From day one, all I wanted was to get a driver's license that looks like me. Now I will be able to do that.' Under the settlement, the DMV also agrees to alter its policy to allow people to wear makeup in photos regardless of their gender.

"The highest-ranking military officer in the United States has apologized to a bereaved military mom after saying the Iraqi city where he died is 'not symbolic in any way'. General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sent a letter saying he regretted that he 'added to the grief' of Debbie Lee, whose son Marc was killed in Ramadi on August 2, 2006. The 28-year-old, the first Navy SEAL to die in Iraq, was fatally wounded while providing covering fire from a building in the heavily-contested city. He was awarded the Purple Heart and Silver Star for his bravery. Humbled: General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, apologized to a military mother for belittling the sacrifice of her slain son . Fallen hero: Marc Lee, right, was killed in Ramadi in August 2006. His mother Debbie, left, was outraged when Dempsey wrote off the city as 'not symbolic in any way' while discussing operations against ISIS . Dempsey had spoken dismissively of the city last week at a briefing when asked how damaging to U.S. and Iraq's military efforts it would be were the city to fall into the hands of ISIS. Responding to a journalist's question, he said: 'The city itself is not symbolic in any way. It hasn’t been declared the caliphate or central to Iraq. 'The issue isn’t brick and mortar. It is about defeating ISIS. I would much rather that Ramadi not fall, but it will not be the end of a campaign.' The remarks outraged Lee, who said she was shaking and reduced to tears to hear the general trivialize the city for which her son had died. In response Lee, from Surprise, Arizona, posted an angry open letter on the website for America's Mighty Warriors, a charity she set up to help servicemen and honor her son. She said: 'I am shaking and tears are flowing down my cheeks as I watch the news and listen to the insensitive, pain-inflicting comments made by you in regards to the fall of Ramadi.' Ramadi was a center of Al-Qaeda operations in 2006, when Petty officer Lee and his comrades were sent in to recapture the city, an effort which ultimately took months and saw some 80 U.S. casualties. Valor: Lee, who was the first Navy SEAL to die in Iraq, was posthumously awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart . Lee continued: 'My son Marc Lee was the first Navy SEAL who sacrificed his life in Ramadi Iraq Aug 2, 2006. His blood is still in that soil and forever will be. Remember that was when so many of our loved ones were taken from us.' Rounding on Dempsey later in the letter, she wrote: 'You, sir, owe an apology to the families whose loved ones blood was shed in Ramadi. Ramadi matters to us and is very symbolic to us. 'You need to apologize to our troops whose bodies were blown to pieces from IEDs and bullet holes leaving parts and pieces behind, Ramadi matters to them.... You and this administration have minimized that Ramadi could fall, now you are minimizing that it is falling, but you, sir, WILL NOT minimize the sacrifice my son Marc Lee made or any of our brave warriors!' Battle: Lee fell while providing covering fire for his allies in Ramadi. Pictured about are three Iraqi soldiers and a Marine fighting in the city in 2006 . Lee's message was shared widely enough that Dempsey read it, prompting him to send an apology. Dempsey's reply, published Tuesday by Fox News, attempted to justify his remarks by saying he was explaining how the U.S. is engaged with a 'different enemy'. He wrote: 'I've read your letter, and I do apologize if I've added to your grief. 'Marc and so many others died fighting to provide a better future for Iraq. He and those with whom he served did all that their nation asked. 'They won their fight, and nothing will ever diminish their accomplishments nor the honor in which we hold their service. 'We are in a different fight now, with a different enemy, and with a different relationship with the Government of Iraq. 'They must determine the path and pace of this fight. That's what I intended to convey.' Discussing the apology with Fox, Lee termed it 'soft', but said that she does accept it. She was also expecting a phone call from him at some point today. Response: Debbie Lee was sent the above letter from Dempsey after he found her angry open letter to him .","General Martin Dempsey sent apology to Debbie Lee, whose son died in Iraq .

"David Cameron and Boris Johnson warned of a looming 'constitutional crisis' last night after Scotland's former First Minister Alex Salmond was caught boasting: 'I'm writing Labour's budget.' The two most high-profile Conservatives joined forces to question the legitimacy of the SNP's plan to try to put Ed Miliband in Downing Street, even if Labour wins fewer seats at the general election. The London Mayor, deployed to inject more passion into the Tory campaign, claimed it would mean 'truckfuls of taxpayers' dosh growling up the M1 to Scotland'. Boris Johnson and David Cameron joined forces yesterday to slam the SNP plans to prop up Labour . 'Lots of people… people who might even have voted Labour - people will think that this is a constitutional crisis,' Mr Johnson said. The SNP has declared it will never support the Conservatives in a hung Parliament, but is ready to do a deal with Labour, even if it finishes in second place. It would be the first time since 1924 that a second-placed party had formed a government. Last night, secret footage of Mr Salmond yesterday raised new fears about Scottish Nationalists holding the balance of power at Westminster after May 7. At a fundraising event, Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become an MP, is heard mocking Labour after it slapped down Scottish leader Jim Murphy's claim that he would write a Labour budget north of the border. 'I knew that already - because I'm writing the Labour Party budget,' he declared, to cheers and applause. Mr Salmond also joked that he would 'check his top pocket' – a reference to a Conservative election poster showing a miniature Mr Miliband in his breast pocket. Alex Salmond boasted that he would write Labour's first budget because the SNP would hold the balance of power . The Prime Minister, in his first joint interview with the London Mayor, his chief leadership rival, said: 'In the last 48 hours the SNP have said ""no money spent on defence projects unless you get rid of Trident. No HS2 unless it starts in Scotland"". 'You have now got Salmond saying he wants to write Ed Miliband's budget. That's before this has even happened. Imagine how much worse it would be, imagine how many pockets would be picked if this were to happen. 'The stakes at this election have always been high. It's about sticking with a plan that's working or risking it with Ed Miliband. But frankly the stakes have got much higher because of what's happening in Scotland with the SNP potentially wiping out Labour. 'The way to avoid that outcome which would be unstable, bad for the economy, bad for jobs, bad for living standards, bad for this country's prospects, the way to avoid it is to vote Conservative. 'What we have got to do in the remaining days of this campaign is bring together these arguments and show that there's an absolute link between the danger of the SNP, a weak Ed Miliband, the threat that he's making and the need to vote Conservative to deliver that majority.' Mr Johnson, seeking to return to the Commons in the west London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, said a Labour government dependent on the SNP's support would be 'totally shambolic'. The two high-profile Tories yesterday visited a school in south west London, where they made some hand paintings with the students . The pair left the school together, where Mr Johnson claimed SNP's plans to prop up a Labour government would mean 'truckfuls of taxpayers' dosh growling up the M1 to Scotland' 'You would have Labour at the beck and call of the SNP. I care very strongly that they've got an agenda to break up the Union, but even worse in government… they would be dragging the steering wheel of a Labour government to the Left. 'From my perspective where I sit in in London you would see truckfuls of taxpayers' dosh growling up the M1 to Scotland. It would be a continual ransom by the SNP of a Labour government.' The Mayor added that the polls were 'starting to move a bit' in the Tories' favour, and claimed there would be a late swing to them as there was in the 1992 election. 'In the last week or so, I really think they're really going to move decisively in favour of a strong, positive Conservative message which is what we've been offering. The record of the government over the last five years has been absolutely outstanding and I think the choice is very clear. 'Do you want to go backwards under Miliband or forwards under the Conservatives? Loads of floating voters are going to make up their minds in our favour in the last few days.' Tomorrow, the Prime Minister and outgoing leader of the Commons William Hague will inflame the row further by launching a separate 'English manifesto' for the first time – as well as the traditional Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish documents. Mr Miliband dismissed Mr Salmond's claim as 'fantasy and nonsense' – but again refused to rule out relying on SNP votes in a hung Parliament. Ed Miliband, pictured on the campaign trail in Ipswich yesterday, dismissed Mr Salmond's claims he would write the Labour budget as 'fantasy and nonsense' The Labour leader also insisted yesterday that he had no plans to negotiate with SNP . 'We are going to be writing the first Labour budget,' he told BBC Radio Five. The Labour leader insisted he had no plans to negotiate, adding: 'I am going to put a Labour Queen's Speech before the Commons and people will have to decide how they vote.' Mr Miliband also accused Mr Cameron of 'trying to stir up English hatred against the Scots' by highlighting the threat posed by the SNP's left-wing agenda. In a separate interview, with the Independent, the Labour leader refused to rule out seeking to enter Number Ten propped up by other parties even if his party wins fewer seats than the Conservatives. Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Salmond's successor, yesterday set out another policy demand for the entire UK – saying SNP MPs would vote for a £24 billion increase in NHS spending. Former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said Mr Cameron had a 'sense of humour bypass' after the Prime Minister reacted angrily to the leaked video . Responding to the leaked footage of him, Mr Salmond said Mr Cameron should 'try holding a few public meetings and meeting real people – and develop a sense of humour'. 'The point made in a light-hearted way was that Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy had been slapped down by his party bosses at Westminster and told that he would have no role in a Labour budget,' the former Scottish First Minister said. 'David Cameron is clearly a prime minister with both a people bypass and a sense of humour bypass.' But Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: 'Here we have the SNP-Labour offer in a nutshell: a chaotic pact with Britain's future security treated like a dinner-party joke. 'After Nicola Sturgeon's slick con-trick earlier this week, this video shows the SNP's arrogance laid bare. 'The only way to prevent Alex Salmond from trying to tear up Britain by holding a Labour party to ransom is by voting Conservative.' Conservative chief whip Michael Gove, on a visit to West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, rejected criticism of his party's warnings about the dangers of the SNP holding sway over a weak Labour government. 'What's putting the Union at risk is the prospect of an SNP victory in seats in Scotland, and the reason why the SNP have been doing well is the collapse in the Labour and Liberal Democrat vote. 'It's the Conservatives who are the strongest party defending the Union, the strongest bulwark against separatism. I think it's absolutely right that we should underline the risks of voting for a party that wants to break up the United Kingdom.'","David Cameron and Boris Johnson last night warned of a looming 'crisis'

"The Duchess of Cambridge has the power to send sales of high-street designs sky-rocketing, so it's little surprise that her offspring have the same effect. As Kate and William prepare to welcome their second child, there's no doubt that the royal couple's favoured childrenswear brands are hoping to cash in on the arrival. Indeed, if Prince George's first year - which boosted the economy by £247m - is anything to go by, anything that the second-born touches will turn to gold and copycat designs will bring a welcome boost to the high street. Scroll down for video . Anything Prince George has been seen wearing has gone on to sell out, such as this £32 Cath Kidston  tank top... and there's no doubt that his little brother or sister will do the same . Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, told The Telegraph that a little girl could bring in £150m for the British economy. He said: 'I think there will be an immediate boost of around £80m when the baby is born, with around £20 to £25m spent on souvenirs and the rest on food and drink such as cake and sparkling wine. The baby could generate a billion pounds over its lifetime. 'There isn’t as much excitement when it’s the second baby, but a girl would have the potential to boost the fashion industry. 'As well as the boost to baby clothing sales that we have seen from Prince George, a Princess would be able to set trends throughout her life, which will be great for the people who designed her clothes or those who can make quick knock-off copies.' The term 'The Prince George effect' was coined just three days after his birth when the £20 printed white aden + anais cloth in which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge wrapped their baby son before leaving the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital sold out almost instantly . The term 'The Prince George effect' was coined just three days after his birth in July 2013 when the £20 printed white aden + anais cloth in which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge wrapped their baby son before leaving the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital sold out almost instantly. Within 48 hours of being seen for the first time, the £44.95 wrap had sold out, while traffic to the brand's website shot up by 1,960 per cent. And it didn't stop there. Following the family's portrait for Mother's Day in 2013, when the prince sported a baby blue number with 'George' emblazoned on his chest, personalised baby clothes retailer My1stYears.com sold 1,200 jumpers in just four hours. Then, the family's tour of Australia and New Zealand in April last year, on which Prince George played a prominent role, sent brands into a frenzy. While most eyes were on the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe choices during the family's time abroad, she wasn't the only royal setting sartorial trends. Following the family's portrait for Mother's Day in 2013, when the prince sported a 'George' emblazoned jumper, personalised baby clothes retailer My1stYears.com sold 1,200 jumpers in just four hours . Much like his mother, Prince George used his first royal tour to prove he's quite the trendsetter, with a plethora of stylish outfits. Designers of the clothes the nine-month-old wore over the fortnight reported a huge surge in sales and the royal tot became something of a fashion icon. One . such example is the Les Petites Abeilles romper suit he wore on his arrival in . Sydney - a similar design totally sold out immediately and then had a shipping time of two months. The young prince looked . dapper in the nautical-style romper suit as he disembarked an . Australian Airforce jet. He . was blissfully unaware of the furore he caused, but within seconds of . the royal trio arriving in Australia, Twitter was awash with commentary . about his ensemble. On a playdate in New Zealand, the tiny tot wore a stylish smocked romper from Rachel Riley, a British luxury brand for children, which retails at £77 (AUD$125). The family's tour of Australia and New Zealand in April last year, in which Prince George played a prominent role, sent brands into a frenzy. A similar version of the Annafie romper suit, sold at Les Petites Abeilles, he wore on his arrival in Sydney, left, sold out immediately and the Rachel Riley dungarees, right, sold out in minutes online . The classic tailored dungarees with a sailboat smocked design on the front panel sold out immediately in the six month and 12 month sizes on the company's website. The Prince's accessories also caused a sales frenzy on the trip. Stockists of the novelty kangaroo backpack, which the Duke of Cambridge was seen carrying after it had been gifted to his son in Sydney, reported the item had sold out hours after the family's airport appearance. The Australian Koala Foundation - one of the stockists of the bag - sold out of its remaining stock of the item immediately. CEO . Deborah Tabart said the sudden rush of orders for the kangaroo bag, . which was selling for £7 (AUD$12.50), was a result of Prince William . seen carrying one. Photographs released of the young prince wearing an adorable soldier jumper in December last year also sent one high street store into frenzy. Prince George wore a £32 Cath Kidston tank top in his Christmas snaps last December and, of course, mothers went into a frenzy trying to snap up the royal's jumper . Within moments of the photos appearing online, the tills at Cath Kidston were ringing as parents rushed to get hold of the then 16-month-old's £32 tank top. But as demand skyrocketed, the sailboat-emblazoned top soon sold out - leaving a crowd of frustrated mothers in its wake and gleeful fashion brand executives rushing through a fresh batch. Then, the knitted tank tops have begun to appear on eBay but will cost would-be purchasers far more than they did in the shops. Ahead of the new royal baby's birth, brands are already stocking memorabilia. Indeed, Blue Almonds, one of Kate's favourite shop's, has launched The Royal Collection 2015. Due to the success of the first collection, and inspired by the Duchess of Cambridge's latest expectancy, the new collection features a moses basket based on the designs store owner Iza Minkiewicz had while pregnant with her own son, Filip. Blue Almonds, one of Kate's favourite shop's, has launched The Royal Collection 2015 inspired by Prince George . Izabela Minkiewicz, said: 'Kate has already had a major impact on the fashion market with the dresses that she’s pictured in flying off the shelves as soon as they hit stores so she’s destined to have the same effect on the baby wear market, too. 'When Kate was photographed in Blue Almonds whilst pregnant, interest in Moses baskets definitely increased and sales of similar infant beds  also boomed.' Style and brand expert Nick Ede added: 'It’s refreshing to see that he’s not too trendy he’s just the perfect English gent. The George effect is due to him wearing clothes that are not designer labels but are wearable, affordable, on-trend colours and perfect for the royal spotlight. 'A style icon is someone who creates a trend and with his nautical stripes, dungarees and baby grows with royal blue piping he certainly doing that.' And dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog, What Prince George Wore, dedicated to all things baby style. But while the Duchess of Cambridge might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears, even she cannot compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power. From £44.95 swaddling wraps to knitted tank tops, the royal baby effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers and eBay entrepreneurs contemplating another year of buoyant sales to come. Here's to a fashionable future for baby number two!","Cath Kidston, aden + anais and Les Petites Abeilles boosted by George .

"A transgender woman killed herself after being taunted in the street for being different, an inquest heard. Mikki Nicholson, who was a national Scrabble champion, stepped in front of a train, on November 7 last year after suffering daily verbal abuse in Carlisle, Cumbria. The 36-year-old had planned a move to Newcastle, where she had hoped people would be more accepting. But she changed her mind months before her death after being told she risked homelessness if she left her social housing. Mikki Nicholson, who was a national Scrabble champion, stepped in front of a train, on November 7 last year after suffering daily verbal abuse in Carlisle, Cumbria. Above, Ms Nicholson preparing for a game in 2009 . The inquest heard how she was receiving psychiatric treatment in the months before her death, and had spent time as an inpatient at the Carleton Clinic. Above, flowers left in tribute at the crossing where she died . Ms Nicholson, who was once ranked as the fourth-best Scrabble player in the world, was born male but identified as a woman. The inquest heard how she was receiving psychiatric treatment in the months before her death, and had spent time as an inpatient at Carlisle's Carleton Clinic. After she was discharged, she was supported by psychiatric nurse Clive Guyo. Mr Guyo said that she clung to the hope that her life would be improved by leaving Carlisle, according to the News and Star. He said: 'Mikki described Carlisle as being hostile to people who are different. She spoke of facing verbal abuse while walking in the streets because of how she appeared to other people. 'Schoolchildren were often the worst for making fun of her and verbally abusing her. Ms Nicholson, pictured before the championships in 2009, had planned a move to Newcastle, where she had hoped people would be more accepting. But she changed her mind after being told she risked homelessness . 'She had a negative view of Carlisle based on past experience. There's no doubt she felt stigmatised.' The inquest heard that Ms Nicholson wanted to move to Newcastle, but was told she would be considered 'intentionally homeless' if she left her Carlisle flat, which was temporary housing. The classification would make it hard to find social housing elsewhere. She had no money for a deposit or to rent privately. Ms Nicholson, who was crowned both UK and European Scrabble champion, became increasingly unhappy in the months before her death, the inquest heard. She was killed instantly when she stepped in front of a train. Coroner David Roberts said Ms Nicholson had been well supported by the psychiatric services, recording a conclusion that she had deliberately killed herself. Jonathan Hammond, a local resident, was on a footpath next to the line at the time of the incident and witnessed the death, according to the News and Star. Ms Nicholson was described as 'fiercely intelligent'. Above, tributes at the crossing where she died . Rebecca Mellor, a close friend, said: 'Mikki was fiercely intelligent. She had a vivacious character and explored her gender identity. 'She frequently felt at odds with the world because of her high level of intelligence and gender identity.' Cumbria Partnership Trust, who provided Mikki psychiatric care, will now discuss the issue of specialist support for transgender people in Cumbria as a result of this tragedy.","Mikki Nicholson, 36, suffered daily verbal abuse on the streets of Carlisle .

"Mila Kunis is being sued by a Ukrainian wannabe singer who claims the Hollywood actress 'stole her pet chicken' as children. Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo  claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 . In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo . In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

"The Married at First Sight star who once considered leaving her groom at the altar because she was unimpressed with his looks has revealed that she is finally ready to physically consummate their marriage, as her feelings for her new husband continue to grow. All three couples began their real journey towards domestic bliss on last night's episode of the FYI reality show, as the newlyweds searched for new homes to call their own, but, surprisingly, it was Jaclyn Methuen and Ryan Ranellone who were brought closer together by process. And the two even ended the first day in their new home sharing a bedroom together. 'Now I am looking at him in a sexual way instead of just looking at him like he's my bud,' the 30-year-old said of her new husband. Scroll down for video . Look of love: Jaclyn Methuen and Ryan Ranellone enjoyed a bottle of wine during their first night at their new apartment in Astoria, Queens, on last night's episode of Married at First Sight . Next step: The newlyweds later headed to their bedroom leaving viewers to wonder whether they finally 'consummated their marriage' And while viewers have to wait until next week's episode to see if the newlyweds did indeed take their relationship to the next level, Jaclyn hinted that physical intimacy is definitely going to develop - and soon. 'We haven't consummated our marriage yet, but it seems like [in] the imminent future that is going to happen,' she told the cameras coyly. Jaclyn previously noted that she hadn't had sex in two years and she hoped it was like 'riding a bike'. The episode began with Ryan, 29, who lives in Stony Brook, Long Island, with his mother and his teenage niece Kayla, traveling over three hours to spend his first night at Jaclyn's home in Union, New Jersey. And despite Jaclyn’s initial reluctance to show any kind of enthusiasm for the marriage, it was clear that the pair had slowly started working towards a mutual feeling of respect – and romance. Ryan couldn’t have been more thrilled about seeing his wife’s abode, admitting that the closer he got to her home, the more excited he became to see his new wife. Meanwhile, Jaclyn was delighted to show Ryan her home, noting that she sees the potential for their relationship more than ever. Can't do it: Ryan visited Jaclyn's apartment in Union, New Jersey but told her it was too far away from his real estate job in Long Island . Major compromise: During dinner, the couple agreed to move to Astoria because it was the halfway point from their two homes . 'I am actually really excited he is coming over. I miss Ryan when he is gone, and it is surprising that I miss him - surprising for me because I don't really miss anybody,' she admitted. While the couple enjoyed a nice evening together, it quickly became apparent that the commute from the New Jersey location was too far for Ryan, who works as a real estate agent in Long Island. 'I would love to make a life together here, but no way, can't do it,' he told her, as Jaclyn worried that finding a place to live would become a road block in their relationship. Later the two met over dinner and agreed to move to Astoria, Queens, because that is the halfway point between their homes. Jaclyn only requested that she could bring her cat and that there would be parking. 'This is my new life. I am married now,' she said. 'This is the first major compromise that we are making.' Final decision: Ryan and Jaclyn can be seen shaking their realtor's hand after they agree on their first apartment together . Hug it out: The newlyweds, who were excited about taking the next step together, embraced in their new kitchen . And when it came to budgeting their finances, Jaclyn admitted that she has to have money immediately taken out of her check and moved to savings because she is a 'spender' by nature. Ryan, who proclaimed that he was a saver, made it clear that he wanted to make his new wife happy and he didn't want her to give anything up she enjoyed. 'Don't sacrifice what makes you happy for the sake of where we are going to live,' he said of the cost of her dance classes, which she was worried would be too expensive to afford after their move. 'We will make it work.' The two also agreed to split the cost of living in half, so they would both be contributing the same amount. After looking at a few places in Astoria, they agreed on a spacious one bedroom apartment for $2,000 a month. Emotional moment: Ryan was sad to leave his mother and his teenage niece Kayla . New life together: Jaclyn packed up her wardrobe as she prepared to move in with Ryan . 'Jaclyn and I are getting close, and I am starting to feel great about this whole experiment,' Ryan told the cameras, while Jaclyn noted that the pair 'can be really happy' in their new apartment. On moving day, Jaclyn received a visit from her sister and her best friend who offered her moral support. And while she was packing up her belongings, she revealed to her closest confidants that she is seeing her husband in a whole new light. 'Flying home on the plane, I feel like somebody flipped a switch,' she said of her recent trip to spend the holidays with her husband. 'I was looking at him like this is my best friend ever and we're buddies, and now I am looking at him differently.' She went on to tell the cameras that she is now 'looking at him in a sexual way'. Newlyweds: When they arrived at their new place, Ryan carried Jaclyn over the threshold . What to do: The two took a moment to figure out where they should place all of their things . 'I am looking at him like a man,' she added. Meanwhile, Ryan got emotional as he said goodbye to his mother and his niece. Although he maintained that he wanted to be married and move in with Jaclyn, he admitted that it was hard to leave his family. On the first night in their new apartment, the two unpacked a bit before enjoying a bottle of wine and some pizza. 'I want to be more touchy and feely with you,' Jaclyn told Ryan as they cuddled on the couch. Huge adjustment: Davina Kullar, 34, and Sean Varricchio, 35, can be seen speaking with real estate agent in Manhattan as they searched for a place on the Upper East Side . Not happy: Sean, who is from New Jersey, was overwhelmed by how small the apartments in Manhattan were . 'What should we do to christen the apartment?' Ryan teased. And when Jaclyn asked if he meant consummate the marriage, he joked: 'I am a nice Catholic boy.' But the two eventually made their way to bedroom, leaving viewers wondering if they were finally going to become intimate weeks after their wedding day. As for Davina Kullar, 34, and Sean Varricchio, 35, the move seemed to be tearing them apart. Davina refused to move out of Manhattan, and as she waited for her apartment to be renovated, she and Sean looked for a new place that they could stay temporarily. But it quickly became apparent that Sean, who is an ER/trauma nurse from Jackson, New Jersey, was uncomfortable with city life as he started to pull away from his new wife. Life decision: The couple finally agreed on a place to stay while Davina's apartment gets renovated . Hear-to-heart: Davina told Sean that he needs to show her more affection after he started pulling away from her . After the two finally agree on a place to stay on the Upper East Side, Sean continued to be overwhelmed. 'I can feel myself pulling back. We're not affectionate. We're not intimate,' he admitted. Davina confessed to the cameras that Sean's actions made her worry that his distance was about more than just geographical location and adjusting to living in New York City. She finally told him that she needs him to be more affectionate. 'Why am I helping you adapt to Manhattan, if you don't really want to be here,' she asked during their heart-to-heart. Stressed out: Jessica Castro, 30, and Ryan DeNiro, 29, learned the bedroom in this apartment is in a completely different unit than the living room and bathroom . Not our home: Jessica and Ryan can be seen having a heated discussion about an apartment they both liked. While she thought it was too expensive, Ryan said that he just wanted to take care of her and make her happy . Although Sean agreed to make more of an effort, he later told her that he had to return to New Jersey for work, leaving her alone in their apartment on what was supposed to be their first night together. Meanwhile, Jessica Castro, 30, and Ryan DeNiro, 29, struggled to figure out where they both should live – and how they should budget for it. While Ryan owns a consulting business in Staten Island, Jessica, who works as a receptionist in Manhattan, doesn't know how to drive, so the two compromised by agreeing to move to Brooklyn . After visiting numerous apartments, Ryan believed he found the one, but Jessica wasn't thrilled with the $4,000 per month price tag. Jessica could only afford to contribute $1,000 towards their rent, and she didn't like the idea of Ryan covering so much more of the bill. Team work: After agreeing on a place in Brooklyn, Ryan helped Jessica pack on their moving day . All better: The two kissed in the bedroom of their new apartment in Brooklyn . 'We need to be able to discuss what we are spending our money on as a married couple,' she explained. 'I would rather invest for down the line, if we stay together, to buy something.' But Ryan said that he just wants to see 'Jess happy,' explaining: 'As a man I want to take care of her'. The newlyweds let the apartment go, and they eventually find one that is not only perfect, but it's in their price range. 'This is our first big decision together,' Jessica said of their new place. 'I hope we are on the right page.'","Jaclyn Methuen and Ryan Ranellone moved into their marital home together on last night's episode of the FYI reality show .

"For many years carbohydrates such as white bread and pasta have been seen as the enemy for anyone trying to keep their waistline slim. But doctors are concerned with the increasing trend that's seeing people cut whole food groups out of their diets, especially healthier options like wholegrains. As revealed by the Daily Mail on Tuesday, experts warn that shunning an entire food group is unsustainable, can damage one's relationship with food and could be doing more harm than good. Australian dietician and nutritionist Susie Burrell agrees with the research that points to white bread and heavily processed carbohydrates as contributors for weight gain, but says this is no reason to cut all carbs out completely.

'Bread has been a dietary staple for thousands of years, and the more advanced technology has become, so too the more processed our bread, resulting in the soft, almost sticky common white loaf many families base a number of meals around each day,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Bread, white or otherwise is a rich source of B group vitamins which are crucial for energy production, and hence bread remains a major contributor to energy and the running of energy systems in the body. 'Less processed varieties of bread also offer a range of other nutrients including dietary fibre, Vitamin E, zinc; iron and long chain unsaturated fats, which is generally why loaves of grain based bread contain more fat than white bread,' she added. The nutritionist said there is a distinct difference in the nutritional value of white and grain bread, there's also a disparity in the glycaemic index (GI). The best: Tip Top 9 Grain (right) and Helga's Lower Carb (right) came highly recommended from Susie Burrell . 'As white, wholemeal and flat breads have all had the grains ground down in their processing, they have a relatively high GI compared to wholegrain bread, meaning that they release glucose into the bloodstream much more quickly than wholegrain breads,' Ms Burrell said. 'Over time, this means that choosing processed breads as a dietary staple will be resulting in regular glucose peaks and troughs, and subsequent insulin release. 'High insulin levels over time are related to weight gain and increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes,' she added. This comes as experts in the UK have warned of the long-term effects of completely cutting out one food group from your daily diet. In light of this the diet guru has compiled a list of the five most nutritious, and five worst breads Australian consumers can buy. BarleyMax wraps also rated highly on the Australian nutritionist's list, coming in third in her top five . Baker's Delight Cape Seed loaf (left) was given the nod by the nutritionist, as was Burgen's Soy Lin (right) 'One of the most commonly asked questions in relation to bread choice is whether ‘wholemeal’ is a good choice. While whole meal bread does contain more dietary fibre than standard white bread, it is still a high GI choice,' Ms Burrell revealed. Swap it: Australian nutritionist Susie Burrell says while too many processed carbohydrates can be bad, people shouldn't generally be eliminating them entirely but instead looking at healthier options . She said Turkish breads can be one of the worst as people tend to eat it in higher quantities and fill the holes with butter or margarine. 'The average adult will need just 2-4 slices of bread each day and be mindful of the increasing sizes,' the nutritionist warned. 'Some large, thick slices of bread can contain up to double the amount of carbohydrates and are really not necessary for the majority of us who would ultimately like to drop a few extra kilograms. 'As many Australians eat bread on a daily basis, it is imperative that our choice of bread is gold standard, and this means grain bread,' she added. Ms Burrell also warned parents to be cautious of the bread they're serving their children, as they will learn what they know. 'If you continue to buy white bread, they will continue to eat it, and it is not the best choice nutritionally for their health long term,' she said. While it's widely accepted that processed carbohydrates, such as white bread and pasta, can contribute to weight gain and its associated diseases, doctors are increasingly concerned about a trend for excluding all carbs - even healthier wholegrains, where the grain is left intact and not processed. People who do this could suffer from a lack of energy, mood swings, poor concentration and gut problems - and may even put on weight. Those who shun carbs say they are bad for us because they convert into sugar in the body, and can cause weight gain because we store excess sugar as fat. Lawson white bread was named as the worst nutritionally, due to its high calorie and sodium counts . Lebanese bread (left) and Turkish bread (right) were also listed unfavourably by Ms Burrell . But while many experts agree that overweight people often do eat too many carbs, they also say that these foods have been unfairly demonised. 'Carbs are seen by many as the ""devil"" food, but any dietitian will tell you they are an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet - the general guidance is they should make up a third of our intake,' says Helen Bond, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. 'They are a ready source of fuel for the body. Cutting them out can cause headaches, tiredness and lethargy. 'You won't be able to perform so well during exercise and concentration is likely to be affected, too, because carbohydrates also fuel the brain.' She adds that where people go wrong is in treating all carbs as the same. Burgen Soya & Linseed Bread . Calories: 111kcal . Carbs: 12g . Fibre:  4.1g . Sodium: 0.13g .

"The lovers who got the most complaints in New York City for loud sex are a handyman and the girlfriend he pops round for quickies with in the building where he works. The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show . Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex . Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'. On the job: The building handyman complained about over noisy sex was at work today - at the apartment block where his girlfriend lives. House of noise: The apartment building is in Bay Ridge, close to New York harbor in Brooklyn . No idea: The building's owner Madelene Behefte told Daily Mail Online she had no idea about the complaints . No respite: The front door of the apartment at the center of six complaints for noisy sex. It failed to stop neighbors from overhearing the couple's antics . DNAInfo reported that New York's 311 helpline, for non-emergency complaints to city authorities, recorded a total of 133 complaints about loud sex between January 1 2014 and February 12 2015. Brooklyn, the borough now associated with trendy hipsters and home to would-be president Hillary Clinton's campaign, had the highest number of complaints, at 42. Brooklyn is the most populous of the city's five boroughs. Queens was next with 37, the Bronx and 31 and Manhattan had 23. Staten Island recorded none. The website reported that on November 14 last year, a 311 operator logged: 'Neighbors are having very loud sex with the windows open that can be heard throughout the whole bldg.' The complainant told the website the woman was 'moaning and screaming ""Oh yeah, oh, do it to me"".' It was followed by another woman shouting at the couple: 'Shut your f***ing windows you wh**e.' Complaints to 311 are passed to police to investigate if they are available, but officers found no noise disturbance when they attended the Bay Ridge block.","Block in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, got most complaints about noisy sex in the city with six in a year .

"A New York man has been caught on camera catcalling women in the street – completely oblivious to the fact that the interview he is taking part in is meant to highlight the horrible and derogatory culture of catcalling. Patrick Jones of Buzz60 was covering a recent anti-catcalling campaign, which saw signs a series of pro-feminist signs being placed on several streets around New York City, when he took to the street to hear opinions from the public. And while the women he spoke to all called the practice 'disgusting,' saying it makes them feel 'horrible' and 'uncomfortable,' one man was only too happy to demonstrate his own tactics for harassing women in public. Scroll down for video . Clueless catcaller: This New York man, right, didn't realize Buzz60's Patrick Jones, left, was doing a segment criticizing catcalling; the man showed his own catcalling techniques throughout the interview .

Unprompted, the man begins demonstrating by whistling and making ticking and kissing noises with his mouth. When Patrick, who looks surprised to have found one of the very street harassers that his other interviewees hit out at, asks the man how he would call a dog, he unabashedly replies: 'The same way'. Demeaning dude: The man on the right laughs as he admits he would call a dog with the same whistling noises he uses to call out to women on the street . 'It feels good,' the New York man says in response to a question about how catcalling makes women on the receiving end feel. The man, who throughout the interview can be seen casting his eyes around seemingly looking for women, then demonstrates his tactics again on a passerby. 'If it's far away it's even better because they're not that scared,' he continues, not acknowledging that his comment implies that when women are close to their catcallers, they feel a sense of fear. 'Sometimes you've gotta have a little distance.' Highlighting the problem: The video was made in response to anti-catcalling signs like these, which have been put up around New York City . Totally oblivious: The man being interviewed didn't seem to notice that he was being filmed in front of a sign like this one, which says 'no catcall zone' Before the video wraps up, the man finally realizes that the interview is not meant to show catcalling in a positive light, asking: 'Wait a second, are you reporting that girls don't like this?' 'They don't like catacalling,' says Patrick insists. 'Get the f** out of here,' says the man, who becomes visibly irritated. 'We're acknowledging that you did a good thing today getting up out of bed,' he adds, before getting distracted by another woman and whistling at her while yelling: 'Yo, sweetheart!'","The New York man unapologetically demonstrates how he harasses women on the street while taking part in an on-camera interview .

"The Tories will tomorrow inflame the row over a potential Labour-SNP power-sharing deal by unveiling the party’s first ‘manifesto for England’. The Prime Minister and the outgoing Leader of the Commons William Hague will launch the English document, which follows traditional Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish manifestos. Its centrepiece will be a pledge to introduce a system of ‘English votes for English laws’ – giving English MPs an effective veto over legislation applying only to their constituents. Inflammatory: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) will be joined by William Hague (right) as they launch the English manifesto - with the latter expected to warn England risks being 'held to ransom' by SNP . Mr Hague is expected to warn that England risks being ‘held to ransom’ by Scottish Nationalists unless Labour agrees to implement such a reform. The manifesto is also expected to commit the Tories to dozens of new road schemes in England and an extension of the Cancer Drugs Fund, which pays for expensive cancer treatments on the English NHS. The document will be seen as an attempt by the Tories to tap into growing English nationalism. Opponents are likely to criticise it as risking fostering division between the UK’s four nations. But a Tory strategist said: ‘We have separate Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish manifestos. Why shouldn’t there be one for England?’ The ‘English votes’ plan would seek to resolve a longstanding constitutional question which will become more urgent than ever once the Scottish Parliament is handed yet more powers. Mr Hague wants to strip Scottish MPs of the power to impose tax changes, education and health reforms on England, given Holyrood will soon control all these issues in Scotland. The reform would make it impossible for any future Labour government to press ahead with its plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in England without winning the support of a majority of English MPs. Tensions: The manifesto is expected to inflame tensions between the Tories and nationalist parties like Nicola Sturgeon's SNP and Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood . It could also make it difficult for a Scottish MP to again hold the office of Chancellor or Prime Minister, given they would be unable to vote on some of their own Government’s legislation. For decades, Labour has relied on the votes of its power base of Scottish MPs to rule Westminster. But since the creation of the Scottish Parliament, critics have questioned how it can be right for Scots MPs to have the crucial say on issues such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals which no longer affect their constituents. Both reforms passed under Tony Blair’s government thanks to the votes of Labour’s tartan army of MPs. Mr Hague is expected to say that the scale of devolution now to be given to Scotland means the question of the status of Scottish MPs at Westminster is unavoidable. 'Calm smoothness': Cameron has insisted he has 'no end' of passion in an interview with The Spectator . David Cameron has admitted that what he called his ‘calm smoothness’ could give people the wrong impression about how urgently he wants to win the General Election. In an interview with The Spectator, the Prime Minister insisted he had ‘no end’ of passion but was a Conservative, a tribe of ‘practical, sensible, clear-headed’ people who ‘don’t always wear their beliefs on their sleeve’. Asked why many people believe he must do more to demonstrate that he really wants to win, he said: ‘I don’t know. There is something about me – I always manage to portray a calm smoothness or something. ‘But look, yesterday, where was I? I went to five seats, I did five speeches, I didn’t finish until way after the other party leaders were home having TV training or something. 'I was out on the stump and I’m doing the same today. Look at my schedule! I don’t know what more I can do.’ Mr Cameron yesterday faced one of his most hostile interviews so far in the campaign. Chris Smith, a Radio 1 Newsbeat presenter, repeatedly interrupted him and offered him a £1,000 bet that he would not win the election outright. Clearly irritated, the Prime Minister said: ‘Have you got some God-given right to declare what the result of the election is?’ He insisted that ‘there is every opportunity in the next 15 days for there to be a majority government’.","Manifesto set to be launched by David Cameron and William Hague .

"Wanted: A police e-fit image of millionaire people trafficker Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72m with his accomplice Mered Medhanie from smuggling migrants in the last two years . Two millionaire people traffickers have been heard mocking the migrant boat disasters that have resulted in thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean, it has been reported. One of them, an Eritrean called Mered Medhanie, also known as The General, was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading migrant ships, a problem that causes them to capsize. Medhanie, 34, who is based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is said to have boasted: 'They say I put too many aboard, but they're the ones who want to leave in a hurry.' A second trafficker, Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years, also showed callous disregard for the plight of his 'customers'. He was heard declaring last summer: 'They organised another trip a few days ago. I don't know what happened – they probably died.' Ghermay, who also lives in Tripoli, was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. More than 1,700 have perished in the last week alone. Italian police yesterday released Ghermay's photofit as they sought to track down the pair, who are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. Ghermay and Medhanie are currently living undisturbed in Tripoli, exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. Medhanie, who reportedly compares himself to the former Libyan dictator, and his accomplice enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist faction. A Italian naval officer stands in front of rescued migrants on board the Italian Navy vessel Bettica as they arrive in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta after being the latest group to be rescued from the Mediterranean . Terrified: Boys embrace as they arrive with migrants at the Sicilian harbor of Augusta with the Italian navy . In another wire tap recording, Medhanie, who is thought to have a wife and child in Sweden, is heard expressing scant regard for migrant suffering. 'We do an illegal job – but what do you expect? We're not the government,' he says, according to La Stampa as reported by The Independent. Others reveal how his business is booming, with him heard to say: 'This year I've done well – I sent off 7,000 to 8,000.' Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, but opting for U.S. or Canadian banks because 'they don't ask you where the money comes from.' Safe: European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean's migrant crisis ahead of a summit as harrowing details emerged of the fate of hundreds who died over the weekend . Rescued migrants wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica  in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race, locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned.' Conversely, Yusuf, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February, said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East, it was reported by The Independent. Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss-crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but also to join relatives in northern Europe. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia said based on telephone intercepts, the average cost to smuggle a migrant from Eritrea or Ethiopia to Libya ran $4,000 to $5,000, while the crossing to Italy cost an additional $1,000 to $1,500. Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another $1,000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front, often using the Islamic hawala banking system which is based on an informal honour code in which a relative in northern Europe pays a local broker. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground advising them that the leg has been paid for. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday, allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster in which 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday.

The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre (66-foot) boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 28, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship, causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan, a fellow 17-year-old Bangladeshi, said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers, it has been reported. It set off from Libya on Saturday and sent out a distress signal shortly before midnight 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. It later capsized.","Mered Medhanie and Ermias Ghermay 'have made £72m in last two years'

"An ex-convict who told cops he fatally stabbed his ex-girlfriend, then cooked and ate some of her organs, may now also be charged with raping her. Joseph Oberhansley, from Jeffersonville, Indiana, is charged with murder and abuse of a corpse in the death of 46-year-old Tammy Jo Harbin Blanton last September. On Tuesday, Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull asked for rape to be added to those charges and a judge will consider the request on May 4, the Courier-Journal of Louisville reported. The motion to change the charges comes after lab results for the victim's body were returned. 'Cannibal killer': Joseph Oberhansley, who admitted to killing his ex-girlfriend before eating some of her organs last year, could now face a rape charge. Prosecutors say they will recommend the death penalty . Murdered: Tammy Jo Blanton, right, had called police asking for help just hours before she was found dead . Last year, prosecutors said they intended to seek the death penalty in the case. Juries in Indiana cannot recommend a death sentence or life without parole unless they agree there is at least one aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, the law says. Rape, burglary and dismemberment are among those aggravated circumstances. Oberhansley, now 34, was convicted of manslaughter in the 1998 shooting death of his then-girlfriend, 17-year-old Sabrina Elder, in Salt Lake City just days after the birth of their son. He served 14 years behind bars for the crime and was discharged from parole on July 23 last year. Convict: In 1998, Oberhansley, then a teenager, was imprisoned for killing his 17-year-old girlfriend . On July 31, Tammy Jo Blanton posted his $500 bond for charges of criminal recklessness and resisting law enforcement stemming from a car chase. Then on September 11, she called 911 at around 3am to report that her jilted boyfriend was outside her home and would not leave, according to the probable cause affidavit. Officers arrived on the scene and ordered Oberhansley to leave after Blanton spoke to him outside. At around 10am that morning, police got another call, this time from Blanton's co-worker, asking them to perform a welfare check after she failed to show up for work. Police found that the back door had been forced open and inside, officers discovered Blanton dead under a tarpaulin in the blood-spattered bathroom of her home, with fatal injuries to her head, neck and torso. 'The front of the victim's skull appeared to have been crushed and brain tissue appeared scattered around the bathtub,' the affidavit stated. The statement added that they found a plate covered in blood and bone, as well as bloodied cooking utensils, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. Scene: Oberhansley allegedly broke down Blanton's backdoor at her Jeffersonville home, pictured, and then forced his way into her bathroom, where she was hiding, and repeatedly stabbed her . When questioned by police, Oberhansley confessed to forcing his way into the bathroom, where Blanton had locked herself, and repeatedly stabbing her. Oberhansley told police he then used an electric jigsaw to open Blanton's skull and ate parts of her brain, heart and lungs. The blade was allegedly recovered from the scene after the grisly death. A trial date is expected to be set by the end of April.

"The owner of a British seaside hotel says it is virus-free after 100 holidaymakers were struck down by what health officials have described as a norovirus outbreak. Dozens of people who visited the Cooden Beach Hotel earlier this month came down with vomiting, diarrhoea and other symptoms of the highly-contagious airborne bug. A Rother District Council spokesperson said it is believed that 100 people have been affected by the so-called 'winter vomiting bug' after visiting the hotel in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex. Health officials said it is believed that 100 people have been affected by the 'winter vomiting bug' A sign posted on the door of the hotel warns visitors about an ‘airborne virus’ at the premises . Owner James Kimber told MailOnline Travel that the source of the illness has not been identified, but many of those who fell ill attended a wedding at the 41-room hotel on 11 April. He said some staff experienced symptoms as well. Mr Kimber said the hotel followed the Environmental Agency's protocol to the letter, including a recommendation to steam clean the venue. A sign posted on the door of the hotel, where guests enjoy sweeping views of the English Channel, warned visitors about an ‘airborne virus’ at the premises. Owner James Kimber has issued an apology to guests and staff, and has vowed to steam clean the hotel . Richard Parker-Harding, service manager for environmental health, said: ‘We have received a large number of reports of people who attended the hotel over the past week who have complained of suffering from acute sickness. ‘Following tests, we have eight confirmed cases of norovirus, also known as winter vomiting disease, which causes gastroenteritis and is highly infectious. ‘The virus is easily transmitted through contact with infected individuals from one person to another. ‘We believe the other people who have been ill also had norovirus. ‘Outbreaks are common in semi-enclosed environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools and cruise ships and can also occur in restaurants and hotels.’ Earlier this month two cruise ships owned by Royal Caribbean International suffered norovirus outbreaks. Both docked in San Diego while sailing from Florida, with about 240 passengers on the Legend of the Seas and Celebrity Infinity cruise liners falling ill.","The owner of the Cooden Beach Hotel has apologised to guests and staff .

"A recently released affidavit reveals that a Chinese translator was accused of sharing government information with an alleged spy. In the affidavit, Timothy S. Pappa, an FBI agent, claims that Xiaoming Gao was paid 'thousands of dollars to provide information on U.S. persons and a U.S. government employee.' That information was provided to individuals she thought to be Chinese intelligence officers. Despite these claims however, she was never prosecuted by the government. What's more, the affidavit also revealed that Gao lived with another State Department employee who had top-secret clearance. Scroll down for video . An FBI affidavit from November 2014 that was recently unsealed reveals translator Xiaoming Gao (above on left with unknown male) shared information with an alleged Chinese spy . Fox News, who obtained the affidavit, also revealed that the State Department employee did admit to sharing details of his job with Gao. As for the alleged spy  she spoke to, their names was 'Teacher Zhao,' and the two met numerous times over the years in hotels in China. Gao admitted to the meetings, and also admitted to reporting on her 'social contacts' in the United States, according to the affidavit. 'It's not clear to me, based on the court files that were unsealed, how a prosecution of this person could possibly have compromised U.S. intelligence gathering,' Thomas Dupree, former deputy assistant attorney general under the George W. Bush administration, told the network. 'If it jeopardizes or threatens to disrupt relations with another country, so be it. That you have to draw the line somewhere, and that we need to send a message that this sort of conduct and activity simply will not be tolerated.' Gao, who left her position in February 2014, began working as a contract interpreter in the Office of Language Services in June 2010. The US attorney's office, who released the affidavit, declined to prosecute, and the FBI has not revealed what they found in a suburban Washington storage facility they searched after filing the affidavit.

"She's the clean eating food lover who has more than 102,000 followers on Instagram thanks to her healthy and delicious looking meals. But she has a secret weapon that most food bloggers don't have - when people aren't obsessing over her recipes, they're checking out her rock-hard abs. We're talking about Clean Eating Alice, the latest social media sensation to be making a name for herself by living a healthy life. Scroll down for video . Over the last year Alice (pictured before, left, and after, right) has completely transformed her body with the help of healthy eating and the LDN Muscle bikini guide . Alice Liveing, from Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, began her healthy journey just over a year ago. She said: 'After years of bad skin, constant fatigue and feeling uncomfortable about my appearance I decided to completely overhaul my approach to eating. 'I started experimenting with food, and found that simply changing what I ate for breakfast had a huge impact on my mood and energy for that day. 'The term [clean eating] is completely subjective and can mean different things to different people, but my interpretation of it was to develop a healthy relationship with food. 'I didn’t restrict myself or feel like I was dieting as such, and learnt how best to fuel my body with tasty and nutritious food.' In these Instagram snaps Alice shows off toned arms, something she said she had previously struggled with . Alice started sharing pictures of her meals on Instagram, which allowed her to take stock of what she was putting into her body. 'I remember a distinct turning point was when I began to post photos of my food on the social media platform Instagram,' she said. 'The idea that I would be making healthy food, and being able to log and share it on Instagram was nothing novel or new, but was helpful for me to keep track of what I was eating. 'I also found great pleasure in making my food look nice, as well as taste good. 'I am conscious that some people may find it annoying when their friends start posting foodie pics on social media, but however annoying they may find it, it is precisely what enabled me to find a healthy relationship with food and create new and delicious dishes that could then help others.' In this snap Alice shows off her figure in a pair of shorts ready for a New Year's Eve party . Of course you don't get a body like Alice's without putting in a lot of hard work. She revealed: 'I aim to go to the gym between four and six times a week, and follow the LDN Muscle Bikini Guide. 'I think one of the best things about this journey is that I found a way of exercising that I loved which I think is so important, and I have LDN Muscle to thank for that. 'I think that the way I look has gained me a few male admirers, but I try to avoid letting any of this attention go to my head!' On the LDN Muscle website, the weight training programme says it aims to promote a 'natural, lean and aesthetic physique'. But when it comes to health and fitness tips there is often only one question on her fans lips. She said: 'My most frequently asked questions are usually about how to poach an egg, which is always funny, and I guess I have my own technique that I am always happy to share.' Alice - who also uses the Healthy Selfie App to chart her progress - poses in the mirror showing off her extremely defined abs . Alice trains in the gym up to six times a week which is how she maintains her impressive body . She continued: 'Other questions usually focus on what exercise I do, and most notably what abdominal exercises I do. 'I try and answer all questions as I like to help people as best I can.' Alice says that it's been amazing to see her social media following grow and that in the future she would love to be the female Jamie Oliver. She said: 'I would love to bring healthy eating to the masses and be the female equivalent of Jamie Oliver. 'My food isn’t complicated, expensive or pretentious nor does it require ingredients that you can’t find in your local supermarket. 'I will be bringing out some recipe ebooks in partnership with LDN Muscle which will include breakfast, lunch and dinner ideas, as well as launching my YouTube channel and personal training. 'On top of all of this I am just about to graduate from Bird College where I have trained for three years as a musical theatre performer, and I am hoping to also pursue my dream to perform in the West End.' Alice says that what she eats changes every day: 'My recipes are usually created from what I fancy eating on a given day, and what I’ve got in the fridge. 'I usually take out all the ingredients I fancy and then try and think how I can create something tasty with them. 'My meals are always built around a protein source, so I usually start there, for example a chicken breast, or salmon and then try and pack in some veg, such as kale, spinach or broccoli, and then add a carb source, my favourite being sweet potato. 'I always try and experiment with seasoning too, so things like paprika, and turmeric to add some flavour.' She continued: 'In terms of avoiding foods, I stay away from refined sugars, and most processed foods, although I am a big bacon lover. 'Alcohol is something that I just make conscious decisions on now, so for example if I’m going to have a drink I’ll have a vodka and diet coke, rather than a brightly coloured alcho-pop. 'It’s all about not feeling restricted and instead just making better choices, and ultimately enjoying being fit and healthy.' Alice says that she likes to start her mornings with a breakfast such as this breakfast wrap made with egg white and crispy chorizo . Breakfast: . Healthy breakfast 'wrap' with spicy paprika egg white wrap, stuffed with crispy chorizo, avocado, rocket, red onion and tomatoes.

"An 11-year-old hearing-impaired boy from Oklahoma has his younger sister to thank for saving his life after a pack of vicious rottweilers mauled him over the weekend. Elijah McKenna suffered two wide, bloody gashes on his back of his head and numerous deep bite marks all over his face and body after his neighbor's three dogs attacked him near his grandmother’s home in Moore, Oklahoma, Saturday. But the child's family say if it were not for Elijah's fearless 9-year-old sister, Alyssa, the special-needs boy most likely would have been dead. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Heroic: Alyssa McKenna, 9 (right), saved her 11-year-old brother, Elijah (left) from a pack of vicious dogs . Horrific injuries: The child, who is hearing-impaired, suffered deep cuts to his head (left) that required 40 staples (left) and injuries to his face (left) Mauled: The young boy was left with numerous deep bite marks all over his body . Vicious: This is one off the rottweilers believed to have attacked Elijah McKenna Saturday. As of Monday, they were still seen in a neighbor's yard . Alyssa says she went outside to check on her sibling, who is deaf, when she heard his screams and spotted a trio of large rottweilers biting the child in the brush by a dirt road. Setting aside concerns for her own safety, Alyssa ran over and scared off the hounds so she could tend to Elijah. The wounded boy could stand up or walk on his own, so his little sister picked him up and carried him home. ‘I was terrified, but I saved his life,’ Alyssa told News Channel 4. When Elijah was brought to a nearby hospital for treatment, he immediately went into surgery. The injured child, who turned 11 Tuesday, was later released home with 40 staples on his head. He is now learning to walk again. Justice: Rhianna Bravenec (right), Alyssa and Elijah's mother, said she wants all three dogs euthanized . Strong: The 9-year-old girl picked up her big brother and carried him home because he was unable to walk on his own after the attack . In recovery: Elijah, who celebrated his 11th birthday Tuesday, is now learning how to walk again . On Monday, the animals that attacked Elijah were still seen roaming around the neighbor's yard. Dog owner Martin Tidwell said that what happened to the 9-year-old was terrible. Rhianna Bravenec, Alyssa and Elijah's mother, said she wants all three dogs euthanized. The woman has another young daughter and a fourth child on the way. Tidwell said he has to wait until the end of a mandatory 10-day quarantine to put his pets down. Under state law, Tidwell is not required to euthanize his animals, but the man said he feels morally obligated to do so. Elijah's family have set up a GoFundMe account hoping to raise $5,000 to help with his mounting medical bills.","Elijah McKenna, 11, was mauled by neighbor's three rottweilers in Oklahoma Saturday .

"A teacher at a Louisiana high school arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old freshman two years ago has admitted to the relationship and apologized for 'taking the victim's innocence,' according to an affidavit. Amber Anderson, 27, has since been relieved of her duties at Christian Life Academy in Baton Rouge. She was booked into prison on Tuesday and is facing a charge of felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile. Anderson had been a math teacher at the school for three years and the alleged relationship took place during July and August of 2013. Amber Anderson, 27, arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old freshman two years ago has admitted to the relationship and apologized for 'taking the victim's innocence' The incident has only now come to light after a former student told the victim's mother, reports WAFB. The woman confronted her son who admitted to the relationship and told detectives that he and Anderson had exchanged sexually explicit text messages and later allegedly had sex at her home. According to the probable cause affidavit, the pair began texting each other after he got her phone number from another student. The victim told police that as time progressed, 'he and [Anderson] became extremely close to one another, and the messages began to become sexual in nature.' The victim and Anderson then began to exchange nude photos of each other and began having sex in July 2013. He would walk to a fast food restaurant near his house and Anderson would pick him up. She would take him to her house where they would have sex. The victim told police this happened multiple times in July and August of 2013 until his mom found out they had been exchanging text messages. He had deleted most of them, so the affidavit says she wasn't aware of the 'intimate nature of he and the accused's relationship.' According to Christian Life Academy's website Anderson began teaching at the school in 2012, is from Laurel, Miss., and attended Mississippi State University . Concerned over what she had seen, the mother confronted Anderson and told her to stop texting her son. The mother also reported the texts to the school's administration. Dr. Jere Melinni, a pastor and founder of the school, has denied any knowledge of the mother's 2013 complaint. 'I do not know anything about this. This is the first day that I have heard anything of this nature,' he told WAFB. 'We would have taken care of it then and she would no longer have been working for us that day I heard.' Police have checked the boy's cell phone records from the time of the alleged affair and found most of the calls and text messages happened between June and August 2013 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Dr. Jere Melinni, a pastor and founder of the school, has denied any knowledge of the mother's 2013 complaint . While being questioned by deputies, Anderson admitted to being involved in an intimate relationship with the victim, according to court documents. She told deputies the relationship was a 'mistake' and apologized for 'taking the victim's innocence.' According to Christian Life Academy's website she began teaching at the school in 2012, is from Laurel, Miss., and attended Mississippi State University. The victim remains a pulip at Christian Life Academy.","Amber Anderson, 27, has been arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old freshman two years ago .

"If there's someone who isn't scared to show her colourful side in these times of taupe and elephant breathe, it is celebrated interior designer Abigail Ahern. Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I’ve ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette – silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys – it’s what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour', come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don’t have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot’s Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room – say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you’ll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You’ll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I’m sure I’d be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo – all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery – you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on! An inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven. The yellow warms up the darker hue, Ahern says . 'To avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull, adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour' 8. All colour schemes are improved by accents: the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise, and bring rooms to life. There are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it. As fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow, it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger. 9. Patterns provide necessary punctuation; don’t neglect them. They anchor a space like nothing else I know. 10. Create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings. Paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you’ve made your space a zillion times bigger. Promise! 'Clever finishing touches, like this whimsical wallpaper, revitalise rooms,' she says .

"Last month some of the biggest names in music joined Jay Z for the launch of his premium music streaming service Tidal. But despite all the pomp and circumstance, the app is now floundering at the lower ends of the iOS app store chart. At the time of writing the $9.95-a-month (£9.99) service ranked at 872 on the overall download chart and 51 in the music category in the US. Scroll down for video . Tidal's $19.99-a-month app (pictured) launched in New York on 30 March. Following the launch the app jumped to 4th place on the iOS music chart but now ranks at 51 in the music category and 872 overall . While in the UK the situation is worse, with the app ranking at 92 in the music app category, and disappearing from the overall app list entirely. By comparison, Pandora radio and Spotify occupy first and second spots respectively when the iOS and Google Play downloads are combined. For iOS only, Pandora is top, Apple's Garageband is second and Spotify is third. The fall in favour was first spotted by BGR's Tero Kuittinen and the figures come from App Annie and its Intelligence platform. It is not known why the app has dropped so significantly but the price may be considered too high for some users. Many users who downloaded it and are using it during the trial period may be looking to cancel their subscriptions and uninstall, or alternatively coverage of the app has dropped. The membership-based service - similar to Spotify - offers music and exclusive video content that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. Tidal currently has more than 25 million songs and 75,000 music videos in its library. Tidal is billed as the first artist-owned platform for music and video and the service aims to compete directly with Spotify and Apple's music service, headed by Dr Dre. Users can pay either $9.95 a month for a standard streaming service or $19.99 for high quality streaming in the US. The same tiers cost £9.99 and £19.99 in the UK. Unlike rival Spotify, the service doesn't have a free tier - meaning the musicians stand to make more money from it, but this also means it doesn't play adverts. Tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - above the 320 for subscribers of Spotify. During the launch event on 30 March, Rihanna, Madonna, Beyonce, Usher, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Jack White and Kanye West joined a host of other stars as they were revealed as co-owners of the subscription service, created by Jay Z.

During the launch event Rihanna, Madonna, Beyonce, Usher, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Jack White and Kanye West joined a host of other stars as they were revealed as co-owners of the subscription service,  created by Jay Z. Tidal is billed as the first artist-owned platform for music and video .

Streaming - which allows users to play unlimited on-demand music online - has narrowly edged out CD sales in revenues over the last year in the US. Industry leader Spotify said it has 60 million users with 15 million of paying for the Premium service. Spotify already has a range of rivals including US-based Rhapsody and Google Play. Paris-based Deezer is the second largest service with 6 million customers. It is strong in Europe and last year entered the US as a high-end-only service. Following the launch of Tidal, Spotify's ranking jumped from 20th overall (red) to 16th in the US, and on 5 April it went from third on the music app chart to second place before falling again the next day. In the UK it held its number one position on the music chart and rose from 8th place to 7th overall (blue) Tidal has more than 25 million songs and 75,000 music videos in its library (pictured).

Tidal is said to stream at 1,411 kilobytes per second, above the 320 for premium subscribers of Spotify . Like Tidal, Deezer's elite service uses FLAC files which are larger than MP3s. Apple - which pioneered digital music through iTunes in 2001 - is reportedly also looking to launch a new streaming service as the market shifts away from permanent downloads. Apple earlier made a bid for streaming customers by buying Beats Electronics, run by Dr. Dre. Along with the US, Tidal is available in Britain and France and plans to launch later this year in Australia and Germany.","Jay Z  launched his $19.99-a-month Tidal app in New York on 30 March .

"As Gwyneth Paltrow files for divorce from  Chris Martin, the couple whose split made them 'closer than they ever have been' are still confounding their critics by playing nicely. Even if you thought their 'conscious uncoupling' was a load of Goop from Gwyneth, it was a refreshing change from the vicious slanging matches other celebrities engage in after a split. There are lessons to be learnt from the couple on how to split amicably - and how to stay friends with an ex. Scroll down for video . Tracey Cox says that Gwyneth and Chris' amicable split is refreshing and something we can learn from . HOW THE COUPLE GOT IT RIGHT: . Put your kids needs first . Gwyneth and Chris are sharing equal custody of their two children and always maintained their first and foremost priority is to make Apple and Moses happy. No matter how acrimonious the split or how little you now have in common, if you have children together you will always have one shared goal: to bring your children up to be happy, functional adults. The more you both focus on that and think of what's best for the children, the more chance you have of forging a geniune friendship. If you're friendly enough to have 'family dates' where you all go out together now and then, do it. But only if you're both relaxed in each other's company. The point is to let the children see there are no hard feelings and that you both have their best interests at heart. If you spend the whole time sniping at each other with pasted, fake smiles, there is no point. Don't criticise their new partner . Gwyneth openly praised Jennifer Lawrence when he dated Chris and he's said to be supportive of her dating choices. Nothing looks more dignified or signals you really are moving on than giving your ex's new love the thumbs up. It instantly scores points with the new person in their life, making them feel less threatened and less likely to want to sabotage, and paints both of you in a good light. If you applaud their current choice in partner, you're effectively saying they had good taste in the past (when they chose you!). Focus on what you liked about your ex at the start, not what drove you apart at the end . Sure, Gwyneth posting a sweet picture of her and Chris in a field with a heartfelt explanation of why they were separating, did provoke a 'Seriously?' reaction. But the sentiment behind it sent a very clear signal: don't expect us to be bagging each other. 'Normal' couples can do the same by letting mutual friends and family know that there is no reason to take sides because you aren't interested in bad-mouthing each other. You might not want to swap 'parting gifts', like Chris and Gwyneth are rumoured to have, but a card expressing disappointment that it didn't work and wishing them well for the future is a nice gesture, if you really do mean it. Talk face to face or on the phone to sort out anything tricky . Chris and Gwyneth regularly talk on the phone to make sure wires don't get crossed. Communicating by text or through social media is fine once you've established a friendship but if you're both still raw and hurting, it's easy to read things into innocent comments. Tracey says that although Gwyneth and Chris' split is admirable there are some aspects you should steer clear of . You can pick up a lot from someone's voice; even better when they're in front of you and you can read their body language. DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME: . You do need a separation period . Chris and Gwyneth were pictured together frequently from the moment the split was announced. But most couples need a period where they separate without too much contact to break the 'we' habit and become two 'me's'. If you're too close, you'll end up being one of those couples who live apart but remain co-dependent, relying on each other for everything they used to. This is fine if you both aren't interested in meeting new partners, but few people feel comfortable intruding on this sort of situation. Don't give your children (or your ex) false hope . Chris and Gwyneth's separation has been so fairytale, the media was predicting a reconciliation practically every week. The same can happen to you. If there's too much tenderness and affection, everyone around you that has a vested interest in you reconciling is given hope. It's also not uncommon for exes who are now being nice to each other, to suddenly remember what it was they fell for in the first place and want to try again. If you're open to that, by all means go for the Chris/Gwyneth style of separating but if you know you'll only ever want to be friends, spell that out. Get the financial settlements out the way first . Gwyneth and Chris are both worth roughly the same (£100m each), so have sensibly decided to split their fortune straight down the middle. Most couples don't earn the same amount (let's not even go there on how much less we're all worth) so do experience friction over finances during the negotiation period. Your friendship has more chance of working if you're polite and fair while you're getting the messy stuff out of the way and attempt more frequent contact once it's sorted. DON'T ATTEMPT BEING FRIENDS AT ALL IF: . The break-up wasn't mutual and you have a hidden agenda . If you're utterly heartbroken, being friends will be painful and pointless. Doing it so you can keep tabs on what they're up to also isn't the best idea you've had. It increases jealousy, upset and anxiety over the break rather than relieves it. You weren't even great friends when you were together . If you spent your entire relationship ripping each other apart why on earth would you want to stay in contact? They're your back-up person . If you were the one to initiate the split but aren't sure you've done the right thing, staying friends is keeping them on the back burner. If you decide you can't get any better, you can get back together, right? Not only isn't this fair to your ex, it's not fair to you either. Leaving the door half-open means everyone new you meet gets compared to them. But exes are exes for a reason - they didn't suit you. If you weren't right together, wipe the slate clean and move on and you'll be more open to meeting a new type of person who will make you happy long-term.

"The women who broke free from Cleveland's 'house of horrors' after a decade in captivity have revealed for the first time in their own words how they survived the traumatic ordeal. Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus recalled the years of rapes, torture and psychological games at the hands of Ariel Castro, a man who lived close to their homes in Ohio, and managed to lure them into his house with trust because his daughters were the girls' friends. The brave survivors have written a book, Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland, which will be released on April 27. In an excerpt, published in People magazine this week, Amanda and Gina, revealed how they found the strength to survive imprisonment. Scroll down for video . Amanda Berry, pictured following her escape from Ariel Castro's 'house of horrors' with her sister (left) and daughter (right) in 2013. The survivor has described in her new memoir, how her daughter gave her the strength to go on during the harrowing ten-year ordeal . Amanda Berry, 29, revealed in her first-person memoir about her abduction and imprisonment by Ariel Castro, that she was left confused by conflicted feelings towards him when he was kind to their daughter, whom she gave birth in captivity after being raped . Gina DeJesus, 25, also shared the details of her horrifying ordeal in a new memoir with Amanda Berry, being published later this week . Amanda recalled how she had learned from TV news that her mother died of a heart attack, aged 43, in March 2006, while she was 'chained like a dog' in Castro's home. At this point, the teen had been missing for three years. Castro lured her into his home on April 21, 2003, on a promise to see his daughter, her acquaintance. He barricaded the 16-year-old in a room, told her to pull down her pants and raped her. She was then chained in the basement and repeatedly abused. Four days after she was captured, Castro turned on the news and saw her mother pleading for her safe return. She said that a silent Castro watched Louwana Miller beg for her daughter to come home. 'He has an odd look on his face, and then I realize: He's proud,' Amanda wrote about her monstrous captor. She also described in the People interview how Castro was much stronger than he looked, packing muscle beneath his rotund figure. 'To be around him was scary,' Amanda recalled.'He had these cold black eyes. We were afraid we were going to die.' The Cleveland 'house of horrors' survivors have written a book, being published on April 27 . Gina DeJesus was abducted using a similar ploy by Castro a year later. She described her abductor to People as 'always prepared'. It later emerged that Michelle Knight, now 34, had been imprisoned in a separate bedroom since August 2002. A month after learning that her mother, Louwana Miller, had died, Amanda, realized she was pregnant by Castro in April 2006. Although initially elated, she worried how Castro would react. Amanda wrote: 'I think my mom sent me this baby. It's her way of giving me an angel. But I worry about what he's going to do. 'Michelle told me that he beat her to make her miscarry. Will he let me carry my baby?' As the pregnant teen mourned her mother alone amid harrowing torture and abuse, she recalled how she made video tapes of news reports of her mom at vigils and watched them repeatedly. Amanda wrote in the memoir: 'I would rewind and hear her voice. I feel like she's definitely here with me now.' On Christmas Day, she gave birth in her prison of a home to daughter, Jocelyn, with the help of Michelle. Castro appeared delighted to have a new daughter, Amanda wrote. She recalled: 'When the baby started kicking, I reached for his hand and placed it on my stomach. 'I knew the baby would be safer if he was excited about being a new father.' Castro told her that they were 'a family'. The predator took the little girl, whom he called Pretty, to church and out to play while her mother remained in chains in his filthy, dilapidated home. Castro finally took the chains off the three women when Jocelyn started to notice them, even though Amanda tried to protect her daughter by telling her that they were only bracelets. Amanda described her confusion at feeling some warmth towards Castro when he treated their daughter well. She wrote: 'I know it's wrong but I feel closer to him. I appreciate that he treats Jocelyn so well and buys her clothes and toys. 'I desperately want Jocelyn to have a normal life. On the days that he helps me do that, I actually feel some affection for him. I'm so confused. 'How can he be good one minute and so cruel the next?' When Jocelyn was five years old, Amanda set up a kindergarten in their bedroom. Amanda asked Castro to buy books. She recalled how her daughter would sit at her 'Dora' desk while Amanda, acting as teacher, would recite the Pledge of Allegiance with her. In November 2012, Castro was becoming more agitated. He lost his job as a bus driver due to stress and began to wonder how he would be remembered in the newspapers because of what he had done. His daughter Jocelyn began to ask when she could go to a real school. Amanda Berry (pictured left as a teen) along with Gina DeJesus (right) and Michelle Knight were held captive in Ariel Castro's Cleveland, Ohio home for 10 years . The broken front door of the house on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland Ohio where Amanda Berry kicked her way to freedom on May 6, 2013, more than a decade after she went missing . On May 6, 2013, a chance finally arose - Castro forgot to lock the door of her bedroom, and Amanda grabbed her daughter and bolted for the front door, kicking her way out through a bottom panel. Amanda described that heart-pounding break for freedom in an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts for ABC's 20/20 to be aired next Tuesday. She said: 'I didn't know what to do, my heart immediately started pounding because I’m like, ''is-- should I chance it? ... He could be here any minute, if I’m going to do it, I need to do it now.' Following the daring escape, police descended on the home, freeing the other women and arresting Castro. He pleaded guilty in July 2013 to 937 counts including two charges of aggravated murder related to one act of forcing one of his victims to miscarry. The 53-year-old was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 1,000 years in August 2013. He hanged himself in his prison cell less than a month into his sentence. Neither Gina nor Amanda is still in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight (pictured) but said in an interview that they wished her well for the future . Amanda recalls how mixed she felt when she learned from a text message that he killed himself. But despite being chained and raped for a decade by the monster, Jocelyn was his daughter and the little girl loved him. 'I don't know what to feel,' she wrote of that September night, as tears streamed down her face. Amanda and Gina revealed in their memoir, written with Washington Post journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, how their captor would play mind games and try to turn them against each other. However they began to establish bonds as they struggled through their darkest hours. Neither Amanda or Gina is currently in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight. In People Magazine, Gina said: 'I think we all did like each other at one point but then [Ariel} played us against each other so we couldn't trust people.' Amanda added that the difficulty of their situation was something that only the three women could understand and she wished Michelle the best for the future. The mother said that she was focused on moving forward in life and concentrating on doing the best for her now eight-year-old daughter. Gina, who is studying for her high school diploma, dreams of owning her own business. And both women said what they have been through left them happy, simply for being able to have regular lives, surrounded by their families.

"Judge Nigel Cadbury, who prompted outrage by suggesting murdered student nurse Karen Buckley had put herself in danger by drinking on a night out . A judge has suggested that a student who was murdered after a night out with friends had ‘put herself in a vulnerable position’. The controversial comments came after Karen Buckley’s remains were found dumped in a field. District Judge Nigel Cadbury mentioned the 24-year-old during a separate court hearing to issue a warning about women drinking too much alcohol. Friends of Miss Buckley, who was studying occupational therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University, have said she had only a few drinks before leaving a club. CCTV shows her walking from the Sanctuary nightclub. From there, she went to a man’s flat in Kelvinside, Glasgow. After a four-day hunt, her body was found at a farm on April 16. Speaking at Worcester magistrates’ court the following day, Mr Cadbury implied Miss Buckley had been drinking heavily on the night of her death. Scroll down for video . Referencing Karen Buckley, Judge Cadbury said: 'It's very, very worrying how young girls put themselves in such very, very vulnerable positions' - prompting anger from domestic abuse and rape charities . University student Karen Buckley, 24, went missing on a night out in Glasgow. Judge Cadbury implied she had been drinking heavily on the night of her death, but her friends say she only had a few drinks . Sentencing Leanne Roberts, 21, who had assaulted someone outside a bar, he said: ‘I find it incredible that young people can get so drunk that they don’t even know who they’re with. 'One only has to think about the horrible situation in Glasgow to see how serious this could have been. 'It’s very, very worrying how young girls put themselves in such very, very vulnerable positions.’ Last night, campaigners branded his comments ‘insensitive’. Katie Russell, of the charity Rape Crisis, said: ‘It was wholly inappropriate, irrelevant and insensitive to make reference to the murder of Karen Buckley in this context and the timing of these comments was particularly distasteful. ‘Of course it’s not unreasonable to advise young people, or indeed people of any age, not to drink alcohol to excess … But for a senior figure within the legal system to talk so specifically about young girls “making themselves vulnerable” in relation to gender-based violence … with specific reference to a recent murder, is unhelpful.’ She added: ‘This reinforces the false notion that it is ultimately victims and potential victims who have the power and responsibility to prevent violence against women and girls. 'In fact, only the perpetrators, who are mostly men, are to blame for violence against women and girls … and only they ultimately have the power to end it.’ Miss Buckley's body was found on a farm north of Glasgow. Women's rights campaigners have said Judge Cadbury's comments as 'unhelpful' and making it seems like 'sexual violence is in some way inevitable' Sarah Green, of campaign group End Violence Against Women, said: ‘District Judge Nigel Cadbury seems to be perpetuating the idea that young women drinking alcohol put themselves at risk of attack. ‘Even if it is not meant, this implies sexual violence is in some way inevitable and it is women’s responsibility to avoid it. It makes the perpetrators of these crimes all but invisible.’ She added that focus should be shifted ‘to the men who choose to commit these crimes – because violence against women is not inevitable. We must start asking who commits rape and why … and what can we do to deter it.’ During the sentencing, the court heard Roberts, of Ombersley, Worcestershire, had punched a woman outside a bar. She was given a six-month community order and a six-week curfew. Mr Cadbury said: ‘There is a drinking problem because she [Roberts] can’t remember what she did … I am sure you are now aware of how vulnerable you made yourself.’ Alexander Pacteau, 21, has appeared in court charged with the murder of Miss Buckley and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. It is not the first time Judge Cadbury, who lives in a  £600,000 farm cottage in rural Worcestershire, has made controversial comments in court. He previously refused to sentence a thief who siphoned off oil from a small village hall because he feared he might 'overreact'. He said: 'My wife is on a small village hall committee. I feel very strongly about this sort of behaviour. 'I feel I would overreact and consider that he should undoubtedly go to prison for this. It would be wrong for me to sentence him. I may be seen to be biased.' The case was eventually transferred to another bench for sentencing. Judge Cadbury is a descendant of Cadbury's founder, John Cadbury, the businessman who set up the famous chocolate firm in the early 19th Century. He is believed to have a daughter and two sons. In 2011,  was appointed a trustee of the Bournville Village Trust, which helps manage the model village set up by the Cadbury family for its workers. He has also worked as a trustee of the Edward Cadbury Charitable Trust, which funds music, education and training in the Midlands. Miss Buckley disappeared from the Sanctuary nightclub, Glasgow.

"The mother of a mentally ill daughter who killed herself last month has revealed how her condition worsened over years and eventually drove her to suicide. Doris Fuller's daughter, Natalie, 28, suffered from bipolar disorder and psychosis, and died when she stepped in front of a train in Baltimore, Maryland, last month. And in the wake of her death, Fuller has written about how her illness, which went undiagnosed until her early 20s, and said she was 'the bravest person I have ever known'. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Doris Fuller's daughter Natalie, left with her mom, killed herself last month - and now Fuller has opened up about how Natalie's bipolar disorder and psychosis led to her death . The mother and daughter pair had shot to fame in 2004 when they collaborated on a parenting guide based on Natalie being totally honest with her mother about whatever she was asked. Bestseller: Natalie opened up to her mom - and the result was this popular parenting book . In a long article about her daughter's life for the Washington Post, Fuller wrote how their famously close relationship was changed for good when Natalie had her first psychotic episode at the age of 22, after she had left for college. Fuller wrote: 'In the span of a few weeks she went from being a dazzling young adult with the world at her feet to a psych-ward patient with an arrest record.' Summarizing her last years, she said: 'My daughter lived more than six years with an incurable disease that filled her head with devils that literally hounded her to death, and she did it while laughing, painting, writing poetry, advocating and bringing joy to the people around her. 'She was the bravest person I have ever known, and her suicide doesn’t change that.' And though medicines and proper treatment gave Natalie her life back for a time, she eventually decided to stop taking her meds, which brought her troubles back, even more acute than before. In a mental health documentary video filmed in 2014, Natalie described the worst lows of her condition, in which she said terrifyingly real voices would tell her to hurt herself. She told the cameras: 'I believed that everything happening to me was real, and I thought that I was acting fine. 'But my mom and my brother and everyone around me could see something that I couldn't see. 'Even though [the voices] were telling me to hurt myself and do horrible things to myself, I still listened to them because I had a relationship with them. I thought they were real.' Although Natalie, a keen artist who sculpted, painted and wrote poetry, often seemed fine while on medication, Fuller told how her future seemed a little bleaker every time she relapsed. Difficulties: Natalie (left in 2014) was not diagnosed with a mental health problem until she was 22 - before then she had a regular childhood (right). She told how as she grew older voices started telling her to harm herself . Growing up: As a teenager, Natalie's no-holds-barred honesty helped make her mom a bestseller . She wrote: 'If she even inadvertently missed a few days of medication - even while receiving therapy and other forms of treatment - the demons would return, and one of the first things they would tell her was to stop taking her medicine. 'The second thing they would tell her was not to talk to her mom, the most powerful other influence in her life. 'Each time she obeyed and relapsed, she plunged into a longer free fall, hitting the ground harder, recovering more slowly and returning at a lower plateau.' According to the article, the final, ultimately fatal, change came last fall when Natalie concluded that the drugs were not helping her at all, and gave them up for good. Fuller was not specific about what happened in Natalie's last weeks, though in a post on a tribute site to her daughter, she mentioned that she had holidayed in Nicaragua with members of her family in February. Fuller, the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center charity has said since Natalie's death that she wants her 'legacy' to be increased understanding and compassion for the those who have mental illnesses. Treatment: When she featured in the video, Natalie told how she was living in a treatment facility and caring for animals in a bid to get better .

He said: '(My family) are sad they are not seeing as much of me as they were but they are very enthusiastic. 'Even Florence gets there's a blue team and I'm in charge. She keeps coming back home at night and saying 'Daddy have you won the election yet?' '(I say) 'no, no it doesn't work like that, it's a long process'.

Mr Cameron's joke came as Philip Schofield introduced pickpocket specialist James Freedman, pictured above teaching the Mail's Harry Mount how to steal . Mr Cameron said he understood why people were thinking hard about who to vote for and said he hoped in the end they would turn to him. He described his frantic campaign schedule, set to include an appearance with London Mayor Boris Johnson later today. Alex Salmond, campaigning with his successor Nicola Sturgeon, is standing for Parliament in May . The Prime Minister said: 'It is a close election, it is a very tough and tight fight. I am not surprised by that. 'In this country, since 2008, since the great financial crash, we have had a difficult time. It has been hard for people and as a country together sacrifices have been made to get the country back on track. 'So I understand why people are thinking very carefully about how they vote - I just believe in the end and hope in the end they will stick with the people turning the economy around rather than go back to the people who crashed it in the first place. 'But in the end, we are a democracy, people will choose.' Mr Cameron said he was left 'angry' by Labour attacks describing him and the Conservatives as heartless. He told the ITV programme: 'What I have done as Prime Minister is try to turn our economy around, get our country back on its feet. It was the poorest that were hit hardest by Labour. 'I get very angry when I hear this attack because we have taken three million of the lowest paid people out of income tax, there are two million extra jobs - people who didn't have work now have work. 'The NHS is absolutely vital to me and is there for everyone's family. Labour can talk about this stuff but I remember what they did in office, I remember the people thrown out of work, who had their houses repossessed. 'It drives me mad sometimes now to hear them talk after five years of opposing everything we have done to get the economy back on track.

"Breakthrough?: Early tests carried out on cancer cells (like the one pictured) have shown survival rates in mice were boosted by more than 50 per cent . A new technique that effectively gives a personal treatment for cancer has been found by scientists. It harnesses the power of the body’s immune system and targets it at tumours. Early experiments have demonstrated that the new method could revolutionise cancer care. Scientists have found a system of priming the body’s immune system to recognise, attack and kill off cancerous cells in lung, skin and bowel tumours. The team which carried out the research found that early trials ‘profoundly retarded’ tumour growth in mice. Survival rates were boosted by more than 50 per cent, according to results published in the journal Nature last night. The scientists are now recruiting patients with skin cancer for the first clinical trial on humans. British experts said it is the most promising sign yet that ‘personal’ treatments may be effective in treating a wide range of cancers. Until now most cancer drugs have been designed according to the type of tumour they are attacking – a broad-brush approach in which the type of drug is selected depending on the body part in which the tumour is sited. But the new focus on personal cancer therapy instead aims to harness each individual’s immune system and give it a boost depending on the genetic make-up of the tumour itself. The ground-breaking technique may provide a universal blueprint for vaccines that can target a wide range of human cancers. And it overcomes the problem of cancer presenting an ever-moving target that constantly evolves to evade the immune system. Scientists last night welcomed the German team’s breakthrough. Professor Kevin Harrington, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: ‘This study provides the first evidence that we may be on the threshold of being able to produce individualised vaccines directed against specific mutations present in a patient’s tumour. Advances: People with skin cancer are now being recruited for the first human trial . ‘Rapid production of purpose-built vaccines appears possible and can now be tested in carefully designed clinical trials. ‘As yet, this approach must be seen as experimental but it potentially represents a new way of harnessing the power of the immune system against cancer.’ The scientists, led by Dr Ugur Sahin, of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, identified tumour-specific mutations linked to the different cancers and showed that many of them could be recognised by the body’s immune system. They then created vaccines based on the body’s own RNA – a genetic messenger – which encouraged the immune system to direct itself towards the weakest part of the tumour. The treatment was shown to boost the body’s T-cells, which detect, hunt down and destroy cancer cells. Of the mice treated, two-thirds were alive after 100 days. Of those that did not receive treatment all died within 65 days. When repeated vaccinations were administered, ‘tumour growth was profoundly retarded’, the authors wrote. Professor Peter Johnson, from the Cancer Research UK Centre at Southampton General Hospital, said: ‘This technique provides the first evidence that it may be possible to direct the immune system to fight cancer using personalised vaccines.’","German team has developed new technique giving 'personalised treatment'

"Australian shoppers will no longer be offered second best a season late. As of Wednesday 22nd April, department store Myer will be holding a unprecedented designer sale sure to melt the plastic cards of fashionistas in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth, in a bid to keep up with international retailers. The department store, which stocks top end  Australian labels including Alex Perry, Toni Maticevski, Lisa Ho as well as international labels  Balmain, DKNY and Alexander McQueen, will see a departure from premium price tags in order to make way for the latest collections in store. Sale season: Myer has announced it is holding a 75 per cent of designer label sale from Wednesday 22nd . The move by Myer comes at a time when there is a greater need than ever to bridge the gap between online and overseas retailer pricing. The department store is understood to have brokered deals to stock international designer collections at the same time as European and American retailers. Sydney shoppers get set: The Sydney CBD will be one of a few selective Myer stores to hold a designer sale . Shoppers heaven: Myer has mark downs between 65-75 per cent off designer shoes, accessories and clothes . This, fortunately for Australian shoppers, means making way for new season collections by slashing the prices of current season stock - at a staggering 75 per cent off. With Bernie Brookes, the CEO of Myer stepping down last month, this move is said to be the influence of new chief Richard Umbers, in an attempt to revive the iconic department store's Australian market. Catwalk to credit card: Balmain (left) and Nina Ricci (right) will be some of the designer brands on sale . 'We think our customers are going to be very excited by this opportunity,' Myer’s Karen Brewster, told The Daily Telegraph. Aside from clothing, the sale will also see a generous 70 per cent of designer accessories and footwear and 65 per cent of designer handbags and wallets prices across labels  including Emilio Pucci, Marc by Marc Jacobs, See by Chloe, Jean Paul Gaultier, McQ Alexander McQueen, Moschino, Balmain and DKNY. The sale will run from Wednesday 22nd until Sunday 26th or until sold out.

"One Tennessee judge has been hailed for her no-nonsense, brutal take down of a gang member who arrogantly dared claim a once-pleasant suburb as 'his hood' while in her courtroom. After O'Shae Smith told Judge Lila Statom that he shot a rival gang member for being 'in his hood', she had no problem telling him the area didn't actually belong to him. 'Sir, East Lake Courts is not your hood', Statom began, referencing the public housing project where the shooting took place. Tennessee Judge Lila Statom has become a viral sensation thanks to her incredible take down of one gang member who dared try to claim an area as 'his hood' while in her courtroom . 'Sir, East Lake Courts is not your hood, it's the citizens of the United States who own that because they work and pay taxes' Statom told O'Shae Smith, who told the judge he shot a rival gang member for being there . 'It's the citizens of the United States who own that because they work and pay taxes, you don't own that.' Statom said she wanted to show Smith he wasn't 'in control everywhere'. 'It makes me upset because there are people that live in East Lake Court who get up and go to work every day. They take their children to daycare,' she told WRCB-TV. Statom had a personal connection to the area that has been ravaged with gang violence, and told Smith 'it used to be a very nice place to live'. 'My grandmother lived there and I spent many a night,' she told the courtroom. 'It was a nice place where you could walk around. People like you have made it a violent, unsafe place to live.' 'Hopefully we can make it the place that it used to be back when it was originally built for people who didn't have anywhere else to live - to make it a safe place to live,' she said. According to police, Smith, 20, shot Kendre Allen, 18, in the hip in late March. Allen also appeared in Statom's court last week to testify against Smith. 'My grandmother lived there and I spent many a night,' she told the courtroom about the Chattanooga area. 'It was a nice place where you could walk around. People like you have made it a violent, unsafe place to live' Smith has been charged with attempted first-degree murder for shooting Kendre Allen, 18, in the hip in late March and is being held without bond. Allen also appeared in court to testify against Smith . Smith has been charged with attempted first-degree murder and is being held without bond. Police said Allen was the fourth person shot in six days in the area during an ongoing gang feud last month, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported. Statom said she thought it was unfair that anyone had to 'live among the violence' that was ravaging a community where she once walked around to get ice cream and groceries or go to church. Police said Allen was the fourth person shot in six days in the area  during an ongoing gang feud . 'I didn't want to allow him to take control over a courtroom when I felt he had maybe taken control over an area of town,' she said. At one point in the video, Statom completely shuts down Smith when he raises his finger to say something. 'I don't think you want to say a word to me Mr. Smith,' she remarks. Statom told Fox News she was especially bothered that Smith was standing in front of her and didn't look to care 'in any way' about the charges brought against him. 'I thought, he needs to know that gang members who go into communities like this are really affecting the people who have no choice but to live there,' she said. The judge says she usually tries 'not to say too much' in the courtroom, but that she was 'frustrated' watching people who 'are not working and are not contributing' bring crime and violence into the community. And Statom hoped that by speaking up, she would inspire others to try and affect change. 'I hope that I can give people that are coming to testify hope, that it does make a difference if you stand up.'

"Appointment: Courtney Brain, 16, was taken out of lessons when she visited her GP for treatment . A straight-A schoolgirl was given a detention for missing half an hour of lessons for an emergency appointment with her GP, her mother claimed yesterday. Courtney Brain, 16, was taken out of school at Skegness Academy when she visited her GP for treatment for a water infection. But she was stunned upon her return to class in Lincolnshire to be told she must make up the missed time for the ‘unauthorised absence’. Her mother Jane Burnham, 50, criticised the ‘mind-boggling’ decision last Wednesday to punish Courtney - who she claimed has a 98 per cent attendance record, although the school put this figure at 91 per cent - and accused the Academy of being ‘petty and unreasonable'. Mrs Burnham, who runs a hotel in the town, said: ‘I was gobsmacked. My daughter has never been in trouble before. She is expected to get straight A*s in her exams and helps out after school with extracurricular activities. 'She is not a problem child, she works hard and this was the only appointment I could get. Trying to see your GP around here can be a nightmare and I’ll always try and get an appointment after school. But on this occasion she couldn’t, so you take it when you can. 'She was only out of lessons for half an hour. It wasn’t like she was round the back of the bike sheds having a cigarette or going on a shopping spree. Then it would be different. 'She had a water infection for which she needed antibiotics - and I find the decision to give her detention mind-boggling. Concern: Skegness Academy (above) in Lincolnshire claimed the detention was to give Courtney, whose mother runs a hotel in the seaside town, the best chance possible of doing well in her exams in the summer . ‘Water infections can get worse so it was important to go to the doctor as soon as she could. I think it very petty and unreasonable for her to be punished in this way. I am not happy at all. 'We were gone half an hour, that’s all she was missing. It’s mind boggling. It’s disgusting really.’ The school claimed the detention was to give Courtney the best chance possible of doing well in her exams in the summer. But Jane Mrs Burnham who runs the Carmelle Hotel with husband Trevor, 53, said she did not think the extra half-hour revision will ultimately make any difference to her overall grades. Detention: Courtney (pictured) was told she must make up the missed time for the 'unauthorised absence' She added: ‘I think the extra half an hour really would not make that much difference especially as she has already done all her coursework and practical work. GP visit: Courtney had a water infection for which she needed antibiotics last Wednesday . ‘It is just revising for her English and maths GCSE now. It is not as though she makes a habit of missing school for doctor’s appointments, it was a one off. 'Courtney’s attendance is 98 per cent, which is above what the school requires and she teaches the younger kids dance after school anyway. She was left upset by this and like she had done something really wrong.’ The girl's attendance figure was contested by the school, which insisted it was 91.2 per cent - below the national average. Principal Elizabeth Silvester said letters were sent out last month in response to a growing concern about the number of sixth-form students missing vital lessons due to medical appointments. She said: ‘As a matter of course, we request that students make any routine appointments out of school hours. 'Where this is not possible, we request that students make up any time that they have lost. ‘We want to ensure students complete all the work for their relevant subjects in order to give themselves the best chance of succeeding in their forthcoming examinations.’ Skegness Academy caters for 1,191 pupils aged 11 to 18 and was given a rating of ‘good’ by Ofsted in its last inspection in October 2012.","Courtney Brain left Skegness Academy to visited her GP for treatment .

"A drone carrying small traces of a radioactive material landed on the roof of Japanese Prime Minister's office in protest against the government's nuclear energy plans. The police and bomb squad were called after the four-propeller, 50-centimeter wide drone, was spotted by member of the Prime Minister's staff, on the roof of his principle office and residence in Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. The drone was equipped with a small camera and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material, according to Japanese media. Radioactive: The drone, which landed on the roof of the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence, was found to contain traces of a radioactive substance . Alert: Police and security officers investigate an unidentified drone found on the rooftop of the Prime Minister's official residence in Tokyo . The radioactive material is likely caesium, a soft metal and harmless to the human body, Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. It is not known who flew the drone onto the building but it is widely suspected it was someone protesting against the country's nuclear policy. People in Japan have become increasingly wary about the number of nuclear power plants in the country, following the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Flown in: The blue tarpaulin covering the drone can be seen next to the helicopter pad on the roof of the Prime Minister's office in Tokyo . Guarded: Police and the bomb squad were called in after a member of the Prime Minister's staff noticed the drone on the roof . Tests to determine whether to plant should be decommissioned are currently being carried out, though many are skeptical over whether it would happen. Meanwhile, the Japanese government reportedly plans to dump 30 million tonnes of radioactive debris from the disaster in a waste complex by nearby village, Okuma. Anti-nuclear protests were held outside the Kagoshima District Court to stop reactors at Kyushu Electric Power Co's Sendai nuclear-power station in Satsumasendai, southwest Japan from being restarted, amid fears they were at risk fro earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Standing guard: A police officer outside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's official residence in Tokyo . Investigations: Officers comb the roof for clues after a drone (pictured right) landed on top of the Prime Minister's official residence in Tokyo . Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was pushing for the reactors to be put back online as he wants to cut Japan's dependence on imported fossils fuels. The courts agreed, meaning they will be back online in less than two years. The drone was initially covered with a piece of cardboard and covered by blue tarpaulin before being removed. Mr Abe was not in residence at the time as he is currently in Indonesia attending the Asia-Africa conference in Jakarta. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said police were investigating Wednesday's incident and that the government may consider new regulations on drones.","Remote control device had miniscule levels of radioactive substance .

"The Conservative know that they need to turn large parts of the country blue on May 7. And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate Alec Shelbrooke in Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.","Samantha Cameron makes solo campaign visit to a charity project .

"The world’s third largest cruise liner today sailed past its sister ship as it made its way out of Southampton Docks on its maiden voyage. The Anthem of the Seas, which has 16 decks and can carry almost 5,000 passengers, towered over the Explorer of the Seas as it departed the Hampshire dock this afternoon. The cruise liners, which are both owned by Royal Caribbean International, will both be based in Southampton and serve Europe and the Mediterranean over the summer. As the season comes to a close, the Anthem of the Seas will then move to New York Harbour which will become its permanent home and allow it to regularly sail from Cape Liberty Cruise Port to Bermuda, the Caribbean, Canada and New England. The highly-anticipated new cruise ship, which was officially named earlier this week, is set to welcome more than 80,000 people on board this summer and bring an estimated £50,000 to the local economy. Featuring robotic bartenders, skydiving, circus training, surfing simulators, indoor bumper car racing, roller skating rinks, an adult-only spa, aerial observatory and 18 distinctive on board restaurants, the ship is widely classed as the next generation cruise liner. Meanwhile, the veteran Explorer of the Seas, which enjoyed its maiden voyage 15 years ago, has been given somewhat of a refurbishment and now also includes a surfing simulator, 3D movie cinema and additional restaurants. The ship, which has 15 decks and a capacity of more than 3,000 passengers, also boasts a rock-climbing wall, ice-skating rink and full-size basketball and will serve northern Europe, the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands until September.

"The South Korean government paid an eye-watering £2.4million to the makers of the new Avengers movie to ensure the country is shown in a positive light, it has emerged. Much of the comic book film, Avengers: Age of Ultron, was shot in Seoul and the country's culture ministry agreed to cover a third of filming costs in the city on the agreement the Republic of Korea is shown as 'high tech' and 'modern'. The use of public funds in what appears to be an extreme case of product placement has been criticised by South Koreans - as officials are having to wait with the rest of the world to see if the film, released on Thursday, will lift the country's reputation out of the shadow of it's headline-grabbing northern neighbour. Scroll down for video . On set: Chris Evans suited up as Captain America as shooting on Avengers: Age Of Ultron got underway in the Sangam-dong district of Seoul, South Korea last year . The production crew in the Sangam-dong district of Seoul, South Korea last year during filming for Avengers: Age Of Ultron . The move echoes that of Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM, who recently made headlines after leaked emails revealed  the Mexican government had offered the studios $20m to ensure a positive portrayal of the country in Spectre. Kim Young-gun, who overseas the Korean Film Council's (KOFIC) incentive program for foreign films, said the film could transform the status of Seoul, which has been largely overlooked by Hollywood compared to its regional peers. He told MailOnline: 'If we have that kind of huge film, which shows Korea in a more positive way, then we think the image of Korea will be changed in a positive way.' The locations featured in the film include Gangnam Boulevard, immortalised in the pop song Gangnam Style, and Cheongdam and Mapo Bridges which span the city's Han River. Before shooting began last year, local government and film industry officials signed an agreement with the filmmakers to ensure the country would be shown in a positive light. In an memorandum of understanding, Marvel Studios agreed it would 'portray Korea as a high-tech, modern country and shall avoid portraying the Republic of Korea in any negative manner.' Filming: Black Widow pictured on her motorbike (right) in Avengers: Age Of Ultron, filmed in the Sangam-dong district of Seoul, South Korea (left and right) Capital city: Much of the comic book film, Avengers: Age of Ultron - released tomorrow - was shot in Seoul in South Korea . Scarlett Johansson plays Black Widow in the new Marvel movie Avengers: Age of Ultron, out on Thursday . The sequel sees the Marvel Comics superheroes forced into action when a high-tech peacekeeping programme - Ultron - goes badly wrong . In return, the country's culture ministry agreed to pay 30 percent of the cost of production in Seoul, about £2.4m. Only on Thursday will they know if it will boost the international image of the capital and make it as iconic abroad as Asian metropolises like Tokyo. Kim said: 'KOFIC and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, also, are concerned about how they will portray Korea in the film, but we are looking forward to seeing the film on Thursday.' KOFIC has estimated the sequel to the 2012 hit The Avengers, which features an all-star cast including Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jnr, could attract some 620,000 extra tourists to the country. The film has already sold 94 percent of its presale tickets. Scarlett Johansson stuns at the European premier of Avengers: Age of Ultron at Westfield shopping centre in west London last night . Stars: The cast of Avengers: Age of Ultron attended the European premier of the film in London last night . Kim acknowledged there has been domestic criticism about the spending of public funds but said the money has been put to good use, claiming US producers are already expressing greater interest in the country. A US source close to the production of the film, however, insisted Marvel Studios has not altered production to appease Korean officials. 'If there was an agreement signed or a rebate involved, Marvel is always about (being) creative first and the script and the story come first, and then if they can shoot in an area that offers them an incentive, then that's just an extra bonus, that's extra good for them,' the source said. 'But it's not what drives their scripts or the stories they tell.' Media in strongly nationalistic South Korea have often complained the country has been overlooked or misrepresented in Hollywood. Starring role: Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Scarlet Witch in the new movie, wrapped up for the premier last night . Dashing: Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, and Chris Evans, aka Captain America, attend the European premier . On Monday, the national broadcaster KBS reported that the country has only had fleeting appearances in the film, usually in relation to North Korea. Seoul, it said, has been shown as indistinguishable from Tokyo. Nina Juna, senior manager of international affairs at the Seoul Film Commission, said the few previous appearances of Seoul on the silver screen have irked Korean audiences. She said: 'The depiction of a future Seoul in Cloud Atlas looked like a future Japanese city, not Korea.'","South Korea has paid Marvel to ensure country is shown in positive light .

Lian Doyle agreed to hide the trainers worn by Justin Robertson when he murdered Pennie Davis because he had been paid £1,500 by the son of the victim's ex-lover. She was today sentenced to 10 months in prison, but was released immediately because she has already spent six months on remand. Killing: Lian Doyle, left, helped to cover up the murder of Pennie Davis, right, in September last year . Doyle, 24, pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice after she admitted disposing of her boyfriend's shoes, thinking he had worn them to commit a burglary. Robertson was jailed for life yesterday after being convicted of murder, while Benjamin Carr also received a life sentence for paying the killer to murder Mrs Davis, 47. Winchester Crown Court heard that Carr wanted the victim dead because she was planning to tell police that he had sexually assaulted someone. Today the court was told that Robertson convinced Doyle to hide his trainers, making her think that he had carried out a burglary while wearing them. She lied to police on his behalf - but when she realised that the trainers were evidence in a murder inquiry, she confessed to what she had done. Boyfriend: Doyle was manipulated by Justin Robertson, left, who was paid to kill Mrs Davis by Benjamin Carr, right . Victim: Mrs Davis was found dead in a paddock in the New Forest in September 2014 . Mr Justice Popplewell told Doyle, from Hythe in Hampshire: 'On September 2 last year, after Pennie Davis had been killed, Justin Robertson had given the trainers he had been wearing that afternoon to a neighbour to put them in the rubbish. 'Two days later he asked you to retrieve them and burn them but rather than burning them you gave them to somebody else to dispose of. 'You didn't know they had been worn to commit a murder and you thought Justin Robertson had been wearing them for a burglary.' He added that following her initial arrest, Doyle was interviewed but failed to inform police about dumping the trainers, which 'impeded' their investigation. The judge said: 'I'm satisfied that Justin Robertson was a dominant character and he is likely to have manipulated you.' Couple: The victim's body was discovered by her new husband Peter, pictured . Family: Mrs Davis' relatives are pictured outside Winchester Crown Court yesterday . Doyle's lawyer Charlie Gabb said in mitigation that she was reliant on Robertson, and would stay with him in friends' houses because she did not have a home of her own. 'She must have been somewhat in awe of him in light of her own vulnerability,' he said. 'For a young lady who has never had any experience of the criminal justice system it's been a considerable shock. 'There is a stark reality that she is on her own and Mr Robertson can no longer provide for her.' Mrs Davis was found dead in a paddock near Beaulieu, Hampshire in September last year by her husband Peter, whom she had married just months earlier. Robertson, 36, was paid £1,500 in counterfeit banknotes to kill her by Carr, 22, who had a longstanding grudge against her dating to her long relationship with his father. The court heard he wanted her dead because he feared she would report sexual assault allegations against him to the police. The plot unravelled when Robertson dropped the keys to his getaway car near to the murder scene, allowing officers to track him down.","Lian Doyle, 24, hid a pair of trainers belonging to Justin Robertson .

"Millions of fake condoms sold by a gang across China have been seized by police after they were found to contain toxic metals. Police in Shanghai revealed today that they had seized three million knock-off condoms - thought to be worth nearly £1.3 million on the black market - after they broke up a large operation covering eight provinces. Officers said the lubricating oil used on the condoms at one production line in Henan province was so disgusting that it made them feel sick, according to the People's Daily Online. Dodgy work: Fake condoms were made in a makeshift workshop in Shanghai . Big haul: A total of three million condoms, thought to be worth £1.3 million, were seized by police . Heavy metals are toxic metals such as mercury, lead and arsenic. However, officials did not reveal the exact metal traces found during the tests. The fakes were packaged as popular brands such as Durex and cost just 1p to make - 30 times less than the market value. Cheap raw materials - consisting of plastic strips and elastic bands - were used to make the condoms in makeshift workshops. But the gang still sold the condoms at the regular price of £4.20 for a pack of 12 via their own online shop, contacting potential customers via social media. The counterfeit condoms were also sold at motels across the country. Squalid: The condoms were made by women in a run-down residential property in the Yangpu district . Health hazard: Tests found that the counterfeit condoms contained toxic metals and were not safe to use . One woman in the Yangpu district of Shanghai had been running a workshop in a run-down residential property, employing local workers to make and package the condoms. The woman, who had already been arrested in 2013 for selling fake Viagra, was arrested along with eight others. Zhang Wenliang, a police officer from Shanghai's Yangpu district Public Security Bureau, said: 'At a workshop in Henan province, we found a small production line which produced bad-quality condoms. The lubricating oil made us vomit. 'We sent the seized condoms to the quality authorities and tests showed they contained heavy metals. They are very dangerous to humans.' Police said the gang had nine production lines and warehouses across the country. The fake condoms were sold in Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shaanxi provinces. Not the real deal: The fakes were packaged as popular brands like Durex in the sophisticated operation .","Three million condoms seized in Shanghai, thought to be worth £1.3m .

"Radio host Mel Greig, who once hit the headlines for her involvement in an infamous royal prank call, has started a personal crusade to help remove the stigma attached with IVF treatment. On Wednesday, Mel posted a blog post on her website titled 'Are we embarrassed of IVF?' where she detailed how she was undergoing the treatment, and that it was nothing for women to be ashamed of. In her post, Mel wrote: 'In the past few months I joined a new club... It’s the IVF Baby Club.' She also uploaded photographs of injecting herself for the first time as she began her IVF program. Mel Greig spoke on her blog about how she was now starting IVF treatment . She posted photographs that showed her injecting herself for the first time as she began her IVF program . The radio host married her fiancé Steven Pollack at Byron Bay in November . The 33-year-old married her fiancé Steven Pollack at Byron Bay in a small and intimate ceremony on November 20. But the couple's efforts to have a baby have been thwarted because she suffers from Endometriosis. Endometriosis causes inflammation and can lead to female reproductive body parts and other organs fusing together, making it almost impossible for eggs to fertilise naturally, rendering many women infertile. Mel was one of these women, and had been told she would not be able to fall pregnant naturally. It was then that she made the decision to have IVF treatment. Since then however, she has discovered that some women keep their IVF treatment a secret and are embarrassed about it. For this reason she took to her blog to highlight the issue. Mel showed her support for women who were also going through IVF treatment . The couple's efforts to have a baby had been unsuccessful because she suffers from Endometriosis . 'When you are first told that news, you do feel like you’ve failed the process of being able to bring a child into the world as a “normal” mother,' she explained on her blog. 'But my thoughts soon shifted to “but I still have a chance to bring a child into this world and that’s amazing” we should NOT feel embarrassed to have IVF babies.' Before Mel started her own treatment she said she understood why the majority of mothers wanted to keep quiet during the process of IVF as it was long, draining, intrusive, emotional, and for some parents, financially hard. 'But when you are through the battle and are holding your precious baby, you should be happy and proud... don’t feel embarrassed to say “they were born through IVF” you need to realise that science helped you with the end result,' she said on her blog. The 33-year-old went public about it as she wanted to help remove the stigma that women can feel about having IVF treatment . She hit the headlines in December 2012 for her involvement in an infamous royal prank call . With fellow DJ, Michael Christian (right), they posed as the Queen and Prince Charles in  a phone prank that ended in tragedy . 'But it was YOU who decided to bring that child into this world, it was YOU (and partner/donor) who provided the magical ingredients to make your baby. 'And it is YOU who is going to smother this child with unconditional love and support for the rest of their life and THAT is what truly makes you a “normal” mother.' Mel has had to overcome challenges in her life before. In December 2012 she was hosting on 2 Day FM with fellow DJ Michael Christian when they posed as the Queen and Prince Charles, and rang the London hospital where the real life Duchess of Cambridge was suffering severe morning sickness with her first child. Nurse Jacintha Saldanha who answered the phone and put the call through to the ward took her own life two days later and cited the distress at being fooled as one of the reasons. The pair's call was answered by nurse Jacintha Saldanha who later committed suicide. She cited the stress caused by the prank as one of the reasons why she took her own life . However, after coming to terms with the tragedy and fallout from it, Mel is ready to take on the next challenge that life has thrown at her - the daunting prospect of IVF treatment. 'As I sit here loading up my first syringe I’m thinking, “I hope I do this right. If my doctor doesn’t answer which friend can I call to ask for advice?” Women help each other, it’s what we do,' she blogged. 'But how can we do that if we don’t know who to ask for help? Support networks are so important. I will share as much of this journey as I can, through the pain, heartache, joy... and I hope I don’t feel the need to keep it private too. Mel has had great support from her husband Steven (right) as she starts her IVF program . 'If you are a part of this elite club and you know someone going through IVF, maybe take that first step and privately reach out letting them know you too have membership and you are there for them if they need someone. 'I know that I’ll be doing the same.'","Australian radio host stands up for women going through IVF treatment .

"We’ve all been there: you hear a catchy song and for days - or even weeks - on end you just can’t get it out of your head. Known as an earworm or brainworm, the effect has been studied before - but its cause, and how to get rid of it, is poorly understood. Now researchers say they have an answer; chewing gum after hearing a catchy song will help you think about it less often. Reading scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song. In a study people were less likely to think about it when chewing (stock image shown). And they were a third less likely to 'hear' it when chewing gum. The results suggests same technique could stop other intrusive thoughts . The study was carried out by scientists at the University of Reading. In the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘catchy tunes’ Play Hard by David Guetta and Payphone by Maroon 5. - Recent music exposure . - Repeated music exposure . - Word triggers (eg. the word ‘faith’) - People triggers (where sight or memory of a person is associated with a song) - Situation trigger (eg. weddings can cause you to remember your own first dance song) - Stress . - Surprise . - Dreams . - Mind wandering . Over the next three minutes, they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum, not chewing gum or tapping their finger. While chewing gum, volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they weren’t chewing gum, or when they were told to tap their finger instead. And chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘heard’ the song in their minds by a third. The study is the first to examine the effects of chewing gum on earworms - and it suggests it could also be used to stop other unwanted or intrusive thoughts. ‘Interfering with our own “inner speech” through a more sophisticated version of the gum-chewing approach may work more widely,’ said Dr Phil Beaman, from the University’s School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, who led the study. In the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘catchy tunes’ such as Play Hard by David Guetta and Payphone by Maroon 5 (pictured). Over the next three minutes, they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum, not chewing gum or tapping their finger . While chewing gum, volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they weren’t chewing gum, or when they were told to tap their finger instead. And chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘heard’ the song in their minds by a third (stock image shown) ‘However more research is needed to see whether this will help counter symptoms of obsessive-compulsive and similar disorders.’ In a previous study by the University of Reading in 2009, it was found that almost any song can become an earworm. A recent poll suggested over 90 per cent of the population experience them at least once a week with 15 per cent classifying their earworms as ‘disturbing’.","Reading scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song .

"Passengers experienced some anxious moments when their plane landed at a New York City airport and was met by firefighters wearing full protective suits. Emergency workers surrounded the Delta Air Lines plane at LaGuardia Airport after an odor of smoke was reported by the crew moments after Flight 2522 touched down. Passengers were still on board as firefighters walked through the cabin with a thermal imaging camera to locate a potential heat source. After the plane landed a firefighter used a thermal imaging camera to locate a potential heat source . Passenger Pamela Sullins snapped photos showing a firefighter in the aisle of the McDonnell Douglas MD-888 twin-engine plane, and others gathered on the tarmac after the commercial jet flew in from Tampa, Florida, yesterday. She told MailOnline Travel: ‘I noticed an odor that seemed like electrical wires burning after we landed. I did not see any smoke.' Pamela, who was travelling to New York for business meetings, said the Delta crew provided updates to passengers as the situation unfolded, and everyone remained calm. ‘I could see [the firefighters] putting on their suits outside the window and the crew kept us pretty informed, telling us that they were coming on board to use a special camera.’ She said passengers were kept on the plane for about 45 minutes. A Delta Air Lines spokesperson said the odour of smoke was detected moments after the plane landed . In a statement a Delta Air Lines spokesperson said the flight crew noticed a ‘smoky odor in the cockpit’ while taxiing to the gate. The spokesperson added: ‘Out of an abundance of caution, the crew shut down both engines and notified the airport fire department. ‘The aircraft was towed to the gate where customers deplaned normally. The safety of Delta’s customers and crew are always our top priority.’ The plane was taken out of service for an inspection and any necessary maintenance.","Delta  said the flight crew reported an odor while taxiing to the gate .

"Will Hatton hasn't been able to keep his feet firmly in one place since the age of 18. The 26-year-old British backpacker has only once tried to conform to a regular nine-to-five desk job at a travel agency - an endeavour that failed within six months. Instead, Mr Hatton has made a career out of travelling the globe as The Broke Backpacker, recording his adventures in his blog, making money through any random odd job he can find in foreign lands and spending only $100 each week on all of his expenses. Will Hatton has made a career out of travelling the globe as The Broke Backpacker while spending only US$100 a week . 'When I first started travelling seven years ago I really didn't have any money whatsoever, so I became a bit of a whizz at hitching, couch surfing and dumpster-diving,' he said . 'Venezuela is definitely one of the cheapest countries I have ever been to. You can fill up a car for under 2 cents and get 12 beers for a dollar!' For just $100 Mr Hatton received a stack of money totalling over 1000 bills . 'When I first started travelling seven years ago I really didn't have any money whatsoever, so I became a bit of a whizz at hitching, couch surfing and dumpster-diving. All of this helped me save money and spend my budget on what really mattered - having a good time,' Mr Hatton told Daily Mail Australia. 'Now I tend to purposefully pick extremely cheap countries such as Nepal, Venezuela or Cambodia in order to help stretch my money as far a possible. 'Venezuela is definitely one of the cheapest countries I have ever been to. You can fill up a car for under 2 cents and get 12 beers for a dollar! 'Sometimes, I pick up casual work on the road.

I've hitched all over Europe and even to Africa and more recently I've been spending time in Venezuela and Colombia,' Mr Hatton said. But his adventures have left him with a scar or two and lead him into plenty of disastrous situations. Mr Hatton said he has been robbed on three separate occasions, once at knife point, crashed motorbikes, had to be evacuated from a jungle in Costa Rica after developing a serious leg infection that left permanent damage to his limb and was strip-searched at gun point while crossing into Israel from Palestine. In Jordan, he hitched a ride from a Rastafarian Bedouin (pictured) who let him spend a week living in his cave, cooking on the fire and helping to herd his goats while Jordan's star-filled desert sky left him in awe each night . Camel riding in Jordan: 'Get on with it, just go and don't look back: If you spend your whole life waiting for the perfect time, the perfect companion or the perfect destination to go travelling then you may never end up going,' Mr Hatton says . He admitted that he found himself well and truly out of money on a number of occasions, often leading him to search for work at a bar for a few days or a farm in exchange for food and board . Indian tug of war: 'After a year in India, I was totally skint and ended up Couchsurfing with an elephant handler for a couple of weeks whilst I figured out my next move' 'To this day, I do not know why I was singled out, but I was separated from everybody else in the queue and taken into a James Bond-esque building complete with blast doors,' he recounted.

One of the most useful pieces of equipment that I take absolutely everywhere is my head torch - it's gotten me out of a tight spot on more than one occasion.

"A photographer who captured the brutal murder of an immigrant in South Africa has spoken out after coming under fire for taking pictures instead of trying to save the victim. James Oatway took chilling images of Mozambique national Emmanuel Sithole being stabbed and beaten by four men in Alexandra township near Johannesburg on Saturday. Pictures of the attack sent shockwaves around the world, with some accusing the journalist of not doing enough to prevent Mr Sithole's death. Responding to the criticism, Mr Oatway said it was vital for people to see the brutality of the anti-immigrant protests that are sweeping the country. He also told how he desperately tried to save Mr Sithole by taking him to a nearby medical centre. But in a desperate twist he found it was closed because the foreign-born doctor had failed to turn up for his shift for fear of being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township. Scroll down for video . Photographer James Oatway (left) who captured the brutal murder of migrant Emmanuel Sithole (right) in South Africa has spoken out after coming under fire for taking pictures instead of trying to save the victim . Sick: As Emmanuel Sithole lay injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench . Under siege: The brutal attack was captured on camera on Saturday morning by a journalist from South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper who was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who'd had their businesses looted overnight . Beaten: As children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening, the Mozambique-born passer-by was attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench . He told Radio 702's John Robbie: 'The one regret that I have was that the first clinic that we took him to weren't equipped to treat him. 'We did lose some valuable time taking him out of the car there, taking him into the clinic and then the nurses told us that there's no doctor there. 'They put a gauze dressing on his wound and then we put him back in the car, but that whole process took about 10 minutes.' Mr Sithole, who had been found bleeding to death in a gutter, was taken to hospital where he later died, the cause of death established as a direct stab wound to the heart. Mr Oatway also defended his decision to take the images, saying they reflected the 'absolute stark reality' of the situation. Harrowing: A third attacker  then entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife . Brave: Before the man had the chance to use the large knife, a witness intervened and the three attackers fled the scene . He said: 'It's not easy to look at and I understand that some people might be offended by that. 'But really people have to know what's happening, and people have to see the brutality and the vulgarity of what's going on. 'I think that people who are angry with me for taking the pictures... should try and direct their anger at the men that are responsible for the attack and not at me.' Four South African men accused of stabbing Mr Sithole appeared in court yesterday accused of murder. They will remain in custody until a trial, set to be held on May 4. Mr Oatway captured the attack while he was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who'd had their businesses looted overnight. But as children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening, the Mozambique-born passer-by was brutally attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench. As Mr Sithole sat injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench. Dying: Witnesses took Mr Sithole in the back of a car to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreign-born duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift because he feared being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township . Fatally wounded: In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because the a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself . During the subsequent journey to hospital, Mr Sithole's condition deteriorated as he screamed in agony before eventually falling unconscious . A third attacker - wearing a grey hoodie - then reportedly entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife. Before he had the chance to use the knife a witness intervened and the three men fled the scene. It was too late for Mr Sithole, however, who managed to stumble along the road pleading for help for his fatal injuries before collapsing fatally injured in a rubbish-strewn gutter. Oatway's  images were published on the front page of South Africa's Sunday Times under the headline: 'Kill thy neighbor: Alex attack brings home SA's shame.' Following the attack, fearful immigrants in South Africa revealed they had been targeted  by longtime neighbors and people who warned they would assault anyone carrying a foreign passport. The immigrants spoke at a tent camp where they are now living having fled Alexandra when the mobs began attacking shops owned by those from other African countries. The violence in Alexandra township followed anti-immigrant riots in and around the coastal city of Durban that killed at least six people, recalling a bout of similar unrest in South Africa in 2008 in which about 60 people died. Four South African men suspected of killing Mozambican national Emmanuel Sithole in Alexandra township in an apparent xenophobic attack, are arraigned at the Wynberg Magistrate Court in Johannesburg .","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"The Duchess of Cambridge's baby is due as early as today, it has been revealed. According to one well-placed source, Kate's real due date is today or tomorrow - which would tie in with comments made by the Duchess herself. Speaking during an engagement in London last month, she said that her second child is due 'mid to late April'. Scroll down for video . Due today? The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due 'mid to late April' during a visit last month . Kate, 33, who was touring the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford with Prince William, added: 'Not long to go now.' Although April 25 is widely thought to be the Duchess' due date, royal sources point out that it has never been officially confirmed as such. 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date,' a Kensington Palace source told MailOnline. 'The Duchess herself said mid to late April and there have been plenty of dates bandied around in the media but we've never confirmed anything and we never will.' However, the 25th remains a favourite with punters according to bookmakers Ladbrokes, although tomorrow and Friday are also popular and are priced at just 6/1. The Duchess is currently thought to be staying at Kensington Palace, a short drive from the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital where she is due to give birth. Popular: The 25th is the favourite but the Palace says neither that date or any other has been confirmed . Preparations: The police were seen making final checks ahead of the birth outside the Lindo Wing yesterday . Yesterday, police could be seen searching the area in preparation for the Duchess' arrival and were seen peering under traffic cones and taking lamp posts apart. According to a statement released by Kensington Palace the same day, the new baby's father, Prince William, has  finished his Air Ambulance training early and will now avoid the two-hour dash from Norfolk that some had predicted. 'The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated,' the statement read. 'This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned. 'As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.' Fans: Royal fans have also set up camp outside the hospital, among them Terry Hut, 71 . Ready to go: The scenes outside the hospital are reminiscent of those seen for Prince George in 2013 . Back in town: The Palace has said Prince Harry will be in London this weekend before returning to Australia . But concerns have been raised about the possibility of the royal birth clashing with official events to mark the centenary of the Dardanelles campaign, with Prince William due to attend a wreath-laying service at the Cenotaph on Saturday. The ceremony, which is also being held to mark ANZAC Day, will be mirrored by another taking place in Turkey which is due to be attended by the Prince of Wales and Prince Harry.

"Ben Affleck today finally admitted the name of the slave ancestor he had censored from his past. The Oscar-winning actor posted on social media that a 'Benjamin Cole' of Georgia, an ancestor on his mother's side, was the relative dropped from the PBS show about his family history. The admission came the day after he apologized for lobbying for the removal of the truth about his family past from Finding Your Roots. Writing on his personal account he said: 'Lots of people have been asking who the guy was. His name was Benjamin Cole - lived in Georgia on my Mom's side about six generations back.' Scroll down for video . Ben Affleck has apologized after he demanded information about a slave-owning relative be withheld from a PBS show about his ancestry . Admission: How Ben Affleck finally came clean . Affleck took to Facebook to issue his apology . Close: Ben Affleck and his former Freedom Rider mother Chris Anne, seen last October in Los Angeles . His mother, Chris Anne, had featured in the show, not because her ancestor benefited from indenture, but because she had been a Freedom Rider. After appearing on Finding Your Roots and learning one of his ancestors was a slave owner, Affleck pushed the network to leave that information out of the program it was first revealed by DailyMail Online, a request the producers ultimately agreed to. However, the admission suggests Affleck may have more than one slave-owning ancestor. Another was named today by The Sun as James McGuire, who kept eight slaves on his farm in what is now Trenton in New Jersey in the 1840s. The affair has severely embarrassed the actor, a high-profile campaigner for liberal causes, who runs a charity for Africa. It has also plunged PBS into crisis, and according to a prominent commentator, 'diminished' Prof Henry Louis Gates Jr, the host of the show, who is a Harvard academic. Last night the actor apologized for asking producers to leave out the name in a post on Facebook, while also explaining his reasons for his decision. 'After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for Finding Your Roots, it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves,' wrote Affleck. 'I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.' Affleck went on to say he lobbied for that information to be withheld after filming the episode. 'It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable,' he explained. 'The assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family.' He then added; 'I regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story. We deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are, as a nation, still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery. It is an examination well worth continuing.' Spotlight: The future of Prof Henry Louis Gates Jr as the host of the show is in the balance after PBS launched an investigation into whether its editorial code was breached. US genealogist Debra Fleming is said to have helped trace Affleck's family tree back to McGuire, a relative of his father Timothy. Ms Fleming told the Sun: 'There are lots of farmers in the family. Slavery didn't end in New Jersey until 1846.' Affleck is just one of the many celebrities once again under fire after WikiLeaks sorted all the hacked Sony emails into a system that makes them easier for the public to search. PBS meanwhile is conducting an internal investigation to determine if this omission violated the network's editorial standards. They have yet to release a statement on their findings or to make clear when they will be reported, and whether they will quiz Affleck. However, the affair has also called into question the future of the show's host, Prof Henry Louis Gates Jr. After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for 'Finding Your Roots,' it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves. I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth. Skip decided what went into the show. I lobbied him the same way I lobby directors about what takes of mine I think they should use. This is the collaborative creative process. Skip agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with. In the end, it's his show and I knew that going in. I'm proud to be his friend and proud to have participated. It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable. The assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family. I regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story. We deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are, as a nation, still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery. It is an examination well worth continuing. I am glad that my story, however indirectly, will contribute to that discussion. While I don't like that the guy is an ancestor, I am happy that aspect of our country's history is being talked about. Ben Affleck . Until now he had been a Harvard University academic best known for the 'beer summit' organized by President Obama when a policeman tried to arrest him because of a 911 call about men breaking and entering a home - which was in fact Prof Gates' own home. The arrest became the center of a debate on racial profiling, and the African-American academic and the policeman were invited to the White House to discuss the arrest and its fallout over a beer. However today he was described as 'diminished' in the New York Times by Frank Bruni, its columnist, as 'diminished' by the affair which 'exposed Gates, a trusted authority on the African-American experience, to accusations that he'd sold out'. PBS declined today to offer any guarantees that he would remain host of the show. On Friday it issued a statement on his behalf but today said it was not responsible for his public statements. The publicly-funded broadcaster was severely criticized by its ombudsman for its handling of Affleck and Daily Mail Online's revelations. Michael Getler, the ombudsman, said the channel 'took a beating'. 'On the broader points, it seems to me that any serious program about genealogy, especially dealing with celebrities, cannot leave out a slave-owning ancestor,' he said. '...Gates, aside from the decision he made – and it looks to me like a bad one – also, in my opinion, violated the well-known ""no surprises doctrine"" for public affairs programming and many other things by not informing PBS about these demands by Affleck'. He added: 'As for PBS, they just struck me as asleep at the switch when this broke. It was pretty apparent from the leaked emails what had happened and to put out a statement that said essentially nothing and very quickly looked pathetic, as if they were hiding something.' PBS said it had no comment to make on the ombudsman's words.","Ben Affleck has revealed name of the slave-owning ancestor which he got PBS to cut from Finding My Roots .

"Cruise ship passengers on today relived their two day ordeal at sea after being trapped on Carnival Spirit as Sydney was battered by the storm of the century. Huge waves as high as 40 feet smashed glass panels, shattered plates and cups – and left many on-board violently seasick as the boat pitched from side to side. A Sydney harbour pilot finally boarded this morning and the ship, carrying 2,500 holidaymakers and 1,500 crew, docked at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at around 10am. Scroll down for videos . The 2500 passengers on board a cruise ship, which has been stranded at sea due to wild weather conditions, have finally arrived at Sydney Harbour this morning . Holidaymakers were due to disembark the Carnival Spirit on Tuesday morning but the Sydney storm prevented the vessel from entering the harbour . The port in Sydney reopened on Wednesday morning, allowing the ship made its way through the harbour to dock . Passengers from the cruise ship Carnival Spirit disembark at Sydney's Overseas Passenger Terminal . 'We're so relieved to just get off,' passenger Courtney Randall said as she disembarked the liner. 'Inside everyone was sick, it was really quite rocky.' 'Everyone is ready to get off,' Debbie from Cherrybrook told ABC radio as the ship headed towards the shore. Another passenger told the Sydney Morning Herald  of the horror and panic of being on board while the ship was battered had left her traumatised . 'At one stage, I looked out the window and one of the waves crashed up against the glass. I freaked out and closed the curtains. I couldn't deal with it,' Athanasia Georgoudakis, from Yagoona in Sydney's south-west, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'This is the last [cruise]. If I want to go on holiday I will catch a plane. I will not take another cruise, never.' Vacationers were put on edge as 'a lot of water' coming through glass panels and some of the crew were also frightened by the experience. One passenger has told how many travellers have been 'vomiting for two days' due to rough seas conditions . A spokesperson for the cruise liner said that boarding is expected to commence at 2.30pm for their modified 7-day Isle de Pines vacation, with plans to set sail by 7pm . A camera on the cruise captures the moment it finally enters Sydney Harbour on Wednesday morning . One member of staff, who had worked on cruise ships for six years said that he had been sea sick and was very relieved to be back on shore. 'I was pretty scared of the roughness because I've experienced nothing like that before,' he told Daily Mail Australia, asking not to be identified. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday. It had been due to dock on Tuesday morning but Sydney Harbour was closed to traffic as conditions were so bad. The crew had pleaded for calm on board the ship, saying it was built to withstand the storm, which has been described as a 'once in a century' weather event. Daily Mail Australia spoke to several new passengers, who were among many waiting to check in their luggage for their week-long journey aboard the ship. One young Gold Coast couple (pictured) Caleb Dias, 18, and Chloie Rhodes, 17, could not wait to jump on board as they had been planning this trip for nearly a year .

The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged and stranded outside Sydney Harbour on Tuesday morning . The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas . Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves . While the ship was stuck at sea, one passenger told the Daily Telegraph that 'there was a large wave that hit at 7.30 last night that tore one of the doors off causing a whole lot of water to come flooding through the deck'. 'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off. 'One crew member has been working here for 10 years and he reckons it's the roughest he's seen.' At 8.25am on Wednesday, Carnival Cruise Line Australia finally posted a message on their Facebook page that their ship had been cleared to dock . ‘(We) have been notified that the port in Sydney is now open to ship traffic and we're happy to say the weather has improved to allow safe entry into the port,' it read. The Carnival Spirit has 2500 passengers on board, stranded outside of Sydney Harbour because of the city's wild weather . 'The pilot is now on board and ship is proceeding to the terminal and is expected to be alongside no later than 10am. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.’ Damage to the 293m Carnival Spirit was minor and it was scheduled to depart of for a seven-day Isle de Pines cruise this evening. Daily Mail Australia spoke to several new passengers, who were among many waiting to check in their luggage for their week-long journey aboard the ship.

One young Gold Coast couple Caleb Dias, 18, and Chloie Rhodes, 17, could not wait to jump on board as they had been planning this trip for nearly a year. 'I guess we're a bit nervous but I think we'll be fine and we even bought some travel sickness tablets just in case,' Mr Dias said. Dr Marie-Therese Proctor, of Picton which is 80km south-west of Sydney, is travelling with her teenage daughter Serena and told Daily Mail Australia she is confident the weather is going to clear up. 'It's disappointing that we lost one day of travel as we were supposed to leave yesterday and we would have cancelled our trip all together if it didn't sail today,' Dr Proctor said. 'But I am looking forward to some quality mother and daughter time on this trip plus I trust the crew's decision to go ahead with the trip in these conditions.' Waves of nine metres have been battering the ship for the past 24 hours .

"The Duke of Edinburgh has been presented with the insignia of his Australian knighthood by the Queen, in recognition of his contribution to the Commonwealth nation. Prince Philip was presented with the award on Wednesday by his wife, despite significant criticism  of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott following the announcement in January that he had recommended the Duke for the honour. The citation recognises the 93-year-old Duke of Edinburgh's long service to the British monarchy and the Commonwealth, adding: 'He has served Australia with distinction and is patron of over 800 organisations.' Scroll down for video . The Duke of Edinburgh has been presented with the insignia of his Australian knighthood by the Queen . The Duke of Edinburgh, who served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War, wore 17 medals and decorations when he visited the new SSAFA charity headquarters in central London in November 2013 . 'For three quarters of a century, Prince Philip has served the Crown, and the wider Commonwealth. He served originally as an officer in the Royal Navy and then as a member of the Royal Family,' the citation said. Mr Abbott’s announcement on Australia Day - celebrated on January 26 - that the Queen’s consort would be awarded his nation’s highest award prompted questions over the wisdom of knighting a British royal on a day meant to commemorate their countrymen. The media dubbed the decision to make Philip a knight of the Order of Australia a 'knightmare', and incited public criticism from within Mr Abbott's own backbenchers as well as the Opposition. 'I stand by the decision. I understand why some people don't like it,' he said. 'I respect their right to be critical... and I take it on the chin, I take it on the chin,' Mr Abbott told reporters at the time. The prime minister - who confirmed he did not consult his own chief of staff Peta Credlin - said there would be 'considerable more consultation around these awards' in the future. Mr Abbott said in a speech at the National Press Club this month that he accepted the decision was a 'captain's call', and he 'probably overdid it on awards'. The Queen presented the Duke with the insignia of a Knight of the Order of Australia (pictured) The  investiture ceremony was held at Windsor Castle on Wednesday . Australia’s High Commissioner, Alexander Downer (above right), was present during the ceremony in the Castle’s White Drawing Room . 'I just want to make it clear that all awards in the Order of Australia will henceforth be entirely a matter for the Order of Australia Council,' he said. During the investiture ceremony, held at Windsor Castle, the Queen presented the Duke with the insignia of a Knight of the Order of Australia. Australia’s High Commissioner, Alexander Downer, was present during the ceremony in the Castle’s White Drawing Room. The accolade is just one of dozens of awards received by Philip, who is already a Knight of the Order of the Elephant in Denmark, a Royal Chief of the Order of Logohu in Papua New Guinea, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. Mr Abbott’s announcement on Australia Day - celebrated on January 26 - prompted criticism . Mr Abbott said Prince Philip (right) had made a 'great contribution' to Australian society during his time . He is also a Knight of the Garter, a Knight of the Thistle, a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, an Earl, a Baron and the Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy. The prime minister's office first sought advice about giving the Queen's husband a knighthood in November 2014, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet officials confirmed in January. They also revealed the Letters Patent for the Order of Australia had to be amended because the Duke of Edinburgh was not an Australian citizen, making him an 'honorary' knight only. Mr Abbott sent a cover letter to the Queen with the amended Letters Patent in mid-December. The Queen agreed to the recommendation to knight her husband on January 7, 2015. The 92-year-old Duke joined the Royal Navy in 1939, aged 19, and served throughout the Second World War and on until 1953, when he gave up his active career in the Navy after the Queen ascended the throne. Since then he has held various military posts, including Admiral of the Fleet and Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy. Array of honour: The Duke of Edinburgh, who joined the Royal Navy straight from school in 1939, wore 17 medals and decorations when he opened the new headquarters of armed forces charity SSAFA in late 2013 .

"An exotic animal owner from Ohio is campaigning for his bear and big cats to be returned after they were seized by the state in January. In total, six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger (part lion, part tiger) were taken from Kenny Hetrick's Stony Ridge farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit and cages were 'unsafe'. Authorities have also started cracking down on the owners of  wild creatures following an incident in 2011 where a man in eastern Ohio released 56 exotic animals - including lions and  tigers - then killed himself. Apparently Hetrick has been heartbroken by the clampdown on his farm and the 72-year-old widower is now fighting to overturn the seizure, backed by neighbors who insist his menagerie doesn't pose a threat. Scroll down for video . Feeling lost: Kenny Hetrick is campaigning for his tigers, leopards and bears to be returned after they were seized by the state in January . They have organized car washes and handed him envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars to pay legal bills. Some spent the winter shoring up his cages with taller fences and netting, hoping the animals will return. 'He's lost without them,' said Josh Large, who lives four houses away. 'A lot of us are lost without them.' Hetrick allowed anyone to visit at no charge, getting by with help from volunteers and donations of cash, as well as of deer and horse meat to feed his animals. He thought of himself as an educator, inviting scout troops and families to learn what they wouldn't hear at zoos. Flashback: In total six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger were taken from Hetrick's farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit - here he is seen in 2014 with his pet bear . However, the 2011 incident mentioned earlier pushed Ohio to tighten regulations on 'private zoos'. Owners are now required to have sturdy cages, background checks and insurance before receiving an annual permit. Since the beginning of last year, Ohio has issued permits to 54 exotic animal enthusiasts. Others gave up their animals or moved them out of state rather than make the changes. 'I know I didn't have everything done, but I thought they'd work with me,' said Hetrick, who acknowledged before his animals were taken that he couldn't afford everything the state wanted. The agriculture department says that it tried, but that he never responded to letters sent over a span of two years with the permit application materials until last October, nine months after the deadline, when it gave him ten days to surrender his animals. State officials in January rejected his application for a permit, which includes a $1,000 fee, saying it submitted was too late. They also said state inspectors who visited the sanctuary outside Toledo last November discovered the tigers could stand on their housing and get dangerously near the top of their cages. The inspection noted there were unsecured padlocks and chains and not enough fencing around an enclosure holding a tiger and black leopard. 'If motivated, it would be very easy for either of those two animals to escape,' said Melissa Simmerman, assistant state veterinarian. Hetrick, whose pickup truck has 'Tiger Man' painted on the side, disputes those assertions. 'Nothing's ever got loose. Not in almost 40 years,' he said. 'Nobody's ever been bit. Nobody's been hurt.' Empty: A sign affixed to a cage at Tiger Ridge Exotics in Stony Ridge, Ohio, indicates that it is the home of Cody the bear - Cody and 10 other exotic animals were seized by the state in January . Lonesome: Only Chief the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law . The Ohio Department of Agriculture has a duty to protect the public's safety, spokeswoman Erica Hawkins said. 'Just because an animal's never gotten out, doesn't mean that an animal couldn't get out,' she said. Hetrick is appealing the department's rejection of his permit application and a hearing is scheduled for next week, but the fight will probably continue in court no matter what a state panel decides. Until then, the ten animals - a lion named Leo that had been in failing health was euthanized by the state last week - will remain a two-hour drive away outside Columbus, in a high-security building operated by the state. 'Today, the Ohio Department of Agriculture did the right thing by seizing the wild animals at Tiger Ridge Exotics who have been held illegally and long neglected. Now, it's been reported that the animals will possibly have to endure the stress of being tranquilized again and moved back to the roadside zoo—a potentially life-threatening move. This is a selfish stunt to prevent the animals from being sent to a sanctuary where they would finally receive the care that they so desperately need. PETA is calling on the facility to do the right thing and allow these animals to enjoy a peaceful life at a reputable sanctuary where their needs would come first.' Source: Toledo News Now . Supporters of Hetrick believe the animals - only the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law - have been mistreated and will not survive long outside their home. State officials insist they are fine. Hetrick doesn't have formal training with wild animals, but he has been around them about 60 years, since he was a ten-year-old volunteer cleaning cages at a zoo in Tarpon Springs, Florida. His love for wild creatures grew when he moved to Ohio. He first brought home an ocelot, often called a dwarf leopard. 'I tell people don't start with a tiger if you don't know what you're doing,' he said. He and his wife, who died four years ago, spent much of the money he made as an auto worker and police officer on the animals. Even with donations, food alone for the tigers and others cost as much as $15,000 annually in recent years. Their collection multiplied, often when others dropped off unwanted pets. His daughter, Corrina Hetrick, remembers going out to catch the school bus only to find an alligator swimming in a kiddie pool. There also was the time a black panther showed up in the back of a pickup truck. 'I didn't have cats and dogs,' she said. 'I had bears and tigers.' Even the circus camped at his two-acre property while traveling between shows. 'We had elephants in the backyard and contortionists in the living room,' she said. Erica Crawford, who has been visiting Hetrick's animals since she was a little girl and now brings her children, said she appreciates the uniqueness of the place. 'There's never been a time,' she said, 'where I felt like it's not safe there.'","In total, six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger (part lion, part tiger) were taken from Kenny Hetrick's Stony Ridge farm .

"A New Jersey woman convicted of killing her husband and hiding his remains in storage containers wept in court Wednesday as a judge sentenced her to 55 years in prison after comparing the grisly murder to Al Capone’s St Valentine’s Day massacre. Loretta Burroughs, 63, sobbed throughout her sentencing as relatives of her late husband, Danny, talked about the horror of losing him and finding out that she chopped up his body and took his remains with her when she moved. Mrs Burroughs was arrested in May 2013 after Danny Burroughs' body parts were found inside the guest bedroom closet of the Ventnor home she was moving out of. Scroll down for video . Crocodile tears: Loretta Burroughs, 63, pictured in wiping away tears in New Jersey Superior Court in Mays Landing Wednesday, was sentenced to 55 years in prison for the murder and dismemberment of her husband . Victim: Daniel Burroughs was missing for six years before his chopped up remains were found at his wife's home in Ventnor, New Jersey, in 2013 . Grief: Raymond Wantorcik, brother of murder victim Danny Burroughs, refers to a photo of the pair stating 'This is my best friend... I won't smile like that anymore' during the sentencing of Loretta Burroughs . She had told family and friends that he had left her for another woman shortly before the couple was due to move to Florida in August 2007. Investigators testified that the containers were each wrapped in nine trash bags, with air fresheners, dryer sheets and scented beads to mask the smell. They began re-examining the case after a family member provided new information to the new cold-case unit of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office in February 2013. Loretta Burroughs said in addressing the court that the killing wasn't planned. But friends had said she didn't want to move to Florida, which was her husband's idea, and that was her motive for killing him. In sentencing her, Judge Michael Donlo said, ‘This court has not seen anything so brutal and heinous as this since Al Capone ordered the St. Valentine's Day massacre.’ The notorious Prohibition-era gangster was believed to be behind the slayings of seven people in Chicago on February 14, 1929, by hired killers dressed as policemen. Shaking his head at the defendant, Judge Donlo marveled that she had murdered her husband just so she wouldn't have to relocate to the Sunshine State. 'Wait until you see now where you're going to go,' he told her, according to Press of Atlantic City. Loretta Burroughs was found guilty last month of first-degree murder for stabbing her husband to death, dismembering him with a knife and a saw, packing the body parts into plastic containers, and dragging them with her as she moved three times in six years. Graphic: The jury was shown how the dead man's remains had been systematically taken apart . Loretta was about to move for a fourth time on May 17, 2013, from Ventnor, New Jersey, to Villas, New Jersey, when authorities arrived at the door of her new home with a search warrant. They were investigating her for fraud in relation to the disappearance of her husband, Daniel S. Burroughs, 63, who was reported missing on September 1, 2007. Guilty: Loretta Burroughs, 63, murdered and cut up her husband then hid the body for six years . 'She asked if we were also searching the Ventnor house,' testified Sgt. Lynn Dougherty of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office. When told that they were, Loretta's physical demeanor 'changed completely. Her whole body sunk. She lost the color in her face, she was wringing her hands, very nervous.' In the guest bedroom closet of Loretta's Ventnor home, Detective Caroline MacDonald of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office discovered two large boxes wrapped in multiple plastic garbage bags. As she started to open the bags, she smelled the distinct odor of decomposition and called the medical examiner. The boxes were transported to the morgue. Dr Charles F Siebert Jr, a forensic pathologist, began opening the boxes. Both were surrounded by nine layers of plastic bags in alternating directions, Siebert testified. He also found dryer sheets, air fresheners, and scented beads to mask the odor of death. Inside the first container, Siebert testified, he found a woman's handbag. 'I described it as olive but I didn't know the color, because it had been sitting in decomposition fluid,' he said. Inside the handbag were a 'cranium and mandible' — a skull and jawbone. The second, larger plastic container contained more bones, including the left upper arm and lower legs. Gruesome: A woman's handbag, soaked in decomposition fluid, was found in one of the plastic totes. It contained the victim's skull and jawbone. Siebert testified that he saw cut marks on the ribs that were consistent with stab wounds. He determined that the person had died by homicide. Dr Stuart Alexander, a forensic odontologist, or dentist, from Cranbury, testified that he positively identified the remains in the plastic tote as being Daniel Burroughs. Alexander compared Burroughs' dental records to the teeth in the skull. Donna Fontana, a forensic anthropologist with the New Jersey State Police, testified about the condition of the bones in the boxes. 'There was no gnawing from animals and no bleaching of the bones,' she said. 'That means the bones were in a protected environment, with no sun exposure, and not exposed to the environment where they were attacked by animals.' Fontana then used a replica of a human skeleton and photographs to explain to the jury what had happened to the bones. She said the right tibia, which is the large bone of the lower leg, had been cut with a knife and a saw. Because the cut edge was the same color of the bone, she said it had been sawed at the time of death. Several vertebrae were missing, and others showed signs of trauma, including 'linear cuts as if produced by a knife.' Demonstration: Donna Fontana, forensic anthropologist with the New Jersey State Police, uses a replica skeleton to show the jury where the bones of the victim's leg had been sawed. Forensic anthropologist Donna Fontana testified that all the wounds to the victim's ribs were made with a knife. The third rib on the left side was completely fractured. Fontana testified that several of the body's 24 ribs were also missing. Of the ribs that showed trauma, the injuries were consistent with knife wounds. One was completely fractured. 'There is a pattern of dismemberment,' Fontana testified. Dismemberment, she explained, is usually done 'to hinder identification and for ease of transport.' Chief Assistant Prosecutor Seth Levy argued that Loretta Burroughs murdered her husband, Danny Burroughs, for money. Danny disappeared on August 3, 2007. A few days later, Loretta told friends and family that he had left her. She said he drove off with a younger woman in a yellow Hummer with Florida license plates. In reality, the prosecutor said, Loretta had killed him, and her gruesome plot had begun months before the murder. Loretta worked at the Mey House Assisted Living Facility in Egg Harbor Township, now called Somers Place. In early June 2007, she asked attorney Enid Hyberg, whose mother was in Mey House, to draft a power of attorney. Loretta told the attorney that she and her husband were selling their home, but Danny was going out of town. With the power of attorney, Loretta could complete the sale. Hyberg drafted the document. She did not charge Loretta, 'in gratitude for the attention she was paying my mother,' Hyberg testified. A power of attorney needs to be notarized. In June 2007, Loretta asked Edward T. Dwyer, whose mother was also in the Mey House assisted living facility, if he knew anyone who could notarize it. 'She said her husband had left her, the house was sold, but the deal wasn't finished because he left,' Dwyer testified. 'I agreed to help her out,' he said. 'She was overly good and generous with my mother.' In June 2007, Dwyer asked his sister-in-law to notarize the power of attorney. Although Danny Burroughs was supposed to sign the document, he did not. Instead, the prosecutor said, Loretta signed Danny's name to it. Loss: Ray Wantorcik had to sit through the trial but said he believed the graphic images of his brother's remains were what had convinced jurors of his sister-in-law's guilt . Ray Wantorcik, right, was finally able to hold a memorial for Danny Burroughs on May 10, 2014, almost seven years after he reported his brother missing. 'My brother won this case for himself,' Ray said. Nicole DiDomizio, Loretta's daughter by another man, testified that her mother frequently signed Danny Burroughs' name. In fact, she saw her do it between four and six times. After Danny's death, the prosecutor said, Loretta used the forged document to sell their home. The profit was $77,101. But the money was locked up in escrow, and Danny was entitled to at least half of it. 'She can't get the money if she is married,' Levy, the prosecutor, said. 'But she can get it if she is divorced.' Loretta filed for divorce on February 28, 2009, 18 months after she killed her husband. She told her divorce attorney, Daniel Alsofrom of Northfield, NJ, that her husband had moved to Florida and did not give an address. Alsofrom published a notice of her divorce complaint in the Press of Atlantic City. Loretta received half of the money when she filed for divorce, and the other half when the divorce was finalized, Alsofrom testified. As a result, the prosecutor said, between the profit from the house, and selling Danny's possessions, such as his tools and his collection of remote controlled model airplanes, Loretta received close to $100,000. 'The defendant has gotten away with it for over eight years, with nothing left but the bones,' Levy said in his closing statement. 'The story ends with the defendant being $100,000 richer and Danny Burroughs in the defendant's closet.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A bride-to-be who lost eight stone when she fell for a Turkish toyboy during a beach holiday, has sworn to remain single after finding out he was two-timing her with another woman. Karen Reidy, 40, from Manchester, thought she had found her soulmate when she met Sakir Candan, 12 years her junior, on holiday in Marmaris in 2012. But the hotel worker's dream romance turned sour when she discovered on Facebook that he had been cheating on her for several months. Karen met Sakir on a break after her mother's death and went on to lose eight stone in weight . Karen slimmed from a size 22 (left) to a size 12 (right) and showed off her new look during their relationship . Karen first met Sakir in September 2012. Her mother had recently died and she booked the holiday to help her through her grief. She met Sakir, then 26, working on a jeep safari and the two clicked immediately. Karen said: 'Sakir was younger than me but I really fell for him. He was charming and looking back, I was vulnerable after my mum's death.' After returning home, the pair kept in daily contact. 'He messaged me constantly and sent cards, telling me how much he missed me,' she said. 'He sent me little love notes signed Spartacus or Emre - his nicknames.' Their relationship continued, with Karen flying out to see Sakir every couple of months and the pair holidayed around Europe, backpacking in the Baltics and Macedonia. Eighteen months after meeting Sakir proposed to Karen with a ring engraved with his name . Karen Reidy was heartbroken when she discovered that younger man Sakir had been cheating . Karen said: 'I paid for everything; our flights and our hotels and all our spends. Sakir was a shopaholic and I bought him shoes, clothes and a new phone. 'Looking back of course I was a fool, but I was in love. 'Sakir came from a poor family. We were planning a life together so it seemed natural for us to share what money we had. 'The only thing Sakir ever bought me was a souvenir cup for my 40th birthday - and I later discovered he had bought the same cup for his other woman.' In between her trips to see Sakir, Karen worked six days a week in a hotel and saved every penny. 'As well as paying for our holidays, I lent Sakir money too. I regularly wired cash over to him, £500 here and there. But I believed that he would pay me back,' she said. The long-distance romance also had a dramatic effect on her figure as she slimmed from a dress size 22 to a size 12, in a bid to impress her new love. She said: 'I didn't even eat - I lost eight stone I was so love-sick. I went from 19 stone to 11 stone and dropped ten dress sizes.' The couple's favourite place was a Macedonian town called Ohrid, where they visited together. Karen says: 'Sakir told me we would live there together and open our own business. The holiday was so romantic. Sakir would regularly send romantic notes to Karen by post while she was away from Turkey . After discovering that Sakir had cheated Karen found out that both she and his other woman had been given the same souvenir mug from Istanbul that had been purchased in a BOGOF deal . 'But I later found out he had sent a postcard from there, which I had paid for, to his other woman. I was speechless at the level of deception.' In autumn 2013, Sakir proposed with a ring, engraved with his name. And in February last year, they began planning their future with Sakir arranging for Karen to meet his family, in preparation for their wedding. But when she arrived home, she got a message from a stranger claiming that she had been seeing Sakir for several months. As well as regular visits, Karen had been transferring hundreds of pounds to Turkey . Karen said: 'I didn't believe it at first. But when I went on her Facebook page, there was Sakir, wrapped around her - wearing a shirt I had bought for him! 'I was devastated.' The two women struck up an unlikely friendship, exchanging details about their relationship with Sakir. Karen - who said she was 'heartbroken' and that Sakir was her 'whole world' - also learned that they had both been given the same souvenir cup from Istanbul. Karen said: 'When she showed me a photo of the cup, my jaw dropped. He had bought me the exact same cup for my birthday.' A furious Karen confronted Sakir and he admitted everything - even confessing he had bought the two cups in a buy-one-get-one-free offer. Karen says: 'It would be funny if I wasn't so broken-hearted. Sakir has ripped out my heart and ripped off my wallet.' Karen estimates she spent around £7,000 on Sakir but although he promised to pay back the cash he borrowed, she has not received a penny. Karen made a trip to Turkey to confront Sakir about the money but left empty handed . She said: 'I paid for everything the whole time we were together. I bought him clothes, shoes and a bike and I lent him cash countless times.' Karen said: 'It all came crashing down around me. I suddenly saw what an idiot I had been. My family and friends had been right all along.' Heartbroken Karen has now pledged to be single . She also claimed Sakir has other love interests. She said: 'I've done some digging and found a third woman who says he was after her too. He is such a rat.' The heartbroken blonde recently returned to Marmaris to confront Sakir about the money he allegedly owed her and why he lied to her but she said 'he had no answers'. 'I went out every night partying and having fun and I bumped into him, one evening, with my friends. 'He had the cheek to tell me how great I looked and I said: ""That's because I'm rid of you"". 'I didn't waste my holiday though. I had a wonderful time, sunbathing and partying. He's in the past. But I will never have another holiday romance.' The only thing I brought home from Turkey this time was a sun tan and a new tattoo.' Sakir Candan admitted that he had been in relationships with both the women. He claimed Karen is stalking him and denied she had sent him money.","Karen Reidy, 40, met Sakir Candan on holiday in Marmaris, Turkey in 2012 .

"Lord Janner escaped justice after the UK’s top prosecutor over-ruled the advice of two of the country’s most senior QCs, it emerged last night. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was encouraged by two aides to charge the Labour peer with historic sex crimes. Both Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. Scroll down for video . Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders 'ignored the advice' of to top QCs to charge Lord Janner . Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse werer made . In particular Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided that it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his advanced Alzheimer’s, sparking a storm of controversy. The latest revelation came as Mrs Saunders endured a barrage of criticism for ending the case before it could reach court. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a ‘trial of the facts’ could have satisfied the need to get the bottom of the appalling claims against Janner whatever his mental state. Figures from across the political spectrum are clamouring for the decision be reversed amid fears of a ‘whitewash’. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said the concerns were justified. Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something ‘very strange’ about the decision and Health Minster Norman Lamb called for the matter to be settled by the courts. Accusing the CPS of ‘heinous errors’, Mr Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of people with dementia being brought to trial. ‘My concern is that because the DPP and indeed the Crown Prosecution Service at a local level have made errors in this case, heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so,’ he said. ‘This matter should not be concluded by the DPP and should be brought before a court. ‘There is a precedent of people with dementia being brought to trial. With allegations as serious as this it seems to me that this is the right approach.’ Mr Hunt said Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been ‘right’ to express concern at the decision. ‘I think she’s right to do so and I think Boris is right to do so as well because I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious,’ he said. Meanwhile Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and leading legal expert, said that although there was strong evidence that Lord Janner was suffering from dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. Earlier this week, leading politicians from seven parties came together to attack the latest decision not to prosecute Lord Janner and demand the decision be reversed amid public concerns of a ‘whitewash’. The cross-party group, led by Labour’s Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times saying: ‘As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.’ Mrs Saunders announced last week that there was enough evidence to charge Janner with 22 crimes against nine victims but said it was not in the public interest to do so. Mrs Saunders’ decision not to prosecute came after a two-year multi-million pound inquiry by Leicestershire Police examining allegations spanning four decades. It led to a furious public row with victims saying they will never see justice and police threatening a High Court legal challenge. Mrs Saunders defended her decision saying it is her duty to make the right judgment even when it is unpopular. But the Daily Mail can reveal Clare Montgomery QC offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. Mayor of London Boris Johson, pictured, has expressed concern over the failure to charge Lord Janner . She told Mrs Saunders it was unlikely prosecutors would be ‘susceptible’ to a judicial review if she took Janner to court. Senior lawyers feared Janner’s legal team, closely advised by his QC son Daniel, would try and block the case with a High Court challenge focusing on his ill health. But Mrs Montgomery is understood to have said that as long as prosecutors had the support of his alleged victims it was unlikely any such review would be successful. Eleanor Laws QC, who was leading counsel to the investigation, recommended that he be charged. Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry. Mrs Saunders concluded that there was enough evidence to prosecute but Janner’s ill health prevented any criminal proceedings. She appointed two of the country’s foremost dementia experts who concluded his dementia is at an advanced stage and would never improve. They were Professor Michael Kopelman, of King’s College London, and Dr Katherine Humphreys, of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. At least 10 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including six in the past year. Mrs Saunders has told friends that she has no intention of quitting over the Janner row. One said: ‘She says she will not be hounded out of office. She is absolutely determined to stay in post.’ In the coming months, she is due to rule on whether Rupert Murdoch’s News UK should face corporate charges over the phone hacking scandal which engulfed the News of the World. Scotland Yard detectives investigating alleged corporate crime are seeking to bring a case that would force senior executives to be held to account. A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and said Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an ‘ancillary matter’. She said: ‘It is the Director of Public Prosecution’s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what she has done in this case. ‘As the ultimate decision maker, she receives advice from a number of internal and external lawyers but the decision is based, ultimately, on her own assessment of the relevant law and circumstances of the case, no one else’s.’","Alison Saunders decided against pressing charges against Lord Janner .

"Those who wore it risked being called a 'mushroom head' by the less fashion forward at school but that hasn't prevented the bowl cut from making an unlikely comeback. The statement Nineties chop, made famous by Jim Carrey’s Lloyd Christmas in Dumb And Dumber, has graced the heads of celebrities far and wide in recent years - from Rihanna and Robert Pattinson to Lena Dunham and Miley Cyrus - and is spreading like wildfire among hipsters. One chain of British barber shops has reported a whopping 200 per cent surge in requests for the almost universally unflattering cut, with men queuing around the corner for their turn to get the snip. The statement 90s chop, made famous by by Jim Carrey’s Lloyd Christmas in Dumb and Dumber (right), has graced the heads of celebrities far and wide in recent years, including Robert Pattinson (left) 'We have been really surprised by the popularity of the bowl cut,' admits Headcase director Martin Nobbs. 'We’ve even had women coming into the barbers asking for the traditionally male style. It’s fast becoming the 2015 hipster trend.' The craze may have been fuelled in part by the release of Dumb And Dumber To, the recent sequel to the 1994 cult hit, in which Jim Carrey hung on to his character's trademark chop. Indeed, Twilight heartthrob Rob Pattinson surprised everyone last November when he adopted the bowl cut, the same month the film came out. Members of the public take the plunge and opt for a bowl haircut . Headcase Barbers (pictured) has tipped the style as a must-have look for summer 2015 . Girls star Lena Dunham drew a similar gasp from commentators last year when she unveiled her own platinum blonde version on Instagram, stating: 'Change is good.' Miley Cyrus has also enjoyed a brief flirtation with the bowl cut, hers being eerily similar in nature to the one sported by Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter back in the Nineties, when Miley was just a child. And who could forget Justin Bieber, who burst onto the scene in 2007 with a sweepy bowl cut so beloved by his fans that he broke hearts around the world when he later chopped it off. Other brave stars to have tried the style on for size over the years include Rihanna, Kelis, Jessie J, Agnes Deyn and Kelly Osbourne. What's more, says Mr Nobbs, another Nineties style is also becoming increasingly popular, although 'the classic curtains style' still has some way to go before it hits the heights of the bowl cut. 'We've seen a bit of a resurgence from that Nineties style as well,' he explains. 'The classic curtains have been spotted recently on the likes of Liam Hemsworth, Zayn Malik and Johnny Depp as well.' Lena Dunham surprised her fans last year when she unveiled her own platinum blonde version on Instagram, stating, 'Change is good' Agyness Deyn was famed for her raven version  in 2010 . Rihanna added a dash of dark to her blonde bowl cut in 2010 . Jessie J went for a very blunt version in early 2014 and American Boy singer Estelle added a red tint to hers . Miley Cyrus is never one to shy away from a bold new look, pictured in August 2014 . Kelis glammed up her bowl cut with gold accessories in 2008 . Nick Carter had one of the original 90s bowl cuts in 1997 . Style icon Kelly Osbourne wore a bowl cut for years, including here in 2005 .

"An Uber customer was hit with a huge $16,000 bill for her 7-mile nightmare journey across New York. Jaime Hessel said her driver had been on his phone, cut across lanes, and even driven down a bus lane during the 35 minute 'trip from hell' from her East Williamsburg apartment to Midtown East. So she was stunned to receive a message from the cab-hailing app telling her she owed them thousands of dollars for the trip across boroughs, reported the Gothamist. The infuriating story was first posted on Reddit. Scroll down for video . Horrified: Jaimie Hessel says Uber billed her $16,000 for a 35-minute 'car ride from hell' - and says she's never going to trust the cab-hailing service again . The journey began on March 28 when Ms Hessel decided to call an UberX car to get to a fundraising pub crawl for cancer due to start at 1pm. But alarms bells were triggered as soon as she got in the car to find the driver appeared distracted. After sitting in the vehicle for around five minutes before setting off, he soon began to ignore the GPS, taking a longer and more complicated route, according to Ms Hessel. To the passenger's terror, instead of paying his full attention to the road, the driver was also taking phone calls and checking his voicemail during the trip. Ms Hessel claims that the car dangerously cut across lanes of traffic on several occasions and was even driven down a bus lane until she demanded to be let out early. 'I had him drop me off a block away from the bar because I didn't want to be in the car anymore. I felt very unsafe,' she told the Gothamist. Shock: Ms Hessel was horrified when Uber billed her for $16,000 - with a $4,000 refund. Her total statement was $12,251.49 . Uber says the eye-popping figure was a clerical error and that the customer was never actually charged the outrageous sum . But the nightmare trip was far from over. After receiving her initial bill of $56.40, the passenger immediate e-mailed Uber Support to complain she had been overcharged and that the driver had unnecessarily extended the ride. Within a few days, the Uber resp had written back to inform Ms Hessel the company agreed the journey was 'inefficient' and she would get a refund of $15. But the following morning, she received a bizarre email which stated she owed Uber more than $16,000 - with a refund of $4,000. Her total, in the end, came to $12,251.49. 'It freaked me out,' she told DNA Info. 'I have bad eye sight and I thought maybe I wasn't reading it correctly.' The panicked Ms Hessel quickly got in touch with the company again to inform them of their error and said she felt lucky that her credit card had expired between the journey and the bill so the transport app would have been unable to charge her. Uber has since wiped the bill and offered to pay her the original $15 refund but Ms Hessel said she now feels she can't trust them with her new card details. They say it was a clerical error and that she was never actually charged the $16,000. She added it was unlikely she would ever use the app again. 'I don't know if I'll use it again,' she told DNAInfo. 'Maybe I'll do it if it'll be somebody else's credit card.' The company has since pledged to refund the entire cost of her ride. A spokesman said: 'We apologize to this rider for any inconvenience and we have provided them with a full refund.'","Jaime Hessel claimed her driver cut across lanes and drove in a bus lane .

Opposites: While Gigi is known for her bright blonde hair, younger Hadid sister Bella favors a much darker look, which she showcases in her Elle shoot .

Bella, meanwhile, walked alongside her sister in the Tom Ford fall/winter 2015 show, and was recently named as the face of Botkier's spring campaign.

The 18-year-old daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin, who is close friend with Kendall Jenner, let slip very discreetly  that she often spent nights with ‘one of her friends’ – meaning Kendall – in their ‘sister’s apartment’ – meaning Kim’s multi-million-dollar residence, while she was traveling to castings in New York at the start of her career. 'I would basically pack a suitcase from home and just come live with her for a week,' she said. But since the days of crashing at Kim’s sprawling home, Hailey has quickly gone on to become a star in her own right. She currently boasts more than 1.3 million Instagram followers, has walked in numerous Fashion Week shows all over the globe, and was recently named as the new face of Topshop Denim. Fancy friends: Model Hailey Baldwin also appears in the publication, revealing that she used to sleep over at Kim Kardashian's house when she was working in New York . 'She’s got that twinkle in her eye,' Topshop creative director Kate Phelan told Elle, while comparing Hailey to supermodel Cara Delevingne. Kate also recalls how, the first time she met Hailey, she was struck by the star's social media influence; when Kate went home to tell her teenage daughter about the meeting, she said she already knew - because Hailey had posted about it online. Indeed, as the magazine points out, it is not just Hailey’s beautiful physical features that have helped to catapult her to the top of the fashion industry ladder, but also her impressively formidable social media presence, which makes her an appealing asset to fashion brands eager to capitalize on her popularity.","Bella, 18, is the younger sister of Guess campaign star Gigi Hadid, 19 .

"A grieving widow said she was frightened for the lives of herself and her family thanks to a 'nasty' neighbour who terrorised them for seven years. During the course of her harassment, Pauline Bruce's neighbour Yvonne Ireland Evans plagued her with silent calls, taunted her dying husband and attacked her son with secateurs. It's not the quiet and peaceful life pensioners Pauline and her late husband Tony expected when they moved to a static home on a community park for over-50s in Ludlow, Shropshire, following Tony's retirement in 2002. Scroll down for video . Pauline and her son John were terrorised by their next door neighbour for seven years . Next-door-neighbour Yvonne went from being a friend, to a nuisance, and then a threat to their safety. She didn't even show any compassion when Tony was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2011 and continued to torment Pauline and her son from a previous marriage, John, when they were grieving his death a year later. Pauline reveals on Channel 5's The Nightmare Neighbour Next Door how Yvonne turned on her after finding out she had struck up a friendship with another woman on the community park. Pauline explains: 'Our relationship started off very well, she was a very nice person, if she could help you in any way she would. She used to come in and have a cup of tea, we became friends.' But it all changed when Pauline started spending more time with another neighbour as they were working on a gardening project together. Yvonne started ignoring her and when Pauline asked why, she was told: 'because I had a new best friend, she didn't want to know us any more.' John holds up some secateurs like the one Yvonne Evans had her her hand when she attacked him . Pauline admits: 'I thought that was a bit petty, I didn't know you were restricted to one friend in life.' But then Yvonne's behaviour took a more sinister turn. She began making silent phone calls to the couple day and night. Pauline said: 'It unnerved us very much, you don't know why people are making silent calls or who they are.' They discovered Yvonne was the culprit after the police traced the calls. She was given a fixed penalty notice and fine. But Pauline said it only led to her harassment becoming worse. 'She'd walk past the house and stick her fingers up at us. She started shouting abuse through the windows calling us peeping Toms and perverts - it went on like this for four years,' Pauline recalled. 'It got to the stage where I'd wake up and think ""I hope nothing happens today"", I'd always have a sick feeling in my stomach.' Then in March 2011 Tony was diagnosed with terminal cancer and told he didn't have long to live. When Yvonne heard the news, instead of expressing sympathy, she mocked Tony telling him: 'You've got cancer, you are going to die.' She also started making her crank phone calls again. Pauline said: 'Tony was terminally ill so we had precious time left and to have that spoiled by someone making unnecessary phone calls made things worse. Why do it when you know he's dying? Why cause us this much hassle?' The couple again got the police involved and Yvonne pleaded guilty to harassment in court and was fined £100. She signed a community resolution saying she would stay away from the family but she didn't stick to it. Yvonne, pictured in footage taken by John, would taunt the family about Tony's cancer . When John was visiting one day, he said she threatened him with a four-foot long branch. John said: 'I was pottering around in the garden and she was on the other side of the fence. She started spurting her mouth off about Tony having cancer saying ""oh dear, guess who's got cancer, and guess who's got terminal cancer"". 'I stepped closer and saw she had a weapon - a branch in her hand.' John then filmed Yvonne with his mobile phone appearing to hit him with the branch over the fence. Following Tony's death, John moved in with his mother to support her and he continued to be abused by Yvonne. 'As soon as I walked in the back gate she would be waiting for me,' he said. Tony died in 2012 with no sympathy from Yvonne who instead harassed the family with crank calls . Despite being heterosexual, John said Yvonne would make homophobic jibes towards him as well as calling him a 'w*****' and a 'mummy's boy'. Then one day the abuse became physical after Yvonne's dog attacked John's, Scrappy, after leaping into their garden. John said: 'I heard a crash bang from the garden and Scrappy was in the jaws of a pretty big dog.' John rescued Scrappy and kept Yvonne's dog in the house, causing Yvonne to then climb over the fence, holding secateurs, demanding her pet back. 'She started hitting me screaming ""give me my dog back"",' John said. 'The secateurs missed my throat by an inch.' Pauline witnessed the encounter and tried to intervene to stop Yvonne attacking her son. 'I was frightened for our lives. We told her to get back into her own garden and then we'd give her her dog,' she said. 'We called the police, I dread to think what she could have done.' Yvonne told the police she had been acting in self defence so Pauline and John decided not to press charges. Instead, they collected all the evidence they had of Yvonne's abusive behaviour and submitted it to the owner of the community park. This led to Yvonne being served an eviction notice and she was told to leave within eight weeks. Pauline said Yvonne continued to be 'nasty' in this time and once again John said she hit him when he caught her prowling around his mother's house at night. The mother and son were delighted and relieved when Yvonne was finally evicted. 'I'm not sorry she's gone I have a much more peaceful life now and can grieve for Tony,' Pauline said. 'I'm so sorry he wasn't here to see the day she went. 'Soon I will get some new neighbours and I pray to God they will be nice and not neighbours from hell.'

"A young man was banned from every branch of Sainsbury's after he was wrongly accused of shoplifting a pair of speakers. Aden Gould, 21, was also told to pay a £150 'security fee' after he was seen testing speakers on sale in a branch of the supermarket - even though he put the equipment back where he found it. The giant firm sent him an aggressive letter warning that staff would call the police if they ever catch him trying to enter Sainsbury's. Banned: Aden Gould, 21, was told he could not return to Sainsbury's after he opened some speakers there . Mr Gould, who has learning difficulties and is unemployed, went into the Sainsbury's branch in Stoke-on-Trent and opened two boxes containing £25 speakers. He then tested the gadgets to see if they worked with his mobile phone, and put them back on display - but was immediately apprehended by security. Staff took him into the manager's office and forced him to empty his bag, but he was cleared of shoplifting. Mr Gould later received a pair of letters saying that he was banned from all 1,200 Sainsbury's stores across the country, and had to pay £150 in compensation. However, the company has now backed down and agreed to revoke the ban, as well as waiving the £150 fine. He said: 'The first set of speakers didn't work and the second weren't very good so I put everything back in the boxes. 'I was walking out of the shop when the security guard grabbed me and took me into the manager's office. I was confused about what I'd done and I thought I was in trouble. 'I wanted to call my mum but they told me to put my phone away. I was scared and frustrated. I felt like I was having a heart attack. 'When I got outside I was really panicking. I was shaking all over. I then received a second letter saying I owed £150 in security fees but I had no idea what it was for.' Reversal: Sainsbury's has now revoked the ban which was imposed at its Stoke-on-Trent store, pictured . His mother Petra added: 'Aden was shaking uncontrollably when he got home and when he got the letter saying he was banned I went straight down there. 'An assistant told me he had committed criminal damage because he opened the boxes and said I was lucky the police weren't being called. 'I think staff initially thought he was a shoplifter but after he proved he had nothing in his bag they should have just let him go. He is being treated like some kind of criminal. 'If it is such a crime to open the little boxes, there should be a sign saying it is a criminal offence.' In its letter to Aden, Sainsbury's stated: 'The invitation to enter and shop at all Sainsbury's stores is permanently withdrawn due to the incident on April 15. 'Should you enter any of our premises you will be treated as a trespasser and the police will be called as necessary.' But after Mrs Gould complained, the company agreed to revoke the ban and told Aden that he was welcome to return. A spokesman said that the £150 fee, which has now been waived, was a standard charge to make up for the fact that the speakers which Mr Gould opened can no longer be sold. She added that the ban and fine had been imposed 'in error', saying: 'We have already been in touch with Aden to invite him back into store and look forward to seeing him soon.'","Aden Gould, who has learning difficulties, opened boxes of speakers and tried out the gadgets .

"Two sons of an ailing bestselling true crime writer are accused of defrauding and bullying her into giving them more than $125,000 - despite the pair already receiving a monthly allowance of $25,000 combined with their two sisters through their mother's corporation. Ann Rule's son, 54-year-old Andrew Rule, is accused of bullying her into giving him $23,327, according to court documents, and admitted to authorities that he blew the money given to him on gambling and strip clubs. Michael Rule, 51, who receives approximately $9,000 a month between salaries paid to him and his wife by Rule Enterprises, LLC, is accused of forging his mother's signature on her checks from March 2014 to February 2015 amounting to $103,628. Prosecutors have filed a restraining order against both men to stay away from Ann Rule, and the two sons accused of wrongdoing are set to appear in court on April 30. Famous true crime writer Ann Rule (above), 84, had more than $100,000 allegedly stolen and defrauded from her by her two sons . Ann Rule, 84, is known for many of her crime books, notably the 1980 bestseller The Stranger Beside Me based on serial killer Ted Bundy. She has published 33 books and eight of those have been turned into movies including Ann Rule Presents: The Stranger Beside Me and Small Sacrifices. The Washington-based author has been in declining health since 2013 after she broke her hip, she also suffers from periods of extreme confusion and is vulnerable to undue influence, according to the Huffington Post. Court documents also said she is 'largely confined to a wheelchair', is unable to 'perform many activities of daily living without assistance' and 'she is on oxygen at all times'. Her son-in-law, Glen Scorr, alerted authorities in March after he became suspicious that she was being 'financially exploited' by her two sons. An investigation revealed that Michael and Andrew Rule along with their two siblings, Leslie and Laura, receive an estimated $25,000 monthly salary combined through their mother's corporation Rule Enterprises LLC for work they perform on her behalf, according to court documents. The four children also have their health and dental insurance covered through the corporation. Andrew Rule, who also has his rent and car insurance covered by his mother, would allegedly bully her until she would give in and write him a check, according to court documents. 'Andy would pester and bully Ann relentlessly for money, sometimes threatening suicide, sometimes trying to make her feel guilty, sometimes screaming obscenities at her, until she would finally give in and write him a check,' the documents stated. Authorities said he would have an excuse for needing money which included when he got injured and needed money for medical expenses, repairing his car, groceries, buying a racehorse and needing clothes after getting a new job. Andrew Rule (pictured above), the son of  author Ann Rule, has been charged with theft by deception in a case of alleged financial exploitation of his mother's money. His brother, Michael Rule, has been charged with theft and forgery . A protection order was granted against Andrew Rule on February 3 prohibiting him from having any contact with Ann Rule except for under limited circumstances, according to court documents. However, authorities said he violated it and was arrested on March 27. While in custody, he told officers he battled with gambling and drug addictions for years, and that he used the money given to him by his mother on gambling and strip clubs. He also told officers he pressured his mother for money never intending to use it for the stated purposes, according to court documents. 'I have never in my life, as God as my witness, stolen anything whatsoever from my mom,' Andrew Rule told KIRO-TV. 'Basically I used to have a gambling problem but I don't anymore and I have absolutely no idea why I was pulled in at the same time my brother was,' he continued. He has been charged with first-degree theft. Michael Rule, who reportedly receives a higher salary than his siblings because he is more involved in his mother's day-to-day care, is accused of forging her signature on her checks, according to court documents. Prosecutors have filed a restraining order against both men to stay away from Ann Rule, and the two sons accused of wrongdoing are set to appear in court on April 30. Ann Rule is known for many of her crime books including The Stranger Beside Me based on serial killer Ted Bundy . Ann Rule told authorities that she did not give him permission to write himself or his wife checks for funds exceeding their salary without her permission. She also confirmed the checks written with her signature was not hers and that it appears to be the signature of Michael Rule, according to documents. Authorities said that once the protection order was filed against Andrew Rule, Michael Rule 'began engaging in similar tactics of intimidation and coercion to pressure his mother to provide him funds above his monthly salary'. 'He became increasingly insistent he needed the money to pay his mortgage and other expenses. He would yell at his mother demanding money as she cowered in her wheelchair,' the documents stated. Ann Rule told authorities in an interview that Michael Rule would fly into rages throwing things across the room and sweeping a counter clean with his arm. A family friend, John Patrick Kelly, who was hired as a handyman by Ann Rule stated he had previously been physically assaulted by Michael Rule, according to court documents. Michael Rule has been charged with first-degree theft and forgery, and both men are out of jail on personal recognizance, according to KIRO-TV. Authorities said the fraud loss amount is expected to rise as more documents are received and reviewed, and the investigation is ongoing.","Sons of New York Times bestselling author, Ann Rule, have been charged with theft and forgery in alleged financial exploitation case .

"A mother has revealed the agony she felt when her two-year-old son toppled out of a window to his death, in a bid to make other families aware of the dangers in the home. Michelle Newman said all she heard was a 'pop' and looked up to see her son James' heels as he fell from the second floor of their condo in Las Vegas. The child had fallen out of the window, which had been propped open to let in the breeze, and died from his injuries. James Krainch was almost two-years-old when he toppled out of a second floor condo window and died . Michelle Newman visits James' grave with her other children Kierah (centre) and Spencer (right) and said they play games at his grave, flying kites and laughing, so they can remember their brother in a positive way . 'When I got to his side, he gave me one last smile and then went unconscious,' Mrs Newman told the Deseret News. On the ninth anniversary of his death Ms Newman visited her son's grave with her two other children Spencer and Kierah Krainich to celebrate the life of their brother. 'A lot of times we'll fly kites and we'll play games,' she said. 'We'll do things I think James would have liked doing with us.' James was 22 months and tumbled from the window because a screen was not strong enough to hold him . Ms Newman said James, who was 22 months old when he died, had fallen from the window as he was sat on the sofa, while she fed his younger brother who was then around six months old. The screen was not strong enough to prevent him from tumbling to the ground. Michelle Newman said she hopes by sharing her story other parents will safety proof their homes . She added: 'I just heard a pop and I looked over my shoulder and I just saw his heels as he toppled out the window,' After he hit the ground James lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital. Doctors worked for hours to save his life, but he died on April 20. The family eventually moved to Utah and Ms Newman split up with her husband and father to her children, Joe Krainch. She recently visited James' grave at Larkin Sunset Gardens Cemetery in Sandy with his brother and sister to mark the ninth anniversary of his death. Ms Newman said she hopes her story will make people think twice about how they can make their homes safer for their children by not putting furniture close to windows. To try and cope with the agony of losing her son Ms Newman started a blog about him and her experience four years after his death. She previously told hold she still included James in the Christmas draw of names, with whoever received his name buying gifts he would have liked at that age and giving them to a child who needs them.","James Krainich was almost two when he toppled from second floor window .

"A former defence minister has accused world leaders of concealing the presence of aliens. Paul Hellyer, who was a Canadian minister from 1963 to 1967, is now urging world powers to release what he believes to be hidden data on UFOs. 'Much of the media won't touch [the documents]', he said during a keynote speech at the Disclosure Canada Tour at the University of Calgary. Scroll down for video . A former defence minister has accused world leaders of concealing aliens. Paul Hellyer, who was a Canadian minister from 1963 to 1967, is urging world powers to release what he believes to be hidden data on UFOs . 'You just have to keep working away and hope that someday you get a critical mass,' he said, according to a report by CTV. '[The public] will say, in one way or another, ""Mr President or Mr Prime Minister we want the truth and we want it now because it affects our lives.""' Hellyer, 91, first went public with his belief in aliens on Earth in 2005, becoming the first high ranking politician to do so. He claims that the aliens have 'been visiting our planet for thousands of years' and are unimpressed with how we live. 'We spend too much time fighting each other, we spend too much money on military expenditures and not enough on feeding the poor and looking after the homeless and sick,' he said. In this image, secretary of defense at the time, Robert McNamara (right) talks at the pentagon, in Washington with his Canadian counterpart, Paul Hellyer (left), in 1963. Hellyer is the first high ranking politician to publicly state that aliens are real . Watch the full interview here . Last year, the former Canadian defence minister declared on Russian TV that aliens are walking among us. But he said they are refusing to share their advanced technologies until we change our polluting and warring ways. He told Russia Today's program SophieCo there are 80 different species of extra-terrestrials some of whom 'look just like us and they could walk down the street and you wouldn't know if you walked past one.' In the bizarre interview, Hellyer made a series of pronouncements about aliens which grew increasingly outlandish and sounded closer to the plot of Star Trek. 'We have a long history of UFOs and of course there has been a lot more activity in the last few decades since we invented the atomic bomb,' he said. 'They are very concerned about that and that we might use it again, because the whole cosmos as a unity, and it affects not just us but other people in the cosmos. 'They are very much afraid that we might be stupid enough to start using atomic weapons again.' However Hellyer told SophieCo that most of the aliens want to help rather than destroy us. 'I would say that nearly all are benign and benevolent and they do want to help us, there may be one or two species which do not,' he said. Hellyer believes aliens are responsible for some of our modern technology including the microchip, LED light and Kevlar vest, he said. He says he has never met an alien, but has seen a UFO near his cabin on Ontario's Lake Muskoka. Hellyer described several types of aliens including 'Tall Whites' who are working with the U.S. air force in Nevada. 'They're able to get away with that; they had a couple of their ladies dressed as nuns go into Las Vegas to shop and they weren't detected,' he claimed. Another group of aliens are called 'Short Greys' who have very slim arms and legs and are about five feet high with large heads. A third group are called 'Nordic Blondes' and Hellyer said that if you meet one you'd probably say, 'I wonder if she's from Denmark or somewhere.' Hellyer's claims are likely to fuel conspiracy theorists who often look at Nasa images for evidence of aliens. This image was taken by Mercury-Redstone 1A on December 19, 1960. 'It's actually the Earth in the background and the UFO is in space observing the Mercury capsule,' Scott Waring recently claimed .","Paul Hellyer served as Canada's defence minister from 1963 to 1967 .

"These incredible photographs  appear to capture a fire-breathing dragon in the sky - just in time for St George's Day. With its large snout and blackened eyes, the furious-looking beast appeared to breath fire as it stared down from the sky in the bizarre cloud formation. Captured at dusk the red sky adds a fiery hue behind the clouded creature giving it an uncanny likeness to the legend of the fire breathing dragon slain by St George - ahead of the patron Saint of England's day tomorrow. The cloud dragon appears to breathe fire in these incredible images captured by amateur photographer Nicolas Locatelli . Amateur photographer Nicolas Locatelli, 20, snapped the unusual cloud in the sky above Briones Regional Park, in California on a Nikon D7100. The student, from San Francisco said he didn't even notice the striking formation until he checked his camera when he got home. The image went viral on Reddit after his friends suggested he upload it to the social network. He only noticed that the red sky at dawn appeared to give a fiery hue behind the cloud formation after he got home and checked the pictures . The pictures, which create an uncanny likeness to the fire breathing dragon slain by St George, the patron Saint of England, were captured at dusk above Briones Regional Park, in California . Nicolas said: 'When I saw the image I was pretty intrigued. 'The way the sunset lit up the cloud at the mouth of the dragon made it look like flames were coming out of its mouth. 'The image was timed perfectly too. The image was taken with a zoom lens on a stormy day so the clouds were in the distance and moving quickly so I got really lucky taking this picture. 'The image was received very positively on Reddit. 'When my friends saw the image, I asked, 'what do you see in this picture?' and they said 'definitely a dragon breathing fire' and 'it's the dragon slain by St George.' 'I got a lot of positive and jovial feedback on the image.' A picture of the legend of St George and the Dragon . The medieval legend of St George and the dragon is over a thousand years old. St George travelled to Libya, where he met an old hermit who told him a dragon had long ravaged the country, demanding the sacrifice of a beautiful maiden every day. With the population of young girls decimated, the king's daughter alone remained to be sacrificed, unless a knight could slay the dragon. Determined to save the princess, he set out to slay the dragon, luring it from its cave upon his arrival. But after falling from his horse, St George evaded the dragon's attack by hiding under an enchanted orange tree before recovering his strength and killing the beast with his sword. The slaying of the dragon by St George, a brave Roman soldier who protested against the Romans' torture of Christians, was first credited to him in the twelfth century, long after his death. The real St George was thought to be a Roman soldier, born to Christian parents in A.D. 270 in what is now Eastern Turkey. Adomnán, the Abbot of Iona in Scotland, provides Britain’s earliest recorded reference to Saint George in the 7th Century. He details the story of the Saint’s exploits, which had been told to him by a French bishop named Arcuif who had travelled to Jerusalem with the crusaders . As the Crusaders returned to England from foreign shores, they brought with them tales of St George, and his reputation grew . A church in Fordington, Dorset, still records St George leading the Crusaders into battle. St George later resigned his military post and protested against Emperor Diocletian against his persecution of Christians . He was dragged through the streets and executed on April 23, 303 AD. Almost a millenia later in 1222 the Council of Oxford declared April 23rd to be St George’s Day . It was not until 1348 that St George became the Patron Saint of England. Today April 23 is celebrated as a day of patriotism for England.","Cloud formation before the red dusk sky resembles a fire breathing dragon .

"A woman has been jailed for using her stiletto heel to inflict permanent injuries on a stranger during an unprovoked attack in a nightclub toilet. Shannon Carter, 21, repeatedly struck 20-year-old Amelia Gledhill with the shoe after a row broke out between their friends on a night out in Bradford. Ms Gledhill is said to have been left traumatised by the incident and is still having problems with her eyesight. Shannon Carter, 21 (pictured) has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for attacking Amelia Gledhill, 20, (pictured right) with a stiletto during a night out. Ms Gledhill still has a scar above her right eye . She has also been left with permanent scarring and is afraid to leave the house alone. During the case at Bradford Crown Court, the court was told how there had been a confrontation between one of Carter's friends and a friend of victim in a bar in Bradford city centre earlier in the evening. The court heard how Miss Gledhill and her friend then saw Carter in  NV night club. Despite Miss Gledhill having nothing to do with the argument, Carter then followed the victim into the toilets, where she carried out the 'unprovoked' attack. As well as sustaining an injury just above her right eye, Ms Gledhill also suffered a deep wound to her arm, the court heard. The victim was given stitches at Bradford Royal infirmary. She also had to return to the hospital on a number of occasions for further treatment, the court heard. She was also left with bruises, a permanent scar and with blurred vision in her right eye. The attack took place in NV nightclub (pictured) during a night out in Bradford City Centre. There had been an earlier confrontation between one of Carter's friends and a friend of the victim . The court heard she also had to take time off work and became too afraid to go out, without being accompanied by her boyfriend. Carter, from East Bowling, Bradford, pleaded guilty to wounding with intent. For the defence, Simon Hustler said Carter had nursed her grandmother, looked after her grandfather and was also a carer for her mother. He added that the attack was an isolated incident and that she had committed no further offences. He also told the court that there was evidence of a mental disorder. Sentencing her to three-and-a-half years in jail, Judge David Hatton QC said Carter had caused the victim permanent scarring and other psychological consequences. The judge said: 'This is a tragic case, revealing the frequent danger and consequence of excessive drinking; tragic, not least because I am satisfied that it was out of character.' But he added that it was a serious offence which could only be dealt with by an immediate custodial sentence. Judge Hatton said: 'I judge your risk of reoffending not to be high. I take account of the fact that any sentence of imprisonment will be in itself a considerable punishment.' He added: 'I derive no pleasure whatever from imposing a sentence of imprisonment on a young woman in your position but I would be failing in my public duty if I did not do so.' After the case, Detective Constable Glen Doran, of Bradford District CID, said: 'This was a particularly nasty and unprovoked assault which left the victim with permanent injuries. 'Such incidents will not be tolerated in Bradford District, and I hope the sentence handed down today will serve as a warning to others.'","Shannon Carter, 21, repeatedly hit Amelia Gledhill, 20, in a Bradford club .

"War veteran: Arthur Townsend, 92, supported himself with his Zimmer frame at Basildon Magistrates’ Court as he admitted criminal damage . A 92-year-old Second World War veteran has avoided jail despite pouring paint stripper over a van owned by a female friend's son because of the way he treated her. Arthur Townsend, who lives in a care home in Epping, Essex, poured the product over a Mercedes Sprinter belonging to Martin Carter - the son of his friend Olive Carter, 96. Townsend carried out the attack after becoming angry with Mr Carter, who he believed was making his mother stay at home to sign for packages relating to his online business. The retired antiques restorer was given a lift in a car to Mr Carter’s address where he dumped the brown-coloured paint stripper on the van, causing more than £2,000 of damage. Townsend - of previous good character - was arrested and charged with criminal damage. He supported himself with his Zimmer frame as he admitted the single charge at Basildon Magistrates’ Court last Friday. Remi Alabi, prosecuting, said: ‘On December 18 last year, Townsend asked a friend if she could drive him to a local address. 'When Mr Townsend got into the car the friend saw a jar containing a brown liquid. ‘When she parked 40 yards away, she saw Mr Townsend in her rear-view mirror and he was emptying a jar of brown liquid onto the front of the van.’ The court heard the damage to the Mercedes van totalled £2,190. Stephen Sparkes, defending, said the veteran made a full admission during a police interview. He said: ‘One of the key issues is the complainant runs a company and his 96-year-old mother, Olive, was made to stay at the address to receive packages. Residence: Retired antiques restorer Townsend lives in this care home (above) in Epping, Essex. He carried out the attack after becoming angry with Martin Carter - the son of his friend Olive Carter, 96 . Vehicle: A file picture of a Mercedes Sprinter van - the model of vehicle that was damaged by Townsend . ‘Mr Townsend was not happy with the way her son was treating him and her. On one occasion Martin Carter swore at Mr Townsend. He resides in a care home and is of previous good character. 'He worked as an antiques restorer and he has known the claimant for 45 years.’ Mr Sparkes said that after Townsend’s wife died in 1995 he became good friends with Mrs Carter. He added: ‘Mr Townsend has done a lot for the family over the years.

"She spent last weekend hobnobbing with Middle Eastern royals in Bahrain, but that clearly isn't enough for jetsetting Princess Beatrice. The royal arrived in Florence yesterday for a fashion conference and has spent much of the past 24 hours partying with fashion's biggest names. Today, a  businesslike Beatrice was all ears as she listened to the speakers at the Condé Nast International Luxury Conference. Scroll down for video . Fashionable friends: Princess Beatrice (centre) poses alongside Tory Burch in Florence this morning . Lost in thought: The Princess looked serious as she listened to the presentations being made on stage . Afterwards, she stopped to pose with US designer Tory Burch - the latest in a string of big name designers to strike a pose with the Princess in the last 24 hours. Last night, she was photographed enjoying a chat with Ralph Lauren's middle son David during a lavish party at the sprawling Palazzo Corsini. She also met International Vogue Editor Suzy Menkes and Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld during the first day of the conference, which is being held at the 700-year-old Palazzo Vecchio. The glamorous gathering in Florence is just the latest in a series of glitzy jaunts for the jet-setting royal, who has faced criticism in recent weeks over the amount of time she spends abroad. In the last two months alone, she has enjoyed skil holidays in Verbier, where her parents own a luxury chalet, and Colorado, and travelled to Greece, New York and, most recently, Bahrain. There, she was joined by boyfriend Dave Clark and viewed the action from a private box beside the country's Crown Prince, Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.

Unfortunately for Beatrice, her travelling days could be numbered with the Princess on the verge of relocating to the New York to take up a new job. The job, which is thought to be in finance, will be her first since leaving her internship at Sony following last November's cyber attacks. Since then, her life has been a round of parties and beaches, beginning with a trip to the Middle East to see the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix the same month. Days later Beatrice and  Mr Clark, a Virgin Galactic executive, flew to Beijing, where they joined her mother Sarah Ferguson and sister Eugenie for the wedding of photographer and graphic designer Victoria Tang to Hong Kong lawyer Christopher Owen.

Chilling in the Caribbean: Beatrice during her trip to St. Barts in January . Next, Beatrice soaked up the sun with Mr Clark on two trips to Caribbean island St Barts, at one point staying on tycoon Lakshmi Mittal’s yacht. She also squeezed in three trips to her parents’ £13million chalet in Verbier, Switzerland.

"A 1,200lb-man forced to move from his financially-troubled nursing home was hoisted from the building by a crane and driven to his new residence on a flatbed truck. Robert Butler, 43, was transported inside a shipping container from Bannister House in Providence, Rhode Island to the Eleanor Slater Hospital in Cranston. He was accompanied by his medical team.

Mr Butler was moved to his new hospital resident in a shipping container alongside his medical team to monitor his health . According to Target 12, the complex operation began with firefighters widening the door of Butler's room, then building a special ramp to move Mr Butler on to a deck. He was then shifted into the shipping container, complete with medical equipment, and lifted with a crane down on to a flatbed truck. Michael Raia of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health & Human Services said planning for the move began weeks ago. Mr Raia said the new facility is better equipped to help Butler. In 2006, Mr Butler, who is on permanent disability, told local news channels that his bed was broken  at the nursing home and he was not receiving proper care.

"A Japanese woman got sweet revenge on her cheating boyfriend by giving his Apple collection a good wash. The unnamed heartbroken girlfriend clearly knew how to hit her lying lover where it hurts, and dumped his iMac, iPhone, iPad and accessories in the bath tub. She then took photos of the gadget Jacuzzi, and sent them to him. Presumably on the one item of technology that wasn't currently taking a long soak. A Japanese woman got sweet revenge on her cheating boyfriend by giving his Apple collection a good wash . The woman scorned took the trouble to give his iMac - which start at £899 - a single soaking . As most of us know, a substantial splash is enough to send your gadget to glitch town, and so the dip this man's prized collection took is sure to prove irreversible damage. Particularly as the woman scorned took the trouble to give his iMac - which start at £899 - a single soaking. Just to make doubly sure the water damage was total. Even if he tries the recommended trick of leaving his gadgets in uncooked rice for 48 hours, we think all the rice in Japan couldn't dry this lot out. Clearly feeling little remorse for his sins and perhaps looking for sympathy, the unnamed man, also from Japan, Tweeted the pics to his account @foolishnessfly2. Retweeted more than 15,400 times, the response has been mixed. The hearts of Apple fans are mainly with the man, with the general consensus being that destroying a fellow's prized Apple collection is a bit harsh, even if he did cheat.

"A white German Shepard puppy named Lt.Dan from South Carolina born without his paw now has a new friend who understands his unique struggle. On Monday the nine-week-old puppy was given to three-year-old Sapphyre Johnson who is missing both of her feet. 'He's just like me!,' the toddler exclaimed with joy the first time she ever saw a photo of Lt. Dan. The dog's original owner Karen Riddle said that Lt. Dan, who was born with eight other puppies in a litter - and could have been euthanized. Missing their feet: Of the nine pups in the litter, Lt. Dan, named for the character in Forest Gump who lost his legs, was the only one missing a paw and Sapphyre Johnson had to have her feet amputated . On Monday, the nine-week-old puppy Lt. Dan without a paw found a new home with Sapphyre Johnson, a toddler who lost both of her feet . Just like me!: Sapphyre and Lt. Dan made fast friends on Monday and the two will grow up together at Sapphyre's family's home in Tennesee . Greenville Online reports that the puppy was named after a character in the film Forest Gump who lost both of his legs. Fellow breeders suggested to Riddle when Lt. Dan was born that he should be put down because he might be too sick to live. But Riddle didn't buy it. When the hound grew a little, Riddle was determined to find a home for him with someone with special needs. Because her father was a Shriner she called Shriners Hospital to see if there was a special needs child or wounded veteran who might want a pet in their home. Sapphyre, who is from Tennessee, has been in the hospital ever since she was just three-months-old. 'When I was seven months pregnant, they did an ultra sound and told us she may be missing some fingers and toes,' said Sapphyre’s mother, Ashley Johnson. 'They don't know what caused it,' she said. Different: Lt.Dan was the only one out of nine puppies who was born without a paw and fellow breeders suggested to his original owner that he be put down . Brilliant Idea: Rather than kill Lt. Dan because he was different, his original owner Karen Riddle suggested that he be placed in a home with a wounded veteran or special needs child . Playing and learning: 'In the future, I could see Sapphyre at her first show-and-tell in school and she could bring in her dog and explain about her dog and herself,' said an employee at Shriners Hospital . Shriners gives prosthetics and orthopedic services to children under 18 no matter what their family's income is. 'She had just two really long toes on each foot. And when she was 1, we had them amputated so she could be fitted for prosthetics,' said Sapphyre's mother. Shriners even suggested prosthetic leg could be made for Lt.Dan when he grows large enough. When Sapphyre saw a picture of her new puppy she knew that she had to have him and she felt an instant connection. 'The first time I showed her a picture of the dog, she looked at it for a moment, and she said, ""That's my puppy. He's just like me,"" ' said Elaine Hardin who works at Shriners. Best friends: Sapphyre and Lt. Dan only just met but from the looks of it they are already best friends . 'He's a special dog and he's going to a special child.' Hardin told Greenville Online that the dog will help Sapphyre make friends and will also help her to explain her disability to other kids. 'In the future, I could see Sapphyre at her first show-and-tell in school and she could bring in her dog and explain about her dog and herself,' Hardin said. 'Everybody loves dogs and they'll want to know about her dog that's special like her.' On Monday Saphyyre was so happy to have her new puppy. 'Lt. Dan, Lt. Dan,' she called out to her new furry friend. The puppy felt so at home with his new owners that it fell asleep in the car as Sapphyre made her way home to Tennessee with her family. Right at home: The puppy felt so at home with his new owners that it fell asleep in the car as Sapphyre made her way home to Tennessee with her family.","On Monday a nine-week-old puppy named Lt.

"This is the horrifying moment a 14-year-old Mexican girl was torn away from her family by federal police and sent to live with a Houston woman who mistakenly thought she was her long-lost daughter. Alondra Luna Nunez can be seen screaming and fighting with every ounce of her energy as she is dragged out of her school in front of her mother in Guanajuato in central Mexico last week. She pleaded with the officers, who were working for Interpol, not to take her from her parents. Alondra is now back with her real family after a DNA test proved that she was not the daughter of Houston resident Dorotea Garcia. 'They stole my daughter,' her real mother, Susana Nunez, raged to Milenio Television on Wednesday. 'I didn't know this woman existed.' Taken: Alondra Luna Nunez's case drew international attention after a video of her being forced into a police vehicle last week appeared online . Alondra used every ounce of her energy to fight Mexican federal police officers, who were working for Interpol on the orders of a Texas judge. Garcia says she found Alondra after she traveled to Mexico in search of her daughter who was illegally taken from Texas by her father in 2007 at age four. Garcia convinced authorities that Alondra was her daughter, despite her family's pleas and the fact that they produced a birth certificate, baptismal documents and family photographs of Alondra as a small child. Alondra was torn away from her parents and little brother by police who were acting on the orders of a judge from Texas. She was taken to the neighboring state of Michoacan for a hearing on April 12. A judge there ignored her family's pleas - and the evidence - that Alondra belonged to them and not Garcia from Texas. In the end, the Mexican judge ruled in Garcia's favor based on a car on the bridge of Alondra's nose. Garcia claimed her daughter had a scar above her eyebrow. Back home: Alondra Luna Nunez smiles at a press conference on Wednesday after she was returned to her parents in Guanajuato, Mexico . Alondra is seen with her father, little brother and mother after she was reunited with her family when a DNA test proved she was not the daughter of the Houston woman who claimed her . Dorotea Garcia (pictured) believed that Alondra Nunez was her long-lost daughter Alondra, who was taken to Mexico by her father in 2007 . The girl and Garcia went by bus to Houston, where Alondra later recorded a video, posted to social media, in which she looked calm and happy and told her parents in Mexico not to worry as they waited for results of a DNA test there. 'I'm fine. I see that the United States is nice,' she said, adding, 'I don't understand anything they're saying, because everything is in English.' On Wednesday, after being returned to her parents, Alondra spoke to reporters in her hometown of Guanajuato and said she was happy to be home. She said the video recorded in Houston was intended to assure her parents she was OK, even though she really wasn't. 'She took me from my parents,' Alondra said. 'I didn't know her or Mr. Reynaldo,' she added, referring to the father of Garcia's missing daughter. The Foreign Ministry said Mexican officials were carrying out a court order to send Alondra to Dorotea Garcia, a Houston woman. Garcia claimed the girl was her daughter who had been illegally taken to Mexico by her father . Similarities? Dorotea never stopped looking for her daughter Alondra Diaz Garcia - seen here before she was taken as (right) in a digitally aged picture . A judge ignored her parents' pleas and put Alondra on a bus to Houston, Texas, with Dorotea Garcia last week . It was unclear how the girl came to be identified as Garcia's daughter. In 2007, the Foreign Ministry received a claim stating that Garcia's then 4-year-old daughter, Alondra Diaz Garcia, had been taken by her father from the U.S. and was believed to be in Michoacan. This year, Garcia went to Mexico and said she had found her daughter in Guanajuato, prompting U.S. authorities to seek the help of Interpol in retrieving her. Meanwhile, Alondra Diaz Garcia remains missing. Reynaldo Diaz is suspected of abducting her from Houston in 2007, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A U.S. felony warrant has been issued for his arrest. Alondra Luna's uncle, Ruben Nunez, said that she returned in good condition and that the family is sure to seek some kind of legal damages. 'In whatever form, they will try to sue whoever is found to be responsible,' Nunez told reporters in the airport in Leon, Mexico, after the girl's arrival. 'It's not right what they did - take the girl just because they could.'","Alondra Luna Nunez's case drew international attention after a video of her being forced into a police vehicle last week appeared online .

"A 30-stone Texan woman has used her eight-foot belly to entice men from around the world, including latest hubby, Lance. Gayla Neufeld, 52, struggled to deal with her family's unusual legacy of piling weight around the midriff for years. But the happy couple, who live in Manitoba, Canada, are now using Gayla's 96-inch asset to launch her new career - as an international webcam model. Scroll down for video . 30 stone Gayla Neufeld met her truck driver husband Lance on a fat-fetish forum . She said: 'Growing up I used to be ashamed of my belly but now I have a great following of men who really like it. 'There have been men from all over the world. I have had doctors, lawyers and even bodybuilders, lots of bodybuilders, approach me, which really amazed me. 'They tell me it's the perfect belly. They say it's not marred or scarred and that they love the shape of it because it is a single belly. Some larger women they have a double-layer or a two-tier belly but mine is a single. That is really attractive to a lot of men.' The 52-year-old says men love her 'perfect belly' and she gets approached by bodybuilders and doctors . Thirty stone Gayla wasn't always so body-confident and for years she struggled to deal with her family's unusual genetic legacy. 'Women in my family have always gained weight around the belly, especially after having children,' said Gayla, whose favourite foods are homemade cookies and ice-cream. 'My mum was fat and my favourite sister was fat, as were my grandparents, my grandmother and my great-grandmother. Gayla inherited her big belly from her family. 'My mum was fat and my favourite sister was fat, as were my grandparents, my grandmother and my great-grandmother,' she said . Aged eight, Gayla already weighted 13 stone. She used to get bullied at school and felt ashamed of her weight . 'Growing up, kids at school would point and laugh at me and say ""boom, boom, boom"" with every step I took. I was really ashamed to be fat.' Aged eight, Gayla already weighed a whopping 13st and continued to pile on even more weight in her teens. One doctor even prescribed her amphetamines to curb her sweet tooth, but it failed and made her even more depressed. Her burgeoning curves made her popular with boys at high school, though, and Gayla had many admirers - but she was too embarrassed at the thought of being naked. Despite her body issues she eventually married at 19 and embarked on a mission to battle the bulge. Gayla's curves attracted boys when she was a teenager, and she married at the age of 19 . However, her husband was embarassed by her size as she continued to pile on the pounds, and they divorced . But instead of maintaining any weight loss, she found herself hovering between 21 and 28 stone. Her wavering confidence was further diminished when her husband said he was embarrassed by her weight and they divorced in 1999. It was at rock-bottom that Gayla discovered an online community of obese women calling themselves SSBBWs - meaning 'super-sized big beautiful women'. These curvaceous women - some in excess of 40 stone - were worshipped by legions of men calling themselves 'fat admirers'. An online community for fat women helped Gayla to embrace her size as she was worshiped by 'fat admirers' Curious to know more, Gayla joined a forum called Bulge Chat and soon found herself overwhelmed with lusty fans. She said: 'I realised I was desirable, I was sexy, I was beautiful and I became confident in who I was. 'I had always thought the men who liked BBWs would be geeks in their mum's basement, but I was totally wrong.' Despite having her pick it was rugged truck driver Lance Neufield, 54, who really caught her attention. 'I realised I was desirable, I was sexy, I was beautiful and I became confident in who I was,' said Gayla . After meeting on Bulge Chat they enjoyed two 15-minute conversations and struck up an instant rapport. Lance told her he was driving to Texas with work the following week and they agreed to meet at a truck stop and have dinner. Gayla agreed despite vowing never to fall for anyone again - and she found herself swept off her feet by the Canadian. She said: 'When he pulled up and I saw him I was like, 'Oh my God, he is so cute'. 'He got in the car and he said to me, 'Your pictures online do you no justice'. I was like, 'Aww, that's so sweet' and I just blushed. When Lance and Gayla first met, they stayed up all night talking and smooching on the sofa . 'Years later I found out that his computer didn't produce very good pictures, but it's okay, it still made me feel good at the time. 'We had our first dinner and got a bottle of Champagne afterwards and rented the General's Daughter and The Thomas Crown Affair. 'We didn't get through any of those movies because we stayed up all night talking and smooching on the couch like a couple of kids. 'I was sad when he had to go.' They embarked on a long-distance relationship before Gayla agreed to move to Manitoba, Canada, to be with Lance - and they married six years later. Gayla moved from Texas to Canada to be with Lance, and they married six years later . Despite her size, they claim to enjoy an 'active and satisfying sex life', though Gayla's weight causes other day-to-day obstacles. She struggles to shop for clothes that fit around her 96-inch belly and must use a motorised cart if required to walk long distances. Getting into a car is also an ordeal and she must book two seats on an aeroplane when flying. She has a range of health issues including arthritis and thyroid problems, but remains upbeat about the future. Gayla struggles to walk long distances and has to book two seats on an aeroplane when flying . She said: 'As far as the health aspects go, I don't really worry about them. My mother is still alive and she is 82. 'I have had doctors tell me more then once that I needed to lose weight for health reasons but I truly believe that when it is your time to go, it is your time to go.' Lance, who has three children from a previous relationship, has always been attracted to Gayla's supersize paunch but wouldn't stand in her way if she attempted to lose weight. Gayla's favourite foods are cookies and ice-cream. She says she doesn't worry about health problems . He said: 'This woman is the love of my life. I would 100% support her if she decided to lose weight. 'The first thing that attracted me to her was that she had the most beautiful face I had ever seen. 'The belly was just the bonus on top of all her other beauty. 'It doesn't matter to me whether it is bigger or smaller because it's not really her belly I love - I love her.' 'The belly was just the bonus on top of all her other beauty,' says Gayla's latest husband, Lance . With Lance's continuing support Gayla is planning to continue her modelling career and win over even more fans. She said: 'I allowed the world to dictate to me what I was supposed to look like and who I was supposed to be. By taking a body-positive image I have empowered myself to be who I am and to enjoy my life. 'I'm not going to tell you that I never have bad days and I am not going to tell you that I don't wish I was thin from time to time, but mostly I just enjoy being me.

"When it comes to modern-day travel, the long waits at airports and cramped flights are considered a necessary evil. But some airports, it seems, are very much worse than others. While Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport, in Pakistan, is often cited as the worst in the world, there are a surprising number of complaints form travellers about well-known hubs ranging from LAX in Los Angeles to London Luton. Scroll down for video . Queues are never a holidaymaker's best idea of fun, but it appears some airports don't help themselves when faced with these kind of situations (pictured is Los Angeles Airport) From the long queues for security, to paying for internet connectivity that doesn't work and fighting for a seat in the terminal, the allegations against these well-known airports are varied, infuriating travellers while they await their connection. So, which airports top the list when it comes to passengers complaining about their experience? These are the hubs that appear to disappoint holidaymakers the most... The layout at Los Angeles Airport has been criticised by many visitors . Los Angeles International Airport, U.S. The San Francisco Chronicle once described LAX as 'eight terminals connected by a traffic jam'. Complaints generally revolve around the convoluted and unsigned layout, the lack of restaurants, activities and services for the layover traveller, and the general uncleanliness of the airport in Los Angeles (LAX). Writing on Google +, passenger Tim Dascomb described the airport, that handled almost 80 million visitors last year, as looking like it 'hasn't been maintained since 1973.' He continued: 'TSA was horrible, no surprise there. Wifi is spotty when it isn't non-existent. When returning internationally, customs was the slowest I've ever encountered in my life.' Nick Ross was similarly scathing in his one-star review when he wrote: 'This is the absolute worst airport I've ever been to. It's like the Walmart of airports. 'My flight was delayed. Then you have to wait in line for almost two hours for them to give you a re-booking for the next day.' LAX is America's second busiest airport in terms of passengers handled each year, beaten only by Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport. So perhaps it is no wonder passengers become frustrated with long queues for security, immigration and customs. There is good news though. In the latest Skytrax World Airport Awards, LAX crept into the top 100, making 98th place from a previous position of 102. Hurghada International Airport, Egypt . It is a favourite hotspot with European travellers, especially those looking for some winter sun. However, travellers complain that there is reportedly no air conditioning in the departure lounge and an expensive duty free shop. Holidaymaker Ash Tulett told MailOnline Travel: 'Lack of places to buy food, surprise card charges when buying duty free make all in all a miserable and depressing looking airport.' Hurghada International Airport is an important check-in to explore Egypt's holiday resorts, with queues like this experienced by many . The opinion was similarly shared by Hannah Davis who left a Google review saying: 'Just flew in and out of this airport. The worst I have ever had the displeasure to use. 'Herded into the security area like cattle by extremely rude and abusive staff. There was one belt working although there were about 10 areas that could have been opened. Barney Ashworth wasn't too happy with Hurghada Airport, and shared his views on Twitter . 'After finally getting through there and checking in yet more queues and abusive staff at passport control. My passport was literally thrown in my face after being stamped.' The airport has undergone massive renovations to accommodate dramatically rising leisure traffic, with officials stating they can now cater for around 13 million passengers annually. Seemingly many of these passengers wouldn't agree. LaGuardia Airport, New York, U.S. New York LaGuardia has been named as the most frustrating airport in North America. Taking into account the time it takes to get there, the security processes, the quality of the terminals and facilities, and how many flights get delayed, LaGuardia takes the crown that nobody wants. Visitors to LaGuardia New York describe the airport as being underwhelming with less than helpful staff . To be delayed at LaGuardia is 'mind numbing' according to research attained by sleepingatairports.net . The research, conducted by businessweek.com, used data from a user survey, airports' on-time performance, and information on the ease of getting to and from the airports. It's location, beyond Subway lines, means long taxi queues for arriving passengers and the airport scored an abysmal 91 out of 100 in BusinessWeek's survey. Sleepinginairports.net says that the airport has 'drab décor, poor restaurant selection, lacklustre cleanliness, counter-intuitive layout and the notoriously unhelpful staff.' They add: 'While a departure from here is manageable, a delay here becomes the definition of mind numbing.' The airport was once likened to a 'third world country' by U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden. People take to social networks on a regular basis to complain about LaGuardia Airport . Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport, Pakistan . The 2014 Guide to Sleeping at Airports named the Pakistan airport as the very worst after tourists were asked to rate their airport experiences based on comfort, facilities, cleanliness and customer service. One customer likened Pakistan's Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport to 'a central prison' adding: 'Many of the touts and taxi drivers loot people at the airport and outside'. Tourists also criticised the absence of crowd control, 'pervasive corruption', inconsistent security checks and the overall lack of cleanliness and technology. Some visitors to Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport have described it as more like 'a prison' The customer service aspect of the airport in Islamabad has been highlighted as a growing concern . London Luton Airport, Luton, UK . The biggest gripe for tourists when travelling here is that they are not actually in London but Bedfordshire. However, while that should be looked into pre-flight, a host of elements at the airport leave customers angry. A favourite with the budget airlines, crowds can become problematic both arriving at the airport and in the terminal. Luton is a favourite with budget airlines, and this can lead to long queues for customers . Some of customers' biggest complaints are that everything from Wi-Fi to the bags used to put your liquids in are chargeable. Writing on the review section of Skytrax, Bob Daniel described Luton airport as an 'absolutely ghastly place.' He added: 'As others have noticed they charge you for anything they can think of. 'The 'short term' car park is so far away heaven help you if it is raining. 'Security is a farce at the best of times, at times of minor demand it is appalling.' Omar Chaudhuri didn't go into detail about his Luton Airport Experience, but was confident in his opinion . And in her zero-star rating on the site, Julia Gilson wrote: 'Luton airport security is a shambles. Be warned long queues causing passengers to miss their flights. 'The whole Luton experience is extremely poor.' Which? Travel has also waded in to the fray, branding Luton the UK's worst airport for the second year running in 2014 in its annual survey of 'holiday hassles'. Of the 8,000 people surveyed, it received a satisfaction rating of just 37 per cent, six per cent lower than the previous year. And one Which? member went as far as describing the airport as a 'hell hole'. Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris, France . Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport is the world's seventh-busiest airport, and one where it's best to give yourself plenty of time to navigate the terminal. Passengers claim sandwiches and snacks are overpriced, complaining that a simple baguette can cost as much as €6, while terminal corrections can mean over an hour spent navigating by shuttle. Be prepared for a terminal transfer once checked-in at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris . An89Go writes in their Google review: 'In general it feels much better when you know you finally leave the airport - check in rush, security rush and everything else that's in rush at the CDG (basically everything) makes you stressed out.' Tom Jeffs was similarly depressed with his experience at the airport in the French capital by writing: 'The toilets are small and cramped, cubicles have no hooks. The only clothing shops here sell jeans that cost over 150 euros.'

"Geoff Barrow has accused streaming services of giving music away, saying his band Portishead were paid just £1,700 despite getting 34million plays . The founder of rock band Portishead has waded into the debate over music streaming, saying that he received just £1,700 in royalties despite his songs being played 34million times. In a series of tweets Geoff Barrow, Portishead's founder and instrumentalist, attacked Spotify, YouTube, Apple and 'especially' Universal Music for selling his music cheaply. He added that he has nothing against streaming, but wants musicians to be paid more, and says it is hurting young talent, stopping people from establishing themselves on the scene. Barrow, who also runs the Invada record label, told The Times: 'You used to write a piece of music and people paid you to listen to it. 'Yet for younger artists who just want to play rock and roll, by the time they get to a major label, all their rights will have been sold away. 'There will be not much meat left on the bone. You see these huge deals but will smaller bands be able to buy a Ford Galaxy to go on tour in if this isn't sorted out?' Artists have long railed against the low royalties paid from streaming companies, leading to Jay-Z launching his own Tidal service this month, promising bigger returns for musicians. Pop megastar Taylor Swift and Thom York, frontman of indie rockers Radiohead, have also pulled their music from services such as Spotify in protest. However, record companies have been quick to upload their music on to these platforms to prop up the collapse in CD sales after music moved online. Barrow, who heads up record label Invada as well as playing in Portishead (pictured), said he was not opposed to streaming technology, but was concerned young artists were getting a poor deal . Streaming companies have also defended their practices, saying they offer artists a fair price in an age where music can be easily accessed for nothing. Rihanna, Madonna, Beyonce, Usher, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Jack White and Kanye West banded together to help launch Jay Z's $20-a-month Tidal streaming service last month, which aims to offer artists a better deal. The membership-based service  will operate in a similar format to Spotify, providing music and exclusive videos that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. The ongoing row between artists, music labels and streaming companies lead to Jay Z launching his own service, Tidal, which aims to give musicians a better deal . Backed by a host of musicians such as Arcade Fire, Daft Punk, Madonna, and Alicia Keys, Jay Z plans to charge £20-per-month for the service, and will give the artists a bigger share . Unlike Spotify there isn't a free service and users will have to pay $9.95 for standard sound quality or $19.99 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' Tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of Spotify, which offers lower levels for free users. Speaking at the launch event, Alicia Keys said: 'Our mission goes beyond commerce, it goes beyond technology. Our intent is to preserve music's importance in our lives.'","Geoff Barrow said streaming services and record labels give music away .

"Technology may have advanced in leaps and bounds, but when it comes to our most precious papers, it turns out many of us remain creatures of habit. A third of adults shun the storage possibilities of the internet and still keep their most important papers in a shoebox, a poll has found. Ten per cent are even more relaxed about treasured photos, letters and mementos – leaving them lying around in piles of paperwork. A third of adults shun the storage possibilities of the internet and still keep their most important papers in a shoebox,the poll by online file-sharing service Lifetile found . From a marriage certificate to deeds to a house, only six per cent keep a back-up copy of vital paperwork online, while just 13 per cent bother to scan it to a computer, the poll by online file-sharing service Lifetile found. The survey of more than 2,000 Britons found almost half (45 per cent) rely on a safe or filing cabinet to store documents, from personal to official ones. While 32 per cent keep their possessions in a shoebox, the box itself is then filed away to a loft, cupboard or garage. The contents can include love letters and old photos before the age of digital cameras to a will or deeds to property, for instance, the children's old school reports and mementos. The survey also found 10 per cent of Brits ignore all the other available options and simply keep physical documents stacked in piles at various places around the home. An ultra cautious 4 per cent have safety deposit boxes, said the survey. Lifetile is a service offering an online site to keep private documents, photos and other memories to build up a family history to share with children and others online. It allows users to import digital photos, social media updates and entries and uploaded paperwork. Men are almost twice as likely women to keep such documents either online or on a computer, and younger adults more likely than older ones to do so, the research showed. Just 13 per cent bother to scan it to a computer, while almost half (45 per cent) rely on a safe or filing cabinet to store documents . Founder Richard Grant said: 'The old shoebox represents a comforting place for people to keep their important documents and treasured memories. 'They can return time and again to look at photos of their children growing up, love letters, marriage certificates and much more. 'It's the story of your life in its simplest form. But the internet has opened up the possibility of immortalising our life story, by making it digital.' It is harder to lose documents and memories kept online, easier to share them with others and easier to find them in a hurry than if they were stored out of the way at home. Grant added: 'We spend so much of our life online, using the web to learn, shop and socialise and yet when it comes to the big life events and our important documents, all of which define us, we often choose to keep them tucked away for a rainy day.'","Ten per cent leave their documents, letters and mementos around in piles .

"Shaun Bryan - who was the intended target of the shot which paralysed little Thusha Kamaleswaran in 2011 - was jailed for another crime this week . The criminal who dodged the bullet that paralysed five-year-old Thusha Kamaleswaran in a botched gangland hit has been jailed. Shaun Bryan, 23, was the intended target of the shooting that shocked the nation in March 2011. Thusha, who had been was playing in the aisle of her uncle's shop in Stockwell, south London, was caught in the crossfire when two gangs clashed. Bryan has now been jailed for a separate crime in which he and an accomplice subjected two women to a 'ruthless attack' in their home in Croydon, south London on December 17 last year. He and 20-year-old Gino Sawyers threatened the women at knifepoint before stealing mobile phones, a laptop and cash. They were both sentenced at Croydon Crown Court after pleading guilty to aggravated burglary. Thusha was hit in the chest and the bullet passed through the seventh vertebra of her spine in 2011. Chilling CCTV footage showed the girl, then five, skipping and dancing in one of the aisles of the shop when she was shot. She went into cardiac arrest twice, and had to undergo emergency surgery in the shop and in hospital. Doctors feared that she would never be able to move her legs again - but she has since regained feeling in both legs, raising hopes that she might one day be able to walk. Thusha Kamaleswaran, pictured left in a documentary, was paralysed in 2011 when  gang members shot at Bryan . CCTV showing  Thusha falling to the ground in the shop where the shooting which shocked Britain took place . In Bryan's most recent crime, police officers used a mobile phone tracking app to trace him and his accomplice but lost the pair when they dropped the items they stole. The Met's dog unit was called in and an Alsatian called Jacob helped hunt down the pair. Both men were sentenced to six years and three months, with Bryan, of Stockwell, jailed and Sawyers, of no fixed abode, sent to a young offenders' institution. Investigating officer Detective Constable John Davis said: 'This burglary was of a particularly violent nature, the men subjected the two victims to a ruthless attack by threatening them with knives and violence in their own home.' Bryan was previously sentenced to two years and four months in a young offenders' institution in 2012 after pleading guilty to eight counts of supplying heroin and cocaine at the Inner London Crown Court.

"They vanished from the Earth around 40,000 years ago after surviving for hundreds of thousands of years through much of the last ice age. Now researchers believe they may have uncovered a possible explanation of what may have contributed to Neanderthals eventual demise - they were not very adept at controlling fire. A team of archaeologists at Boston University and the University of Bath believe this would have meant they lost out when modern humans arrived from Africa. Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the Natural History Museum in London, may have finally died out as they were unable to get as much energy from their food as modern humans who used fire . They used computer model the amount of energy Neanderthals would have been able to get from their food without cooking it compared to humans that were. They found that without fire, a group of Neanderthals would have had less energy - the equivalent 12 reindeer a year - than if they did. They are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers, but Neanderthals were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains.. Instead, it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors, scientists believe. An analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years strips away some of the myths surrounding Neanderthals and reveals they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought. Many researchers believe the differences between the two human species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the Neanderthals. Neanderthals have been found to make stone tools and even made jewellery. Eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia were used to create a necklace or bracelet 130,000 years ago. Modern humans who regularly cooked their food could have then channeled this extra energy into growing their population and searching longer for food during lean periods. Anna Goldfield, an archaeologist at Boston University who led the research, said: 'Cooking makes meat more easily digestible, and that means that the calories that would've been used to digest raw meat can go to other uses. 'I determined, importantly, that a diet of cooked meat meant that either foraging groups could travel a bit farther in their range of gathering, or since they were getting more out of a set of resources, they could stay longer in the same landscape.' Living from about 300,000 years ago to 40,000 years ago, they were known to make stone tools and were accomplished hunters. They spread through out Europe and much of Asia, and there is some evidence that they made jewellery and art. Some researchers believe that they were also highly intelligent - possibly even as intelligent as modern humans, Homo sapiens. There are a number of theories for what caused Neanderthals to disappear - but most seem to agree it was the arrival of modern humans in Europe and Asia that played a role. Some archaeologists believe they were unable to compete with modern humans, while others believe humans actively killed them. Neanderthals vanished relatively quickly once modern humans arrived in the areas where they were living . However, DNA evidence also suggests that Neanderthals and modern humans also interbred. Neanderthals use of fire is still a highly controversial issue, but if they had not used it to cook food as much as modern humans it would have put them at a definite disadvantage. Miss Goldfield said: 'There is certainly plenty of evidence that Neanderthals used fire in Europe as well as in the Levant, Africa, and elsewhere. 'I was absolutely not suggesting that Neanderthals had no use or control of fire. What we don't know is how intensively the populations used fire. 'What is an intriguing problem is the seeming lack of consistent fire use in the Quina Mousterian, a glacial phase of the Middle Paleolithic. 'We see a bit of burned bone at some sites, but really no evidence for lots of fire use. It may be that we haven't found it yet, or it may be that Neanderthals were using other survival strategies. 'Neanderthals probably weren't all that different from humans, but they may have adopted different strategies for dealing with their environment.' Miss Goldfield, who conducted her research with Ross Booton, a mathematical biologist at the University of Sheffield, suggests that with their bigger bodies, Neanderthals would have needed more food than modern humans. Recent research is suggesting that Neanderthals were sophisticated and not very different from modern humans, increasing the mystery behind why they died out and Homo sapiens managed to survive . She said: 'My real aim was to specifically look at the impact of cooking on metabolism, and whether regular cooking of food might have been an advantage for Neanderthals. 'Neanderthals were a bit more muscular and robust than early humans. Neanderthal metabolic costs for a day's activity would have been a bit higher.' Using their computer models they were able to simulate how the populations of Neanderthals would change depending on their use of fire. They found that if modern humans used fire more often than Neanderthals, then their populations would grow. Both groups hunted and ate reindeer, among other large prey, that were prevalanet across much of Europe at the time. But as modern human populations grew, it would also reduce the number of reindeer available for Neanderthals. Over time this could have increased Neanderthals vulnerability to extinction. Miss Goldfield presented her findings at the Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in San Francisco. She said: 'Initial tests indimcate that cooking lean meat increases its caloric value sufficiently to offset up to 3.7 days’ worth of locomotion, or 12 kills per year, thus extending the carrying capacity of a landscape patch, particularly during periods of resource scarcity.' She told LiveScience: 'Fire use would have provided a significant advantage for the human population and may indeed have been an important factor in the overall collapse or absorption of the Neanderthal population.'","Researchers used computer models to study how Neanderthal populations would have fared if they did not use fire to cook and modern humans did .
They found cooking would have increased the number of calories available .
Evidence for Neanderthals using fire is patchy and not all may have done it ."
"Jihadi John and other ISIS extremists are building a network of 'misfits' around the world who can carry out 'chaotic' terror attacks with little planning, a senior police officer has warned. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of specialist operations at the Metropolitan Police, said ISIS is trying to 'pick up' potential fighters among 'the vulnerable, people with violent backgrounds, very young people and those with mental health issues'. Mr Rowley issued the warning of new tactics among Islamist fanatics at the Counter-Terror Expo at Olympia, west London, yesterday. London-born ISIS execution Jihadi John is being used to recruit a network of 'misfits' around the world, made up of the 'very young, violent and mentally ill', a senior police officer has warned . On changing methods of attack, Mr Rowley said: 'We still have groups who are interested in the awful, spectacular attacks that we have seen with Al Qaeda in the past. 'That's still something we have to be concerned and worried about. But now there's a much wider range, with chaotic attacks across the world using knives, using vehicles. 'The real aim being to kill and get footage of that to propagate the message and propagate their cause.' His words echo the case of London teenager Brustholm Ziamani, who was jailed in February for plotting a 'Lee Rigby-style' attack on a British soldier or policeman. He fell under the spell of the notorious al-Muhajiroun group once fronted by hate preacher Anjem Choudary after being made homeless in London. In 2008,  22-year-old Nicky Reilly - who had a mental age of 10 - attempted to carry out a suicide bombing in Exeter after he was contacted by extremists online. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said yesterday that the tactics of terror groups are changing . Mr Rowley said there had been a 'step-change' in the scope and scale of terror threats. Citing the rise of ISIS in Syria and northern Iraq, compared to existing terror strongholds in Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen, he said: 'It's a much easier area to get to. It's not far from budget holiday trips to Turkey and Greece that those terror groups travel to, to exploit.' More than 600 British jihadists have travelled to join ISIS, with half returning to pose a threat on UK streets. But Mr Rowley said around 50 per cent did not have terror links before flying to Syria. Instead, many had been radicalised via propaganda on social media, by extremists, hate preachers and fighters such as  Jihadi John - real name Mohammed Emwazi. Branding ISIS a cult, Mr Rowley added: 'It is actually looking to inspire people to support their cause. 'They're developing that with a very, very determined approach to exploiting social media and propaganda.' London teenager Brustholm Ziamani (left) was picked up by Islamic extremists after he was kicked out of his home. Mentally ill Nicky Reilly (right) was also goaded into carrying out a nail bomb attack in 2008 . Mr Rowley added: 'We have terrorist groups now able, from relatively safe environments in ungoverned space of broken areas of the country, to reach into communities in the UK and influence people to act in their name to commit terrorist act. That is a fundamental difference in the challenge the UK is facing.' The speech came amid reports that ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi has been injured in an air strike in Iraq and is no longer in control of the group. It is said his deputies in the organisation have been running day-to-day activities while he recovers, following the reported attack on March 18. Reilly hoped to kill or wound as many diners as he could with the crude nail bomb he had made . In a display of the tactics outlined by Mr Rowley, a man with learning difficulties was coaxed into carrying out a botched restaurant bombing in 2008. Nicky Reilly, from Plymouth, tried to blow himself up in a busy Giraffe restaurant in Exeter after accessing an extremist website online. He was preparing the nail bomb device in the restaurant's toilet when it went off in his hands, injuring him but no one else. Deputy Chief Constable Tony Melville, who investigated the case, said at the time: 'He was preyed upon, radicalised, and taken advantage of.' Reilly's mother Kim told how he had a mental age of 10 and suffered from mental illness. She said he was an 'easy target, easy prey' for radicalisation. Judge Mr Justice Calvert-Smith, who jailed Reilly for life for attempted murder, said after the trial: 'There is evidence from materials seized that he became increasingly drawn to violent action in support of fellow Muslims in revenge for perceived persecution, and to the idea of himself personally becoming a martyr.'","Met Office Assistant Commissioner says fanatics' tactics have changed .

"The 19-year-old, named locally as Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld (above) from Stamford hill, London, was pulled from the water in Hampstead Heath, north London, after getting into difficulty while swimming . Police officers 'watched' as a group of teenagers desperately tried to save their friend who drowned in Hampstead Heath pond, it has been claimed. Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld, 19, from Stamford Hill, London, had been swimming with four friends as temperatures reached 25C when he got into difficulty. An eyewitness has said at least seven police officers stood on a bank and watched as the boys dived in and out looking for their friend. The teenagers were reportedly heard shouting to ambulance crews on the side, asking how long someone could survive under water as they scrambled around trying to save their friend. It is thought Mr Greenfield may have had a cardiac arrest because of the shock of jumping into the cold water. His body was eventually discovered five foot below the surface and 20ft from the water's edge just before 11pm on Wednesday - nearly six hours after he was reported in trouble at 5.30pm. James Eisen, a 43-year-old freelance journalist, said: 'I was walking past and I could see a lot of commotion going on over the far side of the pond. 'The guy's friends were going in and out of the water and holding their breath and diving under frantically. 'There were police officers and paramedics and firefighters on the bank just standing there watching while the boys dived under. There was at least seven police officers on the side. 'It was a chaotic and surreal scene. 'I heard one of the boys shouting to one of the ambulance crews and asking how long someone could survive under water without breathing as they continued swimming around in a panic. 'I'm guessing the emergency services are told not to go into the water but if that's the case they probably shouldn't have let the boys carry on swimming about. 'Before I left the police helicopter was flying over and they had launched some boats onto the pond.' Mr Grunfeld's family have paid tribute to the teenager, who they described as a 'wonderful' and 'friendly' man, but said there was no blame because they believed that was the way God was meant to 'take him.' Mr Greenfeld, who is from the Orthodox Jewish community and is thought to have lost his Rabbi father to cancer five years ago, had recently flown home to London from New York, where he was studying religion at a Jewish college. Tragically, he only returned the UK to be with his family during the Passover holiday. His sister, who asked not be named, said: 'He was a wonderful young man and lovely brother who was very well liked, friendly, and he will be dearly missed by his family and friends. 'He was very into studies but he was very fun to be with and he would always try to lend a hand.” Police, specialist divers and 30 firefighters scoured the water for the missing teenager and his body was found five foot below the surface just before 11pm last night. He got into difficulty while swimming with four friends . 'We believe that whatever God does is for the good, so if that’s the way he [God] was meant to take him [Moses] then it must be good for him and for us, because it was meant to be. 'So there’s no blame, no pointing, because what was meant to happen, happened, and there was nothing anybody could have done to avoid it.' Speaking of the police response she added: 'Of course we would have liked it if they could have got their quicker. But we really appreciate what the police have done and they treated us and our religious beliefs with respect. 'They waited for Jewish men to come [to the pond] to handle the body, and we really appreciate that.' The group had been swimming outside of the designated area and out of hours at a time when no lifeguards were on duty, it was claimed. Members of his family gathered at the edge of the large pond – which had been packed in the day with sunbathers – as specialist divers from the Marine Policing Unit and around 30 firefighters scoured the water for him. Emergency services workers could be seen taking a stretcher into the park after the discovery of the body . The tragedy came on the hottest day of the year so far as temperatures reached 25.1C at St James's Park in the capital and in Frittenden, Kent. It is believed Mr Greenfeld may have suffered a heart attack brought on by the sudden change in body temperature after diving into the chilly 8C  pond, the Evening Standard reported. A friend of Mr Greenfeld told the newspaper: 'He arrived with pals after driving up from Hackney. They got here after 5pm and the lifeguard was not on duty. 'I think Moses got into difficulty in the shallow part of the pond but there's a steep drop-off. They recovered his clothes from the side of the pond. 'His mother is devastated. He lost his father to cancer when he was young.' The boys had entered the water after the 4.30pm closure wearing what Mr Eisen described as boxers or swimming shorts. He was seen scrambling in a 10ft deep section of the pond and shouting for help before he disappeared under the surface. Emergency services were called just after 5.30pm and a subsequent search involved 30 firefighters, a police marine unit and a police helicopter. The young man's body was eventually pulled out at about 11pm after extensive searches of the murky water. The heath is controlled by the Corporation of London and a spokesman said that officers had not entered the water to try and save the drowning teenager. Last night, members of Mr Grenfeld's family gathered at the edge of the large pond – which had been packed in the day with sunbathers – as specialist police divers and around 30 firefighters scoured the water for him . Members of the Hatzola team, a group which provides 24/7 emergency care and ambulance services in London, were also called to the scene, along with a police helicopter, specialist divers and about 30 firefighters . A spokesman said: 'The heath constabulary officers are here to enforce bylaws in the park, they are not trained lifeguards and the water is dangerous and very murky, so they are advised they are not to go in until proper assistance arrives. 'He was swimming away from the designated area and out of hours so there were no lifeguards on duty. 'There are signs everywhere warning people not to go into the water at these times. 'Visibility in the water is about six inches, it's very murky, and you can barely see in front of your face. 'He had swum out over a ten foot drop and was about 20 feet from the side when he experienced difficulty - you have to be a strong swimmer to be out there. 'It is a complete tragedy but these are the facts behind it.' The Metropolitan Police confirmed a report was now being prepared for the coroner. The heath was full of sunbathers as the incident unfolded yesterday, as dozens of people had gathered to enjoy the unseasonably warm weather. One man, who claimed to be Mr Grenfeld's uncle, said the teenager had gone swimming with friends. He said: 'He went swimming and he must have struggled and he cannot be found. It's very tragic. They did the surface search and they called it off. The divers are coming in. That will change it from a rescue to a recovery.' Henna Anaya, who was on the heath with her son at the time of the incident, said: 'There were about four friends, all of them in the water, and they were swimming. I told my son they were just messing around. 'The next minute someone said to me he was going down and waving his arm and telling his friend to help, he was sinking. There were guys jumping in to help. The guy who went in told me that police had asked him to get out of the water.' Specialist police divers and around 30 firefighters joined the search for a 19-year-old man who got into difficulty while swimming in Hampstead Ponds in Hampstead Heath, north London, yesterday afternoon . Police were initially called to the scene just after 5.30pm after receiving reports from concerned members of the public that a teenager was in difficulty and under the water. His body was retrieved fromt the lake at 11pm . Another witness, who didn't wish to be named, said: 'It was right at the other end from where the lifeguard would have been, so by the time he was struggling, it would've already been too late. 'One woman said she heard the boys shouting for help, but only realised afterwards because at the time she couldn't understand what they were saying. 'The emergency services arrived very quickly, but you can't make miracles. It's just a tragedy.' Andrew Dutton-Parish, a regular swimmer at the Men's Pond who was also at the heath, added: 'It's such a sad start to the summer. It's very rare for anyone to be drowned.' A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said paramedics arrived on the scene within eight minutes, but the emergency teams, accompanied by a police helicopter, were unable to save the young man. The teenager is the second person to have died while swimming on the heath in the past two years. In August 2013, photographer Sussie Ahlburg, 51, from Holborn, drowned in the ladies' bathing pond. It later emerged she had a heart condition and had been warned not to swim in 'open water' by a cardiologist. Hampstead Heath has three swimming ponds which can become extremely busy in good weather. Despite temperatures reaching 25C in London yesterday, waters remained cool on the heath, with temperatures recorded at about 8C.

"A terrified woman has revealed her estranged husband’s chilling plot to have her killed, not once, but twice. Angie Donohue has told how her husband of four years, Daryl Scott Donohue, 43, had tried to hire someone to kill her, even from the confines of his prison cell. ‘I was frightened of him, I was just terrified of him,’ Mrs Donohue revealed in an interview with A Current Affair. Scroll down for video . Angie Donohue broke down as she explained how her husband of four years had tried to hire someone to kill her, even from the confines of his prison cell. Daryl Scott Donohue tried to kill his wife, not once, but twice . Over the course of their marriage, Ms Donohue was forced into hiding after Donohue stalked and terrorised her before trying to hire ‘various people’ to kill her for money. Ms Donohue said that when they started the doomed romance, Donohue was a ‘nice, sweet and fun loving guy’ who  appeared ‘normal’. After dating for about a year the pair got engaged and started to plan a wedding. Ms Donohue said it was on the day that was meant to be the happiest of her life that she discovered her husband-to-be was not the man she thought he was. ‘He didn’t even make eye contact with me and I remember saying the night we were married “why didn’t you look at me?” He told her it was nerves but in that moment she knew something wasn’t quite right. ‘He didn’t even make eye contact with me and I remember saying the night we were married “why didn’t you look at me?” The couple both had children to previous relationships and Ms Donohue said she had no intentions of having any more children, but Donohue convinced her they should try for another baby. Once Ms Donohue fell pregnant, she said things started to get progressively worse. ‘Once I got pregnant it was like the real person emerged and it was kind of frighting.’ She said he became increasingly possessive, always checking her whereabouts and dictating exactly what she could and could not do. ‘Everything I did had to have approval… it was like a switch was flicked,’ she revealed in the emotional interview. Ms Donohue explained her husband became increasingly possessive, always checking her whereabouts and dictating exactly what she could and could not do . She said his controlling behaviour seeped into every aspect of her life; she couldn’t shop, eat or go out without his consent. He had taken control of all their finances. At this stage, Ms Donohue was faced with news that her unborn child was very unwell and he would require multiple surgeries to survive. Her son’s health became her main focus and as Ms Donohue started to approach the end of her pregnancy, the Tasmanian was told she needed to go to Melbourne so specialists could monitor the final stages of her complicated pregnancy.. After giving birth, Ms Donohue’s son was rushed to intensive care. She said she'd finally had enough and worked up the courage to leave her controlling husband. Ms Donohue was faced with tragic news that her  child was very unwell and he would require multiple surgeries to survive . After the birth of their son, Ms Donohue was about to leave her controlling husband when he pleaded that he would change . ‘I’d actually said to him “This isn’t how I’d imagined my life” but he eventually promised that he would change.’ Ms Donohue decided to give him another chance and stayed for several more years until Donohue stooped to a new low, striking his youngest and most vulnerable son. ‘I turned around and said “How dare you effing hit him? You know that he’s had a stroke, he’s had brain damage so why on earth would you smack him in the face?""' Donohue stooped to a new low, striking his youngest and most vulnerable son which prompted Ms Donohue to confront him about his behaviour . He told her he lashed out because their son ‘wouldn’t effing shut up’. Ms Donohue told her husband he had no right to touch their son like that and if he wanted to hit someone, he could hit her, to which he responded ‘I’m going to do one better’. Ms Donohue then took her children and left her abusive husband but he started to stalk the family. ‘He was everywhere,’ she said. Ms Donohue revealed he broke into the house, tampered with her Facebook account, accessed her emails and even attempted to hide out on her children's school grounds. She took this information to police but they told her there was little they could do for her. ‘He was taunting me,’ she added. Ms Donohue revealed her husband had broken into their house, he'd tampered with her Facebook account, accessed her emails and even attempted to hide on her kid's school grounds. She said she knew he was planning to kill her and he may well have succeeded if Donohue hadn’t made a crucial mistake that would alert police to his troubling behaviour. Donohue followed his estranged wife into an undercover car park where he smashed her rear breaklight, allegedly so he could easily follow her at night. The carpark was covered in CCTV cameras and he was caught in the act. Armed with the camera footage as evidence, police launched a major investigation into Daryl Scott Donohue. The blurry CCTV footage shows Donohue before he proceeded to smash his wife's break lights . They soon learned Ms Donohue's fear was justified as they learned he had tried to hire a hit man to murder his wife. ‘They told me a little bit. They told me enough to keep me aware that Daryl was trying to hire someone to kill me,’ she said. ‘The police turned around and said we need you to go away for a while, so we did.’ Ms Donohue and her children hid out in a hotel while an undercover officer posed as a hit man and went to meet Donohue. He offered the officer $10,000 in cash to carry out the hit. Police immediately arrested Donohue for trying to incite his wife’s murder. ‘I got the phone call saying its over, he’s been arrested.’ A photographer captured the moment Donohue was arrested for stalking and inciting his wife's murder . Police told her that her husband had approached ‘various people’ offering them money to ‘to get rid’ of her. Donohue plead guilty to both stalking and inciting murder and in Feburary, 2013, he was sentenced four years in jail. Ms Donohue was devastated he wasn’t put away for longer but she hoped while Donohue was behind bars, her family would be safe. ‘We thought, right, at least for four years, we can get on with our lives. We can just try and be normal.’ She said her son’s performance at school started to improve and slowly her life started to get better. ‘We thought, right, at least for four years, we can get on with our lives. We can just try and be normal’ Unbeknownst to Ms Donohue her husband was still plotting her murder, for the second time, from inside his jail cell. He approached inmates who he knew were about to go on parole and offered them cash to track down his wife and kill her. Scott, who was serving a three month sentence for burglary, was one of two inmates he offered $25,000 to murder Ms Donohue. He said Donohue would plan ways he could kill his wife, and her parents, so he could gain full custody of his children. Scott, who was serving a three month sentence for burglary, was one of two inmates he offered $25,000 to murder Ms Donohue . He allegedly suggested he should cut her break lines and then interfere with her pacemaker. He even offered up a plan to kill her parents by putting cyanide in their milk before texting Ms Donohue off their phone, to lure her to her own death. ‘He turned around and said if its not done in three weeks, I’ll have someone else to do it,’ Scott told A Current Affair. When Scott was released from prison, he immediately went to authorities and provided key information that lead to Donohue being charged for a second time. In Feburary this year, Donohue was found guilty by a court of law for inciting his wife’s murder, again. He was sentenced to a further seven years in jail. ‘You live in fear and you hate that somebody has that kind of control over you from inside prison’ Ms Donohue was taken aback that her husband could still try and hurt her from behind bars. ‘You live in fear and you hate that somebody has that kind of control over you from inside prison,’ she said. Donohue, who showed no remorse, underwent psychiatric testing where it was confirmed he had no mental illnesses that could have contributed to his twisted behaviour. While Ms Donohue would like to believe her ordeal is over, she said she still feels ‘unsafe’. ‘I have no doubt that he’s just not going to let go. He’s one very angry person and he wants me dead. I don’t feel safe.’ Ms Donohue has been offered to join witness protection but she said it isn’t an option. She believes her children need to be surrounded by the people who know and love them. ‘I thought I picked a sensible person. I thought I picked a safe person but it turned out I picked anything but and it turns out I put those kids in danger’ Ms Donohue said she still feels guilty for bringing this man into her children’s lives. ‘I thought I picked a sensible person. I thought I picked a safe person but it turned out I picked anything but and it turns out I put those kids in danger.’ Ms Donohue said she wants as many people as possible to hear her story, and see the face of her killer husband, in case he ever makes another attempt on her life. Donohue is reportedly trying to appeal his second, seven-year, conviction however a hearing date is yet to be determined.","Angie Donohue revealed how her  husband tried to have her killed .

"Modern technology is supposed to be making our lives easier, but often all it does is create more pitfalls. 21st century additions like a Facebook page, an Instagram profile and a smart phone often end up doing more damage to a budding relationship than good. These days we are more connected than ever, but that regularly pushes a potential partner further away. Smart phones and social media often cause nightmare for men and women on dates (picture posed by models) On a date in the 1990s, the biggest fails a person could be responsible for were a lack of conversation, food in the teeth or a man asking the woman to split the bill. Nowadays, the man or woman is also likely to try and photograph their food or keep checking their phone at the table. Girls are often caught out spending too much time in the bathroom, while they compare notes on their evening with friends as their date is sat back at the table. And after the evening is over both parties can fall foul of the temptation to get in touch too quickly - texting within hours of the meeting or checking out the other person's Facebook profile immediately. While on a date it is considered rude to leave your phone on the table  (picture posed by models) To save the embarrassment of being chucked before the relationship has heated up because of your addiction to technology, Blu e-cigarettes have listed the top ten ways to avoid showing yourself up. They include leaving conversations about the dating app Tinder to evenings with your friends, and checking with a potential boyfriend or girlfriend before changing your relationship on Facebook. - Keep phones off the dining table; your date wants to see your face, not your screen. - Don’t be tempted to take a snap of your food for instagram - it will look like you’re more interested in your followers than your date. - Refrain from ‘checking in’ your location online too; it could easily turn into a ‘live-tweet’ scenario or worse, a ‘helpful’ friend might drop by to see how it’s going. - Keep it offline; immediately changing your relationship status on Facebook if the date’s gone well is a sure-fire way to scare off your date. - If it goes really well, it might be time to move the chat away from text; take it to the next level and give them a call a few days after the date. - Do keep your taxi app handy in case you need to make a quick exit from a date disaster and you don’t have any cash . - If you must update your friends on how the date’s going, use snapchat – it won’t leave any evidence! - Don’t brag about the number of matches you’ve had on Tinder, they won’t appreciate it . - Don’t assume your date will find that funny cat meme as hilarious as your friends did! - And finally, leave the Google Glass at home, as recording your companion for post-date analysis isn’t likely to get you a second date .","Social media and smart phones cause a minefield of problems while dating .

"A waitress on a zero-hours contract who kept silent over her boss groping her because she feared her hours would be cut has won a £20,000 payout at an employment tribunal. Lucy Southern, who worked behind the bar at the hotel owned by Britannia Hotels in Leeds, was quizzed about her sex life and asked whether she wore stockings in bed by her line manager Alex Nkoroi. She complained in August 2013 but nothing was done and in October, Nkoroi began touching her, slapping her bottom and kissing her on the neck. Lucy Southern worked for Britannia Hotels and claims she quizzed about her sex life and groped by her line manager Alex Nkoroi . She also claimed he stood behind her to 'grind' up and down her back, simulating sex. He later stroked her back and prodded her in a private area with a pen, the hearing was told. At a meeting with the hotel manager, James Whittaker she told him: 'I didn't want to say anything in case he gave me less shifts. 'I feel like I have to get on with him so that I get my hours.' Ms Southern, who was 22 at the time and no longer works at the hotel, added: 'If I take back what I said about Alex I can just get my hours back can't I?' In the judgement of the panel, which found both Nkoroi and Brittania Hotels guilty of sex discrimination by way of harassment but cleared them of indirect sex discrimination, the tribunal stated: 'The claimant was a casual member of staff. 'She had a zero hours contract and it was certainly her belief whether right or wrong that the second respondent (Nkoroi) would be able to influence the number of hours that she would be given to work. 'When James Whittaker had every reason to believe that a manager had engaged in repeated sexualised behaviour in the workplace, during working hours, with a subordinate member of staff, he did not think that any form of disciplinary sanction was appropriate.' After the tribunal application was lodged, the hotel reinvestigated but found only one count, the neck kissing to be proved and that Miss Southern had encouraged it. Nkoroi was then required in September last year, to attend a bullying and harassment training course. When Miss Southern appealed against the decision of the second investigation, a third investigation was undertaken, but they rejected the appeal. Nkoroi had always denied all the allegations, but at the tribunal in Leeds, after saying he was a practising Christian and swearing on the bible, he refused to deny the accusations, though he said he had forgotten some and that some of the touching might have been accidental. He added that he may have had a conversation with her about her sexual practises but that it would have been in the context of a discussion about his religious beliefs. The panel added: 'We have no hesitation in concluding that the events complained of by Miss Southern occurred.' An employment tribunal at the City Exchange in Leeds, pictured, ordered Britannia Hotels to pay Miss Southern £19,500 in compensation for injury to her feelings . It emerged at the hearing that Miss Southern suffers long-term mental health problems, but had made her employer and Nkoroi aware of it. The panel added: 'There can be no doubt that the claimant perceived such conduct to be humiliating, to have been degrading and to have violated her dignity. 'The other circumstances of the case of relevance are her age, her mental health history and the fragility that the illness was likely to cause and the fact that the perpetrator was a manager in a position, as she believed, to determine what work would be offered to her. 'She took great offence at being touched. She tells us it made her feel dirty and angry. She felt trapped. She felt that she did not know how to handle the situation.' They added: 'We cannot identify what Mr Nkoroi's purpose was in behaving in that way and to be charitable towards him he may not have appreciated the extent of the upset that he was causing although, as a manager, if he had had any worthwhile equality training, it should have been self evident that what he was doing was simply wrong.' The tribunal awarded her £19,500 compensation for injury to her feelings, explaining: 'Where persistent harassment over a period of eight months has occurred, substantial compensation is likely to be justified but where the employer then has the means of addressing the problem, but wholly fails to do so in relation to a process that takes another year to complete, the impact upon this claimiant was clearly likely to be magnified. 'It cannot be underestimated how the claimant must have felt when she was and indeed has continued to be persistently disbelieved.'","Lucy Southern, 23, worked behind the bar at the Britannia Hotel in Leeds .

"John Sutton Jr has spent the first Saturday of May the same way since he was 8 years old - on the sidelines of the Kentucky Derby. To commemorate his dedication to horse racing, Churchill Downs - the track that hosts the race every year - is inviting the 84-year-old man to attend his 76th-straight Kentucky Derby as their special guest on May 2. This week, Sutton invited a reporter from WAVE 3 into the Louisville home he shares with his wife of 61 years Doris, where she spoke about his very first Derby and showed off his impressive collection of racing memorabilia. Scroll down for video . Dedicated: Churchill Downs is inviting John Sutton Jr, 84, to attend the Kentucky Derby as their special guest on May 2, since he has attended every race for the past 76 years . Winner, winner: Sutton was just 8 years old in 1940 when his father brought him to his first race, and the two bet against the favorite on a horse called Gallahadion, which ended up winning the race . Among the masses: Above, a view of the crowds at Churchill Downs on the day of the 1940 race . Sutton says he was just 8 years old in 1940 when his blacksmith father brought him to his first Kentucky Derby. 'Once the race started, we would crash the gates, so to speak to get on the rail or wherever we could get,' Sutton recalled. That year, Sutton and his father decided to bet on the horse Gallahadion, instead of the favorite, Bimelech. And to their delight, Gallahadion pulled through to an unexpected victory that helped cement Sutton's love for the sport. Living history: Sutton has collected a program from every Kentucky Derby he has attended and keeps them in a binder at home. Above, some of the early years . Through the years: The Derby programs got more and more colorful over the years . Keepsakes: In addition to programs, Sutton has Kentucky Derby glasses stretching back more than seven decades . Autographs: Sutton got jockeys to sign several of his programs, which he proudly displays in frames at home . Entry: Above, some of the tickets Sutton has collected from the Kentucky Derby since 1940 . An eye for champions: Sutton won $600 dollars in 19567, when he bet on the winning horse Proud Clarion. Proud Clarion and jockey Bobby Ussery pictured above after placing first at Churchill Downs . Every year since then, Sutton has attended the Kentucky Derby and has collected each year's program since then, which he keeps in a binder at home. He also has kept a collection of his tickets, Derby glasses from the more than seven decades he has attended the race as well as pins and and other programs signed by jockeys. In his early years attending the Derby, Sutton says the day involved a bit of hard work going around to each betting window to buy tickets for his parents, and picking them up snacks for the main event on the way back. But he continues to come back year after year, placing his bets by averaging the past performances of the horses competing. That method won him one of his biggest prizes in 1967, when the then 35-year-old Sutton placed his money on winning horse Proud Clarion and got $600 in return. 'There's nothing like having a winning ticket,' he said, 'You just all of a sudden get smarter you know.'

"Children's soft toys act as a reservoir for bacteria and bring germs into hospitals, scientists have warned. A team of researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee explored how best to minimise the risk of infection after surgery. They note that despite hand washing and other protocols, surgical-site infections continue to pose a problem. Children's toys could act as a reservoir for bacteria and bring germs into hospitals, scientists at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, have warned . The researchers concluded this implied one of two scenarios. Firstly, that current infection prevention methods are not effective. And secondly that there are alternative sources of bacterial exposure to the surgical wound. Their study revealed that soft toys brought into the operating theatre by children served as a breeding ground for bacteria. They urged parents to be aware of the dangers comfort items could pose, and take steps to eradicate the risk. Dr Jonathan Schoenecker and his team aimed to investigate if cuddly toys contribute to surgical-site infections. They swabbed stuffed animals that were brought into hospital by children ahead of surgery. The findings revealed that all those soft toys swabbed showed bacterial growth. In addition, the researchers demonstrated that a single wash and dry cycle at home, followed by sealing the toy in a plastic bag for 24 hours, effectively 'sterilised' 79 per cent of those soft toys tested. Researchers urged parents to wash and sterilise their child's toys before bringing them into the operating theatre, to help minimise the risk of their child suffering a surgical-site infection . The study report states: 'These results indicate that items of comfort, such as stuffed animals, brought into the operating room with a benevolent purpose may represent a reservoir of bacteria that could lead to unwanted surgical-site infections. 'Washing an item of comfort one day before surgery effectively sterilises that item.' The researchers note that future studies will be needed to determine the correlation between stuffed animals that test positive for bacteria and surgical-site infections. Another area to look at is whether giving a child a 'sterile' soft toy reduces the risk of surgical-site infections.","Scientists at Vanderbilt University explored how to reduce infection risk .

"A British former car mechanic who joined the Islamic State as an explosives expert and sniper has shared chilling images of his new high-tech bomb-making factory in Syria. Hamayun Tariq, a divorced 37-year-old who was born and raised in Dudley in the West Midlands, shared four images on Twitter of a room where he claims to make devices known as IEDs. Components are seen organised on shelves and instruction manuals and bomb-making equipment neatly laid out on work surfaces in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state'. Scroll down for video . Well-equipped: British former car mechanic Hamayun Tariq -  who joined the Islamic State as an explosives expert and sniper - has shared chilling images of his new high-tech bomb-making factory in Syria . Boastful: Components are seen organised on shelves in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state' Tariq's social media presence rarely last longer than a few days before being suspended as he specialises in posting detailed instructions on how to build bombs. Despite already doing the same on his latest account, the militant has been able to share images of his bomb-making factory, where he boastfully claims to spend time 'producing sophisticated IEDs'. Terror: Hamayun Tariq is a divorced, 37-year-old father-of-two who was born and raised in Dudley . Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their function. He clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory. After posting photographs of his 'laboratory', the jihadi wrote on Twitter: 'IEDs is my favourite weapon after Sniping, u hit the enemy & disappear in thin air just like a Ghost. Its a Must'. Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria late last year. Shortly after joining the terrorist group he began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' still living in the West to carry out deadly bomb attacks. Tariq has previously posted under various Twitter handles but he is usually suspended rarely quickly thanks to bomb-making guides and sickening calls for terror attacks in the UK. He regularly posted photographs of handwritten instructions explaining how to assemble crude explosive devices and listing the chemicals needed to create deadly poisons. Chilling: Hamayun Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their functionality . Sick: Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria last year. He soon began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' to carry out deadly bomb attacks . ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian . Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren’t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. Tariq's Twitter rants appear to have been in retaliation for him allegedly having his British passport revoked in 2013. One of his most widely shared messages was a sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message was page after page of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. Tariq previously claimed to have encountered up to 40 other British nationals in his first seven weeks as an ISIS fighter in Syria, according to the Guardian, who spoke to him via Twitter's private messaging function on a now disabled account. Describing himself as 'really happy' to have joined the terror group, he reportedly added that he had also met a 'fixer' who was smuggling 1,000 new recruits into ISIS-held areas of Syria every week. He reportedly told the newspaper that he first embraced radical Islam in 2000. Tariq was arrested for fraud in Wolverhampton in 2005 but fled to Pakistan to avoid the case going to trial. He was deported back to Britain two years later and served three and a half years in prison. He claims to have left Britain immediately after his release in 2012 and moved to the Waziristan region of north west Pakistan, where he joined the local Taliban branch. Expensive: Hamayun Tariq clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory . One of Tariq's most widely shared messages was this sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message posted on this long-disabled account was a copy of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook . In September or early October Tariq is understood to have been contacted by ISIS fixers who paid for his transport to join the terror group in Syria. He was trained as a sniper before moving on to specialise in explosives - a subject he has been interested in since studying for a GCSE in Science in the mid-1990s. Tariq described his new life under ISIS as far more comfortable than that in Pakistan. 'Life was tough in Waziristan but here I can't believe I get a salary, I get rent. They even paid for my transport. I'm really happy here and all the guys I've met from the UK are also happy and settled,' he was quoted as saying. The Home Office would not speak about Tariq's claim that his passport had been cancelled, saying they could not comment on individual cases. However they did add that in a broader sense any individual who has conducted himself 'in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK' can have their citizenship revoked. The Home Office has said there are at least 500 Britons fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, although a number of experts believe the real figure is likely to greatly exceed that.","Hamayun Tariq, 37, shared four images of the factory on his Twitter page .

"Rain, wind and a bone-chilling cold confronted all the runners of Monday's Boston Marathon. But after 20 grueling hours on the course, Maickel Melamed overcame another obstacle - a rare form of muscular dystrophy that makes it hard for him to just walk or move - to finally cross the finish line. Melamed, 39, may have come in last place in the 26.2-mile race, but  his story touched a city now famous for its own iron-clad will after the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. Scroll down for video . Maickel Melamed, 39, crossed the Boston Marathon finish line after 20 grueling hours in the rain and cold . Melamed has a rare form of muscular dystrophy that makes it hard just to move or walk, but he didn't let that stop him from finishing his fifth marathon at 5am Tuesday morning . 'After 20 hours of rain, wind and cold, Boston is still strong,' the Venezuelan athlete said on Tuesday as he was honored at City Hall. 'The whole city has been so helpful and loving. The message here is that love is so much stronger than death. It was an honor to run the streets of this city.' Melamed walked the race with Vamos, a volunteer team from Caracas, as well as his physical trainers and dozens of friends and supporters who were there to watch him finish the race at 5am Tuesday morning. The athlete, who has completed four other marathons, said Boston's hilly track became especially tough around mile 24, but his physical trainers found a way to keep him going. 'I'd rest 10 seconds, then take four to six steps,' Melamed said. 'It was a real exciting way to finish.' When Melamed needed to rest, collapsing into his group's arms, they would push him back up and count his every step, according to CBS Boston. The athlete, who has completed four other marathons, said Boston's hilly track became especially tough around mile 24, but his physical trainers found a way to keep him going . Boston Mayor Marty Walsh presented a medal to Melamed and called his story 'truly one of inspiration' And as the inspirational athlete inched closer and closer to the finish line, his supporters were cheering him on and yelling 'Si se puede, si se puede!',  which is Spanish for 'yes, we can!' It was Melamed's desire to prove to others that they could achieve their dreams that kept him going. 'You have to know why you're doing it, because in the last mile, the marathon will ask you if you have a reason, and if you don't have it, you will quit,' he told MassLive.com. 'Raise the bar of your own expectations for yourself. Human power is infinite.' There was a special reason why Melamed, who has completed races in Chicago, New York, Berlin and Tokyo, decided Boston would be the location of his last marathon. It was at Boston Children's Hospital that Melamed, who was only given seven days to live when he was born, had a life-saving operation. Now the athlete, who has also parachuted, paraglided and climbed Venezuela's highest mountain, must retire his running shoes because of the races' physical toll. But his story, which Boston Mayor Marty Walsh called 'truly one of inspiration,' will continue racing on.","Maickel Melamed, 39, finished the race at 5am on Tuesday morning .

"David Cameron will today promise extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs. In a speech on the economy, the Prime Minister will say the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured, will today announce an extra 600,000 childcare spaces at a cost of £350 million . Mr Cameron, pictured, will tell the audience that the Conservative Party wants to reward hard work . ‘For many second earners, work didn’t pay because the cost of childcare was so high. So we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds and disadvantaged two-year-olds. ‘In the next Parliament we will double that for three- and four-year-olds. That’ s right – 30 hours of free childcare a week – worth £5,000 to working families. ‘That means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year – nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs – all by 2017.’ Mr Cameron will also argue ‘that true compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance’. The Conservatives inherited a ‘shocking situation’ where ‘some of the poorest people faced some of the highest marginal rates of taxation’ and couples ‘were spending as much on childcare as one of them took home in earnings’. ‘We, the Conservative Party, have been using all the tools at our disposal – the tax and benefit system; childcare and the minimum wage, to turn that around. This goes to the heart of the country we are trying to build: one based on the principle of something for something, not something for nothing – where those who put in, get out, where hard work is rewarded – where we make work pay. ‘I’ve said it before: I’m not in this job to be some high powered accountant. I don’t just want the lines on the graph to go in the right direction. I want lives to go in the right direction. I believe passionately in reducing poverty. And the best route out of poverty is this: work. ‘We’ve proved that. Since we came to power – since we’ve got more people working than in our history – there are 600,000 fewer people and 300,000 fewer children in relative poverty.’ The new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage. The new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under £350 million a year.","David Cameron will announce the new £350 million childcare places today .

"Not content to just sell other manufacturers phones and mobile plans, Carphone Warehouse is launching a network of its own. Called iD, the mobile network will launch in May and offer free roaming in 22 countries including the US, Australia and across Europe. The firm's boss told MailOnline the aim is to offer features that customers want, including 12-month contracts and affordable 4G handsets. Carphone Warehouse's mobile network launches in May and will offer free roaming in 22 countries, including the US, Australia and across Europe. The firm's boss told MailOnline the aim is to offer features that customers want, including 12-month contracts and affordable 4G handsets . When iD launches next month it will offer the most comprehensive range of roaming countries, ahead of Three with 18 countries and Lyca on 17. Carphone Warehouse's iD will use Three's existing infrastructure to offer these networks and plans. 'Carphone Warehouse is unique because we speak to more customers across the networks than anyone else. This gives us a unique customer insight,' UK and Ireland chief executive Graham Stapleton told MailOnline. The iD network (logo pictured) will use Three's existing infrastructure to offer networks and plans . 'They tell us what could be better across the whole of the industry and iD is based on that insight; giving customers what they want. 'We're building this network from scratch and are using the latest technology to connect and build iD, and because tech is moving so quickly we've been able to come up with something innovative and different.' He said that at launch Carphone Warehouse is creating a platform for the network and in 'two to three months' time [it] will launch products that no-one else will have.' But Mr Stapleton wouldn't reveal what these will be in order to maintain a competitor advantage over rival networks. He continued that the aim is to have all the handsets it currently sells available on the network. 'The reason we are putting 12-month contracts and deals out there is that there is no-one else offering such 12 month contracts and our customers said it was a feature they wanted,' he continued. iD won't the only network to offer 12-month contracts, though. Vodafone, for example, has a range of contracts that start at £9.50 a month. When iD launches it will offer the most comprehensive range of roaming countries, shown in the graph above. This will put it ahead of Three with 18 countries and Lyca on 17 . Carphone Warehouse's boss Graham Stapleton said the iD website will launch tomorrow, where people can register their interest. The full range of plans will be announced as they become available, but an example  offers the Samsung A3 (shown) on a 12-month 4G plan with 300 mins, 5000 texts and 1 GB data for £19.50 . In terms of next steps, Mr Stapleton said the website will launch tomorrow where people can register their interest, and the network as a platform will launch in May - although he didn't give an exact date. Two months after it announced it was launching its own mobile network, Google is now said to be looking at ways to get rid of roaming fees. The tech giant is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. It will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah and Google is working with network operators on developing the cellular plan. The firm will also be launching an app to manage billing and then new features will be announced during the summer that Mr Stapleton described as 'just fantastic and very innovative.' The full range of plans and offers will be announced as they become available, but an example plan offers the Samsung A3 on a 12-month 4G plan with 300 mins, 5,000 texts and 1 GB data for £19.50. 'This is just the beginning,' added Mr Stapleton. 'We know that there are lots more customer issues and frustrations with existing mobile plans that we're eager to tackle. 'We want this network to be focused on the individual and we will continue to listen to customers over the coming months, asking them to help develop and evolve iD.' Other features include controls and caps to help people prevent 'Bill Shock' - surprise costs and fees added to their account. iD is the first major initiative from Dixons Carphone and will be available to customers via all Carphone Warehouse, Currys and PC World stores, as well as online. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline: 'It's quite a coup that iD piggybacks off Three's network given that Carphone Warehouse hasn't offered any deals from the network in years. Perhaps iD Mobiles was the olive branch. 'The promise of 12-month contracts is likely to be a major win with mobile users who crave flexibility - we know that because of the rising popularity of SIM-only deals. 'But iD's success all hinges on how keenly these shorter contracts are priced. We eagerly await more concrete details, in terms of cost and the full range of handsets that will be offered.' Carphone Warehouse is the latest firm to launch its own network. In January Sky announced plans to launch its own network, powered by O2.

"A Saturday Night Live skit about a male student having sex with his female high school teacher painted the relationship as every teen boy's dream, but drew a firestorm of criticism on social media. The reaction to the comedy sketch reflected a growing view among law enforcement and victims' advocacy groups that it is no laughing matter when a woman educator preys on her male students. In U.S. schools last year, almost 800 school employees were prosecuted for sexual assault, nearly a third of them women. New Jersey high school English teacher Nicole Dufault, left, stands accused of sexual relationships with six teenage boys, while Kathryn Ronk, right, a Spanish teacher at Bishop Foley High School in Michigan got up to 15 years in prison for having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy . The proportion of women facing charges seems to be higher than in years past, when female teachers often got a pass, said Terry Abbott, a former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Education, who tracked the cases. This year's numbers are already slightly ahead of last year with 26 cases of female school employees accused of inappropriate relationships with male students in January compared to 19 cases the previous January. Female educators who sexually abuse their students are facing tougher prosecution in part because there are more women police officers. There is also a greater awareness among prosecutors, judges and the general public that students who are victimized by an authority figure, regardless of gender, experience trauma with life-long consequences. 'Law enforcement is increasingly feminized, and women are much less prone to the old attitude: ""Oh, this is just some kid who got lucky,'"" said David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center. 'They recognize the issues involved and they go after women who violate the statutes.' A recent Saturday Night Live skit about a male student having sex with his female high school teacher painted the relationship as every teen boy's dream, but drew a firestorm of criticism on social media . The Twitter furor ignited by the April SNL skit in which a male judge fist-bumps a boy who had sex with his 'hot' teacher indicates how attitudes are changing . Depression, low-self esteem and difficulty maintaining future relationships are among the long-term consequences that male victims face, according to experts. Those problems are sometimes compounded by confusion and guilt over whether they are actually victims since their adolescent bodies involuntarily respond to physical contact. Child abuse experts agree it appears female teachers are being prosecuted more vigorously than in the past. The crackdown is the result of 'two seismic shifts,' said Christopher Anderson, executive director of Male Survivor, the largest U.S. advocacy organization for male sex-crime victims. Pennsylvanian math teacher Erica Ann Ginnetti, 35, was sentenced to 30 days in jail for having sex with a 17-year-old student. The male judge said, 'What young man would not jump on that candy?' 'One is a recognition that it does not matter who the perpetrator is or what the circumstances are. A teacher has absolutely no business engaging in sexual contact with a student,' Anderson said. 'The second is a shift in the culture where boys and their parents are feeling empowered to come forward to say that something has been done.' In recent weeks, a Stamford, Connecticut high school English teacher, Danielle Watkins, 32, whose case was prosecuted by a female state's attorney, was sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for having sex with an underage male student. In Michigan, a female judge sentenced Kathryn Ronk, 30, a Spanish teacher at Bishop Foley High School in Madison Heights, to up to 15 years in prison for having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy, saying 'the law does not recognize a double standard.' In New Jersey, a female prosecutor said the most lenient plea deal she would offer Nicole Dufault, 35, a Columbia High School English teacher accused of sexual relationships with six teenage boys, was 15 years in prison. There are contrary examples, such as Pennsylvania's Erica Ann Ginnetti, 35, the Lower Moreland High School math teacher who had sex with a 17-year-old student and was sentenced to 30 days in jail by a male judge who said, 'What young man would not jump on that candy?' That was after a female prosecutor reportedly said in court that the victim's senior year became a nightmare, his grades plunged and he still struggles with social interactions. But the Twitter furor ignited by the April SNL skit in which a male judge fist-bumps a boy who had sex with his 'hot' teacher indicates how attitudes are changing. 'Appalled by the #SNL sketch glorifying sexual abuse of a male student by female teacher. Sends the worst message &minimizes real experiences,' tweeted Heather Timmis @hnt108. An SNL spokesperson declined to comment. There is no central U.S. reporting system for tracking female teachers who prey on male students, according to federal education officials, but Abbott has been charting the crimes from news coverage. His research showed that female teachers far more often than male teachers use social media to lure students, creating an electronic 'paper trail' that may aid prosecutions. School districts are increasingly moving to ban private social media contact between teachers and students, sometimes in an effort to prevent inappropriate relationships. 'Social media enables the behavior to start,' Abbott said. 'There is no way that a teacher is going to walk up to a kid in the hallway and say, ""Hey, would you like to see a naked picture of me?"" They won't do it. But they will do that on social media. It's like it erases what used to be that barrier.'","According to the U.S. Department of Education, female teachers who sexually assaulted students often got a pass in the past .

"It is the radio format that has delivered the latest chart hits, news and talk shows in stereo to homes around the world for decades. But now the characteristic hiss of interference that accompanies most FM broadcasts is set to fall silent. Norway has announced that it will be the the first country in the world to switch off its FM radio signal. Twiddling the knobs of a radio will no longer be necessary  as analogue services switch off in favour of digital . The Norwegian Government said it will turn off its FM transmitters on January 11 2017. Now with the ever expanding number of digital radio services and growing numbers of people choosing to listen to internet radio, it seems likely other countries will follow Norway's example. The UK had planned to switch off its own FM service by 2018 but the plans were later shelved following objections from commercial radio stations. It is now not expected to happen until sometime after 2020 when digital listeners are expected to outstrip those using analogue stations. Streaming has topped CD sales in revenue for the first time in the United States as music listeners flock to on-demand services and Internet radio, industry figures showed. Data for 2014 showed a major shift to streaming as opposed to physical sales and permanent downloads, with rapid growth both for on-demand services such as Spotify and Rhapsody and Internet radio providers such as Pandora. Streaming revenue totaled $1.87 billion, edging out the $1.85 billion earned by CD sales, according to data of the Recording Industry Association of America. Streaming helped stabilize the bottom line for the long-troubled industry, with overall revenue from recorded music going up two percent to $4.86 billion to mark the fourth year of growth. Listening figures currently show that digital radios account for 37.9% of all listening hours in the UK. In the US, around 85% of American adults still listen to AM/FM stations. Norway, however, has just five national FM broadcasting outlets while there are 22 national digital radio stations. The Norwegian government said there was space for a further 20 digital radio stations and NRK, Norway's public service broadcaster, will be the first to switch off its FM service. The Norwegian Ministry of Culture estimates that the switch to digital radio could save £17 million a year (NOK 200 million). Thorhild Widvey, the country's minister of culture, said: 'Radio digitisation will open the door to a far greater range of radio channels, benefiting listeners across the country. 'Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality. 'Digitisation will also greatly improve the emergency preparedness system, facilitate increased competition and offer new opportunities for innovation and development. Digital radios, like  above, might look retro but can give listeners access to more stations than ever before . Growing numbers of car stereos now come with digital radio as standard, leading to a drop in FM listeners . 'More than half the population already has access to local radio on DAB, and there is considerable potential for further local channels.' The switch off of FM services could create other problems - leaving millions of households with legacy electronics unable to pick up a signal. FM radio, which was first invented in 1933, transmits information by modulating the frequency of the carrier wave. This produces a high quality analogue signal that travels over short distances but can be prone to interference. FM radio became the popular way to transmit stereo broadcasts and it also became hugely popular with pirate radio stations. Digital radio by comparison uses digital modulation - compressing the audio signal into a specific bandwidth spectrum. This allows more radio stations to be crammed into the bandwidth space and can produce clearer reception.","Norway will be the first country in the world to stop radio broadcasts on FM .
It says it will save £17 million a year by the switch to a purely digital service .
The decision was driven by rise in popularity of digital and internet radio .
Other countries are expected to follow as numbers of FM listener drop ."
"Tesla has confirmed it will unveil a revolutionary power pack for the home next week. The California firm said it will announce a 'home battery' and a 'very large utility scale battery' in a letter sent to investors. While products such as this already exist, founder Elon Musk thinks they 'suck', according to Tesla's investor relations director, Jeff Evanson. Scroll down for video . The California firm said it will announce a 'home battery' and a 'very large utility scale battery' in a letter sent to investors. The company already offers battery packs (pictured) for its SolarCity project, but it is unclear whether the latest product will build on this design . There are a number of home battery packs on the market. Most work by powering up overnight when electricity rates are cheaper. Users can then switch them on during the day to use the home during the day. They can be used as back up power in the case of an emergency, or be used to hold power from renewable energy sources. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said . Musk announced the event last month in a cryptic tweet that said there will be a launch of a 'major' new line of products that is 'not a car'. The event will be held at Tesla's Hawthorne, California, Design Studio on April 30 at 8pm. PT. '[At the event] we will explain the advantages of our solutions and why past battery options were not compelling,' the company said. Home batteries power up overnight when electricity rates are cheaper. Users can then switch them on during the day to use the home during the day. In February, Musk said their version of a home battery would be ready for a public debut within months and that it should start going into production by the summer. It is likely to build on the power packs used in Tesla's range of electric cars such as the Model S. 'We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people's houses or businesses fairly soon,' Mr Musk told analysts earlier this year. 'We have the design done, and it should start going into production in about six months or so.' He didn't reveal what a home battery would be used for, but it could act as a generator during a power cut, for example. While products such as these already exist, founder Elon Musk (left) thinks they 'suck', according to Tesla's investor relations director, Jeff Evanson. On the right is an image of a Tesla residential battery being installed . Tesla's billionaire founder last month fuelled speculation by saying it 'not a car' and added the product will be revealed at the company's California, Design Studio on April 30 at 8 p.m. PT . But at a conference last year, Tesla's Stationary Energy Storage Director Arch Padmanabhan revealed some of Tesla's initial plans. The Mirai features the Toyota Fuel Cell System, which combines fuel cell technology with hybrid technology. The firm said it can serve as a 'high capacity power supply during emergencies'. The Mirai converts the DC power from the CHAdeMO power socket in the boot to AC power, using an attachment. Toyota calls it a vehicle-to-home system. Tesla's home battery could work in a similar way, or be a standalone battery. This included a 400 kWh commercial/utility battery for large buildings and a 10 kilo-Watt hour residential battery. Rival car manufacturer Toyota already uses a hydrogen fuel cell in its Mirai car that can be removed and used to power a home. According to the Japanese car maker, the battery can supply electric power to an average home for a week. Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a 'Gigafactory' designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes. Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this. These batteries 3ft tall (0.9 metres), and can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. Tesla would not comment on whether the new batteries will work in the same way. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said .","Event will be held at Tesla's California Studio on April 30 at 8pm PT .

'The items are from a lady who collected handbags, shoes and clothes throughout her lifetime and just enjoyed buying and owning them.' As seen before... a flat version of the blue Milano Blahnik Hangsi pumps Carrie wore when marrying Big in Sex And The City are part of the haul .

'Some of them come with their receipts - which show that they were purchased for £2,000 - and are still in the bags they came in. 'There's 50 handbags and the condition is outstanding. It looks like some of them were bought and never used. 'We've got items ranging from £300 into the thousands. 'The owner would buy a bag in a particular colour when it came out and then buy it in another colour a month or so later, or buy matching Jimmy Choos. 'There's probably in excess of 50 pairs of shoes, and they are in immaculate condition too, hardly worn. 'Then we've got about 20 lots of designer clothing and the rest is accessories. Bag it: A Gucci cream monogrammed canvas and leather tote bag, comes complete with dust bag . Up for grabs: Louis Vuitton monogram canvas Speedy 30, and a lady's Ferragamo jungle print handbag . 'This is never going to come up again. It's a true one-off and a privilege to be asked to hold the auction. 'I think it's quite unusual for things like this to go without a reserve, but because the proceeds are going to charity, everything has to be sold, so will go to the highest bidder on the day. 'It's such a genuine sale, it's not a sale that has been put together, the items are being sold for a reason. And it's a chance for people to get something in immaculate order. 'We're expecting in excess of 100 people on the day. We've got a reasonable-sized premises so we will cope fine with the extra, but we normally only have about 50 people at a sale.'

"Former tech executive Carly Fiorina is set to become the second woman in the 2016 White House hunt – if a report published Wednesday afternoon is accurate. The onetime Hewlett-Packard CEO will launch a formal campaign . on May 4, according to The Wall Street Journal. But Fiorina spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told Daily Mail Online that it's just a rumor at this point. 'I am not confirming the WSJ story,' Flores said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CAMPAIGN-IN-WAITING: Carly Fiorina spoke Tuesady at a public library in Council Bluffs, Iowa, in the state whose presidential primary caucuses can make or break a candidacy . HEAR ME ROAR: Fiorina spoke at the Republican Leadership Summit on Saturday in Nashua, New Hampshire . SHOWDOWN: Republican Fiorina (left) wants to be the conservative balance to Democrat Hillary Clinton (right) when Americans consider electing their first female president . Fiorina would be the fourth Republican in the presidential race, following Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida. Retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson is also expected to announce his candidacy on May 4 in Detroit. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is scheduled to throw his hat in the ring on May 5 in Hope, Arkansas, the town of former president Bill Clinton's birth. Fiorina also has a book scheduled for release on May 5. 'Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey' is expected to be a business memoir that positions her as a practical problem-solver who knows how to unlock Americans' hidden potential. She is also making the rounds in the same early presdiential primary states where other likely presidential hopefuls have turned up. Fiorina was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Wednesday, according to her Twitter account, signing books. Yesterday she was in Council Bluffs speaking to supporters at a public library. FIorina's next book is due in stores on May 5, just 24 hours after her reported presdiential-launch date . Four days ago she spoke at the Republican Leadership Summit in Nashua, New Hampshire, answering a female conservative business leader's claim that only men should sit in the Oval Office because women are under the influence of their hormones and can't reliably control themselves. 'Not that we haven’t seen a man’s judgment clouded by hormones in the Oval Office,' she said, pointing a silent rhetorical finger at  Bill Clinton. The onetime commander-in-chief's storied sexual peccadillos – including his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky – will undoubedly return to America's front burner as his wife, Hillary Clinton, seeks the ofice he once held. Fiorina is schedule to deliver a speech in West Des Moines, Iowa, on May 7 at an event hosted by the Dallas County Republican Party. After that comes a May 8 dinner event at the New Hampshire High Tech Summit in Manchester, N.H. and a May 9 college commencement speech at Southern New Hampshire University. Fiorina has already made waves in presidential politics, responding forcefully after Clinton launched her campaign this month. In a Facebook video, she said the former secretary of state 'does not have a track record of accomplishment or transparency.' HORMONES? Fiorina said it's men like Bill Clinton – not women like her – who would have problems controlling their hormones as commander-in-chief . 'Russia is now a more powerful adversary than it was when she became secretary of state,' Fiorina said. 'Our relationship with Israel has deteriorated dramatically. The Middle East is in flames.' 'She’s not the woman for the White House.' The implication is that Fiorina is that woman. She told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that with her in the race, Clinton 'wouldn’t be able to play the gender card' or emphasize her quest to be the first female U.S. president. The former secretary of state would instead be forced to base her campaign on her accomplishments, Fiorina said, 'not identity politics.'","Former Hewlett-Packard CEO reportedly will enter presidential race May 4 .

"Summer beach season is right around the corner, and with it comes inevitably sunburned skin, several broken flip flops and maybe even a water-logged mobile phone or two. But don't let these glitches ruin your fun in the sun, surf and sand. Below, MailOnline Travel looks at the top hacks, which are sure to cure any seaside holiday struggle. When travelling this summer, there are some basic travel hacks that can help make your holiday go off without a hitch . To add a sun-kissed glow to your locks, simply squeeze lemon juice onto your strands before sitting in the sun . Naturally highlight your hair . To get that sun-kissed glow without ever entering a salon, simply squeeze citrus juice onto your hair before heading outside - it will react . Lemon is often preferred, as its known to be a great natural bleach, but orange will also work in a pinch. However, the acidity found in citrus can be quite drying to your strands, so be sure to mix in water before spritzing it on. It will lighten gradually, so don't apply too much in one go. Use it sparingly over the course of the summer months for all-natural highlights by August. Yes, it's possible to turn your trusty beach reader into a solar-charging device - simply add solar cells . Solar power your eReader . Simply consult this handy guide to turn your trusty beach companion into a solar-charging device. Essentially, by adding solar cells to your e Reader, you will make it so that you never need to plug it in to charge again. Imagine a holiday without worrying about bringing the correct adapter? The dream has now become a reality. Soothe sunburned skin with ice cubes made of aloe vera or by soaking a cloth in black or green tea . Soothe sunburns with aloe vera ice cubes . After spending a few too many hours soaking up the rays, you may find yourself looking for the ultimate skin-soothing relief. While aloe vera is the go-to solution for many, by freezing the aloe in ice cube trays, you will be able to add an extra layer of cool to your epidermis - in just an hour or less. Iced black and green tea can also be used for sunburn relief. Steep a few bags in water, soak your shirt or a face cloth in the liquid and apply to your reddened skin. Pop your water-clogged ears by inflating a balloon after getting out of the pool . Keep a balloon to hand . This may seem like an odd trick, but it's crucial for ensuring that all water is out of your ears after a long day at the pool. After your dip, simply blow up a deflated balloon. If the first time doesn't pop your clogged ears, simply inflate it again and try plugging your nose as you blow. At the beach, keep your valuables in an empty - and thoroughly cleaned - sun cream bottle . Store your valuables in an empty lotion bottle . Whether you're travelling solo and looking to take extra precautions or spending a day at the beach with friends, it's important to keep your valuables out of sight. And an empty sun cream bottle is the ultimate decoy. Simply rinse out a discarded bottle thoroughly to store money, keys and anything else you might need for a relaxing day out. Swap your towel for a weighted, waterproof blanket and say goodbye to sticky sand all over your belongings . Ditch your towel . A waterproof blanket is much more effective than a towel, particularly if you're setting up camp in the sand. When towels get damp, it's nearly impossible to keep sand from sticking to them - and you - and if there's any wind whatsoever, they're nearly bound to blow away. Instead, a weighted waterproof option will stay put and dry during all your dips in the sea. The best way to ensure you don't wind up with a water-logged mobile phone is by using resealable plastic bags . Stock up on resealable bags . No need to splash out on expensive waterproof containers for your iPhone, keys and wallet - a run-of-the-mill sandwich bag will do just fine. Choose any sort of zippered or press-seal plastic bag, drop in your favourite items and put them away in your beach bag. Even if the sand kicks up or there is an unfortunate incident of a rising tide, your phone will stay dry and 100 per cent operational. Bonus: you can still use your touch screen through the plastic coating. 1. Use buttons to transport earrings so you don't lose any en route . 2. To avoid creases, pack your clothes in plastic wrappings . 3. To avoid your shoe soles touching your clothes, place them in shower caps . 4. Stuff your shoes with socks, underwear or other small items to make the most of the space and to help them keep their shape . 5. To avoid shampoos leaking in your bag, unscrew the lid and place a small circle of cling film, or plastic wrap over the hole. Screw the lid back on to hold it in place, and eliminate all worries about bursting liquids . 6. Wrap breakables, such as perfume bottles, or a teacup if you are Miranda Kerr, in socks to protect them . 7. Keep freebie shampoos and cosmetics from hotels so you don't have to lug big bottles . 8. Alternatively store face cream and small lotions in contact lens containers to save space . 9. Wrap your belts round the outside of the suitcase, around your clothes to make use of the outside corner space . 10. Place a dryer sheet in your case to prevent odours transferring to your clothes . 11. Apply a bull clip to razors that have lost their safety lid to prevent tearing of clothes . Trying to brush sand off your sweat and water-soaked body isn't going to work without the help of baby powder . Never again will piles of sand wind up in your vehicle - simply shake on talcum powder and shake off the sand . Bring some baby powder . Believe it or not, this astringent powder is a beach bag essential. After a long day of re-applying sun cream and diving into the pool or ocean, you're bound to have fixed a great deal of sand to your limbs - and attempting to brush it off with your towel will only get you so far. For a much more effective sand solution, shake out a bit of the talcum powder onto your hand and use it to brush the sand off the rest of your body. Bread clips make a great fastener for those instances where your flip flop strap breaks off from the sole . Fix your flip flops . We've all been there: that unfortunate moment where your flip flop strap breaks off from the sole of your shoe. Thankfully, there's an easy fix to keep your feet happy for the rest of the day. Turns out that the clips used to seal and keep loaves of bread fresh actually have multiple uses and if you clip them just above the wide end of the thong, it will hold your sandal together. If you feel worried about leaving your hotel room and valuables, deter thieves by placing a Do Not Disturb sign on your door with the TV playing so it seems as if you are in there. As you leave the room, if you feel the need, vocally announce your departure, as if there were someone remaining behind and the room will not be left unattended. If the hotel does not have a safe, try some of these inventive tricks: . Leave a small amount of money in plain view so they take that and look no further. Tape an envelope with some money to the underside of empty bins means it will remain undisturbed by cleaning staff. This can also work under drawers, under desks or in the cover of ironing boards. If you are really keen to put the effort in to protect your belongings, you can also hide items inside phones or TVs where the backs can be unscrewed, or dropped in a toilet tank in a waterproof covering. To cool beverages almost instantly, wrap a wet piece of kitchen roll around the bottle and place in the fridge . Cool your beverages quickly . Planning a major outdoor bash? This life hack will serve you well from the beach to the barbecue and everywhere in between. Soak a piece of kitchen roll in water and wrap it around your drink bottle. Then, place it in the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes. Voila: a refreshing, ice-cold beverage instantly.","Add natural sun-kissed highlights to your hair with the help of lemon juice .

"Patients who are too fat could be denied routine operations to save money, a survey of health bosses has revealed. More than a third of NHS trusts are considering rationing some types of surgery and other treatments. Several have admitted they may impose 'eligibility' rules which could affect smokers as well as the overweight. More than a third of health trusts are considering rationing some types of surgery and other treatments to save money, according to a new study . The criteria for accepting patients for operations would be based on their Body Mass Index, which measures obesity. When senior managers at 67 Clinical Commissioning Groups – local health trusts – were asked, 39 per cent said they were planning to 'limit access' to routine treatment for financial reasons. Procedures affected include varicose vein treatment, hip and knee replacement, and breast reduction surgery. Others said smokers might be denied some treatments, most commonly IVF. Senior doctors criticised the plans and accused health managers of denying patients vital treatment simply because they were considered to be 'undeserving'. Dr David Paynton, of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'Decisions about whether our patients are eligible for surgery or treatment need to be made on a case-by-case basis and by whether surgery will benefit a patient's long-term physical and mental health. 'It should not be the role of CCGs to impose blanket bans on patients' access to surgery, nor to decide who is and who is not deserving of potentially life-saving treatments based on their lifestyle choices. Obese patients could be denied varicose vein treatment, hip and knee replacement, pictured, and breast reduction surgery, while smokers could be banned from having IVF on the NHS . 'Of course, some procedures cannot be performed on patients who are above a certain weight. 'In these cases, a clinical decision needs to be made about whether surgery would be beneficial if the patient lost weight – but this is a separate issue.' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: 'Each case must be individually assessed and each decision must be ethical and in the best interests of the patient. 'It is easy to target vulnerable patients and we must be very careful not to unfairly discriminate against people who aren't always able to speak out.' A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'If health bodies stop patients from having treatments on the basis of cost alone, then we will take action against them.' There are 211 CCGs in England so the survey by the Health Service Journal covered just under a third. Last year, a CCG in Devon threatened to ban all non-urgent treatments for anyone severely obese with a BMI above 35. This is equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman of 16st or a 6ft man being 18st 13lb. After an outcry, the policy was dropped. A survey by GP magazine last month found that 80 per cent of CCGs ration at least one procedure to patients who are very obese. Doctors have blamed excess sugar and carbohydrates for the surge in obesity – not the lack of exercise. They said poor diet was now recognised as being responsible for more disease than physical inactivity, alcohol and smoking combined. Yet, said the experts led by cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, the public wrongly believed that obesity was due to a sedentary lifestyle. The doctors claimed that obesity has rocketed in the past 30 years, despite little change in physical activity levels. ‘This places the blame for our expanding waistlines directly on the type and amount of calories consumed,’ said Dr Malhotra. ‘Let us bust the myth of physical inactivity and obesity. You cannot outrun a bad diet.’ In the British Journal Of Sports Medicine, the doctors added that the ‘false perception’ on the cause of obesity stems from corporate marketing ‘chillingly similar’ to that used by the tobacco industry. They cited Coca-Cola associating its products with sport ‘suggesting it is OK to consume their drinks as long as you exercise’. Dr Malhotra, who works at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, is an adviser to the campaign group Action on Sugar. Around two-thirds of Britons are overweight or obese. The Government’s obesity adviser Professor Susan Jebb said the doctors failed to note that the best way to lose weight was combining a better diet with physical activity. ‘Rather than trade one off against the other – sugar vs fat, diet vs activity, individual vs population – we need to take action across the full range,’ she added. Tackling obesity without addressing physical activity was ‘tying one hand behind our backs’ said the professor. ‘It makes good sense to seek to change both diet and activity behaviours.’","More than a third of health trusts are considering rationing some surgery .

"President Barack Obama will once again stop short of calling the 1915 massacre of Armenians a genocide, prompting anger and disappointment from those who have been pushing him to use the politically fraught term. As a candidate for president in 2008, Obama promised to use the term to describe the mass murder if elected but has not followed through despite calls from the most famous Armenian-American, Kim Kardashian, and the Pope for the world to recognize the killings as a genocide. Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since at least 2011 to bring awareness to the genocide. She last week traveled to the country for the first time with her husband Kanye West, sister Khloe and cousins Kara and Kourtni Kardashian. 'An emotional day at the genocide museum,' read a tweet posted by Kim that was accompanied by a photo of her and Khloe laying flowers at the Dzidzernagapert Armenian Genocide monument’s eternal flame. Scroll down for video . Tricky language: President Barack Obama (pictured Tuesday) will be sending an administration official to Armenia this week, to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by Ottoman Turks. But the White House still refuses to call the mass killings of ethnic Armenians a 'genocide' for fear of offending ally Turkey . Slaughter: Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I. Above, Armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre . Kim Kardashian, in red, and Khloe Kardashian, in blue, walk in the plaza at the Armenian Genocide Memorial last week. Kim and Khloe were accompanied by their cousins Kara and Kourtni and Kim's husband Kanye West. Kim and Kholoe Kardashian's Armenian heritage comes from their father, the late Robert Kardashian . As a senator and presidential candidate, Obama did describe the killings of Armenians as genocide. But he has never used that description since taking office, mainly out of deference to Turkey, a key U.S. partner. Top administration officials discussed the decision with Armenian-American leaders Tuesday. The White House said U.S. officials pledged to Armenian-American leaders that the U.S. would use this week's 100th anniversary of the killings 'to urge a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts,' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word 'genocide.' Historians estimate up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks, an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide. Turkey, however, denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic-driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said yesterday he was 'deeply disappointed' by the president's decision. 'The United States has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights, for speaking out against atrocity, for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others,' said Schiff. 'This cannot be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or Congress.' Kim and Khloe laid flowers at the Dzidzernagapert genocide monument’s eternal flame during their visit . Paying their respects: Kim has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011. The Pope has also called the slaughter 'the first genocide of the 20th century' Kim and Kanye are pictured here with daughter North West and Khloe as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at Cathedral of Sts. James in the historic Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem last year for Norrie's christening . The White House said that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from Obama this year, the administration believes its approach is right, 'both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present.' The White House also announced that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew will attend a ceremony in Armenia Friday making the anniversary. 'President Obama's surrender to Turkey represents a national disgrace,' Armenian National Committee of America Chairman (ANCA) Ken Hachikian said in a statement yesterday. 'It is, very simply, a betrayal of truth, a betrayal of trust.' The Pope added his name last week to the list of high-profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the 'first genocide of the 20th Century.' He further proclaimed that 'concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.' Kim Kardashian has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011, when she wrote in a blog post, 'Every year, I honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Even though so many countries around the world recognize the Genocide, the government of Turkey still denies it.' 'It happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust. Maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.' During their trip last week to her ancestor's homeland, Kim, Khloe and their cousins met with the country's Prime Minister, Hovik Abrahamyan, who 'expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots!' Kim said in a tweet. Kim's husband Kanye also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in Yerevan at Swan Lake before departing Armenia for Jerusalem, Israel - the location of their daughter's christening at an Armenian church in 2014. The Kardashians also visited the Geghard Monastery during their trip to Armenia . Khloe wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial: 'My sister and I are trying to bring awareness not only to our Armenian genocide but genocides and human slaughter, in general. Knowledge is power!' She kept the campaign going after she returned home, asking her fan base on Twitter to sign a Change.org petition 'to bring awareness to the Armenian genocide' by requesting that Google highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings, April 24. 'I did!!!' she said. As of Wednesday morning the online petition had more than 175,300 supporters and was less than 25,000 signatures away from it's goal of collecting 200,000 names. 'The Kardashians have helped strike a powerful blow at Turkey's campaign of genocide denial,' ANCA communications director told ABC News after the visit. Their trip to Armenia 'has helped shine a global spotlight' on the genocide and 'the need for justice for that crime with millions,' she said. Ties that bind: The Kardashian family tree that traces back to two Molokan Armenian families . Home: Kim Kardashian's ancient ancestors fled the Armenian village Karakale (pictured recently) to escape a prophecised genocide that DID come to pass . Genocide: The village of Karakale (pictured in the 19th Century) was among hundreds destroyed as the Ottoman Empire laid waste to the region. Residents - possibly including the Kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses . Disputed: Armenian lands (in red) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th Century, with bloody consequences . Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. The fundamental division was religious. Armenians are Christians, while Turks are Muslims. The two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years, but the Ottoman Turks had always been on top. As Ottoman rule crumbled, rival nationalisms arose, and the Russian Empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded. Armenians say they were forced from their homes, marched to mass graves and slaughtered. Some managed to flee south into modern-day Syria and the Levant, others to Russian-held land which is now modern-day Armenia. Hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled. The outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed. But the use of the word 'genocide' is hugely controversial, as Turkey - successor to the Ottoman empire, and with a huge majority of Muslim ethnic Turks - rejects the description. Armenia, which became a fully-fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the Soviet Union, has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths. Its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred. The province of Kars (above), where the Kardashians' roots - and the origin of their name - lies, is almost entirely in Turkey. Its capital, Kars, is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries: it sits on the border but the frontier is closed.","In 1915, 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks in what historians have described as the first genocide of the 20th century .

Claire, 44, has now enlisted the help of Susan Hepburn, who famously helped Lily Allen slim form a size 14 to an 8. Scroll down for video . New mother Claire Sweeney has turned to hypnotherapist Susan Hepburn to help her shed two stone . As Claire takes to new motherhood, she has told Closer magazine that there is one pregnancy habit she's struggled to quit - her  chocolate cravings. But instead of resorting to faddy diets, Claire, who is a size 12 to 14, has said that what she really needs is to sort her binge mentality. So the actress, who is currently starring in the play Sex In Suburbia, has sought the help of celebrity hypnotherapist Susan to curb her sweet tooth and quit her habit of snacking when she's bored. Claire said: 'I went to see a hypnotherapist last month for the first time and told her that I needed to sort out my binge mentality.' She admits she craved sugar throughout her pregnancy and couldn't kick the habit afterwards. 'I even went on a binge at a pal's birthday recently and made myself feel sick,' she said. Susan is also rumoured to have helped singer Adele quit smoking, according to the Express. She hypnotised Claire for 20 minutes, which Claire describes as 'a bit like having a good night's sleep - it was so relaxing.' Susan Hepburn (left), who famously helped Lily Allen slim form a size 14 to an 8 (seen in 2009, right) She's only had one session so far but Claire says she can already see results.

But the weather will start to go downhill on Friday, marking the start of what could be weeks of unsettled weather, according to the Met Office. Central and eastern areas of the UK will hold on to some sunshine until later in the day, but there will be two bands of rain bringing wet weather to other areas. The forecaster said: 'There will be a band of rain coming into the south west and another coming into the north of Scotland. The fine weather will be squeezed out from two directions.

'Showery rain is working its way south or north east, depending on where you are. Temperatures will be in the high teens, but lack of sunshine means it will feel cooler.' Forecaster Marco Petagna said there could be a chance of hail or thunderstorms in the south over the weekend. By Saturday, the high pressure that has brought the recent good weather will have gone. Most of the country will see showers at some point over the weekend, but 'it will not be a complete washout'. Most parts of the UK will feel noticeably cooler by Sunday, and there could even be some snow on higher grounds in Scotland by Monday, where daytime temperatures could fall to 10C.

While this is chillier than the balmy weather we have had recently, the temperatures are not too far off the averages for this time of year. Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said Monday will see more widespread unsettled conditions across the UK, a trend which could hold into the beginning of May. He said: 'Looking ahead, it will be windier than of late, particularly in the north. Temperatures are going to be feeling rather cold in the rain and the stronger winds. 'The theme is going to continue into May, but by the middle of May there will be some settled weather.

"Tragedy: Zachary Cain Stickler, 34, died the day after he pleaded not guilty to hitting his partner . A pilot has commited suicide by  intentionally crashing his plane into a field in Northern California the day after pleading not guilty to domestic violence charges, authorities said Tuesday . Zachary Cain Stickler, 34, had been accused of physically assaulting his then-partner in February, and appeared Shasta County Superior Court in Redding on Friday. Before the crash on Saturday, Stickler had sent text messages to friends and family indicating he was distraught and planned to kill himself. He had been charged with  felony count of making criminal threats and a misdemeanor battery charge, Chief Deputy District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said. The charges stemmed from an argument in February in Redding, California, that escalated and became physical, Bridgett said. The alleged victim was living with Stickler at the time and reported an attack in their home. According to the police report, she claimed Stickler had gotten violent and then left their home, and that her cellphone had been destroyed in the process. She declined medical attention. Stickler killed himself by crashing into a pasture in in Millville, California, about 20miles from Redding, on Saturday morning, Shasta County Sheriff's Deputy Dustin Reynolds said. Sheriff's officials responded to a report of an explosion around 8:30am and found a small debris field at the site where the single-engine Cessna crashed. There was no indication Stickler had wanted to hurt anyone else, Reynolds added. A former boss has spoken of his shock at hearing of Stickler's death and the domestic violence charges. Crash: It is believed Stickler intentionally crashed his Cessna plane into a field in California on Saturday, after texting family and friends that he was 'distraught' and planned on taking his own life . Jason Lamberton, chief operating officer at AFT Center Flight Training in Long Beach, California, where Stickler worked last year described him as a 'skilled trainer who had good rapport with students'. 'I'm absolutely shocked. There was nothing like that whatsoever in his behavior. 'The young man was very professional with what he did here. We were really happy with him.' Lamberton also said that Stickler had left the company in order for his girlfriend could pursue an opportunity elsewhere, and that he had offered to provide the 34-year-old with a reference. More recently, Stickler worked for Aperture Aviation, an aerial photography company, which extended its sympathies to his family and friends in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration has assigned two inspectors to the crash, one of whom may conduct an on-site inspection, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said.","Pilot Zachary Cain Stickler, 34, charged with domestic violence .

"One of several Florida teens accused of ganging up on a friend by allowing her to be sexually assaulted was thrown back in jail Tuesday for allegedly breaking the conditions of her pre-trial release by threatening the victim online. Erica Avery was cuffed and hauled out of a Broward County courtroom after being accused of using the internet, which itself violated the conditions set just one month prior when she was first released on $100,000 bond. Prosecutor Maria Schneider said photos of the 17-year-old were posted to social media and one of them shows her using a smart phone, reports the Sun-Sentinel. Scroll down for video . Erica Avery (center) was cuffed and hauled out of a Broward County courtroom Tuesday after being accused of using the internet, which itself violates the conditions set just one month prior when she was first released on $100,000 bond (here, she is pictured at a prior court date) Accused: Prosecutors on Tuesday claimed Avery had contacted a victim she allegedly helped to hold down during a 2013 sexual assault . Avery and four other teens are charged with armed sexual battery and kidnapping in connection with the 2013 assault on a victim in Hollywood, Florida. Not long after their arrest, cell phone video emerged showing Erica Avery and her friend Patricia Montes leering over the victim as she writhed half naked and wept in the yard of the home of Jayvon Woolfork. Montes and Avery are accused of punching, kicking and pepper-spraying the girl before holding her down to be raped by Woolfork. On Tuesday, Avery's attorney told the court it was her sister, not Avery, who sent the victim messages. 'My client has assured me that at no point in time did she access the Internet,' Weinstein said. 'How is she supposed to control what her sister did?' The barbaric attack was filmed on a cell phone by Lanel Singleton. Along with Dwight Henry, the alleged rape gang have all been charged in the attack on November 1, 2013. The sickening clips shows the girls viciously beating the girl while the men watch. One male voice can be heard saying: 'They don't like this girl.' One girl responds: 'I told you we were gonna f*** somebody up'. As the victim begs to be freed, another girl says they should 'let this girl go home' but the attack continues. Avery, here with her co-defendant Patricia Montes, are accused of punching, kicking and pepper-spraying the girl before holding her down to be raped by Woolfork . Montes on Monday pleaded no contest and was sentenced to four years in prison followed by two years probation as part of a deal in which she'll testify against her co-defendants, writes the Sun-Sentinel. Avery could take a similar deal. The victim told police that she was attacked after smoking marijuana and drinking beer with people she believed to be her friends, including one girl who had been her best friend since kindergarten. The victim claims that she was kicked, thrown down stairs and had her face smashed on concrete, breaking bones near both her eyes. The videos, consisting of 11 snippets, show the victim being beaten, but they do not depict sexual activity.

"A taxi driver has entered the Chinese record books by taking 30,000 selfies with passengers. Teng Jiazhi or 'Uncle Teng,' from Shenyang, North China, came up with the unique tipping system ten years ago when he picked up a couple of tourists in -30C. ‘They had been standing in the cold for more than an hour for a taxi' he told reporters from People’s Daily Online. Popular: Teng Jiazhi poses with three passengers in one of the thousands of selfies taken in his cab . Happy snappy: Taxi driver 'Uncle Teng' and his passengers are all smiles for the cab camera . 'When they got in my car, they kept thanking me and offered tips. But I could not take the extra money,’ said Uncle Teng. ‘Before they dropped off, they wanted to take a photo with me. The gratitude they had was very comforting and that photo was the first selfie I took with my passenger.’ Since then the cabby, who starts work at 3am each day, has kept a camera in his car and captured thousands of happy passengers. On average, he picks up as many as eighty passengers a day and at least twenty take selfies with him. The 58-year-old then uploads them to his page on a popular Chinese social media website, making him one of the most recognised faces in the region. Passengers have even commented on how his smile always looks the same and Uncle Teng said it is because it comes from within.

It takes just a chat, some sing along or a joke to make them happy again. ‘A few years ago, an upset young lady got on my taxi and she refused to take a selfie with me. So I started chatting with her. 'I found out that she had a fight with her mum so I sang her a folk song about how mothers always worry. She started sobbing after I finished my song and immediately called her mum to say sorry. 'Before she dropped off, she gracefully took a selfie with me and told me that it was a good day.’ Smile: Passengers pose with phones and balloons in a couple of the thousands of selfie photos Uncle Teng has gathered .

When Uncle Teng first got media attention, he already had 5,494 selfies with passengers and he already had more than 700 followers on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. He challenged himself to get 10,000 selfies for ‘Smile Shenyang’, part of the National Games of the People’s Republic of China that was held in 2013. ‘I have met many taxi passengers who recognised me from the news. I particularly enjoy people calling me Uncle Teng because it is such an intimate name.’ He handpicked 6,402 selfies from his collection for the ‘Shanghai Big World Jinisi Record’ featuring passengers came from all over the world and hopes his record will let people see what a happy place Shenyang is.

"The work of Abi Gordon-Cody is certainly not for the squeamish. Her Instagram posts of severed fingers, rotting flesh and impaled limbs may seem like the work of an extremely violent (or extremely clumsy) person but Abi's injuries are, in fact, all a clever illusion. Abi, 26, from Droitwich, Worcestershire, works as a special effects make-up artist with the daily challenge of trying to find ways of slicing off fingers and impaling bodies in a completely pain-free way. Scroll down for video . Make-up artist Abi Gordon-Cody creates gruesome injuries using special effects . Abi often stars in her own pictures, taking selfies of a bloody pencil seemingly impaled through her nostril and emerging from the bridge of her nose, or a shot of a foot that has trodden on a long rusty nail. In one picture, her toes appear to have been chopped off, while in another, a bloody ear has teeth marks where skin should be and in another, her forearm is covered in a huge iron 'burn'. One of her most inventive is a zombie rictus grin which she made by building up layers of toilet paper, latex and fake blood on her face. However, Abi's talents stretch beyond mangled makeovers having worked in theatre and helped out on film sets and she says that her work can involve beautifying rather than horrifying a client. She told Movie Pilot: 'I am constantly building up my portfolio as a make-up artist. It includes what I like to call, 'pretty make up' such as bridal and special occasions, but more importantly from blushing bride to bleeding eyes I specialise specifically in special effects creation of realistic wounds, injuries and traumas.' Abi's gory recreations of wounds have earned her a loyal following of almost 3000 on Instagram . Abi says that she was inspired to go into stage make-up by her family who worked in showbiz . As well as her gory recreations Abi works as a general make-up artist for weddings and events . Yet while Abi's love of re-creating serious injuries may seem ghoulish, the make-up expert's interest is informed by her unusual background growing up in a theatrical family. Her grandparents owned a circus, her father was a real life cowboy, stuntman and prop maker and her mother started out as a stylish stage hypnotherapist and went on to become the first female escapologist. Abi watched her father transform himself into different characters and she studied her mother while she applied stage make-up. Now her gory Instagram profile with its uncanny depictions of horror scenarios and hideous household accidents has attracted almost 3,000 followers as users take note for possible pranks or Halloween inspiration. Abi titled this post 'day-dreaming nightmare' as she replicates a finger being severed by a potato peeler . Abi says that she used to watch her mother apply stage make-up as a child . Abi says that her busiest time of year is Halloween... unsurprisingly . And yet Abi admits that some horror films terrify her. She tells Movie Pilot that even though she finds the Saw films 'hard to stomach', the special effects are incredible. She said: 'I’d have loved to have been in on those early planning sessions. The make-up team must have been in their element and I can only imagine how fun and rewarding working on such a film was, now something like that is where I want to be!' So far she has put her skills to good use creating realistic injuries from a derailed train simulation to for an emergency service training exercise. In fact, she watches gruesome flicks for inspiration rather than thrills. 'Horror films do inspire me, and now when I watch them I zoom in on how the make-up was created instead of just what it is,' she said. And everyday life provides plenty of fuel for her over-active imagination. 'I look at everyday objects and think of the bad things that could happen,' she said. Abi often incorporates kitchen props to replicate household accidents . Abi uses prosthetics to create convincing injuries such as these severed toes .","Abi Gordon-Cody creates gruesome injuries using special effects make-up .

"All political leaders feel the need to lay bare the details of their private lives. But Nigel Farage may have taken it too far, with a TV interview in which he discusses his love of skinny-dipping in the icy waters of the English Channel as a boy. The 51-year-old also discussed his battle with testicular cancer, keeping his children out of the public eye and how he plans to go on and on as Ukip leader - until 2030. Scroll down for video . Leaning on a seawall in Deal, Kent, Ukip leader Nigel Farage told ITV's Julie Etchingham about his childhood, family and his plans to go on and on . Mr Farage resisted the temptation to let the ITV cameras into this home, perhaps after Ed Miliband's problems with his second kitchen. Instead he was interview by the Tonight programme's Julie Etchingham on the seafront at Deal, where he grew up. Mr Farage revealed that as a schoolboy he 'always questioned authority' He described his childhood of 'youthful excess' but gave few details. Asked if he had enjoyed some lively nights out in the clubs of the Kent town, he replied: 'Oh gosh, absolutely no comment haha.' Asked if his high jinks included the sea, he confess: 'Well I did a bit of skinny dipping and a few things like that in the middle of the night, yes. 'Youthful excess. It got very cold, erm. It does need some parameters and some boundaries; I probably had fewer than most.' As a boy he enjoyed more 'freedom' than children today. 'Kids were allowed out you know with sandwiches and a bottle of water and a bike and off you went and did things for the day.' He would go out and collect things, including 'pot lids and bottles and old clay pipes and all sorts of things'. He admitted: 'As I got older and into my teens I got more and more difficult. I always questioned authority. I guess a bit of a wind up merchant really.' This schoolboy trait has now become part of his political persona. 'Well, being in the European Parliament was an extension of being in school and questioning authority, yes. Look you know to have a healthy vibrant democracy you need people that question authority.' In the programme, to be broadcast tonight, Mr Farage also discussed the impact of his father leaving home when he was just five. 'Well these things happen, he got over it and made a success of his life. We had some problems when I was a kid but not that bad,' he said. Mr Farage resisted the temptation to let the ITV cameras into this home, perhaps after Ed Miliband's problems with his second kitchen . He reflected on his own mortality when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer in his early twenties. 'I was very emotional about it. Well my memory is that I was 21 years old and I had testicular cancer and one of my thoughts through that period was that perhaps I won’t be able to have children, then having children, first child was a very big moment. I was very emotional about it. 'I’ve been very lucky. I've got four - two boys, two girls, they're fit and healthy. You're not going to see pictures because I’m keeping them out of the public view. But they are all doing well in life and I am pleased about that.' He discussed how he says prayers 'sometimes', most recently for his family after they became trapped in a pub surrounded by a gang of protesters. 'The only prayers I would ever say actually would be which after last Sunday (when his family were scared by protesters during a Sunday lunch) perhaps is more appropriate you know would be for my family, to be well and to be happy and be strong and I do sometimes think that what I am doing is making their lives a bit difficult.' As a hobby, Mr Farage would go out and collect things, including 'pot lids and bottles and old clay pipes and all sorts of things' He said that being Ukip leader did not necessarily prepare him for the level of interest, and opposition in recent months. 'Well you see if I got into the Conservative Party, one of the big parties and became an MP and was on a career path, perhaps you could have anticipated longer term what some of the costs might have been, because this was you know a little rabble army that suddenly became quite a big political party, so it's, some of it has come as a bit of a surprise yeah.' But he insisted he has no plans to quit, despite suggesting in earlier interviews that he would stand down if he does not win the target seat of Thanet South on May 7. 'I have decided I will stand down before the 2030 general election,' he said with a laugh. 'I have barely started.'","Ukip leader discusses childhood, his father leaving home and cancer .

But she had never gotten the chance to watch herself dance. She didn't even have any photographs or memorabilia to remember her years on stage. It was David Shuff, who met Barker years ago when he brought his therapy dog to her retirement home, that finally reunited the one-time famous dancer with her videos. After a long and unsuccessful first search, Shuff connected with Mark Cantor, a collector of short musical films called 'soundies' who runs the online archive Jazz on Film. It was then Shuff and Cantor discovered that Barker's videos were filed under 'Baker', a misspelling of her name - which was why no one had been able to find them before, according to Mashable. They located three of Barker's soundies, giving her the chance to finally watch her days in the chorus line, where she was almost always in the front row. 'Don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing,' Barker sang along as she watched one of her routines. When Shuff asked her how many years she danced, Barker replied 'that's all I ever did, that was it!' She said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again'. Barker (pictured right in the video) had danced at legendary clubs like the Apollo, Cotton Club and Zanzibar Club, and had appeared in movies commercials and television shows . David Shuff, who met Barker years ago at her retirement home, and archivist Mark Cantor helped locate and reunite the one-time famous dancer with three of her 'soundies', known then as short musical videos . Barker found herself needing to dance and move to  music at a young age. She told Shuff a story about when she was a child and her mother was preparing her for a bath. Her mother had gone to the house to retrieve something when a young Barker heard a band play nearby. 'When she came back I was gone,' said Barker. 'I was down there naked just going, dancing.' 'And then, if the band would stop playing, I'd look at them and ""come on, let's get it going, let's get it going here.""' Barker said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again' But the most special part for Barker was getting to watch herself dance again. 'I used to often say to myself, I am being paid to do something that I enjoy doing and I would do it for free,' she said . Shuff shared Barker's story on Reddit, where he wrote that the videos were now in her possession and that they are often played in her retirement center's communal room, noting that she's a 'rock star these days'. He added that Barker knows her videos are online now and that it made her happy because she 'feels connected to the world again'. But the most special part for Barker was getting the chance to watch herself dance again. 'I used to often say to myself, I am being paid to do something that I enjoy doing and I would do it for free,' she said. 'Because it just felt so good doing it, because that music, you know, I just get carried away in it.'","Alice Barker danced in legendary Apollo and Zanzibar clubs during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance, as well as movies, TV and commercials .

"He's protected Russell Crowe, Naomi Campbell and Aerosmith rocker Steve Tyler, and now Cengiz Guven is protecting Australian travellers at Gallipoli. Mr Guven is the supervisor of site security at Lone Pine, the hilltop battlefield cemetery that will host the second Australian dawn service on Anzac Day. And while there have been questions about security at Gallipoli following recent terror arrests in Australia and ongoing instability in Syria, Mr Guven is quietly confident. 'The army is here, we are here. It will be okay,' he said. Cengiz Güven (left) with actor Russell Crowe in Istanbul during the premiere of Crowe's film The Water Divider .

The 30-year-old security manager from Istanbul has been taking care of things at Lone Pine for the past four years, but in between Anzac Days his work has a superstar flavour. When Crowe attended the Istanbul premiere of his latest film, The Water Diviner, in 2014, Mr Guven was on personal protection duty. He kept Tyler safe when the frontman and his band were in town to perform and has been on duty for Campbell, American lifestyle icon Martha Stewart and electro-dance group The Prodigy. Switching from one-on-one to protecting thousands doesn't faze Mr Guven, even when the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings has made this year the busiest ever for him and his team from Turkish security firm VipSec.

"'Burned up inside': Doctors could not save Eloise Aimee Parry, 21, above, after she took the 'diet pills' Deadly diet pills thought to have killed six young people in Britain are being sold online for just 70p each. Unscrupulous dealers in the UK and abroad are selling the potentially fatal drug, which contains a toxic chemical used in pesticides and explosives, to those desperate to lose weight. Some promise next-day delivery, while others even offer free samples for those who want to ‘try before they buy’. The most recent victim of the chemical 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) is Eloise Aimee Parry, 21, as reported in yesterday’s Mail. She died this month after buying it online to slim down – despite being a normal weight. Five others have died since 2008. Yesterday, her mother, Fiona, told how the drug arrived in a ‘nondescript’ plastic bag labelled with a white sticker embossed with the letters ‘DNP’ and an illustration of its chemical formula. She found it in her daughter’s handbag after her death in hospital on April 12. Mrs Parry, 51, a chemistry teacher, said the drug was simple to concoct, adding: ‘A student with a decent grade in A-level chemistry could work out how to synthesise this.’ Despite the dangers, the drug can be bought cheaply and easily online, the Daily Mail discovered yesterday. Simple internet searches found dozens of firms marketing and selling DNP as a miracle diet pill for home delivery in ‘discreet packaging’. Others based in China were offering the powder contained in the capsules in bulk, allowing anyone to make pills and sell them online. One company claimed to be based in the UK. It had a sale on, with 100 pills for £70. It also offered to send six free tablets to try. Miss Parry, from Shrewsbury, died after taking eight – six more than the fatal dose. She ‘burned up from within’, her mother said. DNP, a yellow organic compound, is used to suppress plant growth and as an explosive. It was popular as a diet aid in the 1930s but was banned after it was found to be poisonous. Despite this, it has become popular again, particularly among bodybuilders. It works by causing the body to overheat, accelerating the metabolism so it burns more fat. However it also causes dehydration, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating and a rapid or irregular heartbeat and can lead to coma and death. Long-term use can lead to the development of cataracts and skin lesions and may cause damage to the heart and nervous system. There is also evidence that DNP causes cancer and increases the risk of birth defects. Bright yellow DNP powder is produced as a pesticide at chemical factories in Turkey and China. It is then made into easy-to-swallow capsules by dealers who sell them online as weight-loss pills. Dozens of websites advertise DNP as a fat-burning wonder drug. They promise discreet, prompt, worldwide delivery. One British website even offers customers a ‘try before you buy’. What the websites do not say is that DNP has been linked to at least 62 deaths worldwide. Many promise that users can expect to lose 1lb of fat every day on the drug. Some websites include the disclaimer ‘Research purposes only, not for human consumption’ but still sell the drug in capsule form. Produced as a pesticide: Yellow DNP powder . It is illegal to sell for human consumption, but sellers get around this by claiming to sell it as a pesticide or dye, which is not illegal, or with disclaimers. There is little British authorities can do because most firms are based or registered overseas. Miss Parry, who was bulimic, was a families and childcare studies student at Glyndwr University in Wrexham, north Wales. On April 12 she drove herself to A&E after taking eight pills and becoming unwell. Within three hours, she was dead. Mrs Parry said she had no idea her daughter had been taking slimming pills until she arrived at A&E to be told by doctors she had died. Police are investigating the source of Miss Parry’s tablets. However, the British website found by the Mail, which was decorated with Union Flags, offered next-day delivery and said the pills were ‘the most powerful and effective weight-loss tool available’, claiming customers could lose 1lb a day. It added: ‘Used correctly, there is simply nothing like it.’ Other firms are based in Turkey, the US and Russia. In almost all cases, it is impossible to trace those behind the websites because they are registered to offshore host companies. The National Poisons Information Service said there were just six enquiries from GPs about DNP in 2012 – a year later there were 300. Referring to online merchants, Mrs Parry, a single mother of five, said: ‘They don’t care about the damage they inflict, about the pain and suffering of the people who take this stuff and pay a price for it.’ The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency cannot take action against manufacturers or distributors because DNP is not classified as a medicinal product. In theory, the Food Standards Authority could act if DNP was sold for human consumption. But most firms are registered abroad so they fall outside its jurisdiction. Victims’ families have been campaigning for DNP to be classified as an illegal drug, and in 2013, David Cameron promised to ‘look carefully’ at the issue. But in March the Home Office told an MP it would not make the drug illegal because it contains no ‘psychoactive’ properties. Warning: Fiona Parry (pictured), whose 21-year old Eloise (pictured during school years the photo frame) died after swallowing diet pills, has urged others not to take the toxic substance, saying: 'It's an awful way to die' Shock: Mrs Parry said she had no idea her daughter (pictured left and right with her mother, aged three months) had been taking slimming pills until she arrived at A&E to be told by doctors she had died .","Potentially fatal drug contains chemical used in pesticides and explosives .

"Almost 50 people a year die of skin cancer after being exposed to the sun at work in the UK, research shows. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure. A separate study, also commissioned by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors thinking they were not at risk from the sun and sunburn or were unsure if they were. The study found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoorst hinking they were not at risk . The institution urged businesses to improve 'sun safety', for example by minimising workers' exposure in the middle of the day. More than half (59%) of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year. Researchers also found a 'macho culture' in some parts of the industry and misconceptions about the threat of ultraviolet radiation in climates like the UK's as cloud cover does not give total protection from the sun. The studies' findings are being published as part of an Institution of Occupational Safety and Health No Time To Lose campaign to beat work-related cancers, with businesses urged to develop 'sun safety strategies'. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure . The strategies should include regular updates on the UV index from weather forecasts, minimising sun exposure in the middle of the day and asking employees to wear long-sleeved, loose-fitting tops and trousers. While using high-factor sunscreen is helpful it should not be relied on as the only barrier to the harmful rays, employers are advised. IOSH executive director of policy Shelley Frost said: 'We've a clear picture for the UK now of the number of people diagnosed with or dying from skin cancer because of sun exposure at work. 'It's a terrible disease but with some simple measures we can ensure people who work outside are not exposed to the solar radiation that causes it. 'Work-related skin cancer is avoidable but businesses and their employees hold the key to beating it and today we are showing them how it can be done.'","50 die each year as a result of being exposed to the sun at work in Britain .

"When a man arrived at a hospital in India complaining of a stomach ache, doctors suspected it might be a run-of-the-mill case of food poisoning or an ulcer. However they were amazed to find the man had actually swallowed hundreds of coins and nails. Over a three year period Rajpal Singh, 34, had swallowed 140 coins, 150 nails and a handful of nuts, bolts and batteries. He had also gulped down screws, nails and magnets. Rajpal Singh, 34, had hundreds of coins and other objects removed from his stomach after complaining of an ache. The image shows an X-ray with the mass of metal objects shown in white in his stomach . Doctors were amazed when an endoscopy (a long thin tube with a camera attached) revealed hundreds of foreign objects inside Mr Singh's stomach. The endoscopy is pictured . Over a three year period, Mr Singh had swallowed, 140 coins, 150 nails and nuts and bolts, batteries and magnets. Some of the objects removed are pictured . When doctors carried out an endoscopy – inserting a long, thin, tube with a camera attached to the end – it revealed the hundreds of foreign objects in his stomach. Mr Singh, a farmer from Bathinda in India's western state of Punjab, said his bizarre habit began after he fell into a depression, and eating metal objects brought him comfort. He said: 'I used to gulp down coins and metals with fruit juice or milk. 'Due to family problems I had slipped into depression and got hooked onto this weird habit. 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died. 'I feel much more relaxed now. I am never going to do this again.' Mr Singh claims he didn't realise his stomach pain was due to his habit of eating metal objects. Doctors have carried out 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects, as well as a nine-hour operation. But Mr Singh will still need another procedure to remove the rest of the metal . Pictured are X-rays of Mr Singh's stomach, revealing the mass of foreign objects. Mr Singh said: 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died' Dr Gagendeep Goyal (pictured centre in blue) led a team of five doctors who carried out the operation to remove the objects from Mr Singh's abdomen . He went to many medical centres in Punjab complaining of a painful ache in his abdomen, but no doctors could diagnose the problem. Finally, Dr Gagandeep Goyal, a gastroentologist at a local hospital, carried out an X-ray and revealed the mass of metal deep in Mr Singh's stomach. He has since carried out more than 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects - yet some still remain. Leading a team of  five doctors, he also carried out a nine hour operation to remove more of the metal, yet Mr Singh will still need another operation to remove the rest. Dr Goyal said: 'The patient came to us with severe stomach pain. When we did the endoscopy we were shocked to see so many foreign bodies, including coins and sharp objects in his stomach. 'Though we have managed to remove most of them, there are still sharp injects and coins in his stomach. 'His body is too fragile to sustain another operation now so we plan to operate again in about seven days and remove the remaining objects.' Mr Singh says he feels calmer now and will not swallow metal objects again.

"Nigel Farage is a 'Victor Meldrew in stilts' whose remarks about immigrants and ethnic minorities reveal the 'truly odious nature of his views', Nick Clegg claimed today in an extraordinary attack on the UKIP leader. In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Clegg said Mr Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines. The Lib Dem leader condemned David Cameron's appeal to UKIP supporters to 'come home', warning the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed Nigel Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines . Mr Cameron issued an appeal to people planning to vote UKIP to instead support the Tories in an attempt to block a 'toxic tie-up' between Laabiur and the SNP. But Mr Clegg condemned the 'worrying' suggestion that his former coalition partners should seek to build a majority by appealing to people on the 'far right'. Speaking in his bright yellow campaign bus as he headed to the South West, Mr Clegg: . Mr Farage has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, in an apparent attempt to generate headlines and shore up Ukip's core vote. He was condemned in the first TV leaders' debate for saying people with HIV should not be allowed into Britain and in the second for attacking the audience for being too left-wing. After criticism that the Ukip manifesto featured almost all white faces, he insisted yesterday that there was a 'half black' party spokesman featured prominently - and 'one fully black person'. The Lib Dem leader told MailOnline's political editor Matt Chorley that the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' Miriam González Durantezhas been writing a food blog . Nick Clegg is such a bad cook his wife Miriam only lets him do the washing up. The Lib Dem leader admitted his 'rubbishness' in the kitchen after it emerged his wife and sons had been secretly running a food blog - MumAndSons - posting recipes and photographs online. Mr Clegg said he had played no part in the culinary operation, but had helped with taking pictures for the blog: 'I'm sure you can see my hand in a couple of them.' But his own cooking abilities do not stretch to more than peanut butter on toast. 'I'm a sort of sous chef, Mr Clegg told MailOnline. 'I provide helpful moral backing and assistance. I'll do the washing up, and tasting and preparatory tasks.' Asked if there was nothing he could cook, Mr Clegg replied: 'I'm sure I could but I'm great eater, I'm just really not a very good cook. 'If I had to, if I was starving... Peanut butter on white toast obviously, with jam on top. I'm seriously into jam on top.' Ms Gonzalez Durantez said she had run a cooking blog with her children  for three years . Mr Clegg said the comments revealed Mr Farage's true nature: 'The mask is slipping. I think the more he thrashes around to get attention the more the mask slips and the truly odious nature of his views become more and more obvious. 'This is someone who is clearly uncomfortable talking about people from different ethnic backgrounds, calls them 'half' and 'fully' black, but is also someone who advocates basically turning our backs on people who are very sick and kind of indulging in a language that is so divisive, so odious.' Mr Clegg, who boasts that the Lib Dems will win many, many more seats than UKIP on May 7, accused Mr Farage of 'running a truly incompetent campaign'. 'He is just lashing around, thrashing around, lurching from one odious gaffe or assertion to the next. There is no pattern. 'One moment he claims he wants to take his manifesto seriously and the next he is talking about fully and half black candidates. 'You are either serious or a kind of Victor Meldrew on stilts. Which one are you? 'It just beggars belief that it is that kind of person that the Conservative party thinks they need to bring back into the fold.' He said Mr Cameron's appeal to Ukip voters 'could not have been more explicit - people like Farage, please come back home'. 'I don't think the Conservative should have a home for those kind of views,' he added. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus HQ in Filton, Bristol before travelling to Wales, said he would use the final 15 days of the campaign to tell voters of the 'danger of these kind of really odious views basically taking over or encroaching upon how a mainstream party like the Conservative party thinks and acts'. He warned that without the Lib Dems back in coalition, the Tories would be dragged to the 'extremes' by right wing backbenchers, Ukip and the DUP. He said that it is a 'tragedy' that a centrist politician like Mr Cameron had lost control of his party. 'What's happening is you are seeing the bandwagons of the far right encircling an increasingly hapless Conservative leadership. 'And the Conservative leadership will become just victim to and puppets of an array of hardline right wing voices from UKip, from DUP, from their own backbenches, which will do huge damage to our country. Huge damage. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus factory in Filton, Bristol today, said the Lib Dems would act as a 'bulwark' against the Tories lurching to the right . Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka' Mr Farage - appearing on ITV's Lorraine this morning - has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, sparking accusations from Mr Clegg today that he was an 'odious Victor Meldrew' (pictured right) Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka'. 'They have got very hardline views on people who need help from the state because they have fallen on hard times,' Mr Clegg said. 'And they take this very ideological view that basically the state and support for public services should be remorselessly cut back and cut back and cut back and cut back for no reason other than some kind of hardline ideological preference for it.' Mr Clegg went head to head with Mr Farage in two TV debates last year, ahead of the European Parliament elections, which UKip went on to win while the Lib Dems lost all but one seat in Brussels. Mr Clegg insisted most people in Britain are 'decent and pragmatic', and that the Lib Dems are most 'in tune' with public opinion. But he admitted he faces a 'challenge' to turn that into votes after a devastating collapse in popularity since entering coalition five years ago. We're the guarantee that will not let the swivel-eyed brigade take over. He added: 'We are the only bulwark, we are the only barrier, we are the only dam against this increasing pressure from people with some very, very nasty views which would lead to ideologically imposed cuts on nurseries, on schools on colleges.' David Cameron came under fire from Mr Clegg as he visited Advantage children's daycare nursery in Surbiton with London Mayor Boris Johnson . Mr Clegg said he defended Mr Farage's right to say controversial things in an open democracy, but hoped they would be defeated on Election Day. 'I really really abhor what Farage stands for but I don't begrudge the right to say what he says and seek to represent those views in Parliament. 'What worries me much more is not whether he gets a number of MPs in the House of Commons, those seats then become the tail that wags the Tory dog. 'Democracy should be able to encompass views that I would find absolutely beyond the pale, that's what being a free country is about. 'It's about disagreeing with those views, taking them on, arguing against them and defeating them in an argument. 'It's not about saying they shouldn't be expressed. That would be very illiberal.' A Ukip spokesman said: 'This smacks of desperation from a Clegg, horrified by his disastrous polls, trying to punch above his weight. If only he'd do it with policy, rather than these venting, personal attacks. A trick he has obviously learned from Mr Cameron.'","EXCLUSIVE Nick Clegg warns the Ukip leader's 'mask is slipping'

"A mother of four has pledged to remove her children from school to attend an ancient Maypole festival - despite facing fines or even prosecution. Anna James, 32, has vowed to defy the school's ban on taking her children to the 'Obby 'Oss celebrations - claiming the rituals are part of her 'religion, culture and heritage.' The school blocked her request under a government crackdown on unauthorised absences  announced in 2013. Mrs James pictured with her son Ethan (far left), Piran (centre) and Sophia (right) at last year's Maypole festival . But Mrs James said she would be willing to take the consequences of any police action to take her children Ethan, 11, Piran, 5, Sophia, 8, and four month old baby Faith to the event. The annual May 1 celebration is a centuries' old tradition, involving music and dancing through the streets, believed by some to be an ancient pagan fertility ritual which heralds the arrival of spring. Held every year in Padstow, Cornwall at midnight on May 1, it consists of parades and celebrations throughout the town and into the following day. Mrs James, who moved from Padstow to St Austell, Cornwall, eight years ago, said: 'I think it's ridiculous that I'm being told I can't take my children to the event. 'Obby 'Oss is something which my family has celebrated for generations. 'It's part of our heritage, our culture and our religion. If I wanted to take children out of school for some other religion I think it would be a different story. 'I don't expect the St Austell schools to close, but I do think that any school in Cornwall should be sensitive to the needs of people from Padstow to return to their home town on May 1. The event itself is educational.' Mrs James, 32, has vowed to defy the school's ban on taking her children to the 'Obby 'Oss celebrations. Pictured from left to right is Sophia, 8, Ethan, 11, Faith, 4 months, and Piran, 5 . In 2013, former Education Secretary Michael Gove ended the right for schools to grant up to 10 days holiday per year for pupils. New guidelines state that children should only be taken out of school during term-time if it is an 'exceptional circumstance'. Government rules state that it is at the discretion of each individual school to authorise or reject absence requests. Under the current system, parents who take their children out of school without permission could face a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. Padstow Primary School children are included in the 'Obby 'Oss tradition. But leaders at Bishop Bronescombe School in St Austell would not authorise Mrs James' request for her children to join them. Mrs James said: 'For Padstow residents the day is a massively important part of their cultural heritage. 'I'm not an expert on its origins but I do believe it can be described as having religious significance. 'Just because I don't live in Padstow any more doesn't mean I can't celebrate my religion. I would do the same even if I lived in Australia.' The crackdown by the Government on absences was outlined in 2013 and stipulates children should attend lessons rather than take time off to suit parental convenience. The crackdown was announced by the then Education Secretary Michael Gove who intended to stop parents taking children out of school to benefit from cheaper holidays. Mrs James said the festival was part of her family's religion, culture and heritage . But the government insists that local head teachers still have the discretion to approve up to ten absences a year 'in exceptional circumstances'. Bishop Bronescombe School declined to comment. In Padstow, where children are an integral part of the festival, the school closes so pupils can take part in the early-morning dances. Padstow School head teacher Phil Banks said: 'We take May 1 as a community closure day as the majority of our children and staff will be taking part in the festivities. 'It is such an important part of their cultural heritage that we feel it is extremely important for us to support and celebrate it. 'I can understand the position of the St Austell schools, however. 'Guidelines on allowing absence nowadays are incredibly tight. I would imagine a number of schools in the area get requests like this, and not necessarily from people who can claim any legitimate link to Padstow.' Mrs James, who is currently on maternity leave from her job as a PA, said that she has attended the event every year since she was born and for residents of Padstow it was more important than Christmas. She said: 'We see it as more important than Christmas. It is such an important Cornish tradition, but if the children can not go how are we supposed to keep it alive? 'Obviously we celebrate Christmas, but the fact we see this as more important shows the scale of what it means to us. 'I will be taking the kids out as I strongly believe we should be allowed to keep our heritage alive. 'They all have a 100 per cent attendance record. I never take them out for a holiday. 'But everyone in Padstow takes part. People who once lived there come from the other side of the world to take part. It is in their blood.'","Mother of four Anna James has vowed to take her children to the festival .

Mr Spowart paddled out to where the horses were stranded, with concentration etched on his face . His tough journey to save the animals was captured as he paddled past submerged trees and bushes . As he managed to get hold of a brown horse in what was once a field surrounded by a fence, the man clung to its mane to lead it to safety . The moving images show the concentration on his face as he moves towards the animals and his concern as he struggles to lead them out of the deep murky water. In one photo, a startled brown horse attempts to flee as the man is kicked backwards into the water. The man and owner Ms Sharrock, in a green jacket, then appear to try and calm the animal to coax it to come with them without any reins.

The brown horse reared up after becoming caught in barbed wire, splashing and throwing the man back into the storm water . The brown horse stood off against the two rescuers, Sonia Sharrock and Mr Spowart, in fear of the terrifying floods . The man was helped by two women as he led two white and one chestnut horse out of the deep water towards a young boy and a boat . On Wednesday morning, the NSW Premier called on flood victims to 'hang tough' as the storm slowly moved down the south coast. 'Obviously, in the areas particularly impacted in the Hunter, Newcastle and across the Central Coast, we ask those communities to hang tough,' Mr Baird said. He said 'areas such as Dungog and Maitland, parts of the Central Coast' would be declared natural disaster zones but a state of emergency would not be announced. The community of Dungog in the Hunter region is said to be in 'shock' after three residents who died in dangerous weather conditions on Tuesday were identified as Robyn McDonald, aged about 70, Colin Webb, 79, and Brian Wilson, 72, the Newcastle Herald reported. The SES says it has had about 8000 requests for help and conducted 90 flood rescues since Monday, and about 200,000 homes and businesses remain without power. More than 260 SES crews and 600 volunteers will be out in the field on Wednesday.

"An Arizona woman has pleaded guilty to hitting her husband with their SUV because he didn't vote in the 2012 presidential election. Holly Nicole Solomon, now 31, admitted to running over her husband Daniel in a Mesa parking lot after an argument where she said that her family would 'face hardship' because of Barack Obama's reelection. Solomon, who was six months pregnant at the time, originally pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and disorderly conduct for the incident, but now will serve three and a half years in prison following a plea deal.

Bystanders in the parking lot who called police during the 10am Sunday morning row said that Solomon had been slamming the door of her Jeep repeatedly while yelling at her husband. She then is said to have chased him down with the SUV, driving in circles as he tried to hide behind a light pole, according to the Arizona Republic. The woman told police that she wanted to scare her spouse by stopping short of him, but accidentally stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake and slammed into her husband. He had been running around the parking lot screaming for help as bystanders looked on in terror. There was no indication that she had drugs or alcohol in her system at the time. She had blamed problems in their family on Obama and 'just hated' him, according to her husband.

"A Virginia man has won the right to see his son, even thought the child was conceived through the woman using a turkey baster, a court has ruled, . Robert Preston Boardwine provided his friend Joyce Rosemary Bruce with sperm and she impregnated herself using the kitchen accessory in 2010. She had opted for the bizarre method of conception because she believed that the absence of intercourse would mean Mr Boardwine had no parental rights. After the boy was born, the pair disagreed on the level of involvement Mr Boardwine would have in his son's life, with Ms Bruce intent on raising him alone. Unusual method: A court in Richmond, Virginia, has ruled that even though Joyce Rosemary Bruce impregnated herself using a turkey baster and Robert Preston Boardwine's sperm, he still has parental rights . Mr Boardwine had envisioned being more involved in the child's life, telling a lower court he had hoped to 'attend the boy's sporting events some day', and have a say in major decisions such as school. The Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that as the child's biological father, Mr Boardwine is more than a sperm donor and is entitled to be a part of his son's life. 'The path to fatherhood may have been unconventional,' the court said, but it doesn't remove Boardwine's parental rights. According to court filings, Ms Bruce impregnated herself with a turkey baster, believing that Mr Boardwine would not have any parental rights because they did not have intercourse. Mr Boardwine had agreed after some trepidation to provide the sperm, and the pair underwent several tries before Ms Bruce fell pregnant. They discussed a written contract but never signed one, a court heard. 'Bruce used an ordinary turkey baster to inseminate herself,' the court said. 'No other person was involved. They did not go to a doctor's office or to a medical facility.' After several visits from Mr Boardwine in 2010, Ms Bruce learned that she was pregnant in July. Their good relationship continued for the early part of the pregnancy, with Mr Boardwine visiting and bringing a stuffed bear and baby clothes. However, Ms Bruce  wanted him to be only 'as involved as her other friends', a lower court was told, while he sought  a more active role — attendance at the boy's sporting events someday, and a voice in major decisions. Ms Bruce fell pregnant after several 'tries' using Mr Boardwine's sperm, but despite an initially friendly relationship, the pair fell out when she rejected his suggestion for a name for their son . The relationship soured when Ms Bruce rejected Mr Boardwine's suggested name for the child. They didn't speak for about five months, until the boy was born and Boardwine showed up at the hospital. Later visits to her home were 'sort of strained,' Ms Bruice said, and she eventually told Boardwine to stay away. Ms Bruce argued that Boardwine had no rights because, under the state's assisted conception law, he was merely a sperm donor. But the law defines assisted conception as a pregnancy resulting from 'medical technology,' and that definition doomed her argument. 'The plain meaning of the term 'medical technology' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster,' Judge Stephen R. McCullough wrote for the appeals court. Ms Bruce can still appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court.","Man impregnated female friend using his sperm and a turkey baster .

"President Barack Obama held up the shrinking Florida Everglades today as proof positive that climate change is real and is threatening America's 'national treasures,' as well as the economies of their surrounding towns, which rely heavily on tourist dollars. 'Climate change can no longer be denied. It can’t be edited out,' he said this afternoon in a speech at Everglades National Park commemorating Earth Day. 'It can’t be omitted from the conversation. And action can no longer be delayed.' 'That’s why I’ve committed the United States to lead the world in combatting this threat,' he said, throwing a spotlight on his administration's efforts to reduce the rate of global warming through the reduction of carbon emissions.

'I can’t think of a better way to spend Earth Day than in one of our nation’s greatest natural treasures, the Everglades,' he told his audience, calling the swamp, which he acknowledged is not technically a swamp, 'magical.' 'Climate change is threatening this treasure and the communities that depend on it,' Obama warned. 'If we don't act,there may not be an Everglades as we know it.' The president said the fallout from rising temperatures is 'not a problem for another generation.' At least, 'not anymore,' he said. 'This is a problem now. It has serious implications for the way we live right now.' Obama said the rising sea level in South Florida and inward flow of salt water is evidence that climate change is already having a negative effect on communities. 'This is not some impossible problem that we cannot solve. We can solve it if we’ve got some political will,' he said. 'And we can solve it in a way that creates jobs. We can solve it in a way that doesn’t disrupt our economy but enhances our economy. And it’s a bipartisan issue.'

It said, 'Climate change is also affecting some of the most iconic places in our country, from disappearing glaciers in Glacier National Park to dying Joshua Trees in Joshua Tree National Park.' 'Recognized worldwide as a unique and treasured landscape, the Everglades is a perfect example of the threat we face from climate change, including rising sea levels that result in shoreline erosion and increased flooding.'

"A Perth couple who have been trying for over seven years to have a child may finally get that chance thanks to a crowdsourced egg donor. Sharon and Nick Chalwell put out a desperate call earlier this month after nine failed rounds of IVF and one failed egg donor attempt. After sharing their story with a Perth radio station the couple were inundated with women willing to help them realise their dream of starting a family. Thanks to Shannon Mann, 22, who said she has wanted to be an egg donor for many years, that dream could soon be a reality. Scroll down for video . Perth couple Sharon (left) and Nick Chalwell (right) turned to crowdsourcing to find an egg donor . During their search they were put in touch with Shannon Mann (pictured) who has a two-year-old son, Lucas . Mrs Chalwell, 38, told Daily Mail Australia she and Nick have been trying to conceive since they were married, but found it to be a much rougher road than they imagined. 'There were no ifs or buts about it: we wanted kids, that was just a natural progression but that didn't quite happen,' Mrs Chalwell said. 'I've got a couple of challenges, I've got low ovarian reserves so I haven’t had a cycle for 16 months... I've also got an aggressive immune system in my uterus,' she added. 'Its an understatement to say it’s been an adjustment,' Mr Chalwell told Daily Mail Australia. 'You sort of get married and think right we’ll start a family and it’s just a matter of doing what you’re doing and nine months later a kid comes out.' he said. After first attempting artificial insemination, then turning to IVF in 2009 and attempting to conceive via an egg donor last year, the couple felt as though they were coming to the end of the road. Mrs Chalwell, 38, told Daily Mail Australia she and Nick have been trying to conceive since they were married . 'Its an understatement to say it’s been an adjustment,' Mr Chalwell told Daily Mail Australia . A call-out on their local radio station put the Chalwells in touch with Shannon Mann, who they asked to be their donor . But a call-out on their local radio station put them in touch with Shannon Mann, who already has a two-year-old son. Ms Mann, 22, told Daily Mail Australia egg donation was something she'd always wanted to do, and after the birth of her son she wanted to give someone else the opportunity to experience the same 'sacred' bond. 'I conceived my son while on Implanon (a contraceptive implant), from there my partner and I decided we weren't in a position to bring a child into the world,' she said. Ms Mann revealed that she and her partner at the time made the difficult decision to terminate the pregnancy, but that didn't go to plan either. 'We had the needle to terminate and everything that was supposed to happen happened,' she said. But three months later the then 20-year-old was told the termination hadn't worked, and she was still pregnant. 'At that stage a three-month baby is everything, there’s fingers and toes. I thought I'm going to do this, I'm going to have the baby, I’m going to prove everyone wrong,' Ms Mann said. Ms Mann said she wants to enable others to experience the miracle of having a child . She conceived her son while on contraception but said she wouldn't change it for the world . 'And now I have a very happy and healthy two year old.' Her experience with son Lucas made the 22-year-old ever more determined to share the gift of life with someone else and she had already begun the process of donating when she heard the Chalwell's story. Before they can go ahead the trio need to undergo a number of counselling sessions with Iolanda Rodino, their Clinical Psychologist and a counsellor for Egg Donor cases (pictured) 'I'm thrilled I have the opportunity to give back,' Ms Mann said. 'Its sacred to carry a child.' Mr and Mrs Chalwell are equally as excited to have their egg donor's assistance, and hope this may finally help them realise their dream of having a family. 'It’s such a compassionate and beautiful things for people to even consider,' Mrs Chalwell said. Before they can go ahead the trio need to undergo a number of counselling sessions, one which Chalwells will attend on their own, while Ms Mann too has her own individual session. From there they will all have a group session, before a three-month 'cooling off period' according to Iolanda Rodino, their Clinical Psychologist and a counsellor for Egg Donor cases. 'Basically the primary goal is to prepare, check for ethical dilemmas, make sure that there’s no coercion taking place,' Ms Rodino told Daily Mail Australia. 'And pretty much just ensure there’s informed consent about the psycho-social and legal implications, not just early on but later in life for the child.' 'The overall pictures is not to talk people in or out of being a donor but talk about informed consent,' she added. As Ms Mann is classified as a 'known donor', there also has to be in depth discussion about the role she would potentially play in the child's life. The Chalwells said they wanted to share their story in order to raise awareness about egg donation . Ms Mann described the relationship between a parent and child as a 'sacred' bond . 'I just really believe that you don’t know what true love is until you hold your baby for the first time,' she said . While this could finally mean the Chalwells can start their family, Mrs Chalwell said the situation is bigger than her and Ms Mann. There is a lack of egg donors in Australia, and she hopes by sharing her story it will help raise awareness and encourage people to consider donating. Waiting lists are long and women can sit on them for years to no avail. 'There’s just not enough awareness about egg donors in Australia,' she said. 'You can go out and there’s a lot of awareness about blood donation, but not egg donation.' Mrs Chalwell said she and her husband were prepared to go overseas for a donor before they were put in touch with one in Australia. The trio have to undergo counselling and a three month 'cooling off' period before they can go ahead . When asked what it would mean to them should everything go ahead, Mr and Mrs Chalwell both agreed the situation would be surreal. 'It’s going to be so surreal that it’s actually happened because we've been on this journey for such a long time,' Mrs Chalwell said. 'You've got a goal that seems unattainable and when it finally comes off I can image it would feel very surreal,' her husband agreed. Ms Mann said after sharing her story on Sunrise earlier this week she has been contacted by dozens of women commending her on a 'brave' decision to donate her eggs. But she doesn't see it as courageous. 'I just really believe that you don’t know what true love is until you hold your baby for the first time,' she said. 'My question isn't why would I, but why wouldn't I'.","Nick and Sharon Chalwell have been trying to start a family for seven years .

"Surgeons have removed kidneys that each weighed as much as a newborn baby from an Indian man with a genetic disorder. The giant internal organ reportedly weighed a colossal 6lbs (2.7kg) - and was 20 times bigger thanit should have been. It was was extracted from a 45-year-old suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This condition causes fluid-filled cysts to grow in the kidneys, so they expand in size. Surgeons have removed the kidneys, which weighed as much as a newborn baby, from a 45-year-old man with a genetic disease. Scan shows the kidneys, which had grown to 20 times their normal size . Incredibly, a week after his initial operation at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a second kidney weighing 5.5lbs (2.5kg) was removed. Both kidneys beat the previous record of 4.7lbs (2.1kg), which was removed in Dhule, India, in 2011, according to Guinness World Records. Normally, healthy kidneys weigh between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. The patient was diagnosed with ADPKD, which is potentially lethal, last year. He arrived at the hospital suffering from high fever, blood in his urine and severe abdominal pain before he was admitted. 'I used to remain tired throughout the day due to excessive blood loss,' the patient, whose name has not been released by the hospital, said. It took a team of surgeons three hours to remove the giant organ, before he was then put on dialysis. He will soon receive a kidney transplant. Dr Bhargav, one of the surgeons who carried out the procedure, said: 'The kidney was 20 times the normal size and was stuck around the intestines. Normal healthy kidneys weight between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. One of the kidneys the doctors removed weighed 6lbs (2.7kg) (is is pictured on the scales) 'The patient is recovering and awaiting a kidney transplant.' ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Cysts develop in the kidneys, and often the livers and the pancreas. Over time, they grow and multiple, replacing normal healthy tissue and causing the kidneys to stop working. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms and the cysts won't be noticed until adulthood. They will vary by individual but may include back or abdominal pain, recurrent urinary infections or blood in the urine, kidney stones and kidney failure. Two thirds of adults with ADPKD will develop high blood pressure, and 1 in 12 will develop small brain aneurysms. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small, fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. Although children are born with the condition, ADPKD does not usually cause any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this doesn't occur until 30-60 years of age. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including abdominal pain, high blood pressure, blood in the urine, urine infections and kidney stones. Eventually, kidney function gets worse and worse, until so much is lost that kidney failure develops. ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally.

Aldi told the regulator it would put up signs at the entrance of stores and at registers to notify shoppers of the surcharge, as well as have cashiers inform customers before payments were made. But Fairfax Media reports that Aldi has not consistently disclosed the surcharge to customers and many were unaware about the additional fees. Some stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs at the registers warning of the surcharge are in tiny print. A spokeswoman for the supermarket said Aldi had carried out an audit last year to make sure appropriate signs were visible. 'If for any reason an Aldi store does not have the required signage, we will ensure that this is corrected immediately,' she said. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission took action against Aldi last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge on transactions made using tap and go . Some stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs at the registers warning of the surcharge are in tiny print . Under the ASIC Act, retailers that fail to adequately disclose surcharges, or create the impression that surcharges do not apply, may be considered 'misleading or deceptive'. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said retailers needed to disclose credit card surcharges. 'Merchants need to be transparent about fees and charges where credit card surcharges apply so that consumers can consider using other payment methods without any additional costs,' Mr Kell said. 'Consumers should also be mindful that payments by contactless or 'tap and go' cards are currently treated as credit card transactions, meaning that fees may apply where there are surcharges in place, even where they are using a debit card.' In ALDI stores all credit card transactions and all tap and go payments attract the 0.5 percent surcharge, irrespective of whether customers use a debit or credit card. An ALDI spokeswoman said it has always charged credit card surcharges to 'cover the costs associated with the service'. 'ALDI is aware there are high costs associated with accepting credit cards,' she said. Aldi told the regulator it would put up signs at the entrance of stores and at registers to notify shoppers of the surcharge, as well as have cashiers inform customers before payments were made . 'However, rather than inflating prices across the board, to compensate for the credit card acceptance costs, ALDI prefers customers to make the choice themselves.' Tom Godfrey, spokesman for consumer group Choice, said many shoppers were unclear about the charges that can come with using tap and go. 'Most people don't realise that tap and go relates to credit so obviously if you're using a credit facility surcharges can come with that,' Mr Godfrey said. 'What we take issue with is whether the surcharge is at a reasonable level, and what we have seen is excessive surcharges going on. 'The surcharge at ALDI is not excessive, but I don't think it's great they're charging a surcharge on a debit facility, so people's savings accounts.' Mr Godrey said shoppers needed to ask about surcharges before using tap and go. 'I think it's always important to ask - as you've seen with ALDI, you might assume there isn't a surcharge because Coles and Woolies don't have one,' Mr Godfrey said. 'If you're going to use tap and go you should ask what the surcharge will be, then ask for a surcharge free option.'","Aldi under fire from corporate regulator for not disclosing credit card fees .

"The country’s biggest food bank organisation yesterday claimed the number of people claiming free meal packages from its branches passed a million last year. The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as ‘shocking’ evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were ‘unverified’, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow . Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a ‘political football’. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks – said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday’s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days’ worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: ‘Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.’ The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour’s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: ‘The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. ‘David Cameron’s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. ‘Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts – even for those who paid in all their working lives – are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.’ Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: ‘It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.’ The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust’s figures were ‘unverified’. He added: ‘We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory – whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. ‘The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work – and we’ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' ‘It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.’ The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: ‘We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon – whereas food poverty is not. ‘As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance. To do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support. ‘The issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading. We congratulate the Trussell Trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle. ‘It is high time the OFB model of food bank – which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty – is encouraged and replicated elsewhere.’","The Trussell Trust counted the number of people visiting its 445 branches .

"Bitten: Austin Hatfield, 18, found the venomous water moccasin, also known as a cottonmouth, near his Wimauma home last week  (pictured is Hatfield with the snake that is believed to have bit him) A Florida teen who kept a deadly wild snake in his bedroom as a pet and bragged about how many times he'd kissed it was bitten on the mouth and rushed to the hospital Saturday. Austin Hatfield, 18, found the venomous water moccasin, also known as a cottonmouth, near his Wimauma home last week. He'd been keeping the serpent in a pillowcase when it escaped over the weekend. 'We was sitting in the kitchen and he ran out of the room saying hospital, hospital. Now, now,' Hatfield's best friend Jason Belcher told Bay News 9. Hatfield was rushed to a Tampa hospital in critical condition. Bites from the cottonmouth are known to cause extreme swelling and can lead to death. But leading up to the incident, Belcher said Hatfield wasn't at all concerned. 'Alright he's kissed it 12 times. The 13 wasn't a lucky one,' Belcher said. 'He kisses it right on the head. Right on the mouth. He's not afraid of death.' The snake on Saturday night had escaped from its pillow case and slithered across Hatfield's stomach and off his bed, reports the Tampa Tribune. The fatal bite came Hatfield tried to recapture the snake. Lucky for Hatfield, antivenom does exist for cottonmouths--known by the name because of the white, gaping mouth they often display when threatened. Gary Morse, spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said the worst has come and gone for Hatfield. 'His condition has improved today and he is expected to recover,' Morse said. Outdoorsy: The 18-year-old Florida man is apparently a fan of snakes, as evidenced by at least one other photo on his Facebook . Morse said Hatfield was possessing the snake illegally. In Florida, a a permit is required in order to lawfully keep a venomous pet. The snake had to be captured and euthanized in order to ensure proper identification. Morse urged other budding herpetologists not to make the same mistake as Hatfield. 'It really doesn't want to eat you, but it will protect itself,' he said. 'Cottonmouths have a reputation of being somewhat skittish when you get near them and they will readily defend themselves. 'Alright he's kissed it 12 times. The 13 wasn't a lucky one,' Hatfield's best friend Jason Belcher said. 'He kisses it right on the head. Right on the mouth. He's not afraid of death.'","Austin Hatfield of Wimauma was keeping the potentially deadly snake, AKA a cottonmouth, in a pillow case in his bedroom .

"The principal of an Islamic school has come under fire after he reportedly banned girls from running, amid fears it would cause them to lose their virginity. Former teachers of Al-Taqwa College, in Melbourne's outer western suburbs,  claim in a letter sent to the state and federal education ministers that principal Omar Hallak was discriminating against female students. The Age reported that the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority is currently investigating the allegations. Omar Hallak, principal of Islamic School Al-Taqwa College in Melbourne, reportedly bans his female students from running . This comes a month after revelations that Mr Hallak was telling students at his school that Islamic State was not 'created' by Muslims, but was instead a plot against them by the West. The letter sent to ministers by a former teacher this week about the girls not being able to fully participate in sport claimed Mr Hallak believes there is 'scientific evidence' to back his claims. 'The principal holds beliefs that if females run excessively, they may 'lose their virginity',' the letter said. 'The principal believes that there is scientific evidence to indicate that if girls injure themselves, such as break their leg while playing soccer, it could render them infertile.' The principal of Al-Taqwa College banned female primary school students from participating in the 2013 and 2014 cross country district events, the teacher also claimed. A group of students wrote this letter to Mr Hallak when they discovered they had been banned from competing, and asked him to be 'fair' They said the principal had been unaware that the female students were training for the event, and got involved when he was notified. When they found out they had been prevented from competing, a group of female students penned a letter to their principal asking him to let them compete. 'This letter is about the cross country event that has been cancelled', the letter from 'cross country girls' read. 'Apparantly (sic) it is because girls can't run and that is really offensive to all the girls that were going to participate in the event. 'As a school principal you should treat all the subjects equally just to be fair to all the students that want to participate in a sport event', the letter continued. Last month it was reported that Mr Hallak was teaching students at his school (pictured) that Islamic State was not the doing of Muslims, but rather a plot against them . The note from the group of students also raises that point that 'it doesn't say girls can't run in the hadith (sayings of the prophet Mohammed)' and they should be able to participate as long as they are wearing 'appropriate clothes'. Education minister James Merlino has told 3AW the reports are concerning and the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority is investigating. ""If true these are very concerning reports and I have asked the VRQA to investigate and report back to me,"" Mr Merlino has told 3AW on Thursday. When contacted by Daily Mail Australia Al-Taqwa College refused to comment. Last month it was reported that Mr Hallak was teaching students at his school that Islamic State was not the doing of Muslims, but rather a plot against them. He reportedly shows his almost 2,000 students ‘evidence’ that Islamic State terrorists are ‘not linked to Islam’. ‘We don’t believe Muslims are creating IS,’ Mr Hallak told The Age. He believes that the murder and brutality carried out by Islamic State terrorists is actually a plot by Western countries to control oil in the Middle East.","Al-Taqwa College principal banned female students from running .

"A federal judge has approved a plan to resolve concussion lawsuits brought by more than 5,000 former players that could cost the league $1billion over 65 years. The deal comes after the league has been dogged for years by complaints that it long hid the risks of repeated concussions in order to return players to the field. The NFL expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia someday. The settlement approved on Wednesday by a federal judge in Philadelphia would pay them about $190,000 on average. Senior US District Judge Anita Brody (left) approved the deal on Wednesday after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out. Former Philadelphia Eagles fullback Kevin Turner (right) suffers from Lou Gehrig's disease and led the lawsuit against the NFL . The settlement also includes allowing for monetary awards of up to $5million per claimant for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma. Senior U.S. District Judge Anita Brody approved the deal after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out. The negotiators did not increase the original $765million plan, but agreed to remove that number as the cap. The deal means the NFL may never have to disclose what it knew when about the risks and treatment of concussions. Players' lawyers have argued that the settlement will help families get needed financial awards or medical testing that might take years if the case went to trial. The league expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia someday. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (above) has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent players from getting concussions . The league's top lawyer said Brody's approval 'powerfully underscores the fairness and propriety' of the settlement. 'Retirees and their families will be eligible for prompt and substantial benefits and will avoid years of costly litigation that — as Judge Brody's comprehensive opinion makes clear — would have an uncertain prospect of success,' NFL general counsel Jeff Pash said in a statement. The total NFL payouts over 65 years, including interest and $112million sought for lawyer fees, is expected to be more than $1billion. Critics contend the NFL is getting off lightly given annual revenues of about $10billion. However, plaintiffs would have first had to fight their way into court — instead of getting booted to NFL mediation under their players' contracts — to prevail. About 200 NFL retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually including the family of former New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau (above) Seau (above) committed suicide at his San Diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior. An autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE . 'From a business point of view, (the NFL has)...avoided what may have been the biggest risk to their continued prosperity,' said Andrew Brandt, director of the sports law program at Villanova University law school. 'Removing this as a threat is extraordinary,' he said. The NFL lawsuits, and similar suits filed later against the NHL, the NCAA and others, has fostered debate, discussion and safety reforms about sports concussions. Yet the NFL games seem to be as wildly popular as ever. 'I know people talk about, it's dangerous, and mothers won't let their sons play football. But I don't see that. I don't see that at all,' Brandt said. About 200 NFL retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually. They include the family of Junior Seau, the popular Pro Bowler who killed himself at his San Diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior. An autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The NFL earlier this year said concussions have dropped by 36 per cent after they changed the way players tackle (above David Bruton #30 of the Denver Broncos lies on the ground in pain in 2014) Brody most recently asked for several tweaks, including partial credit for time played in NFL Europe and other developmental leagues, to broaden the settlement. Negotiators quickly agreed to her suggestions. She rejected other complaints raised at a November hearing, including those who say the agreement does not cover future deaths from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can only be diagnosed after death, or contemplate the day when it might be diagnosed in the living. Others oppose the award reductions for older men and those who played fewer than five years in the league. 'Although objectors insist that there must be compensation for CTE, the NFL parties were unwilling to settle claims based solely on a (diagnosis) ... rather than on manifest neurocognitive deficits,' the lead negotiators wrote in a March court filing urging Brody to approve the deal. 'Many of the behavioral and mood conditions claimed to be associated with CTE are prevalent within the general public.'","Senior US District Judge Anita Brody approved deal on Wednesday .

"Crime gangs from Eastern Europe are operating here with 'impunity' due to EU free movement rules, a disturbing report warns today. Human traffickers run huge benefit frauds in the UK, including one that was used to fund a housing development in Slovakia. The vile trade also includes the sale of young girls for prostitution and sham marriages. In some cases, 'customers' from outside the EU are requesting women with EU passports so they can make them pregnant. The migrants – desperate for a foothold in Britain – then claim they have a human right to a family life in the UK to raise the child. Vicious: A menacing Eastern European gang leader with his Rottweiler. Crime gangs from Eastern Europe are operating here with 'impunity' due to EU free movement rules, a disturbing report warns today . The Centre for Social Justice report, written by a former senior aide to Home Secretary Theresa May, is based on interviews with senior police and officials in Britain and overseas. It offers a deeply disturbing insight into how, since the EU expanded to include former Eastern Bloc members in 2004, a huge market has opened up in what it calls the 'modern slave trade'. In the past, trafficking gangs had to bring in migrants from outside the EU – which meant they would need to pass through border controls. But they are now able to target people in impoverished communities in Slovakia, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria with open access to Britain. Migrants are duped into believing they are travelling to the UK for work and enter the country legally under the EU's Free Movement Directive. The traffickers then seize control of their bank accounts and travel documents, and force them to work in often gruesome conditions. The report, written by former Home Office special adviser Fiona Cunningham, says: 'One of the most serious unintended consequences of free movement in the EU is that it has made it much easier for organised criminal gangs to operate their cross-border business models with impunity and without fear of being detected and therefore pursued.' Significantly, the report has the backing of Mrs May, who has written the foreword. She has been one of the Cabinet ministers pushing for curbs on EU free movement – including restrictions on countries whose level of wealth is far below that of Britain. Limits: Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured, has been one of the Cabinet ministers pushing for curbs on EU free movement – including restrictions on countries whose level of wealth is far below that of Britain . The report also warns of Eastern European girls – aged 15 to 25 – being brought to Britain and forced into prostitution, benefit fraud or sham weddings to Asian men seeking a right to remain in the UK. Manchester, Birmingham and Gretna are identified as hotspots – with Scotland targeted so the victims can marry at a younger age. Shockingly, the report found girls were sold to 'customers' for pregnancy so the buyer could claim he had an article 8 right to a family life in the UK. Europol, the EU's crime fighting agency, has identified particular problems with children being brought into the UK from Slovakia. Voters want the Tories to be far tougher on mass immigration, a major survey revealed last night. Barely one in ten Britons say they are satisfied with David Cameron’s border policies. The poll by Ipsos MORI suggests this unhappiness may explain why large numbers of Conservatives are switching to Ukip. The findings will heap pressure on the Prime Minister to end his silence on immigration during the election campaign. He has not mentioned his party’s manifesto pledges to curb EU free movement, deport more illegals and tag foreign criminals. Yet a large proportion of voters believe politicians are talking too little about migration. Blow for Cameron: A new Ipsos MORI survey reveals the huge levels of dissatisfaction with the Government's handing of immigration, especially among former Tory supporters who now plan to vote Ukip . Major issue: Just 12 per cent of all voters are satisfied with the handling of immigration, falling to just 1 per cent of Ukip supporters. Above, charts based on results from the Ipsos MORI survey . They are kept under the influence of drink and drugs, to make them easier to control, then sold for sex. Police in Kent said that, in a single day, 16 such children were taken into care. The report adds: 'Pregnant women are sometimes recruited and forced to sell their babies.' Action: Mr Cameron has also pledged to crack down on abuse of the benefits system by EU nationals . Romania and Hungry were also identified as countries from which criminal gangs are trafficking women for sex. Women who are brought to the UK and forced to work in the sex industry are often moved from city to city, with their services advertised online. One website featured 1,000 women based in London. The report calls on the EU to implement a new system of passenger name records so there is a better chance of tracking people smugglers and their victims who travel by air. But this is being blocked by the EU on privacy grounds. It would also alert the authorities if a suspected people smuggler was headed towards the UK with a child. The report says: 'Exploiting the internet and borders made less defined due to European Union policies like free movement, organised crime groups find the trafficking of victims a highly lucrative and accessible crime.' The Home Office has estimated that, in any given year, there are between 10,000 and 13,000 victims of human trafficking in the UK. In the last Parliament, the Tories passed Europe's first Modern Slavery Act. Traffickers involved in the most serious cases now face possible life sentences. David Cameron has also pledged to crack down on abuse of the benefits system by EU nationals. In November 2013, he announced new rules stipulating that incomers can receive out-of-work benefits only once they have been living in the country for three months. UK benefits scam builds a Slovak village . By Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent for the Daily Mail . A crime gang from Slovakia duped unsuspecting families into travelling to the UK so they could scam hundreds of thousands of pounds in benefits – and send the cash back to a village known as 'Smartie Town'. The profits were funnelled to the 1,000-year-old village of Pavlovce nad Uhom in the Michalove district of Slovakia where they were used to build houses. The homes are partly funded by the UK taxpayer and local residents have nicknamed them 'Smarties' after the chocolate sweets because the houses are painted brightly and in different colours. Vivid: A house in so-called Smartie Town, where a crime gang funnelled profits from a benefits scam. Homes in the 1,000-year-old village, such as the one pictured above, are partly funded by the UK taxpayer . When the gang feared UK officials might become suspicious, they changed tactics – sending the migrants to Canada instead to claim asylum and state support there. The victims, expecting to work legally, had been transported to Britain in coaches. But once they were across the border, the criminals seized their passports and other documents and forced them into domestic servitude, slave labour and welfare fraud – signing up for several state handouts including tax credits. Gang members arranged housing and took their victims to open high street bank accounts using a 'translator' who was also in on the lucrative scam. Benefits were then paid into accounts in the names of the victims but controlled by the traffickers. Scam: Three Slovakian crooks, including Darina Balogova, pictured, raked in £1.2million by bringing 'fake mothers' to Britain to claim benefits falsely . The sums of money made by the Eastern Europeans from trafficking victims using this kind of exploitation were huge. In another case, three Slovakian con artists raked in £1.2million by bringing 'fake mothers' to Britain to claim benefits falsely. They persuaded women from their home country to live in the UK and fraudulently claim child and working tax benefits. The family splashed the vast amounts of cash they pocketed on a life of luxury, gambling in casinos and going on spending sprees to buy gold and diamonds. The crooks – Darina Balogova, her husband Marek Balog, and brother Jaroslav Bado – pulled off one of the largest welfare scams of its kind from a terraced house in Chatham, Kent. Up to 50 women were brought to Britain under freedom of movement rules and groomed to claim falsely that they were working for a temp agency on low wages so they could receive tax credits. After the gang had exploited the identities of the women, they allowed them to return to Slovakia, retaining control of their bank accounts, passports, national insurance cards and birth certificates. Balogova – who never worked a day after arriving in Britain – kept around £30,000 in cash at their headquarters in nearby Rochester. At least £60,000 in stolen benefits were transferred back home. But the scam was finally exposed when the criminals began using a high street stationer's receipt books to write bogus payslips for the women. HM Revenue & Customs inspectors noticed they were using the same employee number on all the slips. In November 2011, at Maidstone Crown Court the gang were jailed for tax credit fraud and money laundering. Balogova was sentenced to four-and-a-half years, while Balog was given three-and-a-half years and Bado three years.

"It is the age old debate but with a modern twist: which Premier League club is the most popular according to Twitter followers. For the first time ever, fans can see a detailed breakdown of how support for every club varies around the world and in the UK supporters can go as in-depth as seeing the three most popular teams in their local constituency. So, what exactly does the data show? The map was created by looking at the official Twitter accounts for each team, using their followers as an indicator of allegiance. Fans can toggle the map to view their club's support worldwide, see the most popular clubs globally and compare their club with a rival. Using the 'Zoom to' function fans can also look at any country around the world. Liverpool may be struggling in the Premier League and looking at a 2015-16 campaign without Champions League football, but in terms of Twitter followers they dominate the UK. Arsenal have strong support in London and the south east and actually have more followers in the backyards of rivals Chelsea and Tottenham. In Manchester, it is a win for Louis van Gaal's United who dominate the area apart from Gorton where rivals City are more popular. United also have pockets of concentrated support across the UK. Chelsea have strong support in the Western Isles, while clubs such as Newcastle, Sunderland, Hull City, Burnley, Stoke City, Leicester City, Aston Villa, Swansea and Southampton dominate their local areas. But while Liverpool completely dominate the UK market, their global appeal is less impressive. Brendan Rodgers' side have a large following across the world with strong support in Thailand, Norway, Iceland, Uruguay and Australia but find themselves playing second fiddle to the Premier League's other giants in other areas. For instance, the rest of Asia apart from Thailand is dominated by Manchester United - who have strong followings in India and Pakistan and edge out Chelsea in Malaysia and Indonesia, too. While in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines it is Arsenal who come out on top. The UK (left) is dominated by Liverpool green while South America (right) is very much a strong hold of Chelsea . London and the south east is a sea of yellow reflecting Arsenal's domination, with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Liverpool (green) North America is somewhat surprisingly dominated by Arsenal (yellow) with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Man United (red) Eden Hazard (left) and Ramires (right) in action for Chelsea against a MLS All-Star team during the club's 2012 tour of America . Somewhat surprisingly, United are only the third best supported team in America - despite touring the states frequently over the years and having American owners. Chelsea beat Van Gaal's side to second but it is Arsenal - whose largest shareholder is American Stan Kroenke - who dominate across the pond. Arsenal and Chelsea also split Europe, with Arsene Wenger's side most popular in northern European countries such as France, Germany and Poland and Chelsea taking the south. Arsenal are also well supported in northern Africa (Algeria and Morocco) but further south United turn South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe red. Across the globe, Arsenal are the most popular team with 5.6million followers, followed by Chelsea (5.4m) and Manchester United (4.8m). The reasons behind support for a club in any country or area are of course complicated, but certain trends can be explained. For instance, there is often huge support in certain countries for national heroes. Ivory Coast is pro-Chelsea because of Didier Drogba, Uruguay is a Liverpool stronghold due to the now departed Luis Suarez and Bosnia and Herzegovina is light blue thanks to Edin Dzeko's presence at Manchester City. Arsenal went on tour to Asia in 2013 and they will take part in the 2015 Premier League Asia Trophy in Singapore in the summer . In Asia it is Manchester United (red) who just edge the overall support from Chelsea (blue) and Arsenal (yellow) Liverpool dominate Twitter followers in Australia with pockets of support for Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United as well . The Melbourne Cricket Ground was packed to 95,000 capacity when Liverpool took on Melbourne Victory in July 2013 . And this trend doesn't just happen at the so-called bigger Premier League clubs. Swansea are well supported in South Korea and Iceland presumably because of Ki Sung-yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Enner Valencia being at Upton Park has boosted West Ham's following in the striker's native Ecuador and Everton are still popular in Cameroon even though Samuel Eto'o has left the club. Owners may also have a factor - in Malaysia QPR have a stronger-than-average following which could be attributed to the popularity of the club's owner Tony Fernandes in the country. Russia and the former Soviet countries are very much Chelsea hotbeds and again this may be down to the popularity of Roman Abramovich. With clubs always jostling to expand their fan base and Twitter growing popularity, this could be the new battle ground for clubs. Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Diego Costa all contribute to the popularity of Man United, Liverpool and Chelsea across the globe .","Twitter has developed an interactive graphic which shows support for all 20 Premier League clubs across the globe .

"A five-year-old Iranian girl who has spent more than a year in Australia's offshore Nauru detention centre has been prescribed anti-depressants, has self-harmed by swallowing shampoo and nails and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, her lawyer says. She is now living in fear of being returned from a holding centre in Darwin to troubled Nauru for years while her family's asylum claim is processed, lawyer John Lawrence said. The girl's father has applied for a protection visa for his family after fearing for his life and fleeing form the military police in Iran. The visa can take up to three years to process according to the Department of Immigration. Mr Lawrence told Daily Mail Australia: 'The prospect of that little girl remaining in any type of detention is horrific; she might not still be alive.' A five-year-old Iranian girl is living in fear of being returned to Nauru detention centre . 'The medical reports tell me there have been reported incidences of her self-harming ... swallowing shampoo and swallowing nails.' He also told the ABC he was concerned about the possibility of abuse at Nauru. 'I have medical material relating to this five-year-old girl, which informs me that she is displaying inappropriate sexualised behaviour, as a consequence of experiences that she has either seen or experienced directly or indirectly, on Nauru,' he said. Mr Lawrence told Daily Mail Australia he met with the girl in detention in Darwin on Sunday and said it is the most heartbreaking case he has ever worked on. 'In over 20 years as a criminal barrister I cannot explain how obscene it is to go on a prison visit to a client across the desk when the client is a five-year-old little girl. 'In the interview with the wee girl on Sunday, I just swooned and thought this is completely beyond the pale and I know she's been a prisoner for over a year in the sh*t pit that is Nauru.' 'I guess like all children she is strong, resilient and lovely, however when you ask her to write her name and she writes her detention number not her name and you ask her to draw her picture and she draws a stick person with a stitched up mouth, you realise how wrong it is for a five-year-old old to be in jail and of course her medical results completely confirm that,' he said. The girl wrote her boat number when asked to write her name, and when asked to draw a picture of life on Nauru drew an image of a person with their lips sewn shut . Mr Lawrence said doctors and psychologists have recommended that she be released and that she shouldn't be returned to Nauru because of her post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder. 'The government have got a child who has been damaged in their detention facility and they know she's been damaged in their facility, she's psychologically seriously damaged and shouldn't be returned to Nauru.' Mr Lawrence said the girl's mother had suffered episodes of depression as well as attempting self-harm. Mr Lawrence will lodge an injunction in the Federal Court against the Department in an attempt to block the family's return to Nauru. A department spokesperson said all detainees had access to health care 'at a standard generally comparable' to that available to the Australian community. But the department would not comment on an individual's medical issues or transfer arrangements. 'Persons brought to Australia from a regional processing centre for medical reasons are clearly informed and clearly know that they will be returned ... to continue their refugee assessment and processing,' the spokesperson said. A former building at Nauru detention centre in Nauru pictured in 2012. Lawyers are fighting to stop the girl being sent back to the island . Last week the United Nations Children's Fund says Australia is violating the rights of children being sent from Nauru to Cambodia under the refugee transfer agreement. UNICEF has joined a chorus of international agencies in raising concerns over the $A40 million refugee resettlement pact with Cambodia, with the first of the refugees expected to be flown out from Nauru this week. UNICEF has warned that no government policy or action should knowingly put children's lives or their well being at increased risk. A UNICEF spokesman, Chris de Bono, said Australia and Cambodia needed to be aware of their international obligation under the convention to protect children. 'The world has an expectation that as signatories to the convention on the rights of the child, whatever action they take, they will have given due consideration to its impact on children and they will put the best interests of the child as a primary concern in making any decision,' de Bono told AAP. A recent Australian report by a former integrity commissioner, Philip Moss, on conditions at the Australian funded centre in Nauru was highly critical and detailed allegations of rape and assault, self harm among children, and trading of sexual favours for drugs. The UNICEF comments come against a backdrop of heightened fears over the welfare of the detainees both in Nauru and at detention centres in Australia, especially the Wickham Point facility in Darwin. On Saturday a number of detainees with at least one three-month-old child were flown from Darwin to Nauru despite protests. In the coming week, possibly as early as Monday, a charter plane is expected to fly out from Nauru with some 10 refugees for resettlement in Cambodia.","Lawyers are fighting to stop Iranian child being sent back to Nauru .

"A heavily armed Algerian jihadi who was preparing to attack churches in Paris on the orders is in custody this morning after being implicated in the murder of a young woman. The 24-year-old, named locally as Sid Ahmed Ghlam, had shot himself in the leg before his arrest by anti-terrorist officers in the 13th arrondissement in southern Paris on Sunday. This afternoon the Paris prosecutor said police found Arabic documents mentioning ISIS and Al Qaeda at the IT student's home, as well as evidence on his computer that he was in contact with a man in Syria 'who clearly asked him to target a church.' Sunday's arrest came just hours after the murder of Aurelie Chatelain, a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor, who was riddled with bullets as she sat in her car in a car park in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Investigators reportedly claim DNA evidence links Ghlam to her murder. Scroll down for video . Sid Ahmed Ghlam (pictured) had shot himself in the leg before his arrest by anti-terrorist officers .

Gathered: This is the student residence  where Sid Ahmed Ghlam - a 24-year-old computer science student suspected of plotting imminent attacks on churches in France - had reportedly been living . French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve today said: 'A terrorist attack was foiled on Sunday morning.' 'The police discovered an arsenal containing weapons of war, and a suspect was immediately taken into custody.' Victim: DNA tests reportedly link the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain (pictured) on Sunday . Mr Cazeneuve said the suspect was found on a street in the 13th arrondissement of Paris with a bullet in his leg, and bleeding heavily. He originally claimed to be the victim of an attack by criminals, but officers followed the trail of blood to his car, where they found a Kalashnikov assaultrifle, and a Sig-Sauer automatic pistol. There were also stolen police armbands which would enable him to pose as a plain clothes officer. In Ghlam's student accommodation, detectives later found three automatic rifles, handguns, and bulletproof vests. There were also Jihadi flags and literature, false passports, and plans for attacks on 'one or two' churches in the Paris area. DNA analysis reportedly linked the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain, who was originally from Caudry, in northern France. The arrested man was an Algerian national studying computer science in Paris, and was known to the intelligence services. The man had been considered a likely candidate to travel to Syria to fight with the Islamic State terrorist organisation, said Mr Cazeneuve, and was officially under surveillance.

"Humpback whale populations are to be declassified as 'endangered' following a successful conservation programme. At one stage the worldwide population dropped to just a few thousand due to over-fishing and hunting, but it has now recovered to 90,000. However, some experts have warned it is too soon to declare the conservation project a success, and that more information is needed to make such a decision. Noaa Fisheries in Maryland says the humpback whale is no longer endangered. They want to break up global population into 14 sub-populations. Ten of these will be 'not at risk', two 'threatened' and two still 'endangered'. It follows a conservation 'success story' that raised numbers to 90,000 . The proposal, by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) Fisheries in Maryland, is to reclassify the global population of humpback whales into 14 ‘population segments’, based on how they have recovered. Ten of these would be deemed ‘not at risk’, two would be ‘threatened’ and two would remain ‘endangered’. The endangered species would be off the West and East coast of Africa, while the threatened species live in water near China and Central America, which occasionally enter US waters. Humans hunted the whales in high numbers, killing 200,000 before their listing as endangered in 1970, four years after the International Whaling Commission banned commercial humpback whaling. The commission put a stop to all commercial whaling in 1986. All the whales remain protected under the Marine Mammals Protection Act, and the US is still an active member of the International Whaling Commission. According to the International Whaling Commission's website, there are only a few places in the world that still allow hunting of humpback whales, and that is for aboriginal subsistence only. Three nations, Japan, Norway and Iceland, still allow the animals to be killed for scientific research. Humpbacks are found around the world, and officials say protection and restoration efforts have increased their numbers in many areas. Among those recommended for delisting is the population that migrates each year from Hawaii to Alaska. Noaa officials said decisions on which whale groups to recommend were based on many factors, including the risks they face. The single largest threat to humpbacks is fishing activities that result in the whales becoming tangled in fishing gear and drowning. Protection and restoration efforts have been taking place over the last 40 years after a dramatic reduction in humpback whale numbers. Until the International Whaling Commission gave them protection in 1966, more than 200,000 were killed by commercial whalers. But since then numbers have risen dramatically, and Noaa says the entire species is no longer endangered and needs to be reclassified. However, even those deemed ‘not at risk’ would still be protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. ‘The return of the iconic humpback whale is an ESA [Endangered Species Act] success story,’ said Eileen Sobeck, assistant Noaa administrator for fisheries. ‘As we learn more about the species - and realise the populations are largely independent of each other - managing them separately allows us to focus protection on the animals that need it the most.' And in a letter accompanying a petition on the change, the president of the Waialua Boat Club on Oahu, Hawaii said the reclassification was needed to protect the ‘integrity’ of the Endangered Species Act. ‘We support the concept of delisting as a success story and like the bald eagle, gray whale, and gray wolf see this as a cause for celebration,’ Edwin Watamura wrote. ‘The integrity of the Endangered Species Act itself is at stake here and by not delisting a recovered species, the ESA becomes suspect, as something other than what it was intended. ‘All of the qualifying parameters for recovery have been met, including the population doubling in 20 years and growth of at least 60 per cent of the pre-exploitation abundance.’ The proposal, by Noaa Fisheries in Maryland, is to reclassify the global population of humpback whales into 14 ‘population segments’ (shown), based on how they have recovered. Ten of these would be deemed ‘not at risk’, two would be ‘threatened’ and two would remain ‘endangered’ Humpbacks travel very long distances when migrating. These two were sighted off the coast of Alaska, on their way to Hawaii, a popular route. This is one of the routes that has been recommended for delisting, as numbers have improved dramatically following the successful conservation programme . However, experts have warned that the reclassification is premature, and risks seeing numbers worldwide dropping to endangered levels again. Sarah Goddard, species policy officer at WWF-UK, said there were other sub-populations of humpback whales aside from these 14 for which data was poor. ‘Concern remains about other discrete and small sub-populations of humpback whales for which information about their status is lacking,’ she said. ‘We cannot get complacent. Unfortunately, these species still face many current threats such as shipping, oil and gas, and bycatch or entanglement. ‘We have to maintain conservation efforts regardless and not let our guard down on global conservation efforts to protect this species.’ Here a humpback whale dives among an aggregation of short-tailed shearwaters at Cape Cheerful, Alaska. Scientists still aren't sure why the whales jump out of the water . And Regina Asmutis-Silvia, executive director and senior biologist for Whale and Dolphin Conservation North America, said the reclassification was coming too soon. ‘Humpbacks are a really complicated species to really review for declaring these distinct population segments,’ she told The Guardian. ‘It’s not so simple as drawing a line and saying: “They belong to this population and there’s a lot of them so we are going to take them off the list”.’ Andy Pool, Head of The Sea Life Trust, added: ‘The sad fact is that, despite that ban, whales are still being hunted on our doorstep here in European waters and we need to do more to protect them and give whale populations here the opportunity to recover in the same way that these humpbacks have.’ And Carl Chapman, from the Norfolk Cetacean Recorder, told MailOnline: ‘It’s important that we concentrate conservation efforts on populations that are still endangered, but I think a more caring society would still offer full protection to all living things. 'Yes, cetacean populations [which include marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises] have increased, but not to anything like the pre-whaling days.’ ‘Why not concentrate on those endangered populations and still leave the global protection in place?’ Noaa is now opening up a 90-day comment period from the public for the proposed change. You can submit comments, information or data through their website.","Noaa Fisheries in Maryland says humpback whale is no longer endangered .

"Genetically engineering plants and crops to change their DNA has been a cause of much controversy in recent years. But new research has found that Mother Nature might be making its own GM food, as sweet potatoes have been found to genetically modify themselves. And this seems to have been occurring for thousands of years, meaning humans have been unknowingly eating GM foods for much longer than they thought. Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes (stock image shown) contain 'foreign DNA'. Agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species. This makes sweet potatoes a 'natural genetically modified organism'. And humans have been eating it for thousands of years . The remarkable finding of ‘foreign DNA’ in the vegetable shows that it contains a type of natural genetically modified organism (GMO). The research was conducted by scientists from Ghent University in Belgium and the International Potato Institute (CIP). Sweet potato is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands. It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old. Despite the name, sweet potato is not related to potato; we eat the tuber from potato, while from sweet potato mainly the storage root is eaten. Other sweet potato parts are edible, such as the leaves. It is not the first instance of natural GMOs to be found, but it is the first in sweet potatoes - a major crop plant. And the researchers say sweet potatoes all over the world contain this genetic modification. The study focused around bacteria called Agrobacterium, sometimes referred to as ‘nature’s genetic engineer.’ It is known to do something called ‘horizontal gene transfer’, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. Agrobacterium is specialised to transfer part of its own DNA, called T-DNA, to plants - and it was this T-DNA that was found in sweet potatoes. In total the researchers studied 291 samples of sweet potato from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania, and found evidence of Agrobacterium in all of them. Agrobacterium is known to do something called ‘horizontal gene transfer’, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. This so-called transgenic process is similar to the artificial process induced by humans (stock image shown) Sweet potato (shown) is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands. It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old . ‘The natural presence of Agrobacterium T-DNA in sweet potato and its stable inheritance during evolution is a beautiful example of the possibility of DNA exchange across species barriers,’ said Dr Lieve Gheysen, one of the researchers involved. ‘It demonstrates that genetic modification also happens in nature.’ The research suggests that the bacterial DNA may have adapted sweet potato for thousands of years in the natural process. The transgenic process - a gene that has been transferred naturally - is similar to the artificial process induced by humans. However, the difference pointed out by the resarchers is that we can control the man-made process, while the natural process is out of our hands. ‘In comparison to ""natural"" GMOs, that are beyond our control, human-made GMOs have the advantage that we know exactly which characteristic we add to the plant,’ said Dr Gheysen.","Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes contain 'foreign DNA'

"The European Union launched a . legal attack on Gazprom on Wednesday, stoking tensions . with Moscow as it accused the Russian gas giant of overcharging . buyers in Eastern Europe and hindering competition. European Commission antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said . Gazprom was barring EU clients from selling on its gas to other . states - a particular concern in recent efforts to aid Ukraine - and pressuring governments to back its pipeline interests. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the charges were 'absolutely unacceptable'. The European Union launched a legal attack on Gazprom on Wednesday, stoking tensions with Moscow as it accused the Russian gas giant of overcharging buyers in Eastern Europe and hindering competition . European Commission antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager (pictured) said Gazprom was barring EU clients from selling on its gas to otherstates . State-controlled Gazprom is a vital supplier of energy to . Europe despite the EU's frequent political disputes with Moscow. The Commission's investigation, opened in September 2012, . had initially covered Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, . Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Relations with Russia, and Gazprom in particular, have since . been poisoned more by the East-West confrontation over Ukraine. 'Gazprom is dominant in all these markets,' EU Competition . Commissioner Vestager told a news conference. 'Our preliminary . view alleges that Gazprom is abusing this position.' 'Gazprom has been able to charge higher prices in some . countries without fearing that ... gas would flow in from where . prices were lower,' she said of contracts with the three . ex-Soviet Baltic states and formerly communist Poland and . Bulgaria. Vestager said prices in some countries were as much as 40 . per cent higher than in others. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite welcomed the . charges, saying: 'The era of Kremlin-backed political and . economic blackmail draws to a close.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the charges were 'absolutely unacceptable' Noting the investigation had begun before Russia annexed . Crimea from Ukraine, Vestager said 'this case is not political' but acknowledged some would see political elements in it. Gazprom responded by calling the charges, to which it has 12 . weeks to respond, 'unfounded' and saying it expected a . resolution within the framework of previous undertakings between . the Kremlin and Brussels 'on the intergovernmental level'. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the EU charges against Gazprom were an unacceptable attempt to retroactively apply the bloc's latest energy rules to earlier contracts. Asked to comment on the case, Lavrov said in an interview with three radio stations: 'All contracts in effect now that Gazprom signed with its partners, were signed with full respect of the legal regime that existed in the EU at the time. 'After the EU adopted the so-called third energy package... there have been attempts, and they continue now, to retrospectively, retroactively apply those requirements to old contracts as well. That is absolutely unacceptable.' The EU has brokered deals to keep gas flowing to Ukraine . despite the conflict between Kiev and Moscow, but efforts to . supply gas via eastern EU states have been hindered by contracts . with Gazprom that prohibit the re-export of Russian gas. Gazprom had also pressured Poland and Bulgaria into . accepting unfavourable terms over gas pipeline control and . construction, the commissioner said. The decision to move against Gazprom comes a week after . Vestager charged U.S. tech giant Google with abusing . its market power, following five years of hesitation by her . predecessor. She said, however, that in other cases she would be . willing to negotiate with firms without pressing charges. The Dane has appeared determined to challenge big corporate . powers since taking on the powerful post in November, regardless . of past offers of compromise from both Google and Gazprom. Despite insisting she would look only at the legal merits of . a case that focuses on Gazprom's pricing policies for different . customers, the accusations will not ease frictions with Moscow . over Ukraine in which gas supplies have played a major role. Gazprom offered concessions to Vestager's predecessor last . year in a bid to settle the case and avoid a possible fine but . talks failed over its refusal to cut prices in eastern Europe. The Russian behemoth, with annual sales of some $100 . billion, supplies about 30 per cent of the 28-nation EU's natural . gas. It has been under investigation since September 2012, . including for hampering the flow of gas across Europe. Vestager can order companies to change their business . practices and is theoretically able to levy fines of up to 10 . per cent of their annual global turnover.","Antitrust chief  said Gazprom is barring EU clients from selling on its gas .

Gripped by what would later be diagnosed as a rare brain disorder, the 40-year-old crashed. She blamed her uncontrollable shaking in the aftermath of the accident on her shock. But over the following days, when she lost control of her bladder repeatedly, she feared something else was to blame. Tests revealed she was suffering functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term for a wide variety of neurological symptoms that doctors cannot explain. Samantha Rawcliffe, 40, from Morecambe, has been diagnosed with the rare condition functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term to cover a range of neurological symptoms . The mother-of-two suddenly lost all control of her body and crashed her car last May. In the days after the accident she lost control of her bladder and was shaking uncontrollably . 'It wasn't a bad accident, but I went home shaken and had a drink,' she said. 'I just couldn't stop shaking. 'The next day I wet myself and I wet the bed for the next three nights. 'But I didn't know what was wrong with me, and thought I had a trapped nerve or something like that. 'Even a year on, I have no feeling in my bladder, and I don't know when I need the toilet or even when I am actually weeing. 'There is no sign that will ever return. 'When I was told I had FND, I didn't even know what  it was and it just isn't out there, it's so rare.' Following her accident on May 26, last year, Mrs Rawcliffe was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital to meet neurologists. They eventually diagnosed the rare illness functional neurological disorder in September, following a series of tests. Last September doctors diagnosed the rare brain disorder. Mrs Rawcliffe is now confined to her house, unable to walk and relies on a mobility scooter. Each day she has to take a cocktail of 32 different drugs . Mrs Rawcliffe, from Morecambe, has since had to give up her job as a teaching assistant, and can no longer drive. She struggles to walk further than eight metres, and relies on a mobility scooter to get around. Functional neurological disorder is an umbrella term that covers a variety of symptoms that cannot be explained. The condition can be as debilitating as Parkinson's disease and MS, and may share many common symptoms. Very few effective treatment plans exist. Physical therapy is often the most effective form of treatment, with the aim of reintroducing proper movement and motor control. Many patients are also prescribed cognitive behaviour therapy. The condition can cause the following symptoms: . Source: FND Hope . The 40-year-old spends most of her time confined to her home, and has to take 32 tablets each day to prevent choking fits and tremors. 'Life is quite boring and I can't do anything myself whether it's washing, showering, cooking cleaning,' she said. 'Before I was diagnosed I was going to the gym five times a week and I loved my job. I'm 40 - I never wanted to retire. 'In fact, I get quite tearful when I think about it and my old colleagues always say there is a hole where Sam should be at work. 'I've got no independence anymore and I sold my car in the end because I was sick of looking at it.' Doctors cannot determine whether the condition had been lying dormant in Mrs Rawcliffe's body before it revealed itself. She suffered a mini-stroke as a teenager but recovered within three weeks and met her husband Phillip a few months later. Despite back pain from another car accident 12 years ago, the mother-of-two has not suffered any other ailments. Power plant technician Phillip, 47, and the couple's children Rhys, 19 and Rebecca, 17, have rallied to help. 'I think the kids took it hard at first - there was a lot of crying,' Mrs Rawcliffe said. 'But I have a big family and support network and they have all adapted so brilliantly. 'I used to be the life and soul of the party and I've never been a miserable person but there is so much that I can't do and it's hard to take. 'I end up kind of mourning for the life that I had had before this.' Mrs Rawcliffe is hoping to raise awareness of the condition by drumming up funds for the organisation FND Hope to help boost support for sufferers.

"Ricky Woolaston, 35, dressed in uniform bearing the University of Birmingham logo to break into students' houses and steal laptops . A thief who tricked his way into students' homes to steal their belongings was caught when he left his old police charge sheet behind which had his name written on it. Ricky Woolaston, 35, posed as a university maintenance engineer to gain access to students' properties before pinching laptops and mobile phones to feed his drug habit. But a court heard he was easily tracked down by police after he left behind his bag at the scene of one of the crimes. Officers searched the rucksack and found it contained a police charge sheet from a previous offence bearing his name and address. The prolific thief was arrested last Friday, and has now been sentenced to four years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to five burglaries. The court heard unemployed Woolaston would walk around the University of Birmingham campus wearing clothes bearing the red-brick university's logo. But he was caught out when he broke into the Biosciences Department on January 29 where he forced open two secure metal cupboards. Nothing was stolen but Woolaston, from Erdington, Birmingham, left behind the bag containing the charge sheet. Police were then able to pin four other burglaries on him with the help of students who  positively identified him. After the case, Detective Constable Jon Green, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Woolaston targeted students at Birmingham University in order to feed his drug habit. However, Woolaston was caught after breaking into the University's bio-sciences lab and leaving behind a bag containing a previous police charge sheet, with his name and address written on it . 'He wore a University of Birmingham top and pretended to be a maintenance engineer in order to enter the student flats and steal electrical goods. 'Unfortunately for him, Woolaston managed to leave vital evidence behind at one of the break-ins, and we are grateful to vigilant students who were able to identify him for further burglaries. 'Woolaston was charged with a total of five offences, and asked for a further five burglaries to be taken into consideration.

"A Vietnam War veteran has been suffering from songs being stuck in his head for weeks at a time in a condition that doctors think may be linked to his service. Gregg Manderson, 68, of St Paul, Minnesota, first sought medical attention after he got Twinkle Twinkle Little Star trapped inside his mind last May, setting off nearly twelve months of doctors his mind shuffling between tunes that are stuck on repeat. He has also hallucinated the theme song to the western 1950s television show Cheyenne had the same mysterious bugle call stuck in his head for years. Minneapolis VA Medical Center neurologist Dr Khalaf Alla Bushara and researcher Roger Dumas have looked for a way to end the earworm, though they have yet to find a cure for the military-style revelry. Scroll down for video . Gregg Manderson, 68, of St Paul Minnesota, has sought medical help after Twinkle Twinkle Little Star first became stuck in his head last May. Sounds including police sirens are stuck in his head for around a month . 'These men and women who served, their service still influences their lives even years later,' Dr Bushara told KARE11. The doctor said that the hallucinations occur in those in hearing loss, when the brain compensates for a lack of stimulation by making its own sounds. Dumas, who used to make drum machines and synthesizers for Janet Jackson and Prince before he got into science, said that music hallucinations are different from how a normal person has a song stuck in their head. He told Daily Mail Online that patients such as Manderson experience their hallucinations as sound, rather than have the consciousness that it is only stuck in their head. Manderson will often be listening to the same song for a month before something new appears, though some, like the bugle call, never leave. He thinks that his mind made up the sound, which no one else can put a name to, though he likes it better than other sounds such as the police sirens that circled around his brain for a week. Roger Dumas, a cognitive science researcher who used to make synthesizers for Prince, helped Manderson identify the song in his head and says the tune is unique because it is self-composed . Dr Khalaf Alla Bushara (left) of the Minneapolis VA Medical Center (right) is trying to help cure Manderson by playing the song repeatedly in hopes that he will tune it out . Dumas said that music hallucinations are most often songs that everyone else knows such as 'Twinkle Twinkle', making Manderson's self-composed song fairly novel. The call was particularly frustrating when he first brought it to the attention of doctors, as he did not know what it was. He originally described it as some sort of brass instrument, and was only able to narrow it down with Dumas's knowledge of synthesizers and knack for creating sounds described by others such as musical artists. 'I'm getting used to it, but I don't like it,'Manderson said of the condition. Dr Bushara is trying to help him rid himself of the current bugle call by playing the song repeatedly in hopes that his patient will tune it out. Musical hallucinations are most common in older people and often bring back melodies heard during youth. Manderson's father was a jazz saxophonist, according to TwinCities.com.","Gregg Manderson, 68, of St Paul, Minnesota, has auditory hallucinations .

"Bride to be: American Hayley Carney hopes to fulfil a 'lifelong dream' of becoming a British citizen . An American transgender woman is preparing to move to the UK to marry a bride she has never met in order to fulfil a 'lifelong dream' of becoming a British citizen. Hayley Carney will undergo surgery to complete her gender transition before moving to live with her fiancee, identified only as Anne, in Plymouth, Devon, later this year. She will then have six months to apply for a marriage visa, which, if successful, will set her on the path to citizenship. Ms Carney, formerly known as Robert, said she has been dreaming of a life in Britain since reading books about it as a child. She added that she feels the nation is more accepting of 'people like her'. But it was only after meeting Anne in an online support group that she decided to make a move to the country she 'has always wanted to call home'. She said: '[Anne] told me months ago that my life would be more comfortable in England, not only because my heart has always been there, but overall Britain is more openly accepting of people like me. 'I cannot wait to be there with her and in a country I have always wanted to call home. 'In my heart, that's always been my home since I could read. I have dreamed of being a British citizen my whole life. 'I have found throughout life that British people are kind and polite. I have several friends I have made over the years and they really are some of the best friends anyone could ask for. 'I have spoken with many people about my upcoming move and they all say that my life would be less complicated and acceptance is found more easily there. 'I cannot speak for more people than I know, but in comparing friends from here in the US to my friends in the UK, my British friends are the most wonderful, caring, loving and accepting people I know.' Moving to Britain: Ms Carney, pictured, will undergo surgery to complete her gender transition before moving to live with her fiancee, identified only as Anne, in Plymouth, Devon, later this year . Ms Carney intends to move to the UK and search for a job before applying for a visa. She said: 'Immigration is a huge concern of mine. What I need to do is get there, settle in, find employment, then follow all proper channels to eventually earn myself a British citizenship. 'Once acclimatised, I will proudly hold my head high and call myself British, but not until I have earned that right. 'When I come home to England, I want it to be for the remainder of my life. 'There are so many reasons people migrate; personally I just want a better life.

"Bearing in mind he’s a dog, Don the border collie did a pretty good job yesterday of piloting a tractor across a motorway. To be fair, however, this probably wasn’t the first thought to strike rush-hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them. Like a scene from Wallace and Gromit, the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank, on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier. Don's owner Tom Hamilton (pictured) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls . The tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road. Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks . Despite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt – but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things. Traffic Scotland tweeted a bizarre warning that there may be hold-ups ‘due to a dog taking control of tractor’, adding: ‘Nope, not joking.’ Appropriately, they couldn’t resist the hashtag: ‘#maycausetailbacks’. Observers and Twitter commentators joined the pun fun by speculating: ‘Police investigating – so far no leads’; or the inevitable: ‘This is barking.’ The incident happened at junction 13 of the M74, near Abington in South Lanarkshire. Sheep farmer Tom Hamilton was travelling across a field in the John Deere Gator farm vehicle with his companion in the passenger seat during their morning rounds. Behind the wheel: Don leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire during rush hour . The vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the M74 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrow . Moments after he got out of the vehicle, it took off with Don at the wheel. Safely back at nearby Kirkton Farm yesterday with Don at his side, Mr Hamilton explained: ‘I was sorting out one of the lambs and hadn’t put the brake on. ‘When I turned around I saw it racing towards the motorway. I ran after it but I couldn’t catch up.’ Traffic Scotland tweeted the news that a dog had 'taken control of a tractor' before adding, 'nope, not joking' Officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and Don was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby Kirkton Farm . Remarkably, drivers managed to avoid the runaway vehicle before it came to crashing halt, and none was hurt. Nor did the black and white border collie (a breed noted for its intelligence and obedience) panic or flee in terror. ‘He didn’t even bark,’ Mr Hamilton said. Police said Don had set the vehicle in motion by inadvertently leaning on the controls. ‘So far people seem to find it amusing,’ Mr Hamilton said. ‘But I think Don’s driving days are over.’ Monty, a giant schnauzer cross, was pictured driving a mini down a race track in New Zealand in 2012 .","The bizarre incident happened on M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire .

"Robbie Knievel has been arrested for allegedly driving under the influence in Butte, Montana - the town his daredevil father Evel Knievel helped make famous. Knievel, 52, was speeding in an SUV on Tuesday evening when he rear-ended a Honda, causing a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles, police said. No one was injured. After the crash, Knievel drove off but his car was found nearby and he was seen walking about a block away, according to Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich. In court: Robbie Knievel, pictured in court on Wednesday, was arrested for DUI in Montana after crashing into another car on Tuesday evening and setting off a chain-reaction crash involving two other cars . Officers noticed that he had a bloody lip and smelled of alcohol, but he refused to perform a breath test and so officers got a search warrant to take a blood sample, the Montana Standard reported. Knievel was booked into jail. On Wednesday, he made his initial appearance in Justice Court. He has been in the area, where he has family, for a couple of weeks, authorities said. Skuletich says Knievel invoked his rights to an attorney but didn't give officers a name. The son of the famous daredevil Evel Knievel has previously admitted to being an alcoholic and pleaded guilty to DUI in South Dakota in August 2013. Like father like son: Robbie is pictured jumping 21 Hummers at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2008 . Icon: American daredevil and entertainer Evel Knievel poses for a portrait before a stunt in 1976 . In that incident, he drove his vehicle into two motor homes as he left a campground and a blood-alcohol test suggested he was nearly three times the legal limit. He received a suspended jail sentence and paid nearly $600 in fines. His driver's license was also suspended for 30 days. Following the arrest, he spoke with 'TMZ Live' and admitted that he had an alcohol problem. 'I'm a frickin' drinking, driving daredevil,' he told the show. 'I ride motorcycles and I friggn' drink and ride … that's my deal.' They also asked him how he would feel if he hurt someone while he was behind the wheel. 'I shouldn't be drinking and driving 'cause I could kill somebody,' he said. 'And you know what, it would be better if I killed myself.' Together: The two Knievels are pictured together in 2006 - the year before Evel passed away, aged 69 . Knievel appeared in his father's stunts as a child and has continued working as a daredevil in his own right, while his older brother, Kelly, overseas the Knievel brand. Among his most famous stunts, Robbie Knievel, a father-of-two, jumped over the Grand Canyon in May 1999 - succeeding where his father had failed years earlier. To complete the jump, which was televised by Fox, he soared 228 feet (69 meters) across a narrow part of the canyon on his a 500 cc motorcycle. Evel Knievel, who famously jumped lines of cars and buses, and attempted to hurdle sharks, canyons and anything else, passed away in 2007, aged 69.","The daredevil, 52, 'was speeding in an SUV when he rear-ended a car and set off a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles on Tuesday'

"Some are smiling, some waving, while others have the strain of their torturous journey etched on their faces. Whatever the emotions running through their young minds, these children are very much the lucky ones. They are among the latest group of migrants to have safely reached land after a desperate voyage across the Mediterranean that has claimed the lives of so many others. Of the 446 people on board the Italian rescue vessel, the navy said 59 of them were children, who were no doubt unaware just how perilous their boat trip could have been. Scroll down for video .

Relief: A girl waves after being rescued from the Mediterranean with 445 migrants on their way to Europe . They were dropped off in the Sicilian port of Augusta today after their smuggler boat was picked up off the southern coast of the Italian mainland. Their parents had gambled everything to seek a new life in Europe and on this occasion they were lucky it didn't end in tragedy. The same couldn't be said for the 900 men, women and children feared dead after their boat capsized on Sunday in one of the biggest maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. It also follows deeply distressing images showing the body of a young migrant being brought ashore after he drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Rhodes on Monday. Greek police yesterday arrested two suspected people smugglers over the disaster which happened when a wooden boat ran aground on rocks, killing three people. The two Syrian men, aged 26 and 27, were among the 90 survivors of the tragedy, some of whom were filmed being pulled to safety after clinging to wreckage in rough waters.

A woman (left) gives milk to her son as she arrives with others migrans at the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . In the wake of the tragedies, Italy has pressed the European Union to devise plans to stop the tide of migrants on smuggler boats in the Mediterranean. Italian defence minister Roberta Pinotti said refugee camps should be set up in countries bordering Libya and human traffickers must be targeted with military intervention. 'We know where the smugglers keep their boats, where they gather,' Ms Pinotti said. 'The plans for military intervention are there.' She was speaking a day before EU leaders hold an emergency summit in Brussels on the crisis. Ms Pinotti said she was cautiously hopeful that the EU summit would take tangible steps to deal with the migrant crisis. Hundreds of migrants have been arriving on Italian shores for days after being rescued at sea when their overloaded boats run into problems. 'We think it's the moment in which Europe decides, forcefully, to have an international police operation, which will undo this band of criminals,' Ms Pinotti said. Rescued migrants walk along the quayside after disembarking from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica in Sicily . Italy has pressed the EU to devise plans to stop the tide of migrants on smuggler boats in the Mediterranean . Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has urged the European Union to craft long-range, comprehensive policy on the migrants. He said one way would be to establish refugee camps in Niger, Sudan and elsewhere in Africa with UN assistance. Italy has saved some 200,000 migrant lives at sea since the start of 2014. But Italy's 'noble, generous reaction alone isn't enough', he said. 'We are asking Europe to be Europe, not just when it's time to devise a budget.' He said broad, long-term EU strategy, with wider sea patrols and a robust presence in southern Libya, would help combat '21st-century slave drivers' of migrants. Ms Pinotti said Italy would be ready to take the helm of any military intervention if asked and as long as it is carried out as an international mission, backed by the United Nations. 'We're ready to do our share. We're the closest country to Libya,' she said. Exodus: Of the 446 people on board the Italian rescue vessel, the navy said 59 of them were children . Displaced: Hundreds of migrants have been arriving on Italian shores for days after being rescued at sea . Growing problem: Italy has saved some 200,000 migrant lives at sea since the start of 2014 . Distressing: A man brings the body of a young migrant ashore after he drowned in a shipwreck off Rhodes . The defence minister said the flow of migrants is not about to stop, saying: '90 per cent are from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia, from places where they are afraid of dying. 'We cannot stop them' from leaving their homelands. Mr Renzi and Ms Pinotti indicated that requests for asylum could be processed in refugee camps in African countries near Libya. These could include Tunisia, Niger and Sudan. Italy's defence minister said that it would then be up to all EU countries to take their share of migrants found eligible for refugee status or asylum. Because Italy is the first EU country the migrants set foot in, they stay in reception centres, sometimes for years, while their requests or appeals for asylum are processed. Migrants deemed ineligible for asylum are ordered to be expelled, but many slip away and head to northern Europe to reach relatives.

"A middle-aged grandmother and her husband are defying their critics by celebrating their tenth wedding anniversary, despite their 29-year age gap. William Smith was just 15 when he fell in love with his best friend's mother, Marilyn Buttigieg, who was then 44 years old. The couple, from Crawley, West Sussex, shared their first date and kiss in September 2005. They came under fire from family and friends for the substantial age gap when they became an item when William was 16. Scroll down for video . William Smith was just 16 when he fell in love with his best friend's mother, Marilyn Buttigieg, then 44 . But they feel they have proved their critics wrong because they are still together. The pair tied the knot six years ago this month, after being together for four years. Grandmother-of-eight Marilyn, now 54, said: 'The age gap doesn't matter. Age is just a number and it's about time people got over it.' William, now 25, says it was love at first sight when he clasped eyes on Marilyn - after being invited round to play computer games with her son. William, who unusually took his wife's surname when they got married, said: 'Three or four months went by, then another couple of months - I didn't have the courage to say anything about it, probably due to the fact of the age gap, and the fact she was my mate's mum.' The grandmother-of-eight, 54, said: 'The age gap doesn't matter' and she 'Couldn't wish for anything better' When he finally asked her out, the mother-of-seven dumped her then husband and entered a relationship with the teen. The couple faced a lot of criticism from people who disapproved of the 29-year age gap and predicted the marriage was doomed to failure - and Marilyn's children have all but cut off contact with the loved-up pair. Marilyn, who works at a doctors' surgery in Crawley Down, said of their marriage: 'I couldn't wish for anything better than my marriage and husband. 'We proved all critics wrong. Everybody was saying it wasn't going to last - we've proved we are a real thing.' William added: 'I don't look at Marilyn and think, 'She's nearly 30 years older than me.' She's a nice person so age doesn't matter.' William says it was love at first sight when he clasped eyes on Marilyn . Mother-of-seven Marilyn said she and William still had to put up with people giving them the occasional odd looks in the street. Previously-wed Marilyn added: 'I suppose we always will but people should realise by now after all these years it's a real thing and let us be. We thought it would stop. 'We would always have the odd looks, we don't really care to be honest. 'We've had so much grief over the years nothing shocks us any more. The age gap doesn't matter. 'Age is just a number and it's about time people got over it.' William said he had noticed how time seemed to be flying by as he and his wife built their life together . Marilyn hates her 'cougar' tag, and insists there are double standards for men dating younger women. She said: 'It's OK for a man to do it, why is it not OK if a woman does it?' Like many young husbands, William said he had noticed how time seemed to be flying by as he and his wife built their life together. He said: 'Everything is good in our relationship. I just cannot fathom where the time has gone. Our main goal is to make more memories. 'Hopefully time slows down a bit because it's going too quickly.'","William Smith was 15 when he fell in love with Marilyn Buttigieg, then 44 .

"Dr Christopher Valentine (pictured) used his iPod to take illicit photos of patients, a tribunal heard . A doctor who was allowed to continue working after taking intimate photographs of patients has been caught doing it again, it emerged yesterday. Dr Christopher Valentine, 52, was sacked from a sexual health clinic and hauled before the General Medical Council nine years ago for photographing half-naked male and female patients without consent. His behaviour was branded ‘inappropriate’ but he was not struck off and went to work at an NHS service for drug addicts and alcoholics. However, the married doctor has been caught again after a nurse saw images of a semi-naked man on his iPod Touch during a night out. Fiona White was stunned to find the pictures while looking at others he had taken of colleagues at a a leaving do. Valentine told her the image – which appeared to be of a man’s genitals – was of a patient’s heroin injection site, but Miss White and another nurse who saw it were suspicious and decided to report him to his boss. Yesterday, the Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal in Manchester heard that Miss White saw the pictures on the iPod in April 2013 at a leaving party for a member of Clydebank Community Addiction Team, a unit led by Valentine that treats addicts near Glasgow. Giving evidence at the fitness-to-practise hearing, Miss White said: ‘He started taking photographs around the table and I asked to have a look at them. He handed me the device and I scrolled through and saw photos of people at the table and came across a photo of his cat. ‘I kept going and came across a photo of what I would describe as a male groin. I didn’t look close but I remember getting such a shock.’ Miss White gasped at the image, prompting her colleague Maria Forrester, who was sitting next to her, to look at the iPod, too. Mrs Forrester, a senior addiction nurse, said: ‘In the blink of an eye I could see what she had reacted to. It looked like it was a part of a male body. She seemed quite startled. A nurse was swiping through photographs of Dr Valentine's pets when she came across an image of a semi-naked man, a tribunal . ‘I remember Dr Valentine saying these were pictures of injection sites. I think I did see genitals.’ Mrs Forrester said she met Miss White later to discuss their concerns, adding: ‘There was a consensus that both of us had seen a naked image of part of a male’s body. 'I was concerned that patients were being photographed without consent. I thought I had to report this. 'I couldn’t think of any reason why that doctor would have pictures of patients’ groins.’ Valentine told his boss he took the photos for teaching purposes and used his iPod because he was unable to use NHS equipment. The fitness to practice hearing took place at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (pictured) in Manchester . But an investigation found he used the device to take 53 photos, some of vulnerable patients of both sexes. Some were stored on his home computer. More than half had been deleted when the iPod was seized and had to be retrieved by IT specialists. Valentine, of Dunoon, west Scotland, admitted ten allegations of taking photographs without medical reason or consent and showing them to colleagues. He denied lying to his boss about how many he had taken and keeping them on his device until August 2013. The hearing continues.","Dr Christopher Valentine's colleague saw the pictures on his iPod Touch .

"A first-of-its-kind 3D simulation has revealed what happens when two supermassive black holes dramatically collide in a disk. The video swoops around the disc of superheated material known as a quasar surrounding the black hole, showing how it takes shape. And the simulation is particularly interesting, because recent observations show two such black holes are going to collide in just seven years - so the prediction can be tested in real life. Scroll down for video . University of Illinois scientists have created the first 3D simulation of merging black holes (shown) in a disk. It shows what happens when two supermassive black holes collide . The simulation was led by scientists at the University of Illinois and included Dr Roman Gold, Dr Vasileios Paschalidis, Dr Stuart Shapiro, Dr Milton Ruiz, Dr Zachariah Etienne, and Dr Harald Pfeiffer. To make the simulation, the researchers used Einstein’s general theory of relativity coupled with equations that govern how matter moves near the speed of light in a magnetic field. In the simulations, the processes taking place as the two black holes merge is shown. As they come closer, the magnetic field lines around the two become erratic, while the jets firing out from the ‘poles’ of each object merge into one. Gravitational waves - ripples in space-time caused by such an event - are also predicted to be created by the merger, while electromagnetic energy is blasted into space. Once merged, the material around the black holes continues to swirly intensely. Known as a quasar, this is a region of superheated dust and gas that surrounds supermassive black holes. They are extremely bright and power the centre of galaxies. At the centre of our Milky Way, for example, a bright quasar surrounding the supermassive black hole is visible. This first simulation shows the gas and magnetic fields as the two supermassive black holes collide . This second simulation shows the gravitational waves - ripples in space-time - in the merger . Material swirls around the objects in a quasar and jets fire out from the poles in the merger. It comes after two black holes were found to be seven years from merging. Shown here are gravitational waves produced . The simulation takes on added significance because, just the other day, it was revealed that two black holes 10.4 billion light years away are likely to collide in seven years. The discovery was made using data from the Pan-Starrs telescope in Hawaii. Each of the black holes found inside the quasar PSO J334.2028+01.4075 has the mass of ten billion suns, and this simulation could provide an insight into what will happen if - or when - they merge. ‘As a technical achievement, there’s no doubt that this [simulation] is a giant step forward,’ Dr Cole Miller of the University of Maryland in College Park, who was not involved in the study, told Nature News. ‘This merger would be amazing, if we saw it.’ Supermassive black holes at the centre of large galaxies could be powering blasts from deep inside the galaxy's core, astronomers have claimed. Astronomers have sought the driving force behind these massive molecular outflows for years, but now a team of University of Maryland scientists has found an answer. The huge outpourings of material are responsible for ejecting enough dust and gas to build more than a thousand stars the size of our sun every year. And these outflows could also remove huge quantities of star-making gas, dictating the size, shape and overall fate of galaxies. Gravitational waves - ripples in space-time caused by such an event – are also predicted to be created by the merger (illustrated), while electromagnetic is blasted into space . However, astronomers note that it is not a certainty the observed quasar has two colliding black holes inside it. The evidence so far comes from fluctuations in the quasar’s light - but this could just be due to a single black hole and a disc, rather than an orbiting partner. Nonetheless, astronomers will be keen to observe it in further detail in case their predictions turn out to be correct. And if so, it could also provide a rare opportunity to observe gravitational waves - ripples in space time that occur during such a massive event like this.","University of Illinois scientists create first 3D simulation of black holes .

"Embattled Kim Richards stormed out of an interview with Dr Phil McGraw after a highly emotional discussion of her alcoholism, Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. The hysterical Real Housewife broke down in tears and went into full meltdown  as observers revealed she bolted from the room where Dr Phil had offered to help place her in a top treatment program. But Richards apparently snubbed Dr Phil's offer of help as eyewitnesses in the hallway heard her scream 'F***', and other obscenities when she ran out of the room and down the hall. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tarnished star: Kim Richards leaving the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, where she had an emotionally-charged interview with Dr Phil McGraw after her arrest last week. Her sister Kathy is seen behind . In denial: The hysterical Real Housewife broke down in tears and went into meltdown as observers revealed she bolted from the room where Dr Phil had offered to help place her in a top treatment program . Richards, 50, was arrested last week and charged with public intoxication, trespassing, resisting an officer and battery on a police officer . Three of Richards' children, Brooke, 29, Chad, 22 and Kimberly, 20,  who were there to support their mother, were shell-shocked by their mom's outburst, struggling to control their emotions as she left the explosive interview. Daughter Whitney, 23, was not at the luxury Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills for the interview. But Richards, 50, arrested last week and charged with public intoxication, trespassing, resisting an officer and battery on a police officer following a drunken incident at the Beverly Hills Hotel, demonstrated she is clearly in denial over her problems. Daily Mail Online can reveal that when Richards fled from the room,  the star's son Chad was overheard talking to his mom pleading with her to go in to rehab. He revealed the star is battling more demons, including taking pills and smoking pot on top of her relapse into drinking. An eyewitness at the hotel told Daily Mail Online: 'Kim insisted that any program had to fit her needs, saying she wouldn't go out of state, wanted to do a 30-day not 60-day program, didn't want to miss her daughter Brooke's wedding in May and was worried about being away from Monty.' Kim's ex-husband Monty Brinson - who is battling lung, brain and spine cancer - continues to lean on her for support. First husband Monty, father to eldest child Brooke, has stage 4 cancer and has been living with Kim. Tears streaming down her face, a determined Richards ran down the hall leaving onlookers stunned. She fled toward her own hotel suite where an entourage of friends was waiting. Elder sister Kathy Hilton was also there. She was overheard angrily ranting: 'You can forget this whole thing, here's your microphone I'm done, I'm leaving, I wanna talk to my family. The observer said: 'She was really angry and made it clear she was done.' Richards' daughter Brooke ran after her mom after she exited and they were heard arguing. Richards told her daughter: 'I'm not going down there, I'm not going for three months and I'm not going to miss your wedding.' But Brooke asked her mom to please work the program. She was overheard to say it's on the beach, it's local and she would be able to go to Brooke's wedding. 'What's the big deal?, ' Brooke yelled. 'Why do you have to be so f***ing picky, just go get the help you need. You have to do this mom.' But Richards insisted she's happy to see her own doctor and therapist. She hit back telling Brooke was making her anxious. 'I'm not going back in there, I'm done.' She said she whatever she did would be with her family. 'I'm not drinking every day,' she was overheard to shout. Brooke was followed to the hotel suite by her siblings Kimberley and Chad. Support system: Kim with her son Chad and daughter Kimberly, who were at the session to support their mom . Bride-to-be: Brooke, Kim's oldest child who is getting married next month, was also there for her mother . Richards in Los Angeles following her arrest  during a drunken incident at the Beverly Hills Hotel . 'The children urged their mom to return to the interview, but she wouldn't budge,' said the eyewitness. 'Kim was furious. She had a complete melt down' This outburst was followed by Chad unwittingly revealing further demons his mom is battling. He told his mom that while she he wasn't saying she was drinking every day she was still drinking once in a while - and taking pills and smoking pot. After things calmed down Dr Phil stopped by Richards' room. Richards, who seemed a lot calmer, rambled: 'I do respect you and admire you… I do trust you, I don't know you, but I know you, so I can trust you and my kids trust you.' She said she needed to speak with her life-coach and doctor before making a decision on her treatment and added that she needed to think about it. Dr Phil told her he was sorry if it doesn't work out. 'I think you guys (her children) agree right?' He was overheard to say. 'I want to do it, I just need to be in a safe place and need to know where I'm going,' she was overheard saying. Urging her not to make any more excuses, 'I think you've covered them all,' he added: 'Don't cheat yourself, don't cheat your kids, just remember I told you that.' Since she first appeared on the hit reality show in 2010, Richards' sobriety has been her major storyline, with her recent relapse driving a wedge between Kim and sister Kyle's already strained relationship. She claimed on the show that she only had one incident, when she was in a great deal of pain from an ulcer and Monty gave her a mystery pill to help as she had to go film early in the season. The resulting slurred speech and drunken-seeming antics at a ladies poker night galvanized the women on the show. And the marijuana revelation by Chad is new one, and follows a Housewives trip to Amsterdam later in the season where all the ladies except Kim went to a coffee shop to try edible marijuana. Kyle refused to try it on camera, but Brandi said Kim's sister does smoke pot recreationally. Kim loudly abstained from the whole marijuana situation and said she was maintaining her sobriety. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the former child star may be booted off the Bravo show as producers feel she has become a liability due to her issues with substance abuse. Expect the fireworks when Kim appear with Dr. Phil McGraw on his show next Tuesday, April 28 . Kim was arrested for at the swanky Polo Lounge at the famed Beverly Hills Hotel . Sibling revelry: Don't let the smiles fool you. The sisters have had major issues over Kim's drinking problem . TMZ alleges that Bravo is concerned that due to the nature of the show, they could be held accountable if something was to happen to Kim. There have been no permanent decisions made however, according to the gossip site. The next season of RHOBH has a few months before production picks up again so the final decision has yet to be concrete. Currently, Kim is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10. According to the Richards family friend, Kim's drunken actions were brought on after watching the three-part reunion for the seventh season, which left her 'distraught' and 'very embarrassed'. But that wasn't the only cause. 'A big part of all of this is that she is just stressed out,' the pal explained. 'She is under a lot of pressure, especially because of Monty.' Dr Phil's interview with Richards is set to air on April 28, her first for a national audience since the arrest.","Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star confessed to Dr. Phil that she is struggling with alcohol in emotional interview set to air April 28 .

"A company has released matches that continue to burn even when submerged in water or buried underground in dirt. The UCO Stormproof Matches are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to them and will start burning again once they come into contact with oxygen. The unique matches have to go through rigorous testing to make sure they keep alight in even the most difficult situations. Scroll down for video . Indestructable: The UCO Stormproof Matches (pictured) are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to it and will start burning again once it comes into contact with oxygen . Eric Moe, the product specialist at Industrial Revolution which owns Utility, Comfort and Originality (UCO), explained the process. The Stormproof matches are made by UCO which has been making outdoor accessories for the past 44 years. They include 25 matches in a completely waterproof case with and three strike pads. The matches cost £5.47 ($7.99) from UCO's website and are available from the UK distributor Dalesman International. He said: 'The match sticks are dipped into our coating, which keeps smouldering even underwater, then reignites once exposed to oxygen. 'Essentially, you aren't burning the match stick, but burning the coating on the stick. 'We have drenched them in buckets, buried them in mud, and blown them with a compressed air hose. 'In all cases the flame keeps burning. The matches will still ignite if they get wet, and they are quite impact resistant.' Even when buried in sand (left), the matches can burn again once they are taken out and exposed to oxygen (right). They can also keep smouldering even while underwater . Mr Moe, 31, from Milton, near Seattle, Washington, US, said when you are in unfamiliar terrain, having a source of fire is vital for survival. He said: 'Whether they're in a snowstorm, rainstorm or wind storm, the UCO Stormproof Matches will offer heat and light. 'The importance of being able to create a fire in inclement weather cannot be overstated. 'These matches are designed to ignite and keep burning in the worst conditions. 'Everything is more challenging when you are cold and wet, and it is crucial to have reliable equipment.' The makers explained that essentially, the match stick isn't burning, it is the coating on the stick that is alight: 'We have drenched them in buckets, buried them in mud, and blown them with a compressed air hose' Here the match is shown being dipped into water (left), and when it is take out (right) it is still able to burn . He explained that other devices that are used to light a fire are not always reliable. Mr Moe said: 'Lighters can fail at high altitudes, or if wet. Standard matches have little resistance to elements. Primitive techniques are excellent, but hard to execute in poor weather.

"Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton got her budding presidential campaign's first targeted question about the deadly 2012 Benghazi terror attacks on Tuesday night, and her answer was the sound of one hand clapping. The bash-the-rich candidate flew first class from Boston to Washington, D.C. after wrapping up a two-day New Hampshire campaign trip. Daily Mail Online was on the flight. 'Mrs. Clinton, when are you going to start talking to the press about Benghazi?' Daily Mail Online asked her in the Washington Reagan National Airport terminal. 'Did you make mistakes?' The usually garrulous and broad-smiling Clinton stared straight ahead, continued walking alongside her Secret Service and local police escorts, and said nothing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NO COMMENT: Hillary stared ahead and walked wordlessly Tuesday, refusing to acknowledge her first campaign-trail question about the deadly Benghazi terror attacks in 2012 . DEADLY: The September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attacks killed four Americans including the US ambassador to Libya . WRONG: Both President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Clinton incorrectly blamed the Benghazi attacks on protests sparked by a YouTube video mocking Islam's prophet Muhammad. The two are shown at a ceremony held to receive the remains of the four Americans who were killed at the scene . Moments earlier, she answered a question about why her taxpayer-funded security detail had sped at 80 MPH past exits for the smaller Manchester, New Hampshire airport, and trekked all the way to Boston for a flight with first class seats. 'You know, I don't make the travel arrangements. I don't,' Clinton said. The Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah's military-style Benghazi attacks will likely be a thorn in Clinton's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign season. The group laid waste to a State Department facility while she was America's top diplomat. A special congressional committee chaired by South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, has a mandate to investigate the episode through January 2017, making it unlikely that Clinton will be able to put the issue behind her. TROUBLE AHEAD: New Hampshire resident Brian Blackden included 'Benghazi blood' Tuesday on a sign listing reasons 'Hillary is a liar,' near the site of a Clinton appearance at the New Hampshire Technical Institute . On Sunday during a series of 50 brief interviews with Dartmouth College students in Hanover, New Hampshire, 22 of them made references to Bengahzi when asked about Clinton's chances of becoming president. Many of them, like freshman Cameron Poole, weren't old enough to drive when it happened. 'I think there was blood on her hands,' Poole told Daily Mail Online. He said he believes Clinton's performance before, during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office. 'I definitely do,' he said. 'It shows how she acts under pressure.' NOT FORGOTTEN: U.S. Ambassader the Libya Chris Stevens was the first to die in Benghazi, and was seen by Libyans as a moderate – angering anti-American hardliners from radical Islamist groups . CASUALTIES: US Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith (left), US Navy SEAL Glen Doherty (center) and US Nacy SEAL Tyrone Woods (right) perished in the Ansar al-Shariah attacks in Benghazi . Four Americans lost their lives in the September 11, 2012 terror attacks, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, the first American ambassador killed while on duty since 1979. U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith also perished in the initial barrage of mortars and automatic weapons fire. Hours later, a second wave of attacks hit a CIA annex compound nearby, killing CIA contract soldiers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both U.S. Navy SEALs. The four men came home in flag-draped caskets. Congressional Republicans want answers about Clinton's involvement in what they see as a potential cover-up of facts surrounding how the attacks unfolded and why – and how the Obama administration explained it afterward, just weeks before an election. Part of the swirling controversy involves a home-brew email server that Clinton exclusively used for her official electronic communications while she was secretary of state. Clinton never used an official 'state-dot-gov' email address, but told reporters on March 10 that she had given the State Department copes of 'official' emails – and acknowledged deciding herself which ones qualified. She deleted the rest, some 32,000 messages in all. Clinton's attorney has refused to hand over the server to congressional investigators. Gowdy, the Benghazi committee chairman, wants a neutral third-party to examine it and determine if Benghazi-related emails can be recovered. His committee said Wednesday that its report on the Benghazi attacks won't likely be finished until 2016, putting its release squarely in the middle of the presidential campaign's most hotly contested months. But the committee said in a statement that 'Secretary Clinton’s decision to seek the presidency of the United States does not and will not impact the work of the committee.' Clinton's State Department infamously declined to provide her Benghazi outpost with the beefed-up security presence its station chief requested in the weeks preceding the deadly Ansar al-Shariah attacks. She claimed later that she never saw the requests, insisting that such routine diplomatic cables would never have made it to her desk, even if they were addressed to her. FIRST CLASS: Hillary (seated at the front, right) traveled in luxury from Boston to Washington, seated next to chief of staff Huma Abedin, after am 80 MPH Secret Service dash to Logan International Airport . FAREWELL: Hillary Clinton waved at the end of her final campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday, before hitting the road to Boston for the same Washington-bound flight that Daily Mail Online flew on . In the days following the attacks, Clinton said publicly that it was the result of a spontaneous protest over a YouTube video made by an American – a film that insulted the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Such protests were seen in other Muslim countries, but U.S. intelligence determined in real-time that the Benghazi attacks were well-organized and easily traced back to an Islamist terror network. Months later, following a concussion that delayed her congressional testimony about Benghazi, she testified in a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Just days earlier, lawmakers disclosed that a top U.S. diplomat told them 'everyone' at the American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi knew 'from the beginning' that they were in the middle of a terrorist attack. 'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton told the senators. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans?' 'What difference at this point does it make?'","Former secretary of state landed Tuesday night at Washington Reagan National Airport after a first-class flight from Boston .

"Israel marked its annual day of remembrance for fallen troops and slain civilians on Wednesday, with the country standing to attention for two minutes while sirens wailed. Yom Hazikaron - or Memorial Day - is held the day before Israel's independence day, linking the sacrifice of soldiers with the creation and protection of the state. Under law all places of entertainment, including cinemas, theatres and nightclubs are closed during the sombre day, and many Israelis attend memorial services for relatives and friends who have died in conflict.

According to the Israeli ministry of defence, 116 security force personnel have been killed in the line of duty, over the past year alone. In total, Israel remembers 23,320 fallen since 1860 in fighting for the national cause. On television, one of the state channels screens the names of all the deceased in chronological order over the course of the day. That year, 1860, is when Israel considers to be the start of the conflict with the Palestinians when Jews founded the first neighbourhood outside the walls of Jerusalem's Old City. In addition, 2,538 civilians have been killed in political violence since 1950, including 122 foreign visitors, according to National Insurance Institute figures. Remembrance ceremonies began at sunset on Tuesday and continue until nightfall on Wednesday when the sombre mood gives way to raucous celebrations marking 67 years since the declaration of the Israeli state on May 14, 1948.

"Whether or not a person suffers hearing loss due to loud noise may depend on their genes, research suggests. Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common work-related illnesses and members of the armed forces are particularly vulnerable. In 2013, the US Department of Veterans Affairs reported hearing loss as one of the most common ailments among veterans receiving disability compensation. Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common work-related illnesses, doctors have warned . Now, however, scientists at the University of Southern California believe they have made a breakthrough in their understanding of the condition. They have identified a gene, named Nox3, found in the inner ear, that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss. Their research, looking at the DNA of mice exposed to noise, is the first published genome-wide association study on noise-induced hearing loss in mice. As a result of the findings, those at higher, genetic risk for hearing loss can decide whether to take precautionary measures to protect their hearing prior to hazardous noise exposure, the study authors say. 'Understanding the biological processes that affect susceptibility to hearing loss due to loud noise exposure is an important factor in reducing the risk,' said lead study author Professor Rick Friedman. 'We have made great advances in hearing restoration, but nothing can compare to protecting the hearing you have and preventing hearing loss in the first place.' Scientists have identified a gene, named Nox3, found in the inner ear, that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss . While some gene association studies on noise-induced hearing loss in people have been conducted in the past, all were very small and their results unreplicated. Genome wide association studies search the entire DNA for common mutations to see if any of those are linked with a trait. Mouse genome wide association studies have lead to the discovery of hundreds of genes involved in complex traits that have immediate relevance to people. The study was published in the journal PLOS Genetics. An earlier version of this piece existed but has now been amended.","Research was conducted at the University of Southern California .

"They are probably one of the most famous dinosaurs to be discovered due to the distinctive line of armoured plates along its back. Now new research revealed that male and female stegosaurus had different shaped plates running along their backs. It raises the prospect that the dinosaurs used its giant bony protrusions, which could reach up to 2.5 feet, to attract a mate. Scientists have found that male stegosaurus (top) had different shaped armoured plates to females (bottom) Palaeontologists say male stegosaurus could have used them to show off their prowess in much the same way as peacocks do today. The research has also helped to answer a problem that has baffled palaeontologists for decades. A pair of turkey-sized ‘egg thief lizards’ dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock in the mid-90s, but it has taken until now for experts to determine the sex of the 'lovers'. Now, researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females. They say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail. Paleontologistsat the University of Alberta examined a pair of fossils found in Mongolia, which were first described in 2001. One is a complete skeleton, while the other is missing the middle and end of its tail. the researchers looked at indirect evidence of sexually dimorphic display structures, which are evident today in birds. Examples include the fans of peacocks, the tall crests of roosters or the long tail feathers of some birds of paradise, which are used to attract and court mates. They are almost always much larger in males who do the courting, than in females, who do the choosing. The team theorised that like birds, small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates, rather than for flying. Some stegosaurus individuals have been found with wide plates while others had tall plates with a sharper tip that were 45 per cent smaller. Experts believed that these may have been two distinct species or individuals of a different age. However, using modern scanning techniques on a group of stegosaurus discovered at a 'graveyard' in central Montana, scientists have unraveled the answer. They found dinosaurs that had both sets of plates in the graveyard, suggesting they lived side-by-side. Apart from the different plates, their skeletons were identical. This makes it unlikely that they were different species and CT scanning has shown that the bones were not morphing into one or the other. This suggests they belonged to two different sexes instead. The research team believe that the males may have had the larger, broader plates for use in mating displays while the females had the sharper taller plates, that may have helped to discourage unwanted attention or predators. Evan Saitta, who conducted the work at the University of Bristol, said: 'As males typically invest more in their ornamentation, the larger, wide plates likely came from males. 'These broad plates would have provided a great display surface to attract mates. 'The tall plates might have functioned as prickly predator deterrents in females.' Stegosaurus, a herbivorous dinosaur, lived around 150 million years ago during the late Jurassic period in the western United States. Along with its bony back, it also had large spikes on its tail that are thought to have been for defence or fights with rivals. Stegosaurus (above) lived around 150 million years ago but scientists have been baffled by differences between the shape of the plates on some fossils - leading some to believe they were different species . The new research on the armoured plates  may help scientists determine whether 'Sophie', the stegosaurus at the Natural History Museum in London pictured above, really is a female or if it was in fact a male dinosaur . Some dinosaur experts have speculated that the bony plates may have been covered in skin filled with blood vessels so they could flush with colour. This could have acted as a warning to predator or being used as a way of attracting attention of the opposite sex. Most dinosaur remains are difficult to determine the sex but there are a few that have been found to exhibit differences between males and females. Some had large crests or nose horns that may have been sexual features. Professor Paul Barrett, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum in London where one of the most complete stegosaur skeletons has just gone on display, said: 'It is interesting because it would add to the debate on what the plates were for. 'Sexual dimorphism is something we see a lot in modern animals, although it's not particularly prevalent in living reptiles or in living birds.' However he added: 'I'd like to see a lot more information on the graveyard site itself, the different sizes of the specimens, how they were arranged in the ground, more detail on the geology, and on the analyses that were done.' Evan Saitta (shown left with a stegosaurus armoured plate, used a CT scanner to examine the plates to see whether they might belong to different sexes. He is shown on the right cutting into the fossil to take samples .","Stegosaurus fossils have been found with two different types of plate along their backs - large broad plates and taller sharper plates that are smaller .

"Nigel Farage has called for any migrants rescued from the Mediterranean to be sent back to Africa. The Ukip leader said 'millions' of refugees could arrive on boats in Europe over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now. Mr Farage urged Prime Minister David Cameron to resist pressure at an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels tomorrow for Britain to take in large numbers of refugees brought across the Mediterranean by people-smugglers. Scroll down for video . The Ukip leader, on ITV's Lorraine this morning, said 'millions' of refugees could arrive on boats in Europe over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now . He insisted the UK could not take more than 'a few thousand' genuine refugees. His comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants, including 2,500 children, could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled. Up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on Saturday, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Just 28 people are known to have survived the tragedy, described by UNHCR as 'the deadliest incident in the Mediterranean we have ever recorded'. The Ukip leader's comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants, including 2,500 children, could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled . Up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on Saturday, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees . Europe has been urged to copy Australia's military-led 'stop the boats' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean. Australian PM Tony Abbott – who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach Australia – said the EU should 'urgently' follow his lead. His hardline policy has proved controversial but Mr Abbott said it was the only way to prevent disasters such as the loss of 900 lives when a fishing boat capsized on Saturday night. He said: 'The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats. 'That's why it is so urgent that the countries of Europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people-smuggling trade across the Mediterranean.' Conservative Mr Abbott won power in 2013 on a 'stop the boats' pledge, and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months. Operation Sovereign Borders involves the Australian Navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea, and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from. Mr Abbott has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the United Nations over Australia's obligations to refugees, saying his policy was the 'most decent, most compassionate' solution. In the Mediterranean, callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by European nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back. Last year, Italy scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives. But the horrific loss of life over the past week in a spate of migrant shipwrecks has prompted calls to urgently reinstate the rescue missions. EU leaders including David Cameron are meeting tomorrow in what charities are calling a 'life or death' summit to solve the problem. The death toll from capsizing disasters stands at 1,727 so far this year - 30 times higher than the 56 fatalities by April 21 last year, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). At its recent rate the total for this year could reach 30,000. The Prime Minister and other European leaders are under mounting pressure to come up with a plan to stem the rising number of migrants killed trying to cross the sea for a better life in Europe. Mr Farage said Britain bore a burden of responsibility for the flow of migrants heading out of north Africa because of its military interventions in countries like Libya and Iraq. He said he was happy for Royal Navy ships to take part in search and rescue operations in the area, and for funds currently spent on overseas aid and EU contributions to be diverted to help people in the countries involved. But the Ukip leader told BBC1's Breakfast: 'The big message has to come from Italy, the big message has to come from Greece. The Australian prime minister said it yesterday: unless we send a message that we are not going to unconditionally accept unlimited numbers of people, they will keep coming. That's a decision that's got to be taken by the southern Mediterranean countries. 'What is the message from Italy and Greece? Is it that anybody that comes will be accepted? Because if it is, millions of people could be coming over the next couple of years. 'I'm suggesting that they should be making sure that those people coming in vessels that are not seaworthy should be put into vessels which are seaworthy and taken back to where they came from. 'There may be some cases where people genuinely need refugee status and if Britain has to give a helping hand and give, for example, some Christians refugee status ... then fine.' Asked how many refugees he would be willing for the UK to take, Mr Farage said: 'I would suggest a few thousand, because we as a country can't take unlimited numbers of people. The Prime Minister is going to be under intense pressure on Thursday for us to take really very big numbers and I am afraid we simply can't do that.' Mr Cameron has faced criticism for cutting funding for search and rescue operations in the area. The Times said British military chiefs were preparing to offer one of the country's biggest warships to help tackle the refugee crisis. HMS Bulwark, a 176-metre launchpad for helicopters and small vessels which protected London during the 2012 Olympics, is understood to be among the options being considered by ministers. An MoD spokeswoman said it was 'looking at options but no decisions have been taken'. The charity Save the Children has called on EU leaders to restart search and rescue operations off the coast of Italy within 48 hours, on the scale of the previous, and far larger, Italian-led Mare Nostrum operation. Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in make-shift boats launched by people smugglers from Libya – with up to 950 perishing off the Italian island of Lampedusa over the weekend alone . Chief executive Justin Forsyth said: 'EU leaders hold the lives of thousands of desperate people in their hands when they meet tomorrow. 'With every day that they prevaricate and delay restarting search and rescue operations, the risk grows that more people will die as they try to reach Europe. 'We cannot allow 2015 to be the deadliest year in the Mediterranean yet. We must get agreement at Thursday's meeting to scale search and rescue back up to 2014 levels. 'Even one boat that sinks is one too many, but the escalating number of people dying off Italy's shores brings home the urgent need to act.' Maurice Wren, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the response to events in the Mediterranean was 'inadequate' and Europe had to 'raise its game'. Two alleged people smugglers, including one believed to have been the captain of the ship which was wrecked at the weekend, have been detained by Italian authorities, according to reports. It has been claimed the boat capsized after accidentally colliding with another ship which came to its aid. Boris Johnson this morning called for more to be done to help the fleeing migrants . British special forces should be sent into Libya to lead Europe-wide action to tackle human traffickers, Boris Johnson has suggested. The mayor of London insisted action was required to 'choke off the problem at source' to stop migrants being put on to unseaworthy vessels to travel across the Mediterranean Sea from north Africa. He said: 'The first thing to do is to stop the people who are trafficking in human lives and I think sending over a warship - or whatever we're going to do - is entirely right. 'Myself, I'd like to see a real commitment to getting to grips with these people and round...' Host Nick Ferrari asked if this involved sending military personnel into Libya, Mr Johnson said: 'You need to do something about it.' Mr Ferrari countered: 'You're saying special forces into Libya.' Mr Johnson replied: 'I'm a long way away from the discussions about this but there are clearly some very highly organised and ruthless people who are sending people to their deaths in the Mediterranean. It seems to me that is something that should be the subject of concerted European response led by Britain.' Mr Ferrari interjected: 'We've got it - the SAS and SBS into Libya.' Mr Johnson said: 'I don't see why not, I don't see why not.'","Ukip leader said 'millions' of refugees could arrive on boats in Europe .

"Jeremy Clarkson will return to the BBC but not on Top Gear - even though bosses still haven't found his replacement. BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw, who has been tasked with finding a new presenter for the show, said Clarkson 'will be back' on the BBC, despite his very public sacking from Top Gear just last month. Speaking today about the show's future, the executive insisted there was 'no ban on Jeremy being on the BBC' and that the 54-year-old would return to the corporation once he had 'had some time'. Scroll down for video . BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw (left) who has been tasked with finding a new presenter for the show, said Clarkson (right) 'will be back' on the BBC, despite his very public sacking from Top Gear just last month . The final scenes filmed by the Top Gear team (pictured) before Jeremy Clarkson was unceremoniously sacked from the show will be aired this summer, according to the head of BBC2 . It comes as Ms Shillinglaw revealed that Clarkson's final moments on the motoring show would be aired this summer, saying that there was 'no way' she would let the material go to waste. She said: 'Jeremy will be back on the BBC. It's serious and unfortunate what happened but there is no ban on Jeremy being on the BBC. 'It's a a big deal what happened and Jeremy, as any human being would, needs some time.' Earlier this month, Clarkson pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You, which was due to be filmed this week, and aired a day later. It would have marked his first BBC appearance since the fracas which led to his departure. Referring to that decision, Ms Shillinglaw said: 'The BBC was prepared to have him on Have I Got News For You, it wasn't the BBC's decision not to go ahead with that particular show.' She confirmed that the scenes filmed before Clarkson's sacking were likely to air this summer, saying: 'No way would I want the available material not to be seen by viewers.' Kim Shillinglaw refused to say who would be replacing Clarkson. Asked if it would be a woman, she said female candidates were being considered . The channel boss also admitted that she had not yet found anyone to fill Clarkson's shoes on Top Gear. Amid growing pressure for a woman to be appointed as the lead host, she added that she not thinking of his replacement 'in terms of gender'. She said: 'I worked a lot with female presenters and when I used to work in science that was something across the piece that I really wanted to tackle, but I don't think I've ever approached an individual show thinking that was the way I want to cast it, so I think it's an open book on that. 'We'll definitely look at some women, but it's not a driving priority.' She added that the process of reinventing the show without its main star was 'creatively exciting'. Clarkson was suspended by the BBC last month during an internal investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Mr Tymon, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him. Clarkson's contract was not renewed, with director-general Tony Hall saying 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. But the broadcasting veteran received widespread public support, including from friend David Cameron. Clarkson has said he is already thinking about his next television project. He wrote in his column for the Sunday Times: 'I have lost my baby but I shall create another. 'I don't know who the other parent will be or what the baby will look like, but I cannot sit around any more organising my photograph album.' Clarkson also revealed he was told he 'probably' had cancer two days before the 'fracas' with Mr Tymon, although he has since been given the all-clear. He said he considered turning his back on presenting altogether in the immediate fall-out from the incident. Jeremy Clarkson was suspended by the BBC last month after hitting a producer in a row at a hotel, before being told his contract would not be renewed by the corporation (pictured, in London earlier this month) He told the Sunday Times: 'Let's stop being silly and pick up the pieces and start again ... I just know I'm going to do another car show.' Earlier this month, North Yorkshire Police said Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel. Clarkson first appeared on Top Gear in 1988, just after Noel Edmonds quit as lead host, rising through the ranks before leaving the show temporarily in 2001 during a ratings slump. When the show relaunched in 2002, Clarkson had rejoined the programme as head presenter, alongside Richard Hammond and Jason Dawe - who was replaced by James May in series two. The new studio-style format saw the show become the most watched programme on BBC2, and has been voted the best show on British television. Clarkson's brash presenting style, that often flirted with the boundaries of good taste, earned him legions of admirers and critics, and controversy was never far behind. He was censured by BBC bosses in 2014 after apparently using the n-word on television while reciting a nursery rhyme, and caused a stir a few months later after the Top Gear team were attacked while filming in Argentina. Locals had taken offence to a numberplate on Clarkson's car which read 'H982 FLK' - thought to be a reference to the Falklands war.","BBC2's Kim Shillinglaw says Clarkson 'will be back' because there is 'no ban on Jeremy being on the BBC'

"Drunk driver: Laura Smith has been charged with DUI, child endangerment and public intoxication . Police in Memphis have arrested a woman who they say was drunk driving and allowed a 10-year-old girl to take over the wheel of her car. The Memphis Commercial Appeal reports 35-year old Laura Eugenia Smith faces multiple charges, including DUI, child endangerment and public intoxication. In an affidavit, police say a witness noticed the girl driving Smith's car with Smith sitting in the passenger seat. The witness, Josh Staten, said the noticed the vehicle and couldn't believe his eyes. '(The girl was) actually in her lap and the woman was laying back,' Staten told WREG. 'There was no way the other woman could actually see the road.' Staten then followed the vehicle into an auto parts store parking lot. He used his truck to block the exit so that Smith could not leave while he called police. However Smith backed her car into Smith's truck. She then got out of her car and started to spray him with pepper spray, according to Staten. Scene: The incident occurred on South Third street in South Memphis on Thursday night .

"For any hopeful parent who wants to know what life is really like with a newborn baby, never fear, a clever mom has filled a void on the internet by providing a wide range of hilarious spoof reviews seemingly written by frustrated owners displeased with their young baby children. Raquel D'Apice, a comedian and mother-of-one from New Jersey, has put her own personal spin on crowd-sourced assessments by creating Yelp Reviews of Newborns, an entertaining collection of spoof critiques that highlight the real struggles plaguing new parents today. Raquel, who posts the reviews on her humorous parenting blog The Ugly Volvo, told Today that she came up with the idea of the parody posts after she was searching for something on Yelp and realized that there were reviews for everything except babies. Funny mom: Raquel D'Apice, pictured with her son, created Yelp Reviews of Newborns, an entertaining collection of spoof critiques that highlight the real struggles plaguing new parents today . Not happy: NotLovingIt wrote that she wished she 'had read the reviews' before deciding to have a baby . And just like the website that inspired it, Yelp Reviews of Newborns was written from the perspective of fictional parents who have ranked their individual experiences with their babies by giving them a star rating out of five. 'Calling this a disappointment is an understatement,' fictional reviewer HavntSlept, from New York City, wrote before she complained about the 'long grueling hours', lack of pay and the 'unnatural amount of stress' that comes with being a parent. The new mom, who gave motherhood one star out of five, added: 'If I could give it zero stars I would.' Meanwhile, NewMom417, from Guttenberg, New Jersey, noted that her 'extremely long wait' of more than nine months was 'unacceptable' before she went on to graphically describe her delivery.

Filled with joy: The comedian and mother-of-one from New Jersey can be seen with her smiling baby . Not recommended: NewMom417 gave a detailed list of all the reasons why she was unsatisfied with her newborn . After she continued to voice her complains about 'set up and calibration', as well as 'user experience', she advised hopeful parents not to waste their time. Less than a week after NewMom417's review was 'posted', her newborn baby responded with a 'Message from Proprietor'. 'We understand that people often come to this with unrealistic expectations (not your fault and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused,' the message read. The baby ended the posting by saying: 'Sorry for the inconvenience (we know, it can be difficult) but please hang in there and best of luck in the upcoming months. Thanks for your patronage!' And while Raquel used her experiences has a mom to write the clever rankings, they're not all bad. In fact, some of the Yelp Reviews of Newborns reviewers she created can't stop gushing about what a joy it is to have children. KidsRMyJam, from Long Island City, New York, gave her newborn give out of five stars. So disappointing: Meanwhile, HavntSlept complained about the 'long grueling hours' dedicated to her baby before noting that she would have given her baby 'zero stars' if she could . Happy camper: The reviewer KidsRMyJam called parenthood the 'greatest experience ever' 'Greatest experience ever. So worth it - like your life beforehand was two dimensional and suddenly having a child allows you to experience a third dimension,' the satisfied customer wrote, before adding: 'We've done it twice and would be happy to go back.' OvrTheMoon, from Southport, Connecticut, agreed, writing: 'This newborn is my entire reason for living and has brought such meaning to my life in a way nothing else has.' Meanwhile, Raquel's other fictional parents advised others to stick it out. Manhattan-based dad ThnxButNoThnx wrote: 'Sorry not a fan' on his one star review in 2014, but a year later he came back to edit his original post. 'OK. Still give the newborns one star, but it's been a year now and I'm actually really into this,' he added. 'For those of you who don't like it, give it time. It totally gets better.

"After months of speculation - and years of her friends' doubts - Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has admitted she never had cancer. With her business empire destroyed and her online community in tatters, Gibson today admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, 'Okay, she's human'. Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told Daily Mail Australia she feared for her family's safety. Scroll down for video . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son Olivier, 4, on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . Ms Gibson's interview will be published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . The wellness blogger was a prominent Australian social media personality. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonger her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her 'whole foods' business became famously successful. Penguin published her recipe book and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to fulfil promised donations to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He’s been very stern, along the lines of, ‘I just want you to acknowledge where you’ve f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches. But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. Authorities told Daily Mail Australia  at the beginning of April that Ms Gibson is still facing an official investigation. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'","Belle Gibson has finally admitted she never had cancer .

"For most people a hangover will have them reaching for the painkillers and greasy breakfast, but those living in ancient Egypt had a rather different approach. Historians have discovered a 1,900-year-old hangover cure written on an ancient Egyptian papyrus. Written in Greek, one of the medical recipes offers advice for how to tackle a 'drunken headache' - with the leaves of a shrub called Alexandrian chamaedaphne, or sometimes Alexandrian laurel. The text recommends stringing the leaves of the evergreen plant, also called Ruscus racemosus, together and possibly wearing it around the neck. This  papyrus was found in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, and contains a medical 'recipe' for treating a hangover . While the text recommends this as a way of relieving headaches brought on by alcohol, it is not known if it had any effect. The treatment was discovered as part of an ongoing effort to translate the Oxyrhynchus papyrus - more than 500,000 documents found in an ancient rubbish tip at the Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus, about 100 miles south of Cairo. Oxyrhynchus lies south west of Cairo and is considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt. It has yielded a huge collection of papyrus texts from the Ptolemaic and Roman periods of Egyptian history and among them are fragments of plays and the Gospel of Thomas. The city was built around a system of canals and inhabitants dumped their rubbish at nearby sand hills, including lots of written material as Oxyrhynchus was governed bureaucratically by the Greeks and the Romans. Archaeologists have discovered tax returns, census material, receipts, letters about religion, politics, military action and diaries, giving them a thorough picture of everyday life. In 1896, two young excavators - Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt - from the University of Oxford began to excavate the site and combed through the rubbish. While they were concerned with finding works of high literature, they realised the importance of the discarded everyday material. Some 500,000 papyrus fragments are now kept at the university's Sackler Library; among them the account of match fixing. The hangover treatment was one of 24 new medical texts that are the latest to be translated - the 101st volume of translations to be published. Among the documents, researchers at the University of Oxford and University College London have found 11 copies of known medical texts by Galen and Hippocrates alongside the new medical texts. They also found four documents that appeared to be doctors notes. Dr David Leith, a historian and research fellow at the University of Exeter who translated the medical papyrus, said: 'The remedies appear to cross what we might see as the boundary between magic and medicine - and although some ancient doctors disliked making use of ""magical"" remedies, this was far from always the case.' The recipe for drunken headache - kraipale in Greek - read: 'For drunken headache: wear leaves of Alexandrian chamaedaphne strung together.' Dr Leith said: 'The plant name literally means ""ground laurel/bay"", and its leaves are often compared to bay leaves in ancient botanical literature.' The papyrus were discovered during excavations at Oxyrhynchus in 1890 by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt from Queen's College at the University of University. Around 10 per cent of the papyri have been found to be literary and many are private documents, codes, registers, official correspondence, tax records, bills, leases, horoscopes and inventories. Alexandrian chamaedaphne, sometimes called Dane racemosa (above) was recommended as a cure for hangovers in Egypt 1,900 years ago by stringing the leaves in a garland that was hung around the neck . Dr Margarent Mountford, a papyrologist at the Egypt Exploration Society, which owns the papyrus texts, said: 'These texts are hugely important as they give us an insight into daily life at the time. 'Some were copies of ancient Greek medical texts but there were some original medical texts - which look more like magical spells in some ways. 'The hangover cure for example involves handing a laurel around the neck. I have my doubts if this would have worked but perhaps it had more of a placebo effect.' Professor Vivian Nutton, a historian at University College London who was one of those taking part in the translations, described them as 'the largest single collection of medical papyri to be published.' Hundreds of thousands of texts written on papyrus were found at Oxyrhynchus during the excavation (above) The papyrus are owned by the Egypt Exploration Society and kept at the Sackler Library at the University of Oxford. The medical documents all date from the first century AD to the sixth century AD. These images of some of the medical papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus contain descriptions for treating eye conditions, fever and haemorrhoids with surgery . It is thought the hangover cure may have been necessary as many ancient societies drank wine rather than water, which was unsanitised. The newly translated medical texts also include recipes for helping to halt the spread of ulcers, others for treating hemorrhoids, toothache, gangrene and a dozen for treating eye conditions. One recipe describes the need to rub a decapitated ant onto a stye. Another for treating a discharge of mucus from the eyes called rheum, uses a mixture of copper flakes, antimony oxide, white lead, washed lead dross, starch, dried roses, rain water, gum Arabic, poppy juice and a plant called Celtic spikenard. Another gruesome text explains the technique for eye surgery to treat someone whose eyelid had turned inside out. While fragmented, it still makes unpleasant reading. It says: 'the eye... i began... by the temple... the other from the temple... to remove with a small round-bladed knife... the edge of the eyelid from outside... from within until I scooped out.' Dr Leith said many of the recipes could have been written out like prescriptions for people to follow. He said: 'We tried to give a good selection of different types of medical text in the volume. 'For example there are scholarly commentaries on famous medical writings, surgical texts, handbooks for students giving definitions of medical terms, treatises on acute diseases, as well as instructions on preparing perfumed oils - which could be used for medical purposes - and medical recipes. The documents were found at the ancient town of Oxyrhynchus, in Egypt  around 100miles (160km) form Cairo . 'One of the fragments contains a detailed description of the surgical procedure for removing haemorrhoids, though the author emphasises that in operating on the patient one of the haemorrhoids must be left untouched. 'Two others offer in-depth discussions of different kinds of fever and their treatment. 'It’s natural to assume that most of these Oxyrhynchus papyri will have been bought or copied by doctors too for their own use. 'On the other hand, some of the medical recipes may have been copied out by ordinary individuals, so that they could have particular remedies to hand for themselves or their families.' This papyrus is an example of texts discoverd at Oxyrhynchus and features Euclid's Elements of Geometry . Ancient Egyptians would did not have modern hangover cures and used strings of leaves instead, according to new translations of 1,900 year old texts found at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt. Image above posed by a model . The longest medical papyrus ever found is the Papyrus Ebers (pictured). It contains more than 800 treatments for eye problems to digestive disorders . Texts found on the site of Deir el-Medina identify a workman on the crew designated as the 'swnw', or physician. The physician was given an assistant and both were allotted days off to prepare medicine and take care of colleagues. This physician would have most likely treated the workmen with remedies and incantations found in his medical papyrus. These texts acted like a reference book for the ancient Egyptian medical practitioner, listing individual treatments for different ailments. The longest of these ever found is called Papyrus Ebers and contains more than 800 treatments covering eye problems to digestive disorders. The source of the papyrus is unknown, but it was said to have been found between the legs of a mummy in the Theban necropolis. A suggested treatment for a condition that had symptoms similar to asthma is listed as a mixture of herbs heated on a brick so the sufferer could inhale the fumes. Another treatment, this time for intestinal worms, required the physician to cook the cores of dates and a desert plant called colocynth together in sweet beer. He would then have sieved the warm liquid and gave it to the patient to drink for four days. While smearing a paste of dates, acacia, and honey to wool and applying it as a pessary would be used as a form of contraception by the worker's wives.","Hangover treatment found in documents uncovered at Oxyrhynchus, Egypt .

"Graeme Finlay leaving Teesside Crown Court. He is accused of attacking husband and wife Ronald and June Phillips while on board a cruise ship . The passenger accused of beating an elderly couple on a luxury cruise ship claimed yesterday the violence erupted in a row over an awkward silence at dinner. Graeme Finlay, 53, insisted he acted in self-defence after being attacked by Ron Phillips, 70, wielding his crutch. The 16-stone British Gas engineer, who was travelling alone, confronted Mr Phillips and his wife June, 69, about their rudeness in ignoring him when he joined their table for dinner, a court heard. The couple were knocked unconscious after he allegedly assaulted them outside their cabin. But yesterday Finlay said he only swung his arms to defend himself when Mr Phillips went for him with his crutch. He denied attacking Mrs Phillips. He claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of cocoa in his face and hit him with the crutch when he demanded an apology. He told the court: ‘I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself – I covered my face with my arms, I didn’t want my eye poked out.’ He said he swung his arms outwards and felt them connect with retired engineer Mr Phillips, from Middlesbrough. They were on board the Thomson Celebration liner off Lanzarote when the incident happened in January last year. Finlay, a Glaswegian, gave jurors at Teesside Crown Court a picture of the social pitfalls of the lone traveller when he described being snubbed in the restaurant. He said he enjoyed going to musical shows and filled his time with excursions, but dinner could be a ‘bit awkward’. He recalled joining two couples and said ‘good evening’ as he sat down. ‘I am actually quite a shy person – it is not particularly easy for me when I meet strangers,’ he added. ‘One of the ladies opposite me said “good evening” back, but the other three didn’t say anything to me, which I thought was a bit awkward. I was handed a menu and realised I was going to be in the situation for the next hour or so. ‘I then spotted a couple I’d met the previous evening and I said to the people at the table, “Excuse me, I’m just leaving as I recognise some people over there”.’ The couple were travelling on a Thomson Celebration cruise ship when it is claimed they were viciously attacked. The liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote when it is alleged Graeme Finlay beat the pair . Later he went to a cabaret show and played cards in the casino. He then encountered Mr Phillips carrying two cups of hot chocolate in the lift. Emboldened by an evening drinking alcohol, Finlay said he gave a ‘bit of a speech’ to Mr Phillips about his behaviour at dinner. ‘I said, “Excuse me, I don’t want you to take this the wrong way, but I felt really awkward at the table – it would have been nice if you had said good evening when I said good evening”. His reply to that was “f*** off”. I couldn’t believe he reacted like that.’ The argument continued in the corridor where Finlay claimed he was attacked. Mr Phillips, who uses a crutch because of a hip-replacement operation, suffered facial injuries and his wife two fractured vertebrae. Finlay was ‘disembarked’ from the ship and had to make his own way back to Glasgow. He said he needed three stitches in a wound to his arm allegedly caused by the crutch. He added: ‘I feel deeply ashamed I have been involved in such a thing. I was very shocked to hear about the couple’s injuries. I have found it very hard to live with the shame. I feel sorry for everyone involved.’ On Tuesday, Mr and Mrs Phillips told the court Finlay had ambushed them without warning outside their room and beat them. Mr Phillips said: ‘Never in my life have I hit anyone, not even my wife – you can ask her.’ Finlay denies charges of unlawful wounding and assault causing grievous bodily harm. The case continues. Finlay, 53, says he was ‘ignored’ when he joined their table and so moved to another after looking at the menu, Teesside Crown Court heard. He told the court he was on the ship alone and had drunk two pints of lager, three glasses of red wine and around five vodka and Cokes that evening .

'It isn’t fancy or expensive but it does what I need it to do,’ she said. The mother of two girls said she had started looking into ways to improve her skin after playing Princess Fiona in Shrek in the West End in 2011, which meant wearing heavy green make-up each night. She said she used to have botox injections and plastic surgery but that nearly dying giving birth to her daughter Hollie in 2012 put her off any more invasive treatments. She now relies on radio frequency energy facials (as well as more budget-friendly products such as Cetaphil) to hold back the years. Rush actress Miss Wilde, 31, has described Cetaphil as ‘the best’ facial cleanser, while Monster star Miss Theron, 39, said she loves the ‘clean smell’.

"A former model had to be restrained by police after being caught driving - having downed a bottle of wine before she got behind the wheel. Monica McDermott, 41, could not walk straight when police stopped her black Lexus on a road in Macclesfield, Cheshire. The mother-of-one refused to give a breath sample after coming to a halt on Churchill Way and had to be restrained when she tried to climb out of a police patrol car, a court heard. Monica McDermott, centre, during her modelling days. The 41-year-old had to be restrained by police after she was arrested for drink-driving. When officers breathalyzed her she was three times over the limit . McDermott, now aged 41, pleaded guilty to drink driving at Macclesfield Magistrates' court. She told the court she had drank a bottle of wine while her son was away on a trip, adding: 'I was lonely... I got myself in a state' When police finally managed to breathalyse her, she was three times the limit. McDermott, who works for a marketing company, pleaded guilty to drink driving when she appeared at Macclesfield Magistrates' court. It came after she avoided prison in 2012 when she crashed her car in nearby Alderley Edge while four times the legal limit. She was banned from driving for two years. Monica McDermott (pictured) could not walk straight when police stopped her Lexus on a road in Macclesfield, Cheshire . Prosecuting, Debbie Byrne said a police officer had to use an incapacitating spray when McDermott tried to get out of the police car. She told the court: 'Police received information about a black Lexus driving all over the road and nearly hitting cars. 'The officer turned on the emergency lights but the car made no attempt to stop. He drove diagonally to block her way. 'She crept the car forward like she was trying to drive off. He reached inside to turn the engine off. When she got out she struggled to walk in a straight line. 'She refused to give a breath sample and tried to get out of the police car. The officer used captor spray and called officers to restrain her.' McDermott, of Macclesfield, told magistrates she had been drinking more because she felt isolated after moving home. She said: 'My son was away on a trip and I was lonely. I had been drinking in the afternoon and got myself in a state. My friend said to go around and stay the night. 'I'd had a bottle of wine but thought I'd left enough time and would be ok. I couldn't believe I got in this mess again. 'I could have harmed someone. I'm embarrassed and ashamed.' Probation officer Mike Isherwood said McDermott has had a series of traumatic life experiences. Macclesfield Magistrates' Court (pictured) banned McDermott for driving for four years, but she escaped jail . Adrian Long, chairman of the bench, said: 'We've listened to what you and Mr Isherwood said but it was a very high reading and you have a previous conviction.' She was given an 18-month community order, alcohol rehabilitation programme, 120 hours unpaid work and was banned from driving for four years.

All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed. Darren Wheatcroft pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan, and farmer Simon Whitworth pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting. All three were handed suspended prison sentences and ordered to pay a total of £40,000 to the RSPCA at Burnley Magistrates' Court, Lancashire. Footage shown to the court showed some of the animals, which were imported from the Netherlands and trained using treadmills, . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of £40,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes. Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a £1,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined £10,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined £15,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined £15,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.'

In the first four months of the year, there have so far been 5,080 flight cancellations, compared to the 4,239 cancellations during the same period in 2014. According to flight data specialist EUclaim, cancellations and delays are on the rise so far this year over last . The number of delays also increased to 2,427 from 2,260 in 2014. It's low-cost carrier Monarch that has seen the greatest increase in delays so far, with passengers suffering 64 incidents compared to 47 during the same period of time last year. That's an increase of 30 per cent. And EasyJet hasn't fared much better, experiencing a 19 per cent increase in delays. During last year's first quarter, there were a reported 206 hold-ups, while this year has already seen 245. However, airlines are refuting the figures. A spokesperson fro Monarch said: 'The recent media report in regards to the on time performance during the first quarter of this year is incorrect and misleading. 'For clarity, during the first quarter of 2015 we experienced winter weather across Europe which has been far worse than the same period last year, which particularly affected our operation to and from France, as well as the recent the French ATC strike which affected many carriers across Europe. It should be noted that during this time frame Monarch Airlines’ did not cancel any flights. 'In the event of strikes or weather disruption, the business model of many other airline carriers is to cancel services; which will protect their on-time performance, but of course have a negative impact on their customers. 'Monarch Airlines will only cancel flights if there is absolutely no viable way of operating that flight thus placing the highest value on getting customers to their destination as opposed to protecting our on-time performance by tactically cancelling our flights.' Low-cost carrier Monarch has fared the worst so far in 2015, experiencing a 30% increase in delays . Despite all the hold ups, it's been a good year for Thomas Cook, which has reduced its delays by 37% . But it may not be entirely the fault of the airlines. Monarch - 39% increase . EasyJet - 19% increase . Jet2 - 17% increase . Virgin - 7% increase . Thomson - 6% increase . Ryanair - 6% increase . British Airways - 11% decrease . Thomas Cook - 37% decrease . Winter weather across Europe this year has been far worse than the same period last year and has particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch's routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. Similarly, delays and cancellations could also be attributed to a number of strikes on the continent. The four-day Lufthansa strike in March resulted in some 116 cancellations of flights to the UK. Strikes by Italian Air Traffic Controllers and security staff in Germany also compounded such a problem. Still, despite the external factors, it's been a good year for Thomas Cook, which has reduced delays by 37 per cent, and British Airways also saw an 11 per cent reduction in stoppages. Monarch Airlines contests the EUclaim figures, however, telling MailOnline Travel that 'their source of information is questionable. 'They claim that their data comes directly from the aircrafts on board ACARS and ADS-B systems, but Monarch Airlines use neither of these. 'The reason that our OTP figures appear higher than other airlines is due to the fact that we have not cancelled any flights. 'We put our customers before our OTP and would rather operate with a delay than not at all.'","In the first four months of the year, flight cancellations are up 20% over last .
Number of delays have also increased 7% up to 2,427 so far this year .
According to EUclaim, the worst offenders include: Monarch and EasyJet ."
"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . A brother and sister who hadn't seen each other for 16 years have been reunited after they were matched unwittingly on Tinder. Erik de Vries, 24, and Josephine Egberts, 22, were separated back in 1999 after their parents' messy break-up, after which their father took Erik and his twin brother Maarten to Belgium and their mother stayed with Josephine in their native Netherlands, reports DatingSiteKiezen. Despite Erik and Maarten's best efforts to later track down their sister, it was only after Erik moved back to the Netherlands, joined Tinder and swiped 'right' on Josephine's profile that they were reunited - but the penny didn't drop straight away.

Erik de Vries, 24, and Josephine Egberts, 22, were separated back in 1999 after their parents' messy break-up - only to be reunited 16 years later on Tinder (photo posed by models) Tinder - a global dating app which boasts 21 million matches each day - only allows two people to message each other if both parties express an interest by swiping right on the other's profile picture. 'The first time I swiped her profile I had absolutely no idea,' Erik told Mic. 'In our first conversation I was actually flirting with her so the conversation was very superficial.' After messaging back and forth, details began to emerge about Josephine that made Erik suspicious of who she might be - namely a girl from Breda, where he had grown up, who had been separated from her twin brothers. Initially, Erik backed off over his concerns, but a few days later curiosity got the better of him so he asked Josephine a series of further questions about her past. Upon realising they were indeed siblings, the pair agreed to meet at a local café. 'When I saw him, it was suddenly very clear,' Josephine told DatingSiteKiezen. 'It was so special to see my own blood brother again after 16 years.' Erik was reunited with his long-lost sister after swiping right to her profile photo on Tinder (file photo) Erik's twin Maarten was equally as aghast. 'It’s too crazy for words that you come into contact with each other again like this,' he told NL Times. 'But that also makes it very special. I am very happy that I can now still get to know my sister.' The three siblings say they now plan to spend more time together, albeit in a more appropriate setting.","Erik de Vries and Josephine Egberts lost contact after parents' divorce .

"Sir James Munby says parents should use the 'carrot and the stick' approach to getting their children to do things they don't want to do . The job of parents is to make their children do the things they do not want to do, the country’s most senior family law judge said yesterday. Mothers and fathers should use the ‘carrot and the stick’ approach to make children do the things they find boring or difficult – from going to the dentist to doing their homework, Sir James Munby said. He suggested confiscating mobiles and electronic gadgets, grounding teenagers, and ‘threats falling short of brute force’ as suitable methods for parents to get their way. The price of failure, the judge suggested, could be lifelong pain for the parents or even, if the children’s education or health was at stake, their removal by social workers to grow up in state care. Sir James, who is President of the Family Division, gave his advice in a case in which two teenage girls have refused to see their father for more than six years. Sir James, sitting in the Appeal Court with Lady Justice Black and Lord Justice Vos, said there would be no winners if the girls, aged 14 and 16, were not persuaded to restore their relationship with their father. Sir James said being a parent was tough. But he added: ‘That is what parenting is all about. ‘There are many things which they ought to do that children may not want to do or even refuse to do: going to the dentist, going to visit some “boring” elderly relative, going to school, doing homework or sitting an examination, the list is endless. ‘The parents’ job, exercising all their parental skills, techniques and stratagems – which may include use of both the carrot and the stick and, in the case of the older child, reason and argument, is to get the child to do what it does not want to do.’ Sir James said dealing with strong-willed teenagers could be taxing and demanding. Being a parent is tough, Sir James said - but he added: 'That is what parenting is all about'. (Stock image) ‘But parental responsibility does not shrivel away, merely because the child is 14 or even 16,’ he said, ‘nor does the parental obligation to take all reasonable steps to ensure that a child of that age does what it ought to be doing, and does not do what it ought not to be doing. ‘What one can reasonably demand, not merely as a matter of law but also and much more fundamentally as a matter of natural parental obligation, is that the parent, by argument, persuasion, cajolement, blandishments, inducements, sanctions – for example, “grounding” or the confiscation of mobile phones, computers or other electronic equipment – or threats falling short of brute force, or by a combination of them, does their level best to ensure compliance.’ He added: ‘That is what one would expect of a parent whose rebellious teenage child is foolishly refusing to do GCSEs or A-levels or “dropping out” into a life of drug-fuelled crime. ‘Why should we expect any less of a parent whose rebellious teenage child is refusing to see her father?’ Confiscating mobile phones or gadgets from teenagers is a suitable way for parents to get their way, said judge Sir James Munby . The estrangement of the girls from their father began in 2008 when on a weekend visit the father’s new wife grabbed and pushed one of them during a row. The mother asked for contact with the father to be stopped. Sir James said of the parents: ‘Unless they can, as they must, even at this late stage, sort things out, the future for all of them is bleak. There will be no winners here; all will be losers.’ The girls had a distorted and damaging opinion of their father, he added. However, he said, sooner or later the teenagers would discover the truth. ‘What will the children think, how will they react, when they discover, as one day they will, that their father is not the man they currently believe him to be?’ he asked. ‘Will they then turn against their mother? Will they reject both parents? The mother needs to ponder these questions and think hard about what the answers might be.’ Nevertheless, the judges rejected the father’s appeal against an earlier court ruling which said he had no right to contact with the girls. But despite what the ruling says, the court called on the mother to take it upon herself to rebuild family ties.","Sir James Munby made comments during ruling over family dispute .

"Greg Hardy has been suspended by the NFL after an incident of domestic abuse that allegedly occurred last year. Hardy, who signed with the Dallas Cowboys last month, will be forced to sit out the first 10 games of the season and will not receive his salary for these games. This comes almost one year after Hardy, 25, was convicted by a judge in Charlotte, North Carolina of beating, strangling and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend, Nicki Holder. Those charges were later dropped on an appeal when Holder could not be located to testify. Scroll down for video . The NFL announced today that Greg Hardy (above) would be suspended without pay for 10 games at the start of the 2015 season . Hardy (above) was convicted by a judge last July of beating, strangling and threatening to kill ex-girlfriend Nicki Holder . The decision to ban Hardy followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February. Hardy was informed in a letter by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Hardy was dropped by his previous team, the Carolina Panthers, because of these charges last season, but was still able to collect his salary during that time, which was roughly $770,000 a week. 'I understand that I need to step away from football right now and take care of this legal matter,' Hardy said in a statement after he was cut from the Panthers. The Panthers had originally agreed to wait to take action until Hardy had a jury trial regarding the incident in May. His previous conviction was the result of a bench trial. A jury trial that ultimately led to all charges being dropped.Holder told police that Hardy choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his Charlotte condo. Holder (above with hardy) told police that Hardy choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his condo . This all came at a time when the league was under heavy scrutiny in the wake of two abuse scandals involving stars Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Many were upset with the punishments those two received, feeling the NFL was too lenient. Video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. Rice was definitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, has now been suspended by the team. Both men are expected by many to return to play in the 2015, with Peterson back on the Vikings after an NFL decision and Rice winning a wrongful termination suit during the off-season. Rice even pocketed roughly $1.6million in back pay.","The NFL announced today that Greg Hardy would be suspended without pay for 10 games at the start of the 2015 season .

"An Old Bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an 'unlawful' sentence when letting a BT manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam. Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both Starrs and Tamplin, 53, who made £124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an ‘act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. ‘It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,’ he said. ‘He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball.’ The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: ‘The sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion. ‘Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. ‘What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him. ‘No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. ‘I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing.’ Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: ‘This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do. ‘The judge should have been told what his powers were.’ Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a ‘blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: ‘He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.’ Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around £1million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. ‘It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. ‘Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. ‘You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.’ Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.","Christopher Starrs was spared jail in an 'act of mercy' by judge in January .

"One of paedophile Gary Glitter's youngest victims has broken her 10-year silence to speak for the first time as an adult of her appalling ordeal at the fallen idol's hands. In a harrowing insight into the lifelong effects of the shamed glam rocker's catalogue of sickening attacks, 'N' – who was just 11 when pervert Glitter stole her childhood – told how she still suffers frightening flashbacks of the abuse that turned her into a virtual recluse. A shadow of the bubbly, precocious teenager Glitter snared, the girl, who MailOnline is not identifying, now suffers from dark spells of depression and rarely goes out, haunted by her life-changing nightmare. Fiend: Vile Glitter grabs his youngest victim, 10-year-old D who was 'sold' to him by her aunt in 2005 . Tormented: D on the left and N on the right: The two Vietnamese girls abused by Gary Glitter. N is a shadow of the bubbly young girl she was before she met the paedophile singer . Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, N, now 21, bravely admitted: 'I cry out in my sleep almost every night. I dream that it (the abuse by Glitter) is happening again. I have nightmares about it all of the time and I need to take pills to sleep.' She was one of two young girls predator Glitter was convicted of abusing when he lived in the seaside resort of Vung Tau in Vietnam in 2006. The girl told police how he had lured her to his beach house where he showed her vile films of adults raping children on his laptop. She was tricked into going to his house by Glitter's then 19-year-old lover 'B', a homeless orphan, who became his child-sex 'Pied Piper' sex recruiter for him. B would procure young girls for the star, it was stated in prosecution Statement of Facts bundle read in court. Glitter, now 70, real name Paul Francis Gadd, had sex or sexual activity with N three times in September and October 2005. He arrogantly paid her £9 after each time. He also raped N's friend 'D', who was 'sold' to him by her aunt for £28 when she was just 10, an official police report into the investigation stated. The prosecution dossier told how a prostitute called 'O', who Glitter was seeing, brought her niece D to stay with him - and twice sold her to him for sex. When he raped D, O watched on both occasions, the prosecution papers said. The three of them then slept naked together afterwards on the bed, the court was told. Evil: Glitter pictured with his young victim D and another girl. He paid the victims' families £1,300 compensation each to cheat the death sentence for his crimes . Leering: Pervert Glitter pictured here with victim D at the front in the yellow t-shirt, who was just 10 when he got his hands on her . Pot bellied: Gary Glitter prison mug shot taken in Vietnam in 2007 where he spent three years for child abuse . May 8, 1944 - Gary Glitter - real name Paul Gadd - is born in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Never knowing his father, he was brought up by his grandmother and young mother. Aged 10, he and his brother were taken into care. July 1963 - Glitter marries Ann Murton. They have a son and daughter. They divorce in 1972 . 1975 - Despite selling 18 million records, towards the end of the decade he is declared bankrupt. November 1997 - Glitter is disgraced when a computer engineer discovers thousands of child porn images on his laptop while servicing it. November 1999 - Glitter is jailed for four months after pleading guilty to 54 offences of making indecent photographs of children under 16. January 2000 - After serving two months in prison, the singer is freed and subsequently travels to Spain and then Cuba. He has a son with Yudenia Sosa Martinez on the Caribbean island. 2002 - The pervert is kicked out of Cambodia after facing allegations of sex crimes and moves to Thailand. From there he goes to the Vietnamese coastal resort of Vung Tau. March 2006 - The shamed singer is convicted of sexually abusing two Vietnamese girls, aged 10 and 11, and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. August 2008 - Glitter is ordered to return to the UK after spending two and a half years in jail. October 2012 - Glitter becomes the first person to be arrested under the Met's Operation Yewtree - the investigation launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. He is charged with 10 sexual offences. February 5 2015 - He is found guilty of attempted rape, sex with a child under the age of 13 and four counts of indecent assault. February 27 - Glitter is jailed for 16 years and faces spending the rest of his life in prison. Disgraced Glitter was facing child rape charges at the time of his arrest - which could have resulted in the death penalty and put him before a firing squad. But he wriggled out of it after paying the families of his two victims just £1,300  in compensation each to earn him a more lenient sentence on other charges of child abuse. In theend he served just three years in jail in Vietnam. Looking back both victims' families say they felt tricked and pressured by police and lawyers into agreeing to the deal and regretted accepting the money. In 2008 Glitter was deported back to the UK after serving two years of his sentence. In 2012 he became the first person to be arrested in the Met's Operation Yewtree, the celebrity child abuse probe launch in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. And in January the fallen idol was told he will probably die in prison when he was jailed for 16 years at London's Southwark Crown Court for abusing three young girls between 1975 and 1980 - in chilling echoes of N's case. Back in Vietnam, a decade after his abuse, however, it is clear that N is still tormented and deeply troubled by her ordeal. Painfully thin, she weighs just 46kg despite being nearly 1.7 metres tall and spends most of her day locked up alone in her bedroom, according to her mother. She only agreed to meet with me and my Vietnamese translator on the condition of remaining anonymous because she remembered us from a number of meetings we had with between the time of Glitter's arrest and his deportation to the UK. Squatting on the floor of her parents' single-storey home just a mile from the seaside villa where Glitter molested her, she said sadly: 'When I think about what happened to me I feel I don't want to eat. 'I want to lock myself away. There are unhappy things in my mind. I don't know how to explain it. 'The girls I grew up with have boyfriends and husbands. They laugh at me when they see me. My life is very dark. I can't be like them. 'Sometimes I can't think what I want because everything seems dark. I can't see anything.'

His victims N and D pictured on the day fallen icon Gary Glitter was caged in Ho Chi Minh City March 2006 . Victims N and D posed for photos on the day their abuser Glitter was released from his three-year jail term in 2008 . N – who has received no counselling to help her come to terms with the abuse she was subjected to – feels stigmatised by her ordeal as says her neighbours and former school friends all know about her connection to Glitter. 'I've never had a boyfriend,' she revealed. 'No one will love me when they know what happened to me. I feel shame. I won't meet anyone now. It's better to be alone than to meet someone and then have them find out what happened to me. 'I stay at home because if I go out someone will recognise me and I will have to relive it all over again.' The girl's 54-year-old mother wrung her hands anxiously as she told us: 'My daughter yells out in her sleep all the time. Sometimes she shouts out 'My God – not again'. 'I am very worried about her. I ask her every day why don't you eat? Why don't you go somewhere? 'She used to go to the beach as a young girl. She used to love to swim. But she never goes anymore. She only stays at home with me or locks herself away in her room. 'I try to talk to her a lot because I am worried she has a problem in her mind. Should I take her to a doctor? I don't know what to do. She doesn't talk to her brother or sister. She is a different person.' Told about the new prison sentence given to Glitter in London this year, N's mother was distinctly unimpressed. 'Only 16 years?' she said. 'That man should be put behind bars forever. He has destroyed my daughter's life.' Star: But Glitter used his fame to exploit young girls and sexually abuse them .","Ten years on, Glitter's victim tells how shamed star's abuse ruined her life .

"An Iditarod sled dog who escaped from handlers in Anchorage has been found safe after being on the run for a month. Alaskan Husky, Sarabi, was returned to a friend of the musher Laura Allaway, on Monday night who will be reunited with the animal on April 28 when she returns from traveling. The three-year-old dog was spotted on April 15 near Glenn Highway and then again last Friday near Reverend Tim Carrick's United Protestant Presbyterian Church before being caught on Monday night, according to KTUU. Carrick and his family set up a cage trap in the woods between the church and his home, and used four bowls of dog kibbles, a pot of chicken stock, liverwurst and a motion activated camera to help capture Sarabi. Idiatrod sled dog Sarabi escaped from handlers in Anchorage but has been found safe a month after running away (Sarabi pictured above) Sarabi was dropped from musher Laura Allaway's team (Allaway pictured left) during the Iditarod on March 21. The three-year-old dog was then seen near Glenn Highway around April 15 before being spotted in Palmer . 'I was pretty sure that she wasn't around anymore after three weeks of no confirmed sighting,' Allaway told ABC News. Sarabi escaped from handlers on March 21 after being dropped by musher Allaway's team during the Iditarod race. The animal was then seen near Glenn Highway around April 15, and then in Palmer, about 40 miles northeast of Anchorage. After Sarabi was spotted in near Carrick's home and the church in Palmer, searchers asked him for help. She was seen on video eating the food in the cage trap before it was decided on the evening of April 20 to capture her, and the trap was closed on Monday night. 'This morning  when I got up, she was all the way inside the cage and licking the back' Carrick told KTUU on Monday. 'One of the ladies had put some liverwurst or something in the back of the cage so she would get more comfortable with going in'. Rev. Tim Carrick set up a cage trap in the woods between his home and the church and placed inside over a course of a few days four bowls of dog kibbles, a pot of chicken stock and liverwurst (above the trap) On Facebook Allaway wrote on Tuesday thanking everyone for their help in bringing Sarabi back home to Fairbanks (above) 'I'm kind of sad to see her go in a way, but really happy she's going to be back with Laura', Carrick continued. Morgan Hall, a friend of Allaway's picked up Sarabi on Monday around 9pm and took her to a kennel where Allaway works in Fairbanks. 'We got her. We got her safe. She'll be home safe,' Hall told the Alaska Dispatch News on Monday night. 'That's all that matters.' On Facebook, Allaway wrote on Tuesday thanking everyone for their help in Sarabi's return back home to Fairbanks. Sarabi's only apparent injury was a porcupine quill under the eye which was removed following her capture (Daniel Carrick with the dog above) She wrote: 'The moment we have all been waiting for!! Sarabi is caught! She is safe and sound and will be back home in Fairbanks tomorrow!! 'I can not thank each and every one of you enough for everything you all have done! 'If it wasn't from the help of so many people she likely would still be roaming the streets! I'm so sooo happy she is safe and sound!' Sarabi appears to be at a healthy weight and her only apparent injury was a porcupine quill under the eye which Hall's husband removed following the dog's capture, according to Alaska Dispatch News. Allaway is looking forward to embracing Sarabi once they are reunited. She told Alaska Dispatch News: 'I'm going to hug her for ten minutes straight.'","Runaway Alaskan Husky, Sarabi, escaped on March 21 in Anchorage .

"David Cameron this morning launched a furious attack on Labour MPs 'bleating' about poverty after it emerged more than a million people turned to food banks last year. The Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor'. He accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, delivering a major speech on the economy in Bedford today, said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor' Mr Cameron, in a major speech on the economy this morning, said the Tories were overhauling the benefit system, increasing the minimum wage and providing more free child care to help parents get to work. He added: ‘True compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance.’ He said Labour had left a system where a single mum, working 15 hours and earning £87 a week, would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work. Mr Cameron said families stuck on benefits were not ‘playing the system’ but were ‘victims of it’. He said they were ‘victims of a welfare trap laid by Labour, paid for by hardworking taxpayers’. The PM added: That destroyed aspiration. It created resentment. And it was never meant to be this way. Welfare was meant to be a safety net – not a web from which no-one could escape. ‘So when I hear Labour politicians bleating on about the same old Tories, not on the side of working people, I just think: some brass neck. ‘It was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality. Yes, you Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid. So don’t you dare lecture us on poverty. ‘And know this – the true party of working people in Britain today is us, the Conservative Party.’ Mr Cameron accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Mr Cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. ‘For many second earners, work didn’t pay because the cost of childcare was so high. So we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds and disadvantaged two-year-olds. ‘In the next Parliament we will double that for three- and four-year-olds. That’ s right – 30 hours of free childcare a week – worth £5,000 to working families. ‘That means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year – nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs – all by 2017.’ Mr Cameron also argued ‘that true compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance’. The new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage. The new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under £350 million a year.","Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare .

"A 3-year-old's recurring nightmare about a mysterious white van may help shed light on what really happened the day her mother died in an SUV crash that Virginia police have ruled a tragic accident. Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, a married mother of three from Chesterfield County, was returning home from a birthday party February 21 with her daughter, Elisa, in the backseat when she supposedly slid off a rain-soaked road, slammed her silver Ford Explorer into a tree and died at the scene. Investigators concluded that the crash was a one-car collision that was caused by poor road conditions. Scroll down for video . Loss: Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, pictured with her husband, Craig, and their two children, was killed in an SUV crash in Virginia two months ago to the day . Deadly impact: Castellanos-Tyler was just a few miles from her home when her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree . Accident: Police said the crash was a one-car collision caused by a rain-soaked road . Elisa Tyler emerged from the accident largely unscathed, but according to her father, Craig Tyler, the little girl has been plagued by disturbing nightmares and daytime visions about the accident. 'She’ll just start walking and she’ll start screaming, ""The van, the white van!”' the young widower told CBS6. 'I’ll say, ""What happened with the white van?"" And she says, ""It hurt me — it hurt my car!”' Tyler, who is now raising his their children, ages 9, 3 and 1, on his own after his wife's passing, at first did not know what to make of Elisa's night terrors. But then this past weekend he came across several Facebook posts from nearby communities of Foxcroft and Magnolia Green about a series of hit-and-run accidents involving a white box truck. One Facebook user, 17-year-old Caitlyn Thomas, claimed she was side-swiped by a white delivery-style truck on Otterdale Road March 30; the impact of the collision reportedly sent a piece of her side-view mirror crashing through the driver's window. Doubt: Little Elisa, pictured left with her parents and baby brother, and right with her mom, has been having nightmares and daytime visions about a white van, which her father believes may have something to do with the crash . Widower: Craig Tyler says the toddler, pictured above, has told him that the white van in her dreams 'hurt' her and her car . Sightings: A plain white delivery-style box truck, possibly similar to the one pictured above, has been linked to no fewer than three hit-and-run incidents in which two cars and a school bus were side-swiped . According to an eyewitness, the driver of the truck briefly slowed down and turned his head back to look at Thomas' damaged car, but then took off from the scene without waiting for police to arrive. A day earlier, Subastree Thompson said she was also side-swiped by a white box truck on the same road. According to the woman, who was driving with her 3-year-old in the backseat, the white van was carrying two or three men sitting in a single row. The van slowed down for a moment but then sped off before Thompson had a chance to take down its license plate number. Then on April 3, a plain white van matching the same description as in the two earlier incidents allegedly side-swiped a school bus filled with students from Cosby High School. Chesterfield County Police said they were investigating a possible connection between the crashes, but a spokesperson for the department said there was no evidence in Castellano-Tyler's collision to suggest the involvement of another vehicle. Dashing duo: Natali, a native of El Salvador, and Craig met by chance at a restaurant several years ago and married in a courthouse in 2013 . The 30-year-old leaves behind three children, including a 9-year-old boy from a previous relationship in El Salvador and her and Craig's two kids, ages 1 and 3 . Tragic twist: The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July and Natali had picked out an ivory lace dress (pictured) for the big day. Instead, she was laid to rest in her dream gown . The woman was just a few miles from her home when at 2pm her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree, reported the station WRIC. Paramedics arrived on the scene but it was too late for the mother. Her daughter Elisa was taken to a hospital with minor scrapes and bruises. On Monday, nearly two months to the day after the crash, Natali’s husband, Craig, wrote on his Facebook page that he was praying ‘for the truth to be revealed.’ He and Natali, a native of El Salvador, met years earlier at a local restaurant and married with little fanfare in a courthouse on June 21, 2012. The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July, followed by a long-awaited honeymoon. Natali had an ivory lace gown picked out for the big day, but instead of wearing it to go down the aisle, she was laid to rest in her dream dress February 27 in the presence of her heartbroken family. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help cover some of the Tyler family's living expenses. So far, more than $15,440 has been raised.","Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, married mother of three from Virginia, was killed when she crashed into tree February 21 .

"A 'greedy' cashier who stole £15,000 from a currency exchange and blew it on living a high-flying lifestyle was told by a judge it was time to 'get her hands dirty'. Fashion conscious Shanice Farier, 22, from Derby, earned a 'decent salary' and received handouts from her father but that wasn't enough for her expensive taste, the court heard. She helped herself to money from Kanoo Travel in Derby and spent it staying in hotels and living 'an opulent lifestyle', said Judge John Burgess. Farier appeared at Derby Crown Court highly made up, wearing a figure-hugging dress and clutching an expensive-looking handbag, and even posed for pictures outside court.

'Greedy' cashier Shanice Farier, 22, poses at the top of the steps outside court were she was found guilty of stealing £15,000 from her employer, Kanoo Travel in Derby . The Judge ordered Farier (pictured) to 240 hours of unpaid work, adding: 'I hope she ends up doing work that gets her hands dirty' Judge Burgess chastised her for her greed before ordering her to do 240 hours of unpaid work, adding that he hopes she will 'get her hands dirty'. The judge said: 'She's got all the advantages in life. She's not a person who needs help with a gambling, drug or drink problem. She's just greedy.' He then turned to her and added: 'Unpaid work for the community is not intended to be humiliating, but I hope for every hour you are doing it, you remember why you are there.' She was involved in handling different currencies for the firm but on 12 separate occasions she took money for herself before entering the remainder into the company's books. Farier admitted stealing of £15,336 from her employer between October 2012 and February 2013 and converting criminal property between January 2013 and February 2014. Stuart Lody, prosecuting, said said she hadn't worked for Kanoo long before she started stealing and they soon noticed 'an unusual pattern of discrepancy emanating from the Derby office'. Farier was questioned but denied any wrongdoing and even tried to point the finger at other employees. But her dishonesty was exposed and she was subject to an internal disciplinary procedure and dismissed.

Perhaps she didn't realise how tightly financial systems are controlled.' Stuart Newsam, for Farier, said: 'This offending is out of character. She didn't consider the consequences of her actions and thoroughly regrets now what she did.' Judge John Burgess said Farier had told the probation service that she thought 'it was too easy'. The judge handed her a 10-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months, with 240 hours of unpaid work, adding: 'I hope she ends up doing work that gets her hands dirty.' A spokesman for the company said: 'Kanoo would like to thank Derbyshire police for their handling of the investigation and has nothing further to add to the judge's comments in court.'

"The father of the little girl who starred in a photograph that sent the internet into a frenzy because of a mystery pair of boots has 'no idea' what the object could be. Martin Springall, 38, photographed his young daughter - who he wished not be named - standing near a rocky outcrop in Zushi, Japan, in July 2014. He said he was living and working in Tokyo, around an hour north, and wanted to send a picture 'to my wife, who was at work'. 'I took a series of them,' Mr Springall said via email. 'It wasn't until I was checking them later in the evening that I just happened to notice the boots behind her in that one shot.' 'I showed my wife immediately. She was considerably more upset by it than I was, to be honest. Martin Springall (pictured with his daughter, who he wished not to be named) said he had 'no idea' what the item could be . A trick of the light or paranormal forces at play? There is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is . Eerie: A pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there . The Reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure . Mr Springall gave permission for his friend, Brian, to post the image to Reddit - where it became a topic of 'mostly negative' discussion - until it resurfaced this week . 'I just kind of obsessed over that one photo for a couple of hours that evening and then tried to forget about it. 'I really don't like dwelling on stuff like this, to be honest - it freaks me out.' The photograph has sparked considerable debate on the website Reddit, with sceptics arguing whether the picture was modified, if there was a person standing behind the girl or if it was all a trick of the light. Mr Springall insisted there was 'no one' else in the vicinity - and said it had not been Photoshopped, despite sceptics believing otherwise. 'I certainly would have noticed someone standing behind her in one of the shots,' he said. 'She likely wouldn't even have posed for the picture in that case, because she's incredibly shy'. In this picture from the same set, no one appears to be standing behind this little girl . However, in this other supplied picture, the black boots have returned . 'I have no idea what the boots are, where they come from or what they could represent. 'All I can tell you is that I totally get the cynicism.... If I saw that online I would view it exactly the same way. 'I can assure you, though, that it was just the two of us in the area and the photo is 100% untouched. He said he showed his friend Brian Publicover, 38, the picture on a camping trip around a month later. Mr Publicover, a Canadian, then posted it to Reddit under the username Obiaruf. 'We're not saying it's a ghost,' said Mr Publicover, who is working in Japan, where his friend was also living until a few months ago. Friends: Brian (left) posted the picture to Reddit, where it took off. Both Martin and Brian . Sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl . He added that he had just been 'speculating' previously when he said on Reddit that the boots appeared to be 'samurai boots'. He said there were more convincing posts on Reddit that argued it was actually the image of an American World War II era uniform. Particularly given a flash of blue fabric that appeared above her left arm. 'I hope someone can put this through some sort of image-analysis software,' he said. 'We aren't trying to pull some sort of scam here. We're just saying ""we can't explain this, and it's a bit unsettling"".' Mr Springall, who lives in Toronto with his wife and child, has an open mind.

"The Apple Watch version one, with its much-hyped unbreakable sapphire screen and hundreds of apps, may not be all that it's cracked up to be and has been labelled 'a waste of money' by some of Australia's tech experts. With the wait almost over, release date for the whiz-bang time-piece is set down for April 24, the price comparison website finder.com.au suggests, if you haven't already pre-ordered, you might be better off waiting until next year for the second generation Apple Watch. 'If you want an Apple Watch battery that lasts longer than a day, better apps and GPS, you might be better off waiting,' said Michelle Hutchison, Finder's money expert. 'While the first generation Apple Watch is a very exciting piece of wearable technology, there are clearly many key features missing from the watch. If you’re going to spend between $499 and $24,000 on the first edition, you might end up being disappointed with its functionality in 11 months time.' Scroll down for videos . The long-awaited Apple Watch is about to go from being on display to being on the wrist of buyers world-wide but a panel of technical experts claim it is far from perfect . The Apple Watch 1 will retail from $499 for the cheapest version right up to $24,000 for an 18-carat model . Michelle Hutchison and Jeremy Cabral from comparison website finder.com.au are among those who have run the rule of the soon-to-be released futuristic watch . The Apple Watch gadget went on sale on-line in nine countries and the initial stock sold out in just a few hours. Those who pre-ordered are expected to take delivery on Friday . While Apple is promoting the release with ads stating ""you’re going to be amazed by how many things you can do with Apple Watch"", a survey of five Australian technology experts found a less than enthusiastic response to the current offerings available on the watch. They all expect the second version to be a vast improvement, pointing to a long lasting battery life as the number one feature missing from the current Apple Watch. Other key features which are absent, include an independent internet connection (the watch relies on an iPhone for data), GPS and water-proofing was also an issue. Apple proudly exclaims it to be 'our most personal device yet'. 'Apple Watch is unlike any device we’ve ever made,' the company states on its ""Watch Technology"" website. 'The result is an experience that’s both unique to Apple Watch and quintessentially Apple. To make the best use of its size and location on your wrist, Apple Watch has all-new interactions and technologies. 'They let you do familiar things more quickly and conveniently.' But Ms Hutchison said the first version of the Apple Watch might simply be 'a waste of money' for some consumers, who might be better off waiting until the 2016 version. The price comparison for the Apple Watch across the UK, Australia and US. From $499 right up to $24,000 . The Apple Watch 1 has been in high demand but some tech heads say version two might be worth waiting for . She also estimated that Apple Watch version two would be released on or around March 18, 2016. That was based on a study of release dates between Apple’s first and second edition iPods, iPhones and iPads. Two new features the panellists expect to be available on the second version of the Apple Watch are the GPS facility, and being able to work more independently from the iPhone. Greater access for app developers is also likely to be available on the second version, so said the experts. Mike Rundle, the owner of Flyosity, said he wanted to see it 'work independently from the iPhone or won't need an iPhone to set it up'. He also hoped there would be better GPS capability, along with a 'thinner and faster device with a brighter screen' Chris Stead, Editor in Chief, Old Mate Media added: 'Better battery life is a given as Apple improve its tech efficiency.' 'We can also expect more user interface/control options, and greater access to those options for developers. 'This will be required if app makers are going to be able to make bespoke experiences that maximise the Apple Watch, as currently a number of features are gated off, presumably, to minimise quality assurance issues during the device’s launch.' Mike Rundle (left) from Flyosity and Chris Stead of Old Mate Media were among the panel assembled to look at what Apple Watch 1 has to offer.  Rundle wanted it to 'work independently of the iPhone' Mike Bantick (left) is from iTWire.com wants the Apple Watch to be water-proof while Angus Kidman (right) representing Lifehacker Australia on the panel said the new model should be altered to allow for more apps . But the number one technology upgrade that will have the biggest impact on the Apple Watch is the iPhone 7, according to those surveyed, followed by iOS9 – the next mobile operating system – and Apple Pay where users can make contact-less transactions through the so-called Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. 'The most exciting part about the Apple Watch and wearable technology is the endless potential for how these devices will change our lives,' said Ms Hutchison. 'From turning on our TV to pre-empting a heart attack, to the way we access information and how we pay for things, it has the potential to make our lives more convenient and even more productive.' Mike Bantick, Contributing Editor at iTWire.com has called for a water-proof sport version, with GP and headphone options, while Angus Kidman, the editor of Lifehacker Australia called on Apple to 'open SDK so there are more apps' and Jeremy Cabral, Head of Publishing and Editorial at Finder also wants to see it 'work independently to the iPhone'. The Apple Watch will initially be available in just nine countries: Australia, UK, US, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan but the company says more countries will come on line at a later date.","Tech heads say the new Apple Watch could be 'a waste of money'

"Claims by the country's biggest food bank network that it served a million hungry people in a year were exposed as false yesterday. After the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress seized on the figure, with shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves describing it as 'shocking', the Trussell Trust admitted in a climbdown that 'these are not all unique users'. It emerged last night that its true number of users is likely to be no more than half a million – and possibly lower still. Scroll down for video . It emerged last night that the true number of food bank users is likely to be no more than half a million. File image used . The claim was widely reported by newspapers, while the BBC ran a headline on its website stating: 'Food banks used by ""more than one million people"".' But the Corporation also retreated yesterday, toning down its coverage as the one million figure unravelled. In the announcement of its food bank users, the Trussell Trust – which has 445 food banks run in its name – declared that 'more than one million people received three days' food'. However the Trust has now acknowledged that the claim was based on the number of food parcels given out, and not the number of individuals asking for help. It admitted that fewer than half its claimants come forward only once, and 15 per cent make more than three visits to a food bank in a year. It said that the average claimant uses two of the vouchers that entitle them to a food parcel in a year. The Trust, a charity which has expanded rapidly in recent years and which aspires to run a food bank in every town, found itself under fire from Tories over its claims. Claims by The Trussell Trust that it served a million hungry people in a year were exposed as false yesterday . Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative candidate for Dover and Deal, said: 'Their use of unverified figures is irresponsible and borders on scaremongering. Food bank usage is a serious issue – not something that should be used and misused for PR purposes. What the Trussell Trust would do better to highlight is that the best route out of poverty is to get a good job that gives you a regular pay packet.' One fact-checking think-tank, Full Fact, said last night: 'The claim that over a million people are using Trussell Trust food banks is inaccurate. 'It comes from confusing the number of different people using Trussell Trust food banks in a year with the number of times they use the food banks.' Full Fact said that even Trussell Trust's figures for the number of food parcels handed out – from 913,138 in the 2013/14 financial year to 1,084,604 in the financial year which ended in March – did not mean that demand for free food was going up. It said the increase may reflect that more people are becoming aware of food banks, or people who were already in need have taken advantage of the opening of a new food bank in their neighbourhood. Trussell Trust chairman Chris Mould said: 'The number of times people were given three days of emergency food rose over a million during the year. 'Some of those people have eaten that food on more than one occasion during the year. We should not lose sight of the fact that a large and increasing number of people have been referred to food banks.' Mr Mould added that the charity would review the way its publishes its figures in future.","The Trussell Trust admits that the one million were not all 'unique users'

"Tracy Walters, 48, (right) died after her husband Ian's (left) car veered off the M1 motorway last year . A church treasurer accused of killing his wife by deliberately smashing his 4x4 vehicle into a tree at 84mph has described their early sex life together as ‘dramatic’. Ian Walters is accused of murdering his wife of two years after their relationship had collapsed because she was no longer able to satisfy his sexual demands. Walters, who also worked as a driving test examiner, veered off the M1 on the way back from an unsuccessful ‘make or break’ trip with his wife Tracy, Leicester Crown Court has heard. The 51-year-old’s Mitsubishi L200 Animal ploughed through undergrowth before hitting a tree – leaving Mrs Walters, 48, with serious injuries. She was flown to hospital by helicopter but died two days after the crash in March last year. Walters, who was also badly hurt in the incident, was charged with his wife’s murder two months later – ten days after her funeral. The prosecution is claiming that conflict over sex was a main reason the couple’s marriage had fallen apart. Charles Miskin, prosecuting, said earlier in the trial: ‘One of the principal issues was sex. He seemed to want it all the time and she couldn’t cope with his demands.’ But giving evidence yesterday, Walters described his love life with Tracy as ‘very fulfilling’, adding: ‘It was very exciting and adventurous. She taught me things I never knew. It was very refreshing and usually initiated by Tracy rather than myself.’ Walters went on to say that when they had sex it tended to be ‘long, dramatic and adventurous’ but lacked the ‘intimacy’ he craved. He added: ‘What I needed was intimacy. What I needed was more than the touching. I wanted to fall asleep in each other’s arms.’ Quizzed over texts Tracy had sent to friends complaining that Walters had made her feel like ‘a sex object’, Walters agreed with the defence counsel that ‘his sex drive was higher than Tracy’s’. And he admitted that as their relationship had worn on their sex life had waned. The jury also heard that the couple had a ‘troubled’ relationship, with Mrs Walters telling relatives and police that her husband had been abusive to her. The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . Mrs Walters, a keen horse rider, was flown to hospital following the collision in Markfield, Leicester, but died two days later from her injuries . She made an application under ‘Clare’s Law’ to discover if he had a violent past. The pair, who had both been married once before, had grown-up children from their previous relationships. They started dating in 2011, and got married a year later in Cyprus. Mr Miskin told the court that the abuse started almost straight away, with Mrs Walters showing relatives bruises she claimed her husband had inflicted. Mrs Walters also texted a relative of one of her sons just an hour before the crash to say: ‘I need him arrested when I get back, but I am scared because he is so volatile and I don’t want to wind him up.’ The couple were returning to their home in Swindon when Walters suddenly swerved his car off the carriageway and into a tree. The prosecution claim that Mrs Walters ‘couldn’t cope with her husband’s demands’ in bed, and that Walters purposely crashed to show his wife ‘who was in charge’. But Walters is claiming that at the time of the crash he had been taking antidepressants which sometimes made him drowsy. He told the court that he could recall two times when he had fallen asleep at the wheel, the last of which was on a motorway in 2002. He said he had also had three fainting episodes in the two years prior to the crash. Walters denies murder. The trial continues. The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash .

"A 33-year-old woman on trial for having sex with a male inmate at Washington County Jail six times in four months while working as a services technician is hoping to use an insanity defense, claiming she was 'vulnerable, passive and gullible' and suffers from mental illness. Brett Robinson is facing 12 charges related to sexual misconduct and official misconduct after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell multiple times and engaging in sex acts  between March and July last year. The case follows that of her colleague Lisa Curry, 39, who last month was sentenced to over four years prison for repeatedly having sex with a 25-year-old gang member and convicted rapist. Robinson, who worked in a maximum security control room known as 'the bubble', struck up a relationship with the inmate - who has not been named -  in a nearby cell. The two would talk using an intercom when Robinson's manager left the room. 'Gullible': Brett Robinson, 32, is facing 12 charges after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell at Washington County Jail and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year . Charged: Robinson allegedly brought the male inmate into the control where she worked at Washing County Jail and had sex with him on his birthday under a blanket . According to a psychologist's report obtained by Oregon Live, Robinson felt flattered by the compliments she got from the inmate and started to 'open up to him' early last year. Then, in March, the inmate asked for a kiss on his birthday. When her manager went to lunch, Robinson released the inmate from his cell and brought him into the bubble. She thought it strange that he brought a blanket with him from the cell, the report said. 'He kissed me so passionately, I was taken aback. 'I asked about the blanket. 'He said ''I was hoping we could go farther''. 'Then he was saying ''we don't have time to discuss this'', so I had sex with him.' They continued having sexual encounters, the report said, and Robinson wrote the inmate a love letter that began with 'Hi Baby'. The letter said: 'I am hoping this letter will better convey the love I feel deep inside for you. ... You are a constant presence in my thoughts, fantasies and dreams, and I feel this pervasive emptiness without you by my side. It makes it hard to go about my normal daily activities when all I do is miss you. You are my everything, Baby – I could not envision my life without you in it.' New protocol: In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again . On trial: Brett Robinson, 33, faces charges of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and first-degree official misconduct . However the relationship began to sour when Robinson started hearing about the abusive conduct of the inmate elsewhere in the prison. He had passed a sexually explicit note to a nurse and also pushed a female prisoner against a wall and kissed her. The psychologist noted that Robinson was delusional about the man. The report also said she had struggled with depression and anxiety since childhood. 'There is evidence that these delusions developed in this generally vulnerable, passive and gullible woman as part of a Major Depressive and Anxiety episode,' the doctor wrote. Robinson was caught when the inmate brought up their relationship to a prison employee during an investigation about Jill Curry. The prosecution is fighting against Robinson using the insanity defense. In March Curry was sentenced to four years and two months prison. That case was very similar to the allegations against Robinson. Curry was also a services technician and was convicted of letting gang member Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25,  who was housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, out of his cell and have sex with him in a supply closet. Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cries in court last month as she was sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with an inmate in a supply closet . Curry, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, pleaded guilty last month to custodial sexual misconduct and other charges stemming from her contact with Delgado Galban. Authorities said the sexual misconduct occurred while a deputy was at lunch, when Curry, a civilian jail services technician, was alone in the unit's control room, reports The Oregonian. Curry pushed a button to unlock the inmate's cell and the pair would then meet in the supply closet to have sexual relations. This occurred 13 times, said prosecutor Jeff Lesowski. A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years, which the defense asked the judge to impose. Judge Bailey went above the state's recommendation when sentencing Curry. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, 2014, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician. Curry had claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her . Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation. She had been working in the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center. An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her. The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped. In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release. But according to sheriff's officials, he failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Curry. In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again.","Brett Robinson, 33, facing 12 charges after allegedly letting an inmate out of his cell and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year .

"A crisp fan who gets through 42 bags in a week has discovered a skull-shaped deep-fried potato snack in one of his packets. Barry Selby, 54, who lives with his dog in Poole, Dorset, was eating a bag of cheese and onion crisps when he made the bizarre discovery, which appears to be a profile of a human skull. The floor-fitter has decided to keep the two inches tall by two-and-a-half inches wide snack as he believes it is far more impressive than other oddly-shaped examples he has seen on the internet. Scroll down for video . Spooky find: Barry Selby was eating a bag of Tesco cheese and onion crisps when he found the 'skull' snack . Mr Selby said: 'I was shocked when I found it. I was just eating a bag of cheese and onion crisps from Tesco and when I pulled it out it did take me back a bit. 'I thought it was worth keeping as I don't think I will ever find one like it again. It must have been a very weird-shaped potato. 'It's about two inches tall and two-and-a-half inches wide and it's in perfect detail, it even has an eye socket. 'I sometimes give my dog, Max, crisps in a bowl, so it's lucky he didn't have this packet or I wouldn't have found it.

'I've been keeping it on top of my computer in the front room, but it should be in a protective box really. 'I'm going to keep it forever, it's just so spooky.

"'Exploited by criminals': Gambian footballer Baboucarr Ceesay (above) was among the 900 migrants who died in the Mediterranean boat disaster, his British aunt has revealed . A British woman has revealed how her nephew was among the 900 migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean boat disaster. Baboucarr Ceesay, a talented footballer from The Gambia, is believed to have died on the fishing boat in a 'desperate' attempt to seek a new life in the UK. His aunt Jessica Sey, from Cheltenham, has spoken of her devastation after discovering that he was not among the 27 survivors and demanded the human traffickers be brought to justice. She said: 'He had his head turned and his money taken by criminals who are responsible for thousands of deaths. It's the biggest shock of my life. 'His mother will never get his body back. She'll never be able to ask him why he did it.' She said her two daughters were 'absolutely gobsmacked' by news of the 21-year-old's death. Mrs Sey and her Gambian-born husband lived in the west African country for around five years. She said her nephew played first division football in The Gambia, was the eldest of four siblings and appeared to enjoy a comfortable life. She told the Gloucestershire Echo: 'His mother, Jabou, has lost two husbands and had a really tough time through no fault of her own. 'Nobody is surprised that Baboucarr wanted to make the most of his life but there was absolutely no need for him to do this. 'He wanted to come to Europe but he would never have been granted a visa. In his young head, the logical way out was to do it illegally.' Mr Ceesay and a friend, Alagie, bought a car and then 'just disappeared', she added. Horror: Jessica Sey, from Cheltenham, has spoken of her devastation after discovering that her nephew Baboucarr Ceesay was among the 900 migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean boat disaster . The pair then took a boat from the Gambian capital Banjul to Guinea, where they  crossed the Sahara and made their way to a Libyan migrant camp. Because they had money in their pockets, they didn't stay in the camp for long and were pushed to the front of the queue. But when the boat arrived, a riot broke out in the camp and everyone fought for a place on the boat. Mr Ceesay managed to get on and was placed one of the holds, possibly becoming one of those who were locked in below deck, unable to escape. Alagie was left behind. Some 900 people are feared to have drowned when the overcrowded boat capsized off the coast of Libya on Sunday in the worst maritime disaster since the end of World War Two. When news arrived that the boat had sunk, Alagie had to call Mr Ceesay's family. Tragedy: Members of the crew Italian Coast Guard ship Gregoretti carry bodies of some of the 900 victims from the Mediterranean's migrant boat tragedy in Valletta's Grand Harbour, Malta, earlier this week . Mrs Sey said: 'He's left a huge, very loving family absolutely distraught. 'It's so easy for us in our ivory towers to criticise them, but we have no idea what their lives are like. Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race, locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned.' Conversely, Yusuf, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February, said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East, it was reported by The Independent. 'Even Baboucarr, who was relatively well off by Gambian standards.' Alagie is still in Libya and his family is desperate for him to return home safely. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit today, allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster. The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre (66-foot) boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 27, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Charged with manslaughter: Tunisian boat captain Mohammed Ali Malek (centre) is seen speaking to a nurse on an Italian coastguard ship before being arrested over the deaths of 900 migrants . A police handout showing Mohammed Ali Malek (left) and Mahmud Bikhit (right) after their arrest in Malta . Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship, causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan, a fellow 17-year-old Bangladeshi, said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers, it has been reported. It set off from Libya on Saturday and sent out a distress signal shortly before midnight 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. It later capsized.","Gambian footballer Baboucarr Ceesay, 21, died seeking new life in the UK .

"The new Southpaw trailer last month featured Jake Gyllenhaal showing off an extremely toned torso. But according to his trainer, former professional boxer Terry Claybon, it took a huge amount of work to get the 34-year-old actor ripped for the shoot, including six months of training before filming even started. He also worked out for an incredible six hours per day, including 2,000 sit ups, 1,000 each morning and the same at night. Of course, Jake had to work even harder to get in shape because he had just  dropped approximately 30lbs to play freelance crime reporter Lou, who stumbles upon the dangerous underworld of Los Angeles in Nightcrawler. Scroll down for video . Blood, sweat and tears: According to his trainer, it took a huge amount of work to get Jake Gyllenhaal ripped for Southpaw, including six months of training before filming started, 2,000 sit ups and six hours of training each day . Much thinner: The 34-year-old lost 30 pounds for 2014 thriller Nightcrawler and had  to put that weight  back on plus 15lbs of muscle . He not only returned to his normal weight - but he then put on another 15 pounds of pure muscle to play the desperate fighter Billy Hope. His trainer Claybon told Yahoo: 'Gradually we built up, day-by-day, to 2,000. It takes time to do that', and revealed that his exercise regime included, 'three hours of boxing in the morning and three hours of strengthening, conditioning, and cardio at night.' Speaking about his weight loss for Nightcrawler, Jake told Us Weekly: 'I knew that [Lou] was literally and figuratively hungry, [so I got into the] mode where I was always a bit hungry. Beaten: The trailer shows a muscular Gyllenhaal bloodied and bruised by an opponent in the boxing ring . Bulking up: Jake poses here with his trainers, including former boxer Terry Claybon (second from right), who was responsible for whipping the once-scrawny actor into shape . Gyllenhaal also attended several boxing matches to watch how real fighters move in the ring . 'It's not different than getting into character for anything. It's more about believing where you are and being present where you are. Who's to say what the process is? I have a strange one … but I love what I do.' Claybon explained to Yahoo that Jake put back on the weight he had lost before gaining an extra 15 pounds of muscle for Southpaw. Health experts told the Daily Telegraph that Gyllenhaal likely went on a high-protein diet, that likely included protein powder. He likely had to consume 130 grams of protein - two and a half times the daily recommended intake. Health experts also told the Telegraph that such drastic body changes could cause long-term damage to his body. The huge swing in Gyllenhaal's physique recalls other drastic changes actors have made in their bodies. Among the most recent and most notable is Matthew McConaughey's turn from  Magic Mike hunk to Dallas Buyers Club AIDS patient. Meanwhile, in Southpaw, Jake plays Billy Hope, a professional boxer who must rebuild his life after his wife is killed and his daughter is taken away from him. The recent trailer opens with Gyllenhaal's understatement: 'I expected a hard fight. I put my family through a lot.' It then cuts to him in the ring bloodied and bruised as he takes a relentless pounding from an opponent, while his wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson look on in horror, before Hope suddenly turns it around sends the other boxer to the canvass. Horrified: His wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson can only stand by and watch ringside . Adrenelin: Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, a boxer who allows himself take punches to fire himself up . The reason Gyllenhaal's character allowed himself to take the beating in the first place is then explained. 'The more you get hit the harder you fight, I get it,' his wife says. 'Only now you've taken way to many hits before you get off. You cant fight like that any more. Think about her.' She's talking about the couple's only daughter Leila, who is played by film newcomer Oona Laurence. The youngster is fresh from lauded performances on Broadway as Matilda in the stage adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic. But the trailer also reveals there's a much more devastating blow in store for Hope, when his wife is accidentally shot dead by a bodyguard during an altercation with he has with another boxer who had been taunting him, which McAdam's character had told him to walk away from. Doomed: The two-and-a-half minute clip reveals McAdams is killed during an altercation between Hope and another boxer . Hopeless: The boxer must fight to regain his daughter, who is taken from him by child services following the death of his wife .

And things get worse for the embattled boxer as the child protection services take his daughter away from him after he falls into a dangerous cycle of self destruction following the death of the child's mother. The film also stars Rita Ora, who recently played Christian Grey's sister in Fifty Shades Of Grey, as well as Forest Whitaker and Naoime Harris, replacing Lupita Nyong'o who dropped out in August.

"During its 25 years in space, Hubble has provided the world with unprecedented views of the universe. But to help it find alien life, Nasa needs an even more powerful tool to peer back into the depths of our cosmos. The agency hopes to do this with the James Webb Space Telescope, which will be 100 times more potent than Hubble, and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the Big Bang. The James Webb Space Telescope will be 100 times more potent than Hubble, and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the Big Bang. Pictured are Nasa scientists completing a series of cryogenic tests on six James Webb Space Telescope beryllium mirror segments . Nasa describes the telescope as a 'powerful time machine with infrared vision that will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe.' The project has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers for its ballooning costs - now at about $8.8 billion, far higher than the initial estimate of $3.5 bn (£2.33 bn). But Nasa has promised to keep the next-generation telescope on track for its October 2018 launch. 'What the Webb will really be doing is looking at the first galaxies of the universe,' Webb telescope observatory project scientist Mark Clampin. 'We will also be able, with these capabilities, to look in very dark parts of the universe where stars are being born.' Nasa describes the telescope as a 'powerful time machine with infrared vision that will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe' The James Webb Space Telescope will be 100 times more potent than Hubble, and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the Big Bang. Pictured is an artist's impression . The space telescope will weigh 6.4 tons. JWST's main mirror will be 21ft (6.5 metres) in diameter, three times as large as Hubble's . Inside a massive room that is partially closed off from view, in clean room where no dust can harm the telescope, a team of engineers dressed in white, resembling surgeons, work on building the JWST. The space telescope will weigh 6.4 tons. JWST's main mirror will be 21ft (6.5 metres) in diameter, three times as large as Hubble's. There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy – and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington earlier this month, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, said. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' said Stofan. 'We are talking about little microbes.' The announcement has been prompted by the recent discovery of water by Nasa in surprising places. Jim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa, noted that a recent study of the Martian atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep. A joint project of Nasa, the European and canadian space agencies, JWST will carry four instruments, including cameras and spectrometers that can capture extremely faint signals. Infra-red capability will help it observe distant celestial bodies, and its camera shutter will be able to remain open for long periods, explained Matt Greenhouse, JWST project scientist for the science instrument payload. 'The Webb will have 70 times the light-gathering capacity of Hubble. So the combination of the large size and the infra-red capabilities will allow us to observe this epic of the universe past,' he said in an interview. Even more, the telescope should further the search for life elsewhere in the universe by opening a new window on planets outside the solar system  that might have water. Already, Nasa's Kepler Space telescope, launched in 2009, has helped astronomers identify thousands of exoplanets. JWST is expected to propel that research even further. 'Webb is quite big enough to have a high probability of finding bio signatures in the atmosphere of exoplanets, evidence of life,' Greenhouse said. 'We have sensors on board, equipment on board that will enable us to study the atmosphere of exoplanets spectroscopically. So we will be able to understand the composition of those atmospheres,' he added. 'We can make big progress in the search for life.' Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, which circles the Earth, the JWST will go even further, to a place called L2, for LaGrange Point, 930,000 miles (1.5 million km) away in space. That distance will keep the telescope cold, prevent it from being blinded by its own infra-red light and shelter it from radiation. 'It will follow the Earth around the sun over the course of the year. So it's in a sun center orbit instead of an Earth center orbit,' said Greenhouse. The heavy telescope is scheduled to launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket, made by the European Space Agency, from French Guiana in October 2018. 'Just as Hubble rewrote all the textbooks, Webb will rewrite it again,' said Greenhouse.

"At first sight it might appear shocking that a clapped-out car such as this would be on the market for almost a quarter of a million pounds. But the dishevelled-looking vehicle is a celebrated 1962 Aston Martin DB4 Series III and will be worth three times its £220,000 price if fully restored. Despite its appearance it remains an attractive prospect for many car enthusiasts by offering the rare chance to restore a virtually-untouched DB4. Opportunity: Many car enthusiasts would jump at the rare chance to restore this virtually-untouched 1962 Aston Martin DB4 Series III . Pricey: The restoration project will cost upwards of £350,000 - meaning whoever buys it will have to pay £570,000 to return it to its former glory . Inside: The car, registered as BTB 478A, is being sold at Bonhams' Aston Martin sale in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on May 9 . But the restoration project will cost up to £350,000 - meaning whoever buys it will have to pay at least £570,000 to return it to its former glory. There were about 1,100 DB4 Series III cars made from 1958 to 1963 - and it is becoming tougher to find one that offers a restoration project. The British vehicle was supplied new in July 1961 to a Robert Drummond of London, who lived in a central postcode region in the capital of SW1. The car - to be auctioned in Buckinghamshire - was off the road in storage when bought by the unnamed current owner in 1982 as a restoration project. Work was carried out the next year - including the engine being stripped, fully rebuilt and a new chassis fitted - but it has hardly been touched since. The owner, who lives in the North West of England, has now decided it is time to part with the car that has not been driven in three decades. Steering wheel: The Aston Martin was off the road in storage when it was bought by the unnamed current owner in 1982 for restoration .

A spokesman for auctioneers Bonhams said: ‘We are advised that the Aston is completely original and comes with all components including the original leather interior, the latter in good condition. Someone has had a go at restoring it but for whatever reason never saw the project through. 'It has not been on the road since the work was done. Offered for completion and sold strictly as viewed, this is a potentially most rewarding restoration project. ‘If you take the car to Aston Martin to restore the most expensive bill you will get will be £350,000. ‘Today a fully restored Aston Martin DB5 can be worth between £500,000 to £750,000 and DB4s are slightly behind them.’ The car, registered as BTB 478A, is being sold at Bonhams' Aston Martin sale in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on May 9. The Mail On Sunday reported last month how private bank Coutts said the value some classic cars rose 257 per cent between 2005 and 2013. Last year an investment research organisation said the value of 'exceptional historic' cars climbed 12 per cent in that year alone. Compared with the beginning of 2009, prices had shot up by 163 per cent. With some Ferrari prices peaking, their total gain was 9.7 per cent compared with 24 cent for some sought-after Porsches.","Aston Martin DB4 Series III will cost up to £350,000 to restore but could then be worth as much as £750,000 .

"Locked up: David Norris, 51, was jailed for 20 years for the attempted murder of his estranged wife . A jilted husband who repeatedly stabbed his estranged wife in a graveyard screaming 'Go to sleep with your mum!' has been jailed for 20 years. David Norris's wife begged him to think of their children as he launched his vicious attack - but he only stopped stabbing her when she 'played dead' and a member of the public intervened. Today he was sentenced at Maidstone Crown Court after being found guilty of attempted murder. Norris, 51, pounced on his wife Dionne in the graveyard of St Nicholas Church in Southfleet, near Gravesend, in Kent, as she was about to lay flowers at the grave of his grandmother on October 11 last year. The pair, whose marriage had broken down in August of that year, had arranged to meet up to lay flowers first at the grave of the victim's mother, then at Norris's grandmother's, as they did every year. Norris collected his wife and they visited the first gravesite before they had a conversation about their marriage and whether it could be saved. She told Norris she did not feel she could forgive him for some of his actions and he told her she had destroyed their family. Mrs Norris said she did not want to argue and they agreed to carry on to the second graveyard as planned. While she was unwrapping the bouquet of flowers, Norris lingered at the car boot before walking over to join her. He said: 'If I can't have you, no one can have you.' He lunged at her, knocking her over and grabbing her round the throat. Screaming, she managed to struggle free momentarily before he jumped on her again, brandishing a knife. She begged him to think of their children but Norris stabbed her repeatedly. A member of the public tried to intervene but Norris threatened him with the knife before turning to stab Mrs Norris again, telling her: 'Go to sleep, go to sleep with your mum.' He walked away and the member of the public returned and called the police, comforting Mrs Norris until the emergency services arrived. She had suffered numerous stab wounds to her upper body, arms and hands, as well as a collapsed lung. Officers immediately began searching for Norris, who had called his sons and an uncle and asked them to meet him as soon as he had left the crime scene. He met them and they convinced him to hand himself in to police. Norris and his wife Dionne had visited St Nicholas Church, Southfleet (pictured) to lay flowers on his grandmother's grave. The 51-year-old then began stabbing his wife, screaming 'Go to sleep with your mum!' He was arrested at North Kent Police Station in Thames Way and charged with attempted murder. Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Gavin Moss, said: 'Norris attacked his estranged wife after she made it clear to him she had no interest in reconciling. 'He pounced on her when she was having a private moment of reflection in a graveyard and stabbed her repeatedly, ignoring her as she pleaded for her life. 'When he was arrested, he told officers he was a good man and had never done something so awful before. 'Kent Police had never received any reports of domestic abuse from either Norris or his victim but the violence and lack of mercy he demonstrated in this vicious assault show that he intended to kill his wife. 'It is extremely fortunate that she did not suffer any fatal injuries and I would like to take this opportunity to commend her courage and wish her all the best in her continued recovery. 'Faced with the evidence our officers had built up against Norris, including eyewitness testimony, the jury has convicted him today and handed him a lengthy custodial sentence where he may finally recognise the horrendous ordeal he put his victim through.'","David Norris pounced as his wife was about to lay flowers on a grave .

"A classic Aston Martin once owned by Spartacus star Peter Ustinov is set to fetch more than £1million at auction - twice what it fetched four years ago. The actor bought the Aston Martin DB4 Cabriolet in 1962, shortly after winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Batiatus in Spartacus. It was one of the most luxurious cars of its day, costing £4,000 and was delivered to him at a Swiss hotel at a time when the average house price in Britain was just £2,500. The Aston Martin DB4 Cabriolet once belonged to actor Peter Ustinov and is expected to fetch £1million when it goes up for auction at Bonhams. That's more than twice what it cost just four years ago . A collectors piece: These pictures show the prestigious Aston Martin logo on the bonnet, left, a trademark of the elite brand, and an absolutely spotless stylish leather trim, left, that once seated Peter Ustinov . The fast lane: The car cost £4,000 in 1962 when the average house price in Britain was just £2,500 . Quick sale: The 3.7-litre engine produced 240bhp. It went 0-60mph in nine seconds and had a top speed of 140mph. This was one of the fastest cars of the era so attracted interest from the rich and famous . Listed: The car is expected to attract £1million - more than double the £431,200 it sold for four years ago . And while the average UK home is now £177,000, the value of Ustinov’s Aston has rocketed even more and is expected to sell for around £1 million next month. This is £570,000 MORE than the price paid for the Aston Martin when it was sold at a London auction in 2011. Engineers had fitted the car with a 3.7-litre engine developing around 240bhp, giving it a 0-60mph time of nine seconds and a top speed of 140mph.

It was the first Aston Martin to be produced in Newton Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, which is where it will go on sale at Bonhams auction house on May 9 at the annual Aston Martin sale. The car went down well with critics, with Motors magazine praising its “high quality, exceptional performance, lavish finishing”. They called it “a great British product, benefiting from the styling input of Touring of Milan”. It is not known how long Ustinov owned the Aston Martin, but it had two more owners before being bought by British race car driver David Piper, who sold it in 1984.

It claimed to go from 0-100mph in just 21 seconds, making it a serious competitor to luxury European brands like Ferrari and Porsche .

"From allegations of sexism to claims of fakery, it seems Bear Grylls' latest TV show is never far from controversy, and producers are now back in hot water again. It has been revealed that starving competitors on the survival show hunted and killed an endangered crocodile during filming after the show's bosses mistook it for a more common species. Male competitors had not eaten for two weeks when they tracked down and killed what the show's producers thought was a common caiman - a small, relatively common reptile. Scroll down for video . Male competitors on Bear Grylls' show The Island had not eaten for two weeks when they killed what producers believed was a common caiman - but later discovered was an endangered American crocodile . However, suspicions were raised when the animal slain on camera appeared larger than usual, and it has now turned out to be an endangered American crocodile. While the animal's exact numbers in the wild are unknown, conservationists are in agreement that illegal hunting and habitat destruction have left it critically endangered. Most U.S. states in which the creature is native, along with islands in the Caribbean, parts of Mexico and South America have all passed laws protecting the creature. According to The Sun, the show's producers had surveyed the islands used during the show before contestants were set loose, trying to identify any animals which would be off-limits for hunting. A spokesman for Channel 4 said the islands used in the show were surveyed to establish what wildlife lived there before filming, and it was not known that American crocodiles (pictured) could be found there . While several caimans had been discovered, it was not known that the American crocodile also lived there until the competitors found it. The episode in which the animal is killed on a remote island off Panama, central America, will be screened tonight. A spokesman for Channel 4, which produced the show, said: 'This was a genuine and regrettable error. Prior to filming experts were consulted to ascertain species on both islands and the American crocodile was not known to be in the area or on the island. 'The relevant national environment agency are aware of the incident and have granted a licence to replace the animal which has now been done.'","Male contestants had not eaten for two weeks when they killed reptile .

"A man facing trial for helping his former lover strangle a woman during a sexual encounter, told the court his former flame had a 'twisted desire to kill' and that he had only dug the victim's crude grave. Micheal John Duffy, 34, pleaded not guilty to murdering Colleen Deborah Ayers, 33, whose decomposed body was uncovered in a shallow grave on her parent's 25-acre Lakesland property, located near Picton, south west of Sydney. In the opening statements of Duffy's trial Crown prosecutor Elizabeth Wilkins SC told the jury, that while his former partner, Rachel Evans, had initiated the violent act, Duffy had willingly joined in. He claimed his co-accused, Evans, was the one who had a 'twisted desire to kill' and he had only helped bury Ms Ayers' body. Micheal John Duffy pleaded not guilty to killing Colleen Deborah Ayers after claiming he had only disposed of her body while his co-accused Rachel Evans was the one with a 'twisted desire to kill' Ms Wilkins told the court Evans was the one who grabbed the belt used to strangle Ms Ayers after telling a witness: 'We are going to kill her, we are going to kill her.' 'She put the belt around Ms Ayers' neck. The deceased bucked her off.' 'It was at that stage that the accused Duffy intervened and also started strangling her,' she said. 'This was Rachael Evans' idea. She was the ringleader and this accused [Duffy] joined in.' The court heard Ms Ayers had met Evans at a pub in Campbelltown only a day before she was gruesomely murdered. It is alleged on May 8, 2012, Evans and Duffy, along with a 16-year-old girl who can not be named, went to a hotel in Picton with  Ms Ayers. Evans, Duffy and Ms Ayers then proceeded to have sex with each other while the unidentified teenager filmed the act. The next day, after drinking and taking the drug ice, Ms Ayers invited the duo, along with another man, Scott Debridge, to her parents empty Lakesland property. Ms Wilkins told the court Evans and Duffy had planned to steal and sell firearms from the rural property so they could buy drugs. Courthouse: Duffy's co-accused Evans, who has plead guilty to murder,  will receive a reduced sentence for giving evidence at her former lover's trial . Later that night, after Evans had been 'cutting up' ice, she heard Duffy and Ms Ayers having sex. The 16-year-old witness said Evans became agitated and armed herself with the leather belt. The court heard Evans then entered the bedroom and started strangling the victim. It was at this point, the crown said, Duffy joined in. Ms Wilkins said once Ms Ayers was dead, Evans dragged her body into the bathroom so she could try to wash away Duffy's DNA. Meanwhile, Duffy and Debridge went to a dam on the property to dispose of the body where they dug a shallow grave and buried Ms Ayers. During his trial, Debridge claimed he tried to refuse the orders to dig the grave, however, Duffy 'bashed' him with a shovel until he continued. After Ms Ayers' body was buried the group proceeded to ransack her parents house, stealing jewellery, an Xbox and, as planned, the firearms. It is reported the group left in a maxi taxi at about 7.40am on May 10. In a chilling revelation, Evans then allegedly told the cab driver she had a 'very exhilarating night'. Ms Ayers wasn't reported missing until May 25, when her parents returned home from holidays to the Lakesland property, where their daughter's body was secretly buried. Ms Ayers' discomposed body was uncovered in a shallow grave on her parent's 25-acre Lakesland property in 2012 . Police finally caught up with Evans on May 31, after her parents spent a week wondering where their daughter could be. Evans took officers to the property and showed them where Ms Ayers was buried. She reportedly told the young witness she felt no remorse for the killing. 'I feel good. I don't feel guilty. The f***ing belt buckle snapped. When I was burying her I started hitting her with the shovel. It felt so good,' the Daily Telegraph reported. During her trial it was revealed Evans sent fan mail to infamous murderer Ivan Milat and bragged to the unidentified teen-aged witness that she would become a 'serial killer' in years to come. Evans has plead guilty to murder and Debridge to being an accessory after the fact, with both receiving discounts on their sentences for giving evidence during Duffy's continuing trial.

"Three men have today been arrested on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence . Three men have today been arrested on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence. North Yorkshire police confirmed the men - all aged in their 50s and from the York area - were arrested this morning. The body of the missing chef, who was 35 when she disappeared in 2009, has still not been found. Officers have now launched a fresh search for evidence which could lead to her whereabouts, which is set to continue over a number of days. Police and forensic officers have been working at three houses not far from where Miss Lawrence lived in the Heworth area of York before she went missing six years ago. It is understood the three men have not been arrested before and they remain in custody. A man, in his 50s and from the York area, was arrested last month on suspicion of her murder. He was later released on bail. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge. Miss Lawrence was last seen on March 18, 2009. She was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at the University of York. Detectives began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of York, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house. They have also issued previously unseen CCTV footage of two people walking near the house. The new arrests, and the arrest in March, are understood to be linked to these lines of inquiry. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, head of North Yorkshire Police's Major Crime Unit and the senior investigating officer in the Claudia Lawrence inquiry, said: 'I urge everyone to again show restraint and patience while we carry out these very important enquiries. Your co-operation and support is greatly appreciated by the investigation team.'

Two houses nearby to Miss Lawrence's are being searched by police, who have cordoned off half of one street with crime scene tape . People living around the homes that are being searched said officers arrived just before 7am. At the address nearest to Miss Lawrence home, uniformed police wearing face masks could be seen carrying out brown evidence bags. At another property, forensics officers wearing white protective suits were clearly at work. Each of the houses is under police guard. Martin Dales, friend of Claudia's father, said the new arrests were a positive movement in the investigation but that progress was a series of ups and downs for the family. Speaking outside the chef's house, he said: 'Peter finds it very hard, going up and down. 'You feel like you might be getting somewhere and then you get let down. 'Three arrests is certainly a big movement for the police though. 'That's four people in the space of one month.

Police conduct searches in  York, at the home of Miss Lawrence. Searches are being conducted which are expected to be ongoing over a number of days . 'The public has been tremendous in keeping information coming which has helped the police.' Mr Dales added: 'Someone is withholding the truth and that is despicable. 'Imagine if it was your daughter and you were sitting around waiting for answers and somebody, for their own skin, was trying to be obstructive. 'I hope the full force of the law comes down on them.' A resident living near one of the houses said police arrived at around 7am today. Tommy Ward, 81, said: 'It started off with one police car then a few more came. 'It was just around about 7am when everything started up. 'I was outside my house watching the world go by at the time. 'I haven't seen anyone arrested but a few weeks ago some sniffer dogs were . there in the same house. We've had dogs a few times now. I don't know the person who lives there.'

"The cost of a daily lunchtime takeaway can be crippling and yet instead of making lunches at home the majority of British workers still pop to the high street to grab their midday meal. The 'meal deal' (which is not always a meal, or a deal) has seen us stave off the hunger pangs with soggy sandwiches, slimy salads and salty soups, spending an average of £1,840 a year. But we could save up to £1,300 a year if we just prepared our lunch at home. Cheese, crackers and charcuterie is a simple and delicious lunch which can be easily assembled in the office . Food website Food52's 'Not Sad Desk Lunch' series demonstrates just how simple it can be to bring healthy, cost-effective, and delicious lunches to work. These incredibly detailed ideas and recipes show how to make everything from easy-to-assemble options such cheese and crackers, to more complicated steamed Chinese buns, and Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches . Each recipe on Food52 is contributed by a member of the team who promises to keep your midday meals 'both interesting and pretty.' If you're after something simple, cheese, crackers and charcuterie will do the job. Simply choose your favourites, assemble and eat; and If you're vegetarian, swap meat for pickled vegetables and you're good to go. Make something complicated like stuffed dumplings (left) or keep it simple with a toast tartine (right) Hannah Petertil has some inspired combinations which include Cheddar, apple, and bacon jam; mozzarella and prosciuotto or manchego and dried apricots. Keeping with the theme, you could also use the handy cracker to spread a variety of toppings. Make a Greek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta; a hummus cracker with roasted red pepper on top; pesto crackers with thinly sliced prosciutto; or smashed avocado crackers. Don't feel like spreading? Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go. Workers could save up to £1,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed. More than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of £1,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals. In comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just £552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping £1,288. The startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home. Pita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables. Experiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes. Remember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita. Still sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine. Spread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous. The site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment. Steamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which  can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou). Jenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.' Steamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms . You can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them. Freeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave. Looking for something even more exotic? Author of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters. Banh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats. The bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in. To make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office. Buns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead. 'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings. I tend to lean towards two of my favorites: pork and chives for my meat option, and chives, egg, and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there,' Betty Liu of Food52 writes.

"The family of a man who was cremated by mistake after a funeral home accidentally put a stranger's body in his coffin have filed a lawsuit. Jerry Moon's family only discovered the devastating blunder when they opened the casket to say their final goodbyes and found the other body wrapped in a plastic bag. While the body of the loving father - who was terrified of cremation - was accidentally incinerated at Dahl McVicker Funeral Home in Kelso, Washington State. The family of Jerry Moon, pictured with his wife Janice, were distraught when they found another man's body in his coffin . A lawsuit filed by the family claims the Brown Mortuary put the body of 97-year-old Robert Petitclerc in the coffin by mistake . The family is now seeking unspecified damages for emotional distress. Chronically ill in his final years, Mr Moon began arranging for his funeral 16 years before his death in 2013. The 72-year-old railroad conductor had paid $4,655 to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis, Washington, according to a lawsuit filed in Lewis County Superior Court. The prepaid services also included embalming, a funeral and a graveside service. After he passed away at a hospice in Longview on October 13, the funeral home was responsible for transporting his body to the Brown Mortuary for a burial. But Shawn Briggs, an attorney representing Moon's family, said his identification bracelet had been placed on another body. Jerry Moon, pictured with at Weyerhaeuser Railroad where he worked for 28 years, was chronically ill in his final years and had began arranging for his funeral 16 years before his death in 2013 . Born in Chehalis, Mr Moon, a father and stepfather to six, spent most of his life in Southwest Washington . According to family members, Mr Moon's funeral was a touching goodbye to the man they loved. At the end of the service, they opened the casket. But they were horrified to find the body of Robert Petitclerc - dressed in Jerry Moon's clothes and with a picture of Moon's wife tucked under the pillow in the coffin. Plastic had been wrapped round his head and face. 'This makes me feel like he was treated as a number, not a person,' daughter Cheryl Moon told KIROTV.com at the time. 'I turned around and said to myself three times, 'That's not him, that's not him, that's not him,' son Randy Moon told the station. The mistake is all the more surprising as Mr Moon was 72 and bald while Mr Petitclerc was 97 and had a full head of hair, the lawsuit said. 'It was horrifying,' Mr Briggs told the Seattle Pi. The family, who had been given a bill of $8,834 by Brown Mortuary for the service, would only later learn that the mix up at the funeral home meant Mr Moon's had been cremated. Mr Moon, pictured with wife Janice, had paid $4,655 to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis, Washington, according to a lawsuit filed in Lewis County Superior Court . Grieving: Moon's son Randy says he believes his father is in Heaven, regardless of who was in the casket . Sadly the discovery was even more upsetting for the family as Mr Moon had always been scared of cremation. 'He was afraid of cremation,' Mr Briggs added. 'He had religious beliefs that were inconsistent with cremation.' Born in Chehalis, Mr Moon, a father and stepfather to six, had spent most of his life in Southwest Washington. Brown Mortuary initially claimed the body was Mr Moon, but later admitted he had been cremated on October 17, 2013, by mistake, according to the lawsuit. The mortuary later sent a $92.72 refund check to Janice Moon. Relatives have now filed a lawsuit against the two mortuaries that mishandled Mr Moon's remains. It says the mortuary acted fraudulently and with malice in its handling of Jerry Moon's body and conspired to cover-up the fact that Mr Moon had been mistakenly cremated. The mortuary is part of a funeral service chain owned by Texas-based Service Corporation International. Representative Kim Tarleton declined to comment on the allegations, saying it would be 'inappropriate to share any details about this situation.'","Jerry Moon, 72, had pre-arranged to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis .
