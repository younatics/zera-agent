"Manchester City have apologised to supporters and promised to hand out ticket refunds after coaches they laid on for free were delayed and missed the kick-off at Crystal Palace. The Premier League champions have written to 300 fans who took them up on their offer of free transport for the Bank Holiday evening clash at Selhurst Park. Palace's South London home is notoriously difficult to get to and the club acted after the game was scheduled for an 8pm start, making it impossible for supporters to travel by train. Edin Dzeko and his Manchester City team-mates reflect on their Premier League defeat at Crystal Palace . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany looks dejected after seeing his side slump to defeat in London . However, after being sent on their way from the Etihad Stadium at 1.30pm by City legend Mike Summerbee, all of those onboard the six coaches missed the kick-off with some arriving as much as 20 minutes after the start. Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival. Now, the club has acknowledged the coaches set off too late and have written to supporters to apologise and advise them that they will be refunding the cost of their match tickets. The letter, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The free coach travel was provided to enable supporters to attend this match on a day when return rail travel from Manchester wasn’t an option due to the kick-off time, and the time of the final train back to Manchester. Glenn Murray is mobbed by his Crystal Palace team-mates after he opened the scoring against Man City . Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew celebrates with the home fans during their win against Manchester City . 'We have liaised with our travel partner and wanted to advise that whilst this was a Bank Holiday, which was factored in to the journey planning, it is accepted that the coaches should have left the Etihad Stadium earlier than they did. 'As a gesture to you and all supporters who travelled on the official coaches, the club will be refunding the money that you paid for your match ticket within the next seven working days. We will contact you if we require any further details to process the refund. 'We would like to apologise for the delayed arrival at Selhurst Park and thank you for your patience and support on the day.' The move is likely to cost the club in the region of £12,000. Things did not get much better for the City fans when they finally arrived for the match as Manuel Pellegrini's side went down 2-1 to all-but-end their hopes of retaining their title.","Manchester City have apologised to supporters and promised refunds .

"Robbie Fowler is already among the names of the best Premier League strikers of all time, with only five players scoring more than his 162 goals. The former Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester City hitman broke on to the scene as a goalscoring sensation at Anfield in 1993 and would go on to win 26 caps with England.

"A gang of fly-tippers have dumped a staggering 40 tonnes of industrial waste at the side of the road in a pretty Suffolk village. The mounds of rubbish, described by one police officer as the worst he has seen in almost 30 years, will cost the public purse thousands of pounds to clear up.

I have never seen anything like it in my 28 years, certainly not in Suffolk, not on that scale and not as blatant.' He added: 'It's quite incredible. If it's a black bin in a layby you almost expect to see it but not three trailers full - this is unheard of.

The recycling rate of just over 59 per cent for 2013/14 put Stratford eighth out of 352 authorities nationwide. District spokesman Councillor Mike Brain said: 'This is great news and it's thanks to our residents that we've been able to achieve this result with their commitment and support for recycling. 'The service we provide is designed to make recycling easy and our residents have responded to that by ensuring they recycle as much rubbish as possible and by limiting the amount of other waste that is produced. 'It is important that residents continue to recycle and one of the reasons why we are performing so high is because more residents are regularly putting food in the green bin and the weekly collection of electric / electronic goods, textiles and batteries is still proving very popular.'

Things escalated after Sydney went 3-0 up in the second half, with the supporter base venturing onto the concourse to set off more flares. NIB Stadium operators VenuesWest has threatened a five year ban on the patrons who were involved with setting the flares off within the stadium, Perth Now reports. VenuesWest chief executive David Etherton said the organisation will work with police to investigate the incident and CCTV footage to collect all related evidence.

"Roberto Martinez has ruled Darron Gibson out of the rest of the season after he underwent tests on his damaged metatarsal. The Everton midfielder was hurt in the 2-1 win over Queens Park Rangers last month but Martinez was hopeful that Gibson would be able to play some part in the final seven matches of the campaign. Now, though, he has been forced to admit defeat with that plan. It is a blow for the Everton manager, whose side have staged a mini-revival in recent weeks, but he insists there is positive lining in that Gibson, who missed almost all of Martinez's first campaign with cruciate ligament damage, does not require surgery. Everton midfielder Darron Gibson will not play again this season after damaging his metatarsal . Everton manager Roberto Martinez expects Gibson to return to pre-season in the best possible shape . Martinez now expects the former Manchester United midfielder to return to pre-season in the best possible shape and maintains he has a crucial role to play in Everton's future. 'I don't think we are going to see him this season,' said Martinez. 'But I am not too worried about that. It is a tricky injury because if you don't heal it properly, it could come back. We need to make sure he is 100 per cent. If he is fully fit for pre-season, that would be fantastic. 'Darron has been through a lot. We don't have another player like him in the squad. We are trying to support him. He can add that calm feeling, he has shown his worth and what he is capable of adding. But it is tough, I won't lie. It is devastating for him. 'We just have to look at the positive that he doesn't need surgery, as at one point it looked very likely.' Martinez, meanwhile, has admitted Romelu Lukaku is only '50/50' to be involved in Saturday's trip to Swansea owing to a hamstring injury. The Belgian international, whose future on Merseyside has been the subject of speculation, has only been making slow progress. Everton striker Romelu Lukaku is only '50/50' to be involved against Swansea due to a hamstring injury . We will give him as much time as we can,' said Martinez. 'It is still 50/50 as to whether he will make it. We need to make sure he is 100 per cent before we put him on the football pitch again. It is not a big problem but we do not want to take any risks with him. 'But we are very strong in terms of numbers. The squad is developing really strong competition for places. We want everyone fit and available. The squad is big enough to cope with these problems. After the demands of Europe, we have fully focused on the league. 'We have been able to cope with the mental fatigue. I do feel that we will learn and the focus is getting good momentum in the season. There are lessons to learn. We are now a more mature team. It's been a tough season and we will learn our lesson. We want to continue our momentum.'","Darron Gibson was injured in Everton's 2-1 win over Queens Park Rangers .

"An imam who was gunned down in the street in a murder that is thought to have links to terrorism had been replaced at his mosque by a Caribbean preacher involved in an attempted coup d'état 25 years ago. Abdul Hadi Arwani, 48, was found slumped in a Volkswagen Passat on Wednesday morning in Wembley. The imam, described as 'the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet', had gun  wounds to the chest. He was said to have been embroiled in dispute with his former workplace, the An-Noor mosque in Acton, where he had been replaced by Hassan Anyabwile from Trinidad and Tobago. The  name of Mr Anyabwile, 53, appears in Caribbean parliament documents surrounding a violent coup attempt in 1990 by Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeen. Hassan Anywabwile (left) from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Abdul Arwani (right) at the An-Noor Mosque in Acton. Mr Arwani was found dead on Wednesday with bullet wounds in his chest . Mr Arwani stepped down from his role at the mosque last year after it was repeatedly linked to extremism. When contacted, staff at the An-Noor Mosque refused to answer questions about the former preacher's time there . Over the course of six days, almost 100 members of the Islamic organisation were involved in holding hostages at gunpoint in the island's capital, Port of Spain. The city's police headquarters were blown up in the coup, with Mr Anyabwile described by a Parliamentary report of being 'responsible for organising the use' of the explosives involved. The coup ended after six days with the insurgents' surrendering on the condition of amnesty on August 1. Twenty-four people had been killed in the anarchy. It is understood Mr Anyabwile replaced Mr Arwani at the An-Noor mosque in Acton, West London, some time around 2013. He is registered as having lived in London since 2005. Mr Arwani stepped down from the An-Noor mosque last year following repeated accusations that it was linked to extremism. When approached this afternoon Mr Anyabwile, who became partially disabled after being shot four times in legs, denied any knowledge of any dispute. Anyabwile is named in a Trinidadian parliamentary report on an attempted coup which saw 24 people killed in 1990. He is described as being 'responsible' for the use of explosives in the blowing of police headquarters . Mr Anyabwile did not comment on claims Mr Arwani had been embroiled in a dispute with the mosque when approached . Arriving for midday prayers the man, who was helped into a wheelchair by a security guard, told the MailOnline: 'Feud? I know nothing about that. 'All I can say is from Allah we come, and to Allah we return.' When contacted today another member of staff at the mosque refused to answer questions about Mr Arwani's time there. A statement printed on a piece of paper and taped to its front door read: 'We have with great sadness heard of the unfortunate death of Shaykh [sic] Abdulhadi Arwarni who was the former Imam of the Annoor [sic] Cultural & Community Centre who served from 2005 to 2011, he will be sadly missed. 'We send our sympathies and condolences to his family, the Muslim community and friends. May Allah forgive him and open the doors of mercy onto him.' But one friend of the late imam said the dispute between the father of six and the An-Noor Mosque had been heated. Solicitor Mohammad Bassam Tablieh, 43, said there had been conflict about the 'running' of the mosque. There is no suggestion that either Mr Anyabwile or the An-Noor mosque in Acton is suspected of  any involvement in his death, with counter terrorism police still investigating. Scotland Yard officers called in the specialist division because 'of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. 'The investigation remains in its very early stages and officers remain open-minded about the motive,' a spokesman added. Earlier this week sources close to the Mr Arwani said they feared he may have been killed by supporters of the Syrian president Bashar-al-Assad - of whom the imam was a fierce critic. Describing his father as 'the most peaceful man you could meet,' one of his six children, Murhaf, said he was 'actively involved in the fight against extremism'. 'He did not care what your background, race or status was. He did not care if you were rich or poor. 'He just wanted to help people in need. He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it,' he said in a statement. Later his 23-year-old daughter, Elham Arwani, said while her father was openly 'against Assad', she did not think that was the reason behind his killing. Mr Arwani's family said they did not believe his death was connected to his opposition of the Assad regime. Speaking at the family home (above), his 23-year-old daughter said that was likely 'not the reason' Anyabwile was involved in the attempted coup of Trinidad and Tobago in 1990. Above, a rebel fighter stands with his AK-47 during the six-day standoff . Almost 25 years ago, around 100 members of the radical Islamic group Jamaat-al-Muslimeen stormed Trinidad and Tobago's Parliament in Port of Spain. They were demanding that the then Prime Minister, Arthur Robinson, resign and that new elections be held, accusing the leader of wild extravagance while, they said, its working classes went hungry. The rebels blew up Port of Spain's police headquarters and stormed a state-run television channel in a bid to take control of the Trinidadian capital. The Muslimeen's leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, appeared ominously on air during the first day of the coup attempt. Among one of their hostages was Mr Robinson. The Prime Minister was shot and beaten during the six-day coup. Violence and looting ravaged the city as all those who had been in the buildings when the Muslimeen stormed remained in their capture. On its sixth day, the rebels agreed to surrender on the condition of amnesty - releasing what remaining hostages they were keeping unharmed. They were all arrested and charged with treason but later released after producing copies of an amnesty that had been agreed when brokering an end to the coup. Anyabwile, formerly known in the Caribbean as Beville Marshall, is thought to have separated from the Muslimeen in 2001. Years later he was shot four times in the legs, leaving him in need of a wheelchair. He had tried to establish his own Islamist group, according to the Trinidadian press. In 2004 a local report claimed he had been turned down for asylum by the Home Office having told them that his life would be in danger if he returned to the Caribbean island. The attempted coup brought the island's capital to a standstill with looting and violence rife for days . But friends and neighbours claimed critics of the Assad regime had been targeted in the area, with some residents who displayed green flags, a sign of opposition to the Syrian government, having their tyres slashed. Mr Arwani grew up in Hama, the site of a notorious 1982 massacre where up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the Syrian Army under the orders of Hafez al-Assad, the current president's father. He fled the country as a 16-year-old, taking refuge in the UK while his parents faced routine questioning of his whereabouts for years. One of the mourners who gathered in his memory at Nadi Park Royal in Willesden Junction, north west London, said he had returned to Syria in recent years to dissuade fighters from aligning themselves with the Government. The source claimed Mr Arwani stopped going to the country on advice from the Turkish authorities. The An-Noor Mosque, where Mr Arwani used to be one of the main imams, has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers. It became notorious in 2013 when a terror suspect went there and changed into a burqa in order to escape surveillance then went on the run. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed has been missing for 16 months, and was last seen entering An-Noor dressed as a man before leaving in a full-length covering designed for women which obscured his identity. He was subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure, which restrict the movements of people suspected of involvement in terrorism. Other extremists linked to the mosque include Uthman Mustafa Kamal, the son of hate preacher Abu Hamza, who has regularly led prayers at An-Noor.","Abdul Hadi Arwani was found dead in Wembley on Wednesday morning .

"Everton will look to extend Darron Gibson's contract this summer as he recovers from the latest injury setback of his career. Roberto Martinez confirmed on Thursday that the Republic of Ireland international will miss the final seven games of the season with metatarsal damage, but expects him to be ready for pre-season as he does not require surgery. Gibson has endured a wretched time over the last 18 months, not least when he ruptured cruciate ligaments, and his position at Goodison Park could be regarded as vulnerable, particularly as Everton will rekindle their long-standing interest in Tom Cleverley in the summer.

Cleverley, who has spent the season on loan at Aston Villa, will become a free agent in July when his Manchester United contract expires and, given they have worked together before at Wigan, he is a player Martinez will consider recruiting. But Martinez has moved to assure Gibson he has a place in his plans. The 27-year-old was signed by David Moyes in January 2012 and has 12 months remaining on his current deal but his manager is already looking at his situation. 'This injury has arrived at such a bad moment because he was back from another long-term injury but it's something we'll look at in the summer,' said Martinez. 'I've been very pleased with Darron. Coming back from that sort of injury you don't reach 100 per cent for a long time. Everton will look to extend Gibson's contract this summer as he is treated for his latest injury setback . Martinez has moved to assure Gibson he has a place in his plans despite holding an interest in Tom Cleverley . 'But when he's been on the pitch, he's performed really well. From the Leicester game, all his performances have been really influential. Though he's now injured, he's been able to show his worth and for me he is an important player that we want here for the future. 'We are going to see him. But I'm not too worried. It is a tricky injury because if you don't heal it properly, it could come back. We need to make sure he is 100 per cent. If he is fully fit for pre-season, that would be fantastic. We don't have another player like him in the squad. 'We are trying to support him. He can add that calm feeling, he has shown his worth and what he is capable of adding. But it is tough, I won't lie. It is devastating for him. We just have to look at the positive that he doesn't need surgery. At one point, it looked very likely.' Cleverley is a target of Martinez and with his Manchester United contract running out a move could happen . Cleverley played under Martinez at Wigan, on loan from United, and has been at Villa Park this season . Having won their last three matches against Newcastle, QPR and Southampton, Everton have put together their best sequence of results in the Barclays Premier League for more than 12 months to clamber away from a potential relegation scrap. There is no chance, however, of them qualifying for Europe next season but Martinez does not think their potential to make new signings in the summer has been effected. He feels the club's progress over the last four years means they are strong enough to withstand this disappointment. Everton have put together their best sequence of results in the Barclays Premier League in over a year . Martinez does not think their potential to make new signings has been effected by a lack of European football . 'Within football when you face an opposition losing or winning doesn't affect players,' said Martinez. 'It's how you lose and I think every player who's faced Everton this season will have come out with a real respect and a real appreciation of the way we play as a club. 'We don't rely on 10 months of results, we've got a bigger picture of what we're trying to achieve and what we've got in the squad, particularly in terms of the younger players who have been given incredible roles. So I think the perception of Everton has improved in the last 12 months. 'We know the positions that we need to strengthen in the summer. It's something we've worked really hard on since January in order to identify those targets but a lot of decisions will depend on how we perform in the last seven games. It's going to be a very important end of season for us.' Martinez says he has 'got a bigger picture' of Everton's progress and does not rely on 10 months of results .","Darron Gibson has been ruled out for the rest of the season with injury .

"It was not the role Bradley Neil would have wanted — the job of being the boy reminding Augusta just how brilliant Jordan Spieth’s opening had been. For while the 21-year-old American was chewing up golf’s most spectacular course, the teenager from Scotland was suffering the role in reverse. Neil earned his invitation to the Masters after winning the Scottish Boys Championship in 2013 and then the British Amateur Championship last year. Bradley Neil finished 13 over par after competing in his first Masters . Still an amateur, the 19-year-old is being tipped for huge things when he does turn pro by no less a star than world No 1 Rory McIlroy. And he had the calming influence of veteran fellow Scot Sandy Lyle playing alongside him as he stepped on to the first tee hoping to recover from a six-over-par round on day one. There was promise as he atoned for hoisting his drive into the trees alongside the fairway with a recovery shot that put him 30 feet from the hole. But three putts later on the first of Augusta’s lightning fast greens, memorably described by Peter Alliss as ‘like trying to roll a ball down the bonnet of a car and stopping it before it falls off’, reality was beginning to bite. The young Scot has been tipped for big things by the likes of Rory McIlroy . He did birdie the par-five second, but then came five more dropped shots to reach the turn in 41, and the youngster finished the day on 79, 13 over par in all and facing the truth that his big weekend was already over. ‘I’d prepared well for this, but it shows my game is not good enough yet,’ he admitted. ‘I need to work hard on it if I want to get back here. ‘I’m jealous that Sandy gets to come back here every year, and I also want to do that in the future.’ Lyle, who won the green jacket in 1988 as one of the two major wins of his career, is 57 and a student of traditional hickory clubs — he won the World Hickory Open at Carnoustie last year. He even used a putter from the bygone era as he made his 34th Masters appearance. But although he three-putted only once, he carded a 76 to end day two at six over par.","The 19-year-old is being tipped for huge things when he does turn pro .

"Danny Willett gave a rules official, who had been in his line-of-sight, a verbal blast which was clearly audible to spectators surrounding the 17th green at the Masters on Thursday. Englishman Willett vented his anger after his second shot from beyond the green trickled all the way across the putting surface and left the preacher's son facing a bogey or worse. 'Of anyone you should know the rules,' Willett shouted loudly at the official, who was sitting about 60 yards away in a golf cart, outside the gallery ropes. Danny Willett waits to play a shot on the fifth during the first round at 2015 Masters on Thursday . The 27-year-old Englishman carded a one-under 71 during his first ever round at Augusta . Willett was still visibly angry as he left the green after salvaging a bogey, though he had calmed down by time he spoke to reporters about 30 minutes later. He said his ire had been raised because the official had been in his line-of-sight as he was preparing to play his shot. 'We were being timed (for slow play), which I can appreciate,' Willett said after carding a one-under 71 at Augusta National. 'It's a little bit tricky out here, so it takes a little bit of time, but you'd like to think the referee that's timing you knows exactly where to put his buggy and where not to put his buggy.'

"Bradley Neil admitted he needed to give himself a 'kick up the arse' after missing the cut on his Masters debut at Augusta National. The 19-year-old Scot carded rounds of 78 and 79 to finish 13 over par, although he did at least sign off in style with a birdie on the 18th. 'It was a great learning experience but very tough,' said the 2014 Amateur champion, who played with 1988 Masters winner Sandy Lyle. 'Every time you get to play with the world's best you'll take something away. This is where I want to be in a few years time. I just need to keep working harder. Amateur champion Bradley Neil missed the cut on his debut at the Masters . The Scot admitted he needed to 'give himself a kick up the a***' after struggling on the professional tour . 'I've prepared well for this but this shows it's not been enough. Sandy was great. Putting is one of the best parts of my game but I struggled with it and he pointed something out and I'll take that on board. 'I'm very jealous of him, he gets to come back (here) every year. That's something I want to do in the future. I think I'm good enough to get back here, I think I have the game to do that. I need to give myself a right kick up the arse after this. I'm desperate to come back.' Neil still harboured hopes of making the cut after his first round, but carded four bogeys, a double bogey and one birdie to cover the front nine in 41, before coming home in 38. 'You know how tough this place is before you get here but any expectations you have are blown out of the water,' he added. 'You don't realise how tough it is until you play it. You watch it so much on TV but you can't believe the difference. Neil was playing with fellow countryman and former Masters winner Sandy Lyle . 'It deserves all the respect it gets. It's the best in the world, the toughest in the world. It's been a game of two halves the last few days. It's been taking a step forward and then taking two back. I couldn't get one up on the course, it just kept coming back at me. 'I'm disappointed with the last two days, I've done worse here than I did at the Open (missing the cut on 11 over at Hoylake). 'I thought this would suit me better than the Open. My season has been disappointing so far but I'm playing against world-class fields and bigger, better courses than I was on the amateur circuit.

"Police have blasted motorists who played an impromptu game of football on the M25 after becoming stuck in a major traffic jam. Long tailbacks built up on both sides of the carriageway as a stretch of the motorway between junctions four and five in Ortford, Kent was closed so an air ambulance could land to rescue a seriously injured female motorcyclist. But during the hour-long delay today, Kent Police received reports that people started kicking a ball about in the closed stretch of the road. Motorists who were caught playing football on the M25 after becoming stuck in a major traffic jam on the motorway in Kent . They tweeted: 'We have reports people are playing football in the static traffic on the M25. 'This is dangerous. We ask that people remain in their vehicles.' Meanwhile at the same time two teenagers found themselves stranded on the wrong side of the motorway when the clockwise carriageway reopened. Police said that the pair had walked to the opposite side after the road was closed and had to be escorted back to their vehicle by police after it reopened catching them unaware. A Kent Police spokesman said: 'The pair had reportedly walked across the motorway whilst the road was closed, but then were unable to get back when the road was re-opened. 'A patrol helped them return to their vehicle. 'Police are now appealing for information following a serious road traffic collision on the M25 between junctions 4 and 5. 'The anti-clockwise carriageway is still currently down to one lane and motorists are advised to avoid the area. Kent Police tweeted warning motorists to remain inside their vehicles while they were stuck in the gridlock . 'Police are also keen to remind people to stay in their vehicles if they are stuck in stationary traffic.'

The blaze sent plumes of black smoke across the carriageway with footage taken by motorists showing the wreckage of the vehicle.

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff sees no reason to go cap in hand to the powers that be within the German giant and demand extra revenue to fight off the new threat of Ferrari. From out of the blue, it was the scarlet red of Ferrari that was back on the top step of the podium for the first time in almost two years last time out in Malaysia, pushing reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg down to second and third. From the threat of another Silver Arrows-dominated campaign in the wake of last year's stunning success and crushing start to the season in Australia, Formula One was provided with a much-needed tonic with Ferrari's return to winning ways courtesy of Sebastian Vettel. Sebastian Vettel saw off the challenge from Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . Vettel (right) won the second race of the season following Mercedes' dominance last year . That led to speculation Wolff was prepared to ask for more funds from the Mercedes board to ensure his team stayed ahead of the pack. But a dismissive Wolff said: 'We have everything we need. 'We feel confident in the resources we have, the staff we have, and that we are well-placed. 'We just need to stay calm, continue to develop and put the right things on the car. 'Maybe we put some things earlier on the car than planned, but there is no reason to panic. 'We are back into a regular racing season where you have more than just one contender, and more than one-twos every single weekend. It's back to normal business.' Mercedes chief Toto Wolff claims the champions will just keep calm and carry on . Mercedes will look into reasons why the team was beaten into second and third in Malaysia . Wolff insists his team has left no stone unturned since the race in Malaysia in a bid to uncover what went wrong, even though most teams would jump through hoops for a two-three finish. 'Although we had two cars on the podium, we have been looking very carefully at every area where we could have performed better,' said Wolff. 'Our opposition has raised its game and we must now raise ours even further. 'As we have said since Melbourne, we expect a season-long battle for both world championships and we must maximise every opportunity. Rosberg (left) and Hamilton visited Mercedes' Brackley base to go through their cars on Thursday . 'China is the next chance to do that - a circuit which has been a good hunting ground for the team. 'Lewis has a great record here, and for Nico it's where he made his first step into the winners' circle. 'We have the weapons at our disposal and we need to make the most of them this weekend.' Hamilton is a three-time winner at the Shanghai International Circuit - including last year - whilst he has been on the podium on three other occasions. Rosberg, meanwhile, was second to Hamilton last year after triumphing in 2012. Like Wolff, Hamilton knows more can and will be done, as he said: 'Malaysia was a tough weekend. Hamilton heads to Shanghai having won the Chinese Grand Prix last year on his way to the title . 'It always is with the heat, but with car problems on Friday, rain during qualifying on Saturday and a race which didn't go to plan on Sunday, that one was particularly challenging. 'Ultimately we made the best choices we could, but there is always room for improvement and we've been working hard to analyse everything for the next race in China. 'The circuit is one I really enjoy and it suits my driving style quite well. 'I won the race last year and have only finished outside of the podium places twice, so the target is definitely to build on that and get back to the front.' The British driver is congratulated by film star Arnold Schwarzenegger after winning the Australian Grand Prix . From his perspective, Rosberg is far from happy with his two races to date which have seen him finish second and third. 'It's not been a perfect start to my sixth year with the team and I'm determined to turn that around this weekend,' insisted Rosberg. 'Of course, my team-mate will have other ideas, so will my compatriot in the red car (Vettel) I'm sure. 'But this is a track that has always suited me well, so I'm aiming to put in a strong weekend.'","Sebastian Vettel gave Ferrari victory at the Malaysian Grand Prix .

"What better way to kick off the week you get married than by settling a pressing matter at work before you relax and prepare for the big day? That is how Andy Murray may be feeling  as he looks to face Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open. The British No1 marries Kim Sears in Dunblane on Saturday and, win or lose on Sunday, he will be heading straight to the airport to get back and focus on what lies ahead next weekend. Andy Murray reacts as he reaches the Miami Open final with a win over Tomas Berdych in the last four . He will face long-time rival Novak Djokovic in the final in Miami on Sunday . Murray's fiancee Kim Sears watches on in the heat in Miami during his semi-final . He would dearly love to do so with the trophy in his luggage. For one, it would represent his biggest tournament win since taking the Wimbledon title in 2013, irrefutable proof that he is back towards his best. Perhaps even more importantly it would end the growing dominance of Djokovic over the Scot — and everyone else for that matter. Murray will need no reminding that he has lost nine out of his last 10 matches against the Serb, so it is a huge task. Even more remarkably, Djokovic has won his past nine finals at these Masters-level events, which are one tier down from the Grand Slams. Murray allowed himself to get befuddled by the world No1’s histrionics in the Australian Open final, and then played a plain bad match when thrashed by him in their Indian Wells semi-final last month. The 27-year-old was in clinical form as he set up a final showdown with Novak Djokovic . Murray reacts after winning the final point before shaking hands with Berdych as he heads into the final . ‘I learned more in the Indian Wells match from what I didn’t do,’ said Murray. ‘The final in Australia didn’t necessarily feel like it came down to the tennis or the tactics, but in Indian Wells there were a few things I did wrong.’ Top of that list was to lapse into his tendency to feel his way into the match, rather than come out firing on all cylinders. If Murray does that again he will lose, but he plays well here and is hugely familiar with the heavier conditions, so this should be closer. He has also played all his matches during the day, which will help with the lunchtime start (6pm UK). His opponent, however, looked incredibly sharp in defusing John Isner’s big serve in the semi-final and Djokovic knows recent history is on his side. Murray is set to marry his fiancee in Dunblane next Saturday . ‘It can only serve as a positive, going in with the fact I won the last six matches we played against each other, especially the most recent one,’ said Djokovic. ‘It gives me confidence and maybe a slight mental advantage. But we are talking about small margins, that’s always the case when we play each other.’ One thing for sure is that the next big tournament when they face off, two players who have been rivals since before their teenage years will both be married men.","Andy Murray faces Novak Djokovic in Miami Open final on Sunday .

"Lawrence Dallaglio views the poor performance of English clubs in Europe as a 'crisis' for French rugby rather than evidence of a gulf in class between the Aviva Premiership and Top 14. Saracens are the nation's solitary representative in the semi-finals after Bath, Northampton and Wasps tumbled out of the Champions Cup over the weekend, scraping through 12-11 against Racing Metro. Most alarming of the defeats was Clermont's spellbinding 37-5 rout of reigning Premiership champions and runaway leaders Saints, whose director of rugby Jim Mallinder admitted the result points to a chasm between the English and French leagues.

Scenes of elation as Saracens clinch victory with the last play of the match against Racing Metro 92 . The divide will only grow as more of the southern hemisphere's finest talent head for the Top 14, as typified by Will Genia's decision to snub Bath for Stade Francais and Dan Carter's vast £1.4million salary when he joins Racing Metro after the World Cup. While former England captain Dallaglio regards the influx of household names as exciting for France's club game, he believes it is a disaster for the national side who have not finished above fourth place in the RBS 6 Nations since 2011. Clermont's  Wesley Fofana runs with the ball during the European Rugby Champions Cup match . 'Last weekend's results don't mean there's a crisis in English rugby, rather that the French clubs have more strength in depth,' Dallaglio said. 'I don't think there's a huge difference in class between the English and French leagues - the Northampton result was a one off. 'In fact I'd argue that what we're seeing is a crisis in French rugby. I see players who are outstanding for their clubs - guys like Wesley Fofana and Maxime Machenaud - not playing well for France. Clermont winger Napolioni Nalaga runs with the ball during the match against Northampton . Wasps' Ashley Johnson attempts to bust through the wall-like defence of European champions Toulon . 'There is something going dramatically wrong in French rugby because while they're happy to attract the biggest and best foreign names to their club game, they're doing so at the expense of their national side. 'There's a balance to be struck and we've got it right in England, Ireland and Wales, but in France it's totally out of balance.' Fofana was mesmerising against Northampton yet he was eclipsed by former England full-back Nick Abendanon, whose debut season at Clermont has been a roaring success and prompted calls for an end to his international exile. Wasps' No 10 Alex Lozowski kicks away from Michalak during their European Champions Cup quarter-final . Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) scores his second try against Northampton . Nine months in the Top 14 has shaped Abendanon's own views on Les Bleus' shortcomings. 'A lot of the players representing France I wouldn't pick if I was their coach,' Abendanon said. 'This is only my personal opinion, but the coaching at Clermont is of a very high standard while the French team is looking a little bit lost. They need guidance and better coaching. 'France seem to kick away a lot of ball, yet they have players like have Yoann Huget and Wesley Fofana in their backline.' Ali Williams crosses for a late try for Toulon as they put victory over Wasps on Sunday beyond doubt . nICK Abendanon cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory . Abendanon's Clermont will face Saracens in the first Champions Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne on April 18, a rematch of last season's showdown at the same stage when the French club were humbled 46-6 at Twickenham. Dallaglio believes spectators at the Stade Marcel-Michelin on Saturday had been present at a special performance that left Northampton shell-shocked. 'Clermont are the best side not to have won the European cup and you get the sense from their win against Northampton that their name might be on the trophy this year,' Dallaglio said. Northampton captain Dylan Hartley leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat . 'That was possibly the best quarter-final performance I have seen in the history of this competition. It will take a very good side to stop them. 'Northampton will be scratching their heads wondering why they lost by so many points, but they were simply blown away by a side who reached a completely different level. 'That doesn't make Northampton a bad side - we've all come back from France with our tails between our legs after being beaten by a better side and I include myself in that.'

The club future of the England and Lions flanker appeared to be in doubt last month when his cruel injury jinx struck again. Croft suffered a dislocated shoulder in the Tigers’ victory over Newcastle and, after surgery, he was left facing six months of rehabilitation. In 2012, the 29-year-old suffered a broken neck and he missed most of last season with a knee injury while this latest setback has almost certainly ruled him out of the World Cup. Tom Croft has signed a new deal with Leicester which keeps him with the Tigers despite his injury troubles . Despite Croft’s lack of action in recent years director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘I have agreed a contract with him. Tom has had some poor luck injury-wise. We all know when Tom’s fit he is world-class. ‘He is still relatively young. He has been very loyal to the club over a long period and we have supported him hugely. It’s the right thing to do. I think he will come back and we will be talking about Tom Croft playing how Tom Croft can play.’","His cruel injury jinx struck again as the England and Lions flanker dislocated his shoulder against Newcastle .

"Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges. Reports emerged on social media on Thursday afternoon suggesting the Newcastle United owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks - including the 'Ready' badge and mascot Broxi Bear. The Sports Direct tycoon had been given security over the icons and logos as part of the £5million loan handed to the previous Gers board in January. Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges . Reports emerged  suggesting the Newcastle  owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks . But now Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation after documents appeared on the government-run Intellectual Property Office (IPO) website showing the club's trademarks were now controlled by SportsDirect.com Retail Ltd. In a statement a club spokesman said: 'The board is currently conducting a review of all contractual documentation but this particular issue has become a matter of urgency.' News that Ashley has seized hold of more treasured assets will worry the Ibrox faithful. The Londoner is already vastly unpopular after grabbing hold of a 75 per cent share of the club's retail income with his loan deal. Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation into the claims surrounding Ashley . The IPO site confirm the transfer from Rangers Football Club Ltd to Sports Direct was fully assigned on March 25 - less than three weeks after former chief executive and Ashley ally Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach, a former Sports Direct executive, were removed at a general meeting called by King. Yet Interim chairman Paul Murray announced two days later that the new board had held 'no discussions with Mike Ashley or Sports Direct'. Rangers announced last week that if they gain promotion to the Premiership, they will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 as part of the deal which saw five Magpies youngsters move to Ibrox on loan.

"Ferrari technical director James Allison believes Mercedes are again likely to lead the way in China this weekend. Fears of another season of domination from Mercedes were blown away by a shock, yet deserved victory for Sebastian Vettel last time out in Malaysia. It was the Maranello marque's first success for almost two years and at least offered hope to neutrals that reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg will not have it all their own way. Sebastian Vettel won the second race of the season with victory in Malaysia last month . Vettel saw off the challenge from Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . In searing heat and high track temperatures the Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen were far kinder on their tyres, stopping only twice compared to the three trips to the pits for Hamilton and Rosberg. This weekend's race at the Shanghai International Circuit, however, should favour Mercedes given the cooler climes than that of Sepang. Allison is certainly not expecting back-to-back Ferrari wins and said: 'Our car has a pretty decent cooling package. 'That allowed us to operate in the fierce temperatures like we experienced in Malaysia without having to open up the car. 'The track was also rough and hot, which is hard for tyres, and we're fortunate the car goes well on its tyres. Hamilton celebrates his win in Australia . 'Quite what problems were going on in Merc-land I don't know. 'But I'm fairly sure we will have our work cut out in China to do as impressive a job as we did in Malaysia.' As to whether Ferrari can stay the course with Mercedes and provide a season-long challenge, for now that is too difficult to determine. 'I don't know about that. I'll tell you at the end of the season,' remarked Allison with a smile. 'In Melbourne (the season-opening Australian Grand Prix) Mercedes were very, very dominant, and we were better than we looked. 'Even in free air we wouldn't have held a candle to them there. 'There is a lot of work for us to do before we can head into every race weekend confident we can hunt for the victory from the first session of that weekend. 'But we do have a fairly exciting development plan, and we've a lot of performance to bring. 'It should at least be an interesting season to see if we can close that gap so we are genuine contenders at any weekend.' Crucially, and what may yet be a determining factor, Allison added: 'Normally over the course of a season being kind to your tyres is the best thing you can be.'","Ferrari won the second grand prix of the season in Malaysia .

"It's a sight Manchester United fans have been accustomed to for years but after a 16-month wait 'normality' for those on the red half of the city has only just been restored. For the first time since November 23, 2013 United sit above 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City in the Premier League after having played the same number of games. Following City's 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday night they now trail Louis van Gaal's side by a point ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford. Manchester United sit above Manchester City in the Premier League table for the first time in 16 months after having played the same amount of matches - following the latest round of results .

Wayne Rooney (centre) scored a stunning half-volley as  United beat Aston Villa 3-1 on Saturday . City now trail United by a point, following Monday's defeat at Palace, with seven league games remaining . The last time this had happened United sat sixth on 20 points, one ahead of then ninth-placed City after 11 games during the 2013-14 campaign. This had occurred following City's 1-0 defeat at Sunderland on November 10, 2013 while a Robin van Persie header gave the Red Devils victory over Arsenal by the same scoreline going into the international break. However, the intervening 499-day period had been one dominated by Manuel Pellegrini's side as they won the league title and the Capital One Cup last season. In comparison, United slumped to seventh in the table - their lowest-ever finish in the Premier League era - with former manager David Moyes sacked as a consequence for their woeful results. United were last above City in the league after an equal amount of games  on November 23, 2013 . This occurred after City's defeat at Sunderland, Robin van Persie's header gave United a 1-0 win vs Arsenal . United's fall from grace was in stark contrast to the 2012-13 term - when they won the title in Sir Alex Ferguson's last as  Old Trafford boss. Yet post-Ferguson United had only managed to sit above City in the league twice after the same amount of games prior to Monday. Aside from November 23, 2013 the on other occasion occurred on August 26, 2013. Back then this was after the second game of last season as City's 3-2 defeat at Cardiff allowed United to move a point ahead of them following their 0-0 draw against Chelsea. With the Red Devils looking down on their bitter rivals once more, they'll look to extend their one point gap to four  with victory in the derby on Sunday.

"Sergio Aguero says the experience of scoring in a Manchester derby is unparalleled. The Argentine has scored six goals in derby meetings with United and is planning on adding to that tally when the two sides meet at Old Trafford on Sunday. 'I always love to score, but of course it is even more special to score in the big games,' he said. Sergio Aguero smashes the ball against the post during Manchester City's defeat by Crystal Palace .

"Hector Bellerin has enjoyed a superb breakthrough year at Arsenal this season, so much so that he is already being tipped for a move back to La Liga leaders Barcelona. The 20-year-old right back left the Catalan giants four years ago as he pursued a faster route to first-team football, eventually opting for Arsenal in the Premier League. But now, it seems Barca fans are keen for the Spaniard to return to the Nou Camp as they voted the youth international as their preferred choice to replace Dani Alves should the Brazilian leave the club. Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin has been linked with a return to former club Barcelona . PSG and Man United target Dani Alves could leave the Catalan giants as his contract expires this summer . In a poll carried out by Spanish publication 'Sport', Bellerin carries 12 per cent of the vote, with Glen Johnson also included with a mere two per cent. A move would see him follow the route of Cesc Fabregas, who also left Barca before ever playing a first-team game. However, it seems supporters would be happier if Alves stayed, with 62 per cent voting in favour of a contract renewal. The 31-year-old's current deal expires at the end of the season, with PSG and Manchester United potential suitors. Bellerin has been on a rapid road to success during the 2014/15 campaign for Arsenal, filling in for Mathieu Debuchy as the Frenchman struggled with injuries. He scored his second goal for the club against Liverpool on Saturday and is also improving defensively, with Arsene Wenger praising his contribution. Bellerin scored the opener for Arsenal in their impressive 4-1 victory against Liverpool on Saturday .

"Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez is 'worth his weight in gold' after settling in seamlessly at the Bernabeu this season. That's the view of Spanish newspaper Marca, who focus on the impressive form of the Colombian star since his £60million move from Monaco last summer. According to the Madrid-based publication, Los Blancos have won 80 per cent of their games when Rodriguez is in the side compared to just 58 per cent when he's been missing. Marca (left) say that James Rodriguez is 'worth his weight in gold' as AS focus on Cristiano Ronaldo's appeal . The 23-year-old is also described as 'the jewel in Real Madrid's crown' and praised for his influence in the No 10 role after scoring 13 goals and laying on 12 more for his team-mates so far this season. But his biggest triumph - according to Marca - is how he has lived up to his enormous price-tag, becoming a firm fan favourite for Carlo Ancelotti's side. Elsewhere in Spain, AS focus on Real's appeal against Cristiano Ronaldo's yellow card for diving in Wednesday's 2-0 win against Rayo Vallecano. They say that La Liga's competition and appeals committee will meet on Friday to decide whether or not the Portuguese superstar will be allowed to face Eibar this weekend.

"Eden Hazard believes Chelsea have the Premier League title in their grasp. Hazard scored a penalty and set up Loic Remy's winner - either side of Charlie Adam's 65-yard strike - in Saturday's 2-1 win over Stoke which saw the Blues take a seven-point lead at the top of the standings. Jose Mourinho has targeted five wins and one draw in the remaining eight games and Hazard is optimistic Chelsea will win a first Premier League title in five years. Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard insists his side are close to getting their hands on the Premier League title . Hazard jumps in the air to celebrate his goal during the hard-fought win over Stoke City in west London . Hazard told Chelsea TV: 'We are confident. We are first in the league and we take game after game. We have the title in our hands. We want to bring the trophy to Stamford Bridge.' Hazard felt Chelsea's win could have been more convincing. 'In the first half we created a lot of chances,' he added. 'We played beautiful football and OK, we scored just one goal, but we deserved to score three or four. The Belgian international gave Chelsea the lead from the spot and made no mistake against Asmir Begovic . 'The most important thing was the victory and we did very well till the end.' Remy's strike came after Diego Costa had come on as a half-time substitute before going off with a recurrence of his hamstring problem 11 minutes later. Hazard has backed Remy, who could be given an extended run in Costa's anticipated absence, to keep on scoring after the France striker's second winner in successive games.

"In true Zlatan Ibrahimovic style, he was not content with simply breaking the 100 goals barrier for Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday evening. The 33-year-old added another two to make it a hat-trick on the night and take his total tally to 102 goals in less than three years in the French capital. To put his remarkable goalscoring record at PSG into perspective, he now trails only former Portugal forward Pedro Pauleta in the all-time record books. Pauleta scored 109 in 211 games for PSG between 2003 and 2008, Ibrahimovic has played in just 124 games so far. Zlatan Ibrahimovic slides on his knees after scoring for Paris Saint-Germain in their semi-final on Wednesday . The Paris Saint-Germain star was presented with a trophy to celebrate hitting 100 goals for the French side . Ibrahimovic’s hat-trick and a goal from Ezequiel Lavezzi saw them beat Saint Etienne 4-1 and remain on course for a unique quadruple, with a Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona to come next week. After the match, Saint-Etienne boss Christophe Galtier called Ibrahimovic the ‘best foreigner to ever play in France,’ and you would struggle to argue against that assessment. He has been a runaway success since arriving at PSG for £15.7m in July 2012 and claiming in his opening address to fans that he would become ‘part of the history of the club.’ He stuck to his pledge and was Ligue 1’s top scorer in in his first season with 30 goals, compared with the next best on 19 goals. Saint-Etienne boss Christophe Galtier called Ibrahimovic the ‘best foreigner to ever play in France' Ibrahimovic is considered to be one of the finest strikers of his generation despite his volatile demeanour . It was more of the same last season with 26 goals to his closest rival on 16. This season he has faced a challenge from Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon who is currently at the top of the French goalscoring charts but you would not bet against Ibrahimovic catching him before the end of the season. His goals for PSG have ranged from the straightforward to the important and the downright incredible – notably an audacious back heeled volley during a 4–0 win over Bastia in 2013. Ibrahimovic, pictured with Wednesday night's match ball, has never played in the Premier League . Many consider Ibrahimovic to be one of the finest strikers of his generation with an eye for the spectacular, an incredible athleticism and brilliance in the air. But a criticism often levelled at Ibrahimovic is that he has never played in the Premier League. The longest spell he has ever spent at one club is three seasons so on that basis a move away from PSG could be on the horizon. But would he choose the Premier League for a last hurrah? Here Sportsmail looks at his record his six previous clubs. Malmo 1998/99 – 2000/01 . Came through the youth ranks at the club and signed his first contract with them in 1996. Played six matches and scored one goal in his first season and Malmo were relegated. His 13 goals in 28 matches was a major factor in getting them straight back into Sweden’s top tier the next year. Around this time Arsene Wenger expressed an interest in bringing Ibrahimovic to Arsenal but he eventually moved to Ajax for a fee of £6million. Ibrahimovic came through the youth ranks at the club and signed his first contract with Malmo in 1996 . Ibrahimovic moved to Ajax in 2001 after catching the eye at his hometown club . Ajax 2001/02 – 2004/05 . There was initial frustration for the striker who did not feature prominently in manager Co Adriaanse’s plans but once Ronald Koeman took over he was given a starting berth, playing a key part as Ajax won the Eredivisie title in his first season. He scored twice in a 2-1 win over Lyon in his Champions League debut in September 2002 with Ajax eventually falling at the quarter final stage. Dutch team-mate Rafael van der Vaart accused Ibrahimovic of trying to deliberately injure him in an international game and the dispute precipitated his move away from the club. Ibrahimovic is pictured in action for Ajax in their Champions League clash against AC Milan back in 2003 . Juventus 2004/05 – 2005/06 . He reportedly expressed an interest recently in moving back to the Italian club where he feels he has unfinished business. He made an instant impact in the side which had just lost main striker David Trezeguet through injury, scoring 16 goals in his first season. The following season was a different story as he was pushed out onto the flank to play a supporting role. He seemed unmotivated at times and was criticised by fans for his apparent lack of effort in big games. Juventus were hard hit by the investigation into the Italian football scandal and relegated to Serie B at which time Ibrahimovic demanded to be released. Ibrahimovic scored 16 goals in his first season for Juventus but only lasted two years with the Serie A club . Inter 2006/07 – 2008/09 . Inter won the Serie A title each of the three seasons Ibrahimovic was at the club. It took him little time to adjust as he scored 15 goals in his first season. He scored five Champions League goals in the 2007/08 campaign and in May 2008 netted both goals in a 2–0 defeat of Parma on the final day of the season which sealed the Scudetto (Italian title) and a personal Serie A Footballer of the Year trophy. He was the league’s top scorer in 2008/09 with 25 goals, helping Inter to another Scudetto. He was also named 'Footballer of the Year' for a second consecutive season. Following his spell at Juventus, Ibrahimovic moved to Inter Milan where he won the title on three occasions . Barcelona 2009/10 - 2010/11 . Playing in possibly the best club side of all time – including Lionel Messi, Andre Iniesta, Carles Puyol and Xavi – Ibrahimovic immediately set a club record for scoring in all five of his first games. He went on to be named in the UEFA Team of the Year and was the sixth highest scorer in the league as Barcelona won La Liga. His final goal for Barcelona came in a 3–1 defeat over Sevilla which sealed a second Spanish Super Cup for Ibrahimovic. But his relationship with manager Pep Guardiola had broken down and it was time to move on. Ibrahimovic scored in his first five games for Barcelona, but left after two years in Spain to join AC Milan . Milan 2010/11 – 2011/12 . Ibrahimovic returned to Italy on loan with an option to buy for around £17.5m at the end of the season. He missed a penalty in his debut game but things soon picked up and he scored 14 league goals and won his first Scudetto with Milan, who completed their full purchase of him at the end of the season. His disciplinary record continued to be flawed and he was sent off for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the gut and for slapping Napoli’s Salvatore Aronica. He was Serie A’s top scorer in the 2011/12 season with 28 goals. Ibrahimovic made his move back to Italy, firstly on loan, before he signed a permanent deal to join AC Milan .","Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a hat-trick for PSG on Wednesday night .

"Pep Guardiola was in no mood to celebrate as Bayern Munich secured their place in the semi-final of the German Cup with a 5-3 penalty shoot-out victory over Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday.

We have other players and have to adapt the game for them.' Robben was ruled out for around two months with a stomach muscle tear at the end of March.

The PSG defender is out for at least four weeks after scans revealed that the 27-year-old suffered a torn hamstring in Sunday's 3-2 win at Ligue 1 title rivals Marseille. And it seems that boredom has already kicked into the usually jovial Brazilian as he sported a new hairdo on Wednesday. David Luiz posted an Instagram picture sporting a new hairdo in the style of a man bun on Wednesday . Luiz (centre) has time on his hands at present after tearing a hamstring at Marseille on Sunday night . The Paris Saint-Germain defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced . Accompanied with the caption: 'Parisien!' Luiz has his usually flowing brown locks styled into a man bun. The centre back's new look seems to be a source of amusement for his PSG team-mate Lucas Moura who later shared a picture with Luiz among his Instagram followers. 'I'll let you choose the nickname,' the midfielder wrote as he referred to Luiz's barnet later that afternoon. And while Luiz's hair may be a laughing matter to his team-mates, his injury will not be for manager Laurent Blanc as they seek Ligue 1 and Champions League glory this season. The former Chelsea defender will miss both legs of their quarter-final tie against Barcelona in Europe, while potentially missing eight league matches as they look to defend their crown. The 27-year-old (left) will be out for at least four weeks after scans revealed the severity of the injury .","Paris Saint-Germain won 3-2 at Ligue 1 title rivals Marseille on Sunday .

"It's T20 season on the sub-continent and the world's best players are about the pad up for the latest edition of the Indian Premier League, cricket's most exciting and richest domestic tournament. Eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round India in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament's eighth edition, with the final taking place at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 24. Can Kolkata Knight Riders retain their title? Will Virat Kohli lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their first title? Can MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings win their third crown? And who are the players to watch out for? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 Indian Premier League as India prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow. MS Dhoni, pictured in the 2011 Champions League, is looking to guide Chennai Super Kings to a third title . CHENNAI SUPER KINGS . The bright yellow jerseys of the Super Kings are one of the iconic sights of the Indian Premier League. Led by the superstar Indian duo of MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina, Chennai are the most successful team in IPL history. As well as their back-to-back victories in 2010 and 2011, CSK have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four. In international players Dhoni, Raina, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja and Mohit Sharma, the Super Kings have probably the best pool of Indian talent in the tournament, which is key given that seven of the starting XI have to be domestic players. The foreign talent is also strong, though, and includes New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, South African Faf du Plessis and West Indian all-rounder Dwyane Bravo. ONE TO WATCH: There are so many. Dhoni needs no introduction, Raina is the top scorer in IPL history, but MCCULLUM is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment. He hit the first ever IPL century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant World Cup campaign. Brendon McCullum's aggressive brand of cricket led New Zealand to the World Cup final . £1,740,000 - Yuvraj Singh's salary, the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by Delhi Daredevils in the auction. 3325 - runs Suresh Raina has scored, the most in tournament history. 2008 - Year the IPL was first played. 119 - wickets taken by Lasith Malinga, the most in the history of the tournament. 60 - matches in the 2015 tournament. 46 - days the tournament lasts, beginning on April 8 and ending on May 24. 12 - venues to be used in 2015. 8 - teams in 2015 edition of the IPL. 3 -  English players in the tournament - Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pietersen. DELHI DAREDEVILS . The side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final. The Daredevils have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year. They are led by South African JP Duminy and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel, although Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews is a handy player as well. World Cup outcasts Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, all of whom featured in India's successful 2011 team, will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning. ONE TO WATCH: In 22-year-old DE KOCK, Delhi have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world. De Kock has already scored six one-day international tons but his highest score in the World Cup was an unbeaten 78. 2011 World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year's India team . KINGS XI PUNJAB . After years of just making up the numbers, the Kings XI Punjab lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round-robin stage before losing in the final. Punjab's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong Australian contingent, and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, George Bailey and Shaun Marsh. But the Kings XI also have South African powerhouse David Miller in their ranks along with Sri Lankan Thisara Perera. Their Indian talent isn't the strongest in the tournament but Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country, and 21-year-old Axar Patel is one of the best young talents in India. ONE TO WATCH: The destructive MAXWELL. One banner in the stands in Chandigarh last year read 'Glenndeep Singh Maxwell - the King of Punjab'. It was Maxwell's power-hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the World Cup just how dangerous he can be. Glenn Maxwell was one of the top run-scorers in the IPL last year and almost guided the Kings XI to the title . KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS . The reigning champions Knight Riders have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third IPL title in four years. Gautam Gambhir's international career may have stalled, but he is still one of the most talented Indian batsmen out there. Along with Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan was also part of India's 2011 World Cup winning team while Robin Uthappa was the leading run-scorer last year with 660. In terms of overseas talent, Kolkata boast Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib-al-Hasan and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate. ONE TO WATCH: It's rare for India to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace, but they have one in UMESH YADAV. Kolkata will be looking for Yadav to combine with Morkel and Narine as part of a fearsome bowling attack. Sunil Narine, pictured in action for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 Indian Premier League . MUMBAI INDIANS . The team that once featured the great Sachin Tendulkar finally won the IPL in 2013, and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year. In Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Parthiv Patel, Mumbai have a strong core of Indian talent, but it is their overseas game-winners that makes them dangerous. Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-taker in tournament history with 119, and he is joined by Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Corey Anderson and Josh Hazlewood. After losing in the eliminator against Chennai last year, the Mumbai Indians will once again expect to reach the play-offs and mount a serious challenge for the title. ONE TO WATCH: The demon bowler that is MALINGA has made a habit of cleaning up batsmen in the IPL and was key in their success in 2013. He will once again lead this bowling attack.

RAJASTHAN ROYALS . Since Shane Warne's side won the inaugural IPL in 2008, the Rajasthan Royals have only made the play-offs on one occasion since. Rajasthan's short history has been eventful to say the lease. They were expelled by the BCCI and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot-fixing scandal that saw former Test match bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth banned for life. This year's Royals team features a strong Australian presence in captain Shane Watson, Steve Smith and James Faulkner as well as New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. Their Indian talent lacks star quality, though, with Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni the only men who have forced their way into the national side. ONE TO WATCH: Australian SMITH has enjoyed a summer of dominating India and was instrumental in his country winning the World Cup. Smith is a dangerous player with the bat, can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament. Steve Smith will look to continue his excellent form into the Indian Premier League with Rajasthan . Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, pictured in 2009, is a part owner of the Rajasthan Royals . ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE . Any batting order that contains Chris Gayle, AB de Villers and Kohli has half a chance, but it has been Bangalore's bowling that has held them back in recent years. Bangalore have never won the IPL and have missed out on the play-offs altogether in the last three years. The Royal Challengers paid big money in the auction to pick up Dinesh Karthik (£1.17million) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag. But news that World Cup player of the tournament Mitchell Starc will miss the start of the IPL will hurt their bowling attack. ONE TO WATCH: Any of their big three batsmen really, but DE VILLIERS is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket for his stunning range of shots. Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle pictured playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2012 tournament . South African AB de Villiers is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket . SUNRISERS HYDERABAD . The newest team in the Indian Premier League, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the Deccan Chargers. The Sunrisers will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan and their middle order will feature New Zealander Kane Williamson and English duo Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan. Hyderabad also landed Kevin Pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of £205,000 after he was released by the Delhi Daredevils, but the 34-year-old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play-offs. Pietersen reached the agreement with the Sunrisers in order to return to Surrey in an attempt to resurrect his England career, but the play-offs take place during the same week as England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. The Sunrisers also boast a a strong bowling line-up with foreign stars Dale Steyn and Trent Boult supported by Indian internationals Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. ONE TO WATCH: Hyderabad's strength is up top with captain Warner and DHAWAN. The Indian batsman scored two centuries at the recent World Cup and, like Warner, has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he's there for a while. Eoin Morgan will look to move on quickly from England's miserable World Cup when he plays in the IPL . Kevin Pietersen, here playing for Delhi in 2012, will join Hyderabad if they make the play-offs .","IPL 2015 to begin in Kolkata on Wednesday, April 8 .

"Tim Sherwood has branded Aston Villa’s stars ‘icing on the cake players’ — urging them to toughen up before they host Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday night. Villa’s mini-revival has been halted by back-to-back defeats and Sherwood believes his star names must dig deep to avert their relegation crisis. He said: ‘You look through QPR’s side and they’ve got a lot of players who are men with a lot of experience. Tim Sherwood has branded Aston Villa’s stars ‘icing on the cake players’ ahead of their match with QPR . Sherwood believes his star names must dig deep to solve their Premier League relegation crisis . ‘We’ve got a few men — but a lot of pretty much icing on the cake players. I’m trying to get that mentality into them to start digging out results. It’s not what we’re cut out to do.’ Sherwood insists Tuesday night's clash is the most important of his managerial career — and that the same goes for most of his squad. ‘For me, this is the biggest,’ he said. ‘This is huge for them and they have to be able to take it. If they can’t handle it, don’t be at this club and don’t be at the bottom of the league.’ QPR will be without striker Eduardo Vargas on Tuesday evening, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee ligament injury. The 25-year-old Chilean international, on loan from Italian club Napoli, was hurt after scoring the opening goal in Saturday’s 4-1 win at West Bromwich Albion. Vargas will be out for 10 to 12 weeks and will miss his side’s seven remaining matches. QPR will be without striker Eduardo Vargas on Tuesday evening after he was injured previously .

"Arsenal's midfield trio Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta and Abou Diaby have all been handed starts for the club's Under 21s game on Tuesday night as they continue their respective recoveries from injury.

Iliev, Maitland-Niles, O’Connor, Bielik, Ormonde-Ottewill, Diaby, Arteta, Gnabry, Wilshere, Crowley, Iwobi . Wilshere has been out of action since November after breaking his foot against Manchester United, as has club captain Arteta who picked up an ankle injury at home to Borussia Dortmund. Diaby's fitness troubles have been well documented, with the French midfielder racking up 227 weeks out during his nine-year career with the club. All three featured in last week's practice match against a Brentford development XI, with England international Wilshere scoring in the 4-0 victory. Mathieu Debuchy and Mathieu Flamini also appeared in that game, though both are now closer to first team action with the latter coming on against Liverpool on Saturday. Arsene Wenger said last Thursday: 'They’ve no problem after that coming out of the game. They are back available in training, a bit short still of top competitive level certainly but that’s normal. 'They’ve been out for a long time but I was quite surprised by how fit they looked and the quality of their performance - it was good.'

"Alastair Cook insists he is 'refreshed' by this winter's enforced sabbatical at home on the farm. England can only hope their Test captain has benefited indeed, because he can expect to have precious little time for the remainder of this year to regain that sort of perspective. Cook has had a taste already of what is to come, first of all in three Caribbean Tests this month and then a decidedly awkward assignment at home to New Zealand, before England somehow try this summer to regain the Ashes lost 5-0 under his captaincy in 2013-14. England captain Alastair Cook in training in Basseterre as his team prepare for the West Indies Test series . Cook addresses the media at Warner Park in Basseterre ahead of England's Caribbean Tests . Cook (right) and Jonathan Trott walk out for a nets session as England prepare for their series . April 6-7 St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI (3pm BST) 8-9 St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI (3pm BST) 13-17 1st Test, Antigua (3pm BST) 21-25 2nd Test, Grenada (3pm BST) May 1-5 3rd Test, Barbados (3pm BST) To date, he is one match - eight runs in two innings - one problematic radio interview and one departure press conference, alongside coach Peter Moores, back into the regime he departed for three months after his Christmas axing as England's World Cup captain. As Cook, Moores and their playing and management colleagues reconvened at Gatwick Airport on Thursday, the captain's first task was to field questions on a series of topics unlikely to go away any time soon. He made 79 in his last Test innings, part of a wide-margin and third successive victory at home to India last summer, and will be a record-breaker for the foreseeable future as England's most prolific centurion. It was Cook himself, however, who helpfully pointed out those facts will be irrelevant when he next walks out to open the innings for his country. Before and after that moment, he will be beset by the endless stream of enquiries - about his own poor form of the past two years, his and Moores' future, the remarks of outspoken new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves ... and, of course, Kevin Pietersen. Alastair Cook smiles while fielding during England's Test series with India last summer . Cook bats during the fifth Test against India at The Oval last year . The speculation over whether Kevin Pietersen will return to the England fold will overshadow the tour . The wonder is whether Cook can clear his mind sufficiently to defend his wicket against the new ball, or dispatch a wide one. That ability, though, is what sets apart batsmen of his calibre - and he can only keep telling himself he has the track record to prove it. 'That's what I've got to do ... at the top of the order you're paid to score runs, and I'd love to get back to that. 'Every time you go out to bat you start on nought. 'The record you have in the past counts for nothing when you walk out there.' Cook waved what he hoped would be a brief goodbye to Moores, less than a week before turning 30 on Christmas Day, still apparently full of optimism - despite an unsuccessful tour of Sri Lanka - that he would be retained to complete the task he had been set three-and-a-half years earlier, to lead England to the World Cup. Cook struggled for form playing for the MCC against Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi last month . Cook will hope England can regain the Ashes when they face Australia later this summer . The tinsel could barely have been in place around him, wife Alice and their baby daughter at their rural home before he discovered he would be staying on well into the new year after all. Back to work last week, after England's World Cup embarrassment without him and off his own bat after those two brief innings for MCC against champion county Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi, Cook could do little else than try to impart a little positive spin on events. 'It's been a different couple of months from what I thought I would have before Christmas. 'Every cloud has a huge silver lining, and spending three months at home has been fantastic. 'It's been living a normal life again - which I haven't had for quite a long time - and it's been great, spending time with family and friends and being at home. 'It's been refreshing, but the challenge now is that a lot's gone on since that last win against India at The Oval. Cook pictured in conversation with England head coach Peter Moores during a nets session on Sunday . Cook (centre) takes part in a fielding drill at Warner Park in Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis . 'To say we can get back there straight away is going to be a challenge for the players and for the leadership, with me and Mooresy, to try to do that.' It is a moot point whether Graves' words will help them or not. He spelled out in the weeks before England's first venture of an outrageously hectic year that, should Cook's tourists fail to beat the 'mediocre' opposition they are set to face in the Windies, there will be 'inquiries'. Encouraged or otherwise by that, Cook is experienced enough to know - especially after England's disappointments and struggles since they won their last home Ashes series - that success will be hard-earned and is no foregone conclusion. Reminded of the chairman's synopsis, he said: 'Anyone who has to cross over the line and face 90 mph bowling from Kemar Roach will have a different view of that. 'We know that winning any series away from home will take a lot of skill and effort.'","England begin their tour of West Indies in Saint Kitts on Monday .

"Nabil Fekir's father insists Arsenal would be the ideal destination for his son, rather than a move to Manchester City. The young Lyon star has been attracting interest from Premier League clubs but the frontman's father Mohamed does not want him to sit on the bench at Man City and claims he would progress with Arsenal under Arsene Wenger. Fekir recently split with his agents after his family were reportedly disappointed with their insistence on pursuing a deal with City. Nabil Fekir's father believes a move to Arsenal would benefit the Lyon star, rather than a switch to Man City . Fekir (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring the opener in Lyon's 3-1 win over Guingamp . According to Foot Mercato, Fekir's father said: 'They pushed for him to sign for City. But I told them if he goes to City and finds himself on the bench, it doesn't interest me, and the kid is not interested either. 'He loves to play, he does not like to be replaced. And they pushed to sign him for City, that's why he preferred to stop with them.' Speaking to La Perisien, the 21-year-old's father also said: 'Nabil would like to finish 1st or 2nd and play Champions League football with Lyon. If he leaves, it'll be for Arsenal. It's the only club that can enable him to progress, with Arsene Wenger. He will not go to Manchester City to sit on the bench.'

"Kevin Pietersen has lashed out at Graham Gooch for commenting on his attempted England comeback. Gooch appeared on BBC Radio Five Live on Sunday morning and took a broadly supportive stance of Pietersen, who has re-signed for Surrey in an attempt to stage an unlikely Test return. Gooch, the former England captain who also worked as the national side's batting coach until last year, went as far as saying Pietersen had 'wiped the floor with the ECB' in the lengthy PR battle since his sacking in 2014. Kevin Pietersen has lashed out at Graham Gooch for commenting on his attempted England comeback . Gooch (above) went as far as saying Pietersen had 'wiped the floor with the ECB' in the lengthy PR battle since his sacking in 2014. The 34-year-old Pietersen wants to end his England absence that started after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash . But Pietersen appeared to take exception to Gooch's suggestion that a Test series victory in the West Indies this month would take the 34-year-old's name off the agenda. He retweeted a BBC Online article and then posted a brief but pointed attack on Gooch, relating to his captaincy on the 1982 rebel tour of Apartheid-era South Africa. It read: 'Graham Gooch - you captained a rebel tour of SA, got banned & then returned to the England team. I don't think I've done anything as bad!' Earlier, Pietersen had suggested his first practice session of the season could be streamed live to fans. Kevin Pietersen will step up his attempts to earn an England recall when he starts batting on Monday . Pietersen (right) rejoined Surrey  after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said domestic form would help . Pietersen has indicated that his campaign will start with a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12 and he is due to return to the nets on Monday. He announced that to his 2.3 million Twitter followers and raised the prospect of using the social network's new broadcast app, Periscope, to showcase his session in real time. He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might @periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live & see how I get on. Should I? £comeback'. Quite how Pietersen's '£comeback' will pan out in the long term is unclear. Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves advised that signing for a domestic side would help Pietersen's cause . Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves has offered just enough encouragement for him to believe he could once again wear the Three Lions - despite a year of bitter recriminations and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography.

Mathieu Debuchy and Mathieu Flamini also appeared in that game, though both are now closer to first team action with the latter coming on against Liverpool on Saturday. Arsene Wenger said last Thursday: 'They’ve no problem after that coming out of the game. They are back available in training, a bit short still of top competitive level certainly but that’s normal.

"Barcelona's 1-0 La Liga victory against Celta Vigo on Sunday evening featured one of the most bizarre incidents of the season so far. With the score at 1-0 following Jeremy Mathieu's 73rd minute header, tempers flared between Celta striker Fabian Orellana and Sergio Busquets as the Barcelona midfielder attempted to waste time during the closing stages.

"Kevin Pietersen has hinted the first chapter of his county comeback could be streamed live to fans. The divisive batsman has re-signed for Surrey this summer in an attempt to win an unlikely England recall, having been thrown an apparent lifeline by incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. He has not played in the LV= County Championship since 2013 but is set to start the season with the Brown Caps in the hope of turning the selectors' heads and reversing last year's controversial sacking. Kevin Pietersen will step up his attempts to earn an England recall when he starts batting on Monday . The 34-year-old Pietersen wants to end his England absence that started after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash . Pietersen (right) rejoined Surrey  after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said domestic form would help . The 34-year-old has indicated that his campaign will start with a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12 and he is due to return to the nets on Monday. Pietersen announced that to his 2.3 million Twitter followers on Easter Sunday, raising the prospect of using the social network's new broadcast app, Periscope, to showcase his session in real time. He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might @periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live & see how I get on. Should I? #comeback'. Quite how Pietersen's '#comeback' will pan out in the long term is unclear. He clearly feels Graves' words are encouragement enough of a Test recall but after so many bitter recriminations - and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography - there are still many bridges to build. His decision to hit the county trail, so long a bete noire in his career, at least offers the platform for him to nudge both selectorial and public opinion from close quarters. But when England flew to the West Indies on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming Test series, the messages were thoroughly mixed.

"Jose Mourinho had placed the Barclays Premier League’s joint-top goalscorer on standby for this match, insisting he would only turn to Diego Costa if absolutely necessary. As it turned out, the emergency glass needed to be broken. The £32million striker was required to stop Chelsea squandering the opportunity to open a seven-point advantage over their title rivals. Yet all they got was 11 minutes before Costa was forced off with a recurrence of the hamstring injury that ruled him out of the international break with Spain. Chelsea striker Diego Costa limped off with a hamstring injury shortly after coming on at the interval . Will he be out for a week, a month, two months, maybe more? ‘It’s too early,’ said Mourinho, who went on to defend throwing Costa on. ‘I don’t say “gamble” because we did every test, every scan, the player trained for two days, he was 100 per cent with the team. ‘The medical department were convinced he was ready. The player was convinced he was ready. Not for 90 minutes but he was ready to play and to help the team.’ In the meantime a chunk of the Chelsea contingent will be wondering how they fill the void left by Costa. They need look no further than this win against Stoke as the answer presents itself in the form of Loic Remy and, of course, Eden Hazard. Blues striker Costa looks despondent as he sits on the turf following another injury to his hamstring . Hazard scored and assisted in the same Premier League match for the seventh time, and looked like a man ready to rubbish the idea he was too tired to play a full 90 minutes for Belgium in midweek. He tormented the Stoke defence here at Stamford Bridge, and has scored more Premier League goals for Chelsea over the past three seasons than any other player. That’s 35, by the way. So, too, was Remy equally as clinical against Stoke. Acting as Costa’s replacement for the starting XI, he proved more than a handful for the visitors on his fourth start for Chelsea in the Premier League. It took an outstanding one-handed save from Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic at full stretch to deny Remy’s deflected shot from giving Chelsea the lead after just three minutes. Then, four minutes later, it was him again, going close as his curled shot skipped agonisingly wide of the far post. The man turned down by Liverpool was given the unfortunate task of trying to fill the boots of Costa, but rarely looked shy in doing so. Yet it remained 0-0 as half time approached. Was it time for Mourinho to roll the dice? It was in the 32nd minute his patience wore thin. Costa looks in pain after pulling up at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 2-1 win over Stoke City . Chelsea gave away possession in the final third – not for the first time – and a frowning Mourinho turned to his substitutes’ bench, gestured at Costa with a nod, and the striker began warming up down the touchline. A sign he was to be introduced soon enough. It took a smidgen of luck for the deadlock to be broken thanks to the quick feet of Cesc Fabregas earning a penalty, and Hazard was cool as ever in putting Chelsea ahead. Never in doubt, as no player in Premier League history has taken more and never missed than Hazard. Yet Stamford Bridge’s celebrations were short-lived. Mourinho’s frustration grew when Charlie Adam channelled his inner David Beckham and scored from more than 60 yards out. With Thibaut Courtois left embarrassed, Mourinho knew it was time to ‘gamble’. Jose Mourinho was happy to have gambled with Costa's fitness despite losing the striker after 10 minutes . Off went Oscar, on came Costa for the second half. No sooner had he been on the pitch than he had to come off. He signalled to the bench after just 10 minutes and was replaced by veteran Didier Drogba. Yet this was all about Chelsea's go-to guy, Hazard, and Costa’s worthy replacement, Remy. ‘We have three strikers,’ Mourinho declared afterwards. ‘We decided at the beginning of the season to go more with Diego. He won the right of being first choice.’ But by this evidence, Chelsea supporters need not lose sleep over their first-choice striker's injury. As Stoke found out, Remy can fill the gap left by Costa, and Hazard is simply every bit a Premier League title winner in the making.

"Manchester City are confident UEFA’s punishment for breaching financial fairplay regulations will be lifted this summer which would allow them to bid for stellar names like Raheem Sterling, Gareth Bale, Kevin de Bruyne and Ross Barkley. City boss Manuel Pellegrini has been hampered over the past year by UEFA restricting them to a net transfer spend of £49million in each window and keeping the club’s overall wage bill to its current level of £205million-a-year. UEFA’s settlement with City published in May stated those penalties would remain in place until the end of the 2015/16 season but the club’s latest financial figures showed drastically-reduced losses of £23million which they feel proves they are now compliant with FPP regulations. Manuel Pellegrini is hoping that the financial restrictions imposed by UEFA for a breach of FFP rules will be lifted at the end of this season . Manchester City have been limited to a net spend of £49million in the last two transfer windows - they spent £25m bringing Wilfried Bony in from Swansea in January . Ahead of Monday night’s trip to Crystal Palace, Pellegrini was certainly talking like a man excited at the prospect of signing 'crack' players this summer. ‘I think that next season we don’t have any restrictions so we will be in the same position that all the other English clubs have,’ said Pellegrini. ‘It’s important. You have so many strong teams here in England and in Champions League, you can not allow them to keep the advantage every year; having less players to put in your squad or spending less money. We spend money, of course we always spend money, but they spent more.’ Manchester United, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal have all paid more in transfer fees in the past 12 months than City who were traditionally Europe’s biggest spenders after the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi owners in 2008. Uefa also ordered City to play with a reduced squad from 25 players to 21 in the Champions League this season and while that restriction has now ended, any time reduction in the penalties on spending and wages is more controversial. Arsenal have paid more in transfer fees than City in the last 12 months, including £30m on Alexis Sanchez . The document published last May by UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body investigative chamber explicitly said City’s financial penalties would run for two seasons at least and there has been no official deviation from that decision. The published statement said at the time: ‘Manchester City agrees to significantly limit spending in the transfer market for the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16. It means City will have to argue their case with Uefa that as they have been financially compliant over the past year, they deserve to be free of restrictions moving forward. They have successfully argued their case with UEFA before. Last summer they persuaded the governing body to allow them to bypass the normal quota of eight homegrown players as their Champions League squad had been reduced. Eliaquim Mangala joined the champions from Porto for £32m last summer . The reigning Premier League champions have only paid money for Fernando, Willie Caballero, Eliaquim Mangala and Wilfried Bony in the last two transfer windows and that was part-paid by the sales of Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell. Pellegrini admitted they weren’t in a position to compete with neighbours United for established world stars like Angel di Maria because of the FFP penalties. It has cost City on the pitch. Even if they win their remaining eight Premier League fixtures their points tally will be lower than last season and they crashed out once again at the last-16 stage of the Champions League. Pellegrini and director of football Txiki Begiristain both accept the squad needs replenishing and they want to be in the market for the top available players. Manchester City have been heavily linked with a move for former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne . The club also want to be involved in any race for Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling . They have been strongly linked with former Chelsea winger Kevin de Bruyne who has been one of the best players in the Bundesliga with Wolfsburg. And if Liverpool do allow Sterling to leave, City want to be involved in the chase for one of England’s most outstanding talents to help fit in with quotas for homegrown players. ‘If you are the manager or a player of a big tem, you are always open to criticism because everyone expects a high level of performance,’ he said. ‘The major issue with our team always seems to be the money but this season I think we were the team that spent less than any other team. That is the weird thing. ‘For this club trying to be a big team in so few years, maybe we are paying the cost for that.’ Since the transfer penalties were introduced, City have spent £91million on players in the last two windows (Net spend £68million). That compares to Manchester United £145.5million, Liverpool £113million, Arsenal £92.5million and Chelsea £82.6million. Over the same time period Barcelona spent £118.3million on players and Real Madrid £81.2million though they also broke the world transfer record for Gareth Bale the previous summer.","Manchester City have been restricted to a net transfer spend of £49m .

"Brittany Lincicome beat Stacy Lewis in a play-off to claim her second ANA Inspiration crown after a dramatic end to the LPGA's opening major of the year in California. Lincicome looked set to finish in the chasing pack until she carded a brilliant eagle on the par-five 18th to record a closing 69 and move level with fellow American Lewis on nine under par. Former champion Lewis (70) could still have claimed the win herself when, playing in the final group, she had a chance to birdie the last but her effort from 10 feet sneaked past on the low side, sending the two friends into a play-off at Mission Hills Country Club.

It also saw the 29-year-old take a jump into Poppie's Pond for the second time having also won this tournament in 2009. On that occasion Lincicome also eagled the final hole, and she admits it was 'surreal' to repeat the feat this time. 'I mean, to make eagle on any hole is pretty incredible, and then to do it on Sunday at a major, at this major where I did it in 2009,' Lincicome, whose last tournament victory came in 2011, said on www.lpga.com.

So like I said earlier, today was my day. Somebody was looking out for me today.' Lewis, whose bogey on the third sudden-death play-off hole allowed Lincicome to clinch the title, has now finished runner-up on five occasions since winning the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship last June. She has also had five more top-10 finishes in that time and the 30-year-old - who won the ANA Inspiration in 2011 - admits the only thing she can do is to try to look forward. 'I guess the more times you do it, the easier it gets,' said Lewis. 'I don't know. That's all you can do. You can't sit and dwell on it. You just have to go out the next week and try to win. I'm doing a lot of really good things, so I just have to keep going forward.' This was Lincicombe's first LPGA tour victory since 2011 .

"Derby County want Burnley manager Sean Dyche to replace Steve McClaren this summer, regardless of which division they are in. Play-off chasing Derby are planning for life without former England boss McClaren, who has been linked to jobs with Newcastle and Sunderland, and will make a concerted effort to get Dyche, who has impressed in the Premier League this season. Burnley host Tottenham on Sunday still fighting for top-flight survival, despite being written off as relegation certainties before the season began. Derby want Sean Dyche to replace Steve McClaren should the former England boss leave this summer . Dyche, 43, has won admirers for his plain speaking and organising a competitive team on a restricted budget. Derby, however, believe he will be tempted by a move to a bigger club — their average home gate of 29,000 is 10,000 more than Burnley get at Turf Moor. Derby occupy the final play-off place in the Championship, although Friday’s 2-2 draw against Watford was their seventh game in a row without a win. Derby boss McClaren has been linked with a move to Newcastle at the end of the season . It is almost certain, however, that McClaren and the club will part ways at the end of the season, whether they win promotion or not. McClaren was heavily backed to replace Alan Pardew at Newcastle earlier this season and insiders at Derby were unhappy at the way the story was highlighted in the public domain. Derby have been impressed with Dyche's work in the Premier League with Burnley this season . Since then, Derby’s form has gone off the boil and McClaren admitted after their last game that they could no longer go up automatically.

"Darren Bent could still return to Aston Villa in the summer even after his contract is allowed to run down at the club which cast him aside, but his focus for now is helping Derby get promoted. Bent was out of favour with sacked manager Paul Lambert and Rams boss Steve McClaren took the chance to add the experienced striker to his line-up on loan until the end of the campaign. But with Tim Sherwood now in charge at Villa Park the 31-year-old is keeping his options open. Darren Bent has scored nine goals in 13 games for Derby since going on loan from Aston Villa in January . Bent scores Derby 's form has been impressive for Derby since joining the Championship promotion hopefuls . 'I wouldn't rule anything out,' he told TalkSport. 'I will have to wait until the end of the season to make that decision. 'It will be nice to have the option. But I don't want to look too far ahead because I'm enjoying playing for Derby County and I don't want to take my eye off the ball.' Sherwood's side take on QPR on Tuesday night in a crucial relegation clash - a loss could see Villa fall below the line and Chris Ramsey's men enjoy a sniff of safety. Bent has nine goals in 13 appearances for the Rams and is focussed on their push for the Premier League . Bent's form has no doubt caught the attention with new Villa boss Tim Sherwood while at the Rams . While on the books at Villa, the end of the campaign for Bent - whether it be at the regular season's end or with a playoff triumph with the Rams - will also see him become a free agent. And with nine goals in 13 games since arriving at Derby in January, after stays at Fulham and Brighton, he may have some bargaining power. Bent has previously praised Sherwood, who he knows from his time at Tottenham, as an 'unbelievable motivator', saying Villa is 'the perfect job for him.’ He previously told the Telegraph that ‘There have been conversations' with his parent club. Sherwood has also bemoaned the absence of Bent as his side struggles for goals. 'I’d like to have him here now. You can’t have enough goalscorers in your building,’ he said.","Darren Bent said he'll wait until the season's end to decide on his future .

"It really is tough to think of a previous Premier League game of such importance being undercut by this depth of friendship between dugouts. Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey know each other inside out. They also know how their careers could be shaped by 90 minutes of football at Villa Park. From living 10 minutes apart in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, the pair will be 10 metres away from each other on a touchline in Birmingham, relishing the pressure. The careers of Tim Sherwood (above) and Chris Ramsey (below) could be shaped by 90 minutes on Tuesday . Ramsey's QPR go to the home of Sherwood's Villa for a match that could see them out of the bottom three . A match of this magnitude is what these two English coaches craved during years working together at Tottenham Hotspur, probably believing they would be united in battle. A quirky sequence of events has pitted them on opposite sides instead. Sherwood came close to the QPR job when Harry Redknapp resigned, but Paul Lambert was sacked in the same period and Aston Villa placed the call. Ramsey looked the unlikely choice at Loftus Road but guided QPR to their first away Premier League victory this season at Sunderland, earning the reins until the summer. A second win on the road at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday means QPR can go above Villa with three points on Tuesday night, plunging Sherwood’s team into the relegation zone. The reverse result would take Villa to the precipice of safety, leaving QPR with a fainter glimmer of hope. QPR come into the match with confidence after a convincing 4-1 victory over Villa's neighbours West Brom . Christian Benteke celebrates his goal in Villa's 3-1 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday . It is a sliding doors match, the kind to be looked back upon in months to come as the moment futures were directed, both for clubs and managers. Lose and suffer relegation? Sherwood’s position would come under considerable question, his trajectory as the bright thing of English coaching skewered. Ramsey would likely be shuffled back to a role behind the curtain. Win and survive? Reputation enhanced, the opportunity to lay foundations would be presented. Either way, this pair will share pints again, unpicking the evening when their top-flight statuses came under enormous scrutiny. Neither Sherwood nor Ramsey has been trying to underplay this match, even if one offered a little more bombast than the other. ‘I think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club,’ said Sherwood. ‘If I could hype up the pressure even more I would.’ ‘A win would be a fantastic boost for us because it would see us above the line,’ said Ramsey. ‘It would give the fans a lot of hope that we have a chance of staying up.’ Neighbours within 10 minutes and friends, Ramsey (centre) and Sherwood (right) know each other inside out . The pair worked together at Spurs with Les Ferdinand (second right), now QPR's director of football . Under the floodlights, this promises to be a thrilling night of action. Villa Park has already enjoyed that with back-to-back matches in darkness against West Brom. The second victory, in the FA Cup, sparked a pitch invasion. The atmosphere against QPR will be tense and frenetic again. Sherwood will live every moment on the sidelines, Ramsey will be more considered. There are likely to be some telling looks either direction. Both would be inclined to work with each other again. ‘He’s a good pal of mine and a very loyal friend, but it’s been put to one side,’ insisted Sherwood. ‘Considering we worked together for four-five years before, there is going to be some sort of strange feeling,’ said Ramsey. Once the whistle blows it is down to the players, of course. QPR’s will bounce into action off the back of one of their finest performances this season. Villa underwhelmed in defeat at Old Trafford. The Hyatt hotel just off Broad Street brought comfort for Ramsey’s squad during their trip to the Second City three days ago, but Eduardo Vargas, scorer of two in two, will be missing through injury this time. Bobby Zamora, who claimed a wonderful strike at the Hawthorns, has been wrapped in cotton wool over the weekend. QPR will be without Eduardo Vargas, who scored his second in two games against West Brom . Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair are out for Villa, Tom Cleverley, Aly Cissokho and Kieran Richardson major doubts. Sherwood wants attacking football with a gritty underbelly, Ramsey is likely to map out a plan to threaten on the break. Twice Villa have been beaten late at home under Sherwood, as Ramsey will be aware. Quality may suffer in the circumstances, but excitement should still course through the encounter. High drama awaits. Christian Benteke . Struggled on return form Achilles injury and looked disinterested at times under Lambert, seems to have found his mojo for Sherwood as four goals in four games testifies. Should strike terror into QPR at his best. Fabian Delph . The beating heart of Aston Villa, a demanding, driving bundle of energy in midfield to whom others turn. Scored the breakthrough goal in the Cup tie against West Brom and needs a similar impact here. Fabian Delph is the beating heart of Villa . Ciaran Clark . The 25-year-old has grown in stature this season for Villa, a vocal presence at the back and thoroughly committed. He will be the defender to put in a tackle of substance to get the fans cheering. Charlie Austin . Has now scored 16 Premier League goals this season, a remarkable tally in his debut campaign. Will look to get on the end of any opportunities in the area and has movement to trouble. Joey Barton . Was at his snarling best against West Brom, tackling and passing to dominate midfield. Picked up his eighth booking in ten games but is available against Villa. Much depends on how much he imposes himself. Joey Barton's midfield menace is key for QPR . Bobby Zamora .

"Jordan Henderson is not ready to give up on Liverpool's Champions League hopes despite an eight-point gap to Manchester United in fourth place. The 24-year-old scored a penalty at the Emirates on Saturday, but it was not enough as Liverpool fell to a 4-1 thrashing at the hands of Arsenal to leave their top-four hopes in tatters. That result followed a devastating 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United last time out and Brendan Rodgers' side have fallen from two points off Champions League qualification to eight behind. Jordan Henderson urged Liverpool not to give up on their hopes of finishing in the top four . Henderson is targeting seven wins out of seven in the league and an immediate response at Blackburn . But Henderson urged his team not to give up on the top-four race with seven games to play, and to bounce back immediately on Wednesday night when they take on Blackburn in an FA Cup quarter-final replay. He told Liverpool's official website: 'We knew it was going to be difficult [to finish in the top four], even before Saturday, but it makes it even more difficult. 'That doesn't mean we'll just give up. We've got seven games left now and we need to try to win every one. If we do that, then you never know. 'Blackburn is another big game for us straight away. We've got to recover well, learn from this one and move on and try to get a big win on Wednesday.'","Jordan Henderson says his team will not give up hope of top-four finish .

"Tim Sherwood has urged Aston Villa to man up as he labelled their clash with relegation rivals QPR the club's 'biggest game' for years. They host Rangers on Tuesday with Sherwood admitting he does not have the players to grind out results. Victory would move Villa five points clear of the Barclays Premier League drop zone but they will return to the bottom three if QPR, three points behind with a better goal difference, win. And Sherwood underlined the magnitude of the game ahead of the showdown. Tim Sherwood (from left to right), Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey during their time at White Hart Lane . Sherwood (right) sits on the bench with Tottenham Hotspur staff Ferdinand (centre) and Ramsey (left) Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor celebrates his goal by saluting Sherwood (right) and Ramsey (centre) 'I think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club,' he said, with Villa in 17th. 'This is without doubt the biggest game of the season for Villa and possibly one of the biggest in a number of years. 'This is the biggest (of my managerial career).' But the boss believes he must instil a different mentality into his players as he tries to keep them in the top flight. 'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results. It's not what we're cut out to do. 'I haven't identified many players who can't cope with the pressure, but you don't know until they get out there.' Sherwood is without Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair while Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho are doubts. Sherwood faces his friend and former Tottenham assistant, QPR boss Chris Ramsey, for the first time since they both left Spurs last summer. Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham and remain close ahead of their showdown . The bond between the two remains strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls for now . Sherwood hinted that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road ends, then he would ask to bring him to Villa Park . Ramsey has admitted his job at Rangers could be under threat if they get relegated and, while he admitted Ramsey may prefer to be a manager, Sherwood left the door open for a reunion at Villa. He added: 'If there was ever an opportunity for me to work with him again I would do that. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here. 'Listen, I know I am biased - he has been good for me and I have been good for him. But he is up there with the very best coaches I have ever seen.'

"Clint Hill reckons the pressure is on QPR's relegation rivals and insists Rangers can survive if they keep their cool. Chris Ramsey's side are still in the relegation zone but the defender believes other teams will be worried about them. Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal in Tuesday's 3-3 draw at Aston Villa, a result which denied QPR the chance to climb out of the bottom three.

They are third bottom, two points from safety, after Christian Benteke's hat-trick rescued Villa but, following Saturday's 4-1 win at West Brom and a point on Tuesday, Hill is confident about their survival chances. 'We have dragged teams in to it now, Villa probably thought they could win the game and pretty much put themselves safe,' he said, ahead of Sunday's visit of Chelsea. 'But we've brought another team into it and the pressure goes onto the next game. It's about the team and players who hold their head and keep calm who will prevail and stay in this league. 'The positive is we have four points from difficult travels and we're right in the battle now so we're looking forward to the next game.'

'To go in 2-1 behind we could have kept our heads down and sunk, but we showed a lot of character and going 3-2 up you think you've got the precious three points in the bag but they scored a fantastic free kick in the end.'

But Sherwood dismissed any added pressure after failing to beat Rangers and insisted he is not giving much thought to his Spurs comeback. He said: 'There's always pressure on all the games you're going to play and who's to say we can't go to into those games and win? 'I don't think we're cut out to dig out results, we can't do what QPR did. We're going to play on the front foot.

"Burnley manager Sean Dyche has dismissed speculation linking him with Derby.

Dyche remains a big fan of the Gunners boss and cannot comprehend why there were calls for the three-time Premier League winner to be sacked. 'They're a fine side, who keep progressing despite what people say,' said Dyche, who took Burnley up last year after finishing second in the Sky Bet Championship. The Burnley boss cannot believe that some Gunners fans were calling for Arsene Wenger to be sacked . 'Arsene seems to get questioned, I don't know why, I think the job he's done is terrific. 'Of course, I'm aware fans would like to have won more trophies in recent years but, as a young manager aspiring to progress in the game, I look at people like him thinking 'you haven't done badly if you have a career like his'.'

"Friends and neighbours. For the next 48 hours, however, the pint will have to stay behind the bar as Chris Ramsey and Tim Sherwood go toe to toe in the scrap for survival. As far as QPR manager Ramsey is concerned, Sherwood’s Aston Villa are in no danger of tumbling out of the Barclays Premier League, despite their lowly position. The verdict is delivered on the evidence that Ramsey has gathered in four years of working alongside Sherwood at Tottenham. Chris Ramsey believes his friend and neighbour Tim Sherwood will keep Aston Villa in the Premier League . But the QPR boss will be pulling no punches when he clashes with his former Tottenham colleague on Tuesday . QPR scored four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since March 1994 v Norwich (4-3). ‘Without a shadow of a doubt I think he will keep them up,’ said Ramsey. ‘He has a good squad, players who have the wow factor and he knows how to manipulate those particular players. 'If I was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do, I would be putting a bet on him keeping them up.’ Ramsey will be doing his utmost to extend Villa’s top-flight uncertainty on Tuesday night and has reason for optimism given Rangers’ stunning victory at West Bromwich Albion. Ramsey says if he 'was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do,' he would bet on Villa staying up . QPR celebrate the second of their four goals against West Brom from Charle Austin (right) A second win in the Birmingham area in four days would send QPR above Villa on goal difference. Sherwood and Ramsey, a duo operating as boss and assistant last season at Spurs, will share words in advance. ‘Me, him and Les (Ferdinand) live probably 10 minutes from each other so sometimes there is a pint to be had. I’m sure we’ll speak before the game,’ added Ramsey. ‘We worked together at Tottenham for four years in various jobs,’ said Ramsey. ‘It’s great you can have two coaches who’ve gone through the system and are coaching in the Premier League. The game has to look at it from an English point of view. ‘If things hadn’t gone our way against West Brom then the mountain looks a little bit bigger. The game will be very important for both teams.’ Ramsey and Sherwood were in the trenches together at Spurs and live within 10 minutes of each other . The perspective for Ramsey’s team is more positive after putting four past a West Brom side who for the first half looked to have beach on the brain already. Joey Barton scored in added time at the Hawthorns to underline the emphatic victory, having six minutes earlier received a forearm in the face from Youssouf Mulumbu that saw the Albion midfielder sent off. That ended any chance of a comeback for the hosts, who trailed 3-0 at the break but pulled one back through Victor Anichebe. First half goals from Eduardo Vargas, Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora, who scored a wonderful lob with the outside of his left boot, did the damage. Eduardo Vargas celebrates the opener for QPR in the remarkable 4-1 win over West Brom on Saturday . Bobby Zamora (left) scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob to give his side a 3-0 half-time lead . Austin’s strike was his 16th in the Premier League this season and Barton suggested he would have an England cap by now were he in a more fashionable side. ‘It helps if you play for certain clubs to play for England,’ said the QPR midfielder. ‘Certain people who haven’t done as well as Charlie, who has scored so many goals in a struggling side, seem to be shoo-ins in the England side.’ QPR captain Joey Barton celebrates his goal, his team's fourth, late in the game at The Hawthorns .","Chris Ramsey believes Tim Sherwood will keep Aston Villa from relegation .

"Tony Fernandes spoke of his despair after his Queens Park Rangers team twice threw away a lead against Aston Villa, with the Rangers chairman watching the scenes at Villa Park from afar on his iPhone. Christian Benteke's hat-trick earned a draw for Villa, with his last goal coming just seven minutes before full-time, and within five minutes of what had looked like a winner from Charlie Austin. Matt Phillips had earlier given QPR the lead in the first half but taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point at Villa Park. Tony Fernandes spoke of his despair after his Queens Park Rangers team twice threw away a lead . Fernandes, Rangers chairman, was watching the 3-3 draw at Villa Park from his iPhone away from the game . Taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point . And Fernandes, currently in Malaysia, spoke of his experience of a variety of emotions while watching the game from the other side of the world. 'It's a strange thing thus QPR love,' he tweeted. 'I went to bed at 1 in the morning. I got up exactly at 2.45 am. No alarm. My heart knew it's QPR time. 'I watched the game on my iPhone all kinds of emotions. Despair, disappointment, joy, but most important pride. 4 points from two away games.' Fernandes revealed that Richard Dunne and Leroy Fer could return for Sunday's visit of Chelsea and that Yun Suk-young would also return after that game. The character of QPR's Clint Hill and Chris Ramsey were praised by their club's chairman on Twitter . Charlie Austin looked like he might have scored a late winner for QPR but Christian Benteke equalised . Clint Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal for Rangers' second, and Fernandes was delighted with the display of the veteran centre back, even if he did fail to get to grips with the prolific Benteke. He also reserved praise for manager Chris Ramsey . 'Clint hill typified our fighting spirit,' he posted. 'As I've always said players playing for the badge and Chris Ramsey what a pro.' Finally, Fernandes posted some cryptic tweets as to his own future at the club, perhaps hinting that he would be leaving. Hill had equalised in the second half after hosts Villa led 2-1 at the break courtesy of Benteke's two goals . Matt Phillips opened the scoring for Rangers but they found themselves pegged back by brilliant Benteke . Fernandes is also Global CEO of AirAsia, the airline that saw flight QZ8501 go missing late last year. 'It's been a tough three months since December 28th. Abuse, tragedy, close friends gone but I never stopped believing in all that we do,' Fernandes said. 'The decision on my future has been made. 6 games 18 points. Never stop believing rangers fans. Les also a hero. Never stop believing.' QPR stay inside the relegation zone but moved up to 18th place with the draw. They face Chelsea at Loftus Road on Sunday in what is sure to be another occasion to play on supporters', and the owners', emotions.","Queens Park Rangers twice threw away a lead in clash with Aston Villa .

"Wallace, the Chelsea defender on-loan at Vitesse Arnhem, has been released without charge after being questioned by police on ‘suspicion of a sexual offence’. The 20-year-old, who has been loaned out to Fluminense and Inter Milan since he signed for Chelsea in January 2013, was with Vitesse’s squad for their trip to Excelsior and fined by the Dutch club. ‘Wallace won't be in the selection for the match against Excelsior,’ a statement from Vitesse read. Wallace is pictured in action for Chelsea during their pre-season tour of Indonesia back in July 2013 . ‘The Brazilian defender was arrested last night in the centre of Arnhem on suspicion of an offence. ‘Based on the fact that he is to refrain from going out in the 48 hours before a match, Vitesse immediately decided Wallace will be out of the team and will receive a maximum fine. ‘Vitesse has no further announcements.’ While the Dutch club refused to comment on the nature of the offence which led to the arrest, a police spokesman is quoted by local media as saying it was 'sexual’. The 20-year-old right back is pictured playing for Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem in February of this year . ‘We still don't know what exactly happened,’ police spokesman Paul Koetsier told RTL. ‘That must be found out during the investigation. ‘We can't make it more concrete than a suspicion of a sexual offence. Maybe there will me more information later today.’ Wallace is on a season-long loan at Vitesse. The Dutch outfit enjoy a close relationship with the Blues and the club’s owner Alexander Chigrinsky is an associate of Roman Abramovich. Wallace, a Brazilian Under-20 international, made his debut for Jose Mourinho’s side during their summer tour of Asia in 2013 before his season on loan at Inter. He made only three appearances for the Serie A club before being sent to Vitesse.

"The top of the Championship with five games to go . After another barmy day in the Championship we are still no closer to finding out which three clubs will be promoted to the Premier League. Eight sides still have a chance of claiming one of the two automatic promotion places, even with just five games left to play of the regular season. And then there are the play-offs – notoriously hard to call but surely even more so this season given the fine margins that separate this year's promotion-chasing crop. Regardless of who goes up though, there have been some stellar individual performances this season that will no doubt have attracted top flight attention. Here are eight players - one each from Bournemouth, Norwich, Watford, Middlesbrough, Derby, Wolves, Brentford and Ipswich - that could well be playing in the top flight next season regardless of whether their club goes up or not. Troy Deeney scores as Watford beat Middlesbrough on Monday in a crucial clash in the Championship . Matt Ritchie . Club: Bournemouth. Position: Winger. Age: 25. Games: 41. Goals: 11. Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right flank and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side. A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. It was the Scotland international's £400,000 move to Bournemouth from Swindon in January 2013 that triggered Paolo di Canio's dramatic resignation at the County Ground. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday . Bradley Johnson . Club: Norwich. Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. Games: 38. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League - where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this - come August. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season . Troy Deeney . Club: Watford. Position: Striker. Age: 26. Games: 37. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons . Patrick Bamford . Club: Middlesbrough. Position: Forward. Age: 21. Games: 34. Goals: 15. Having spent spells on loan from Chelsea at MK Dons, Derby and Boro in League One and now the Championship, the next step in Bamford's progression will be in the Premier League next season. If Boro go up, Jose Mourinho will surely be happy for the England Under 21 international to continue under the tutelage of his former No 2 and Boro boss Aitor Karanka. If not, there will be plenty of other suitors for the tall, versatile forward. Patrick Bamford (centre) moved to the Riverside on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea last summer . Will Hughes . Club: Derby. Position: Midfielder. Age: 19. Games: 39. Goals: 2. Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played over 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager . Bakary Sako . Club: Wolves. Position: Winger. Age: 26. Games: 36. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for £4million from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself  in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up . Alex Pritchard . Club: Brentford. Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 21. Games: 41. Goals: 9. Another side bidding for back-to-back promotions are Brentford and Tottenham loanee Pritchard has been key in their surprise success story. Short, agile, quick and versatile, Pritchard is in the Spanish mould of midfielder we have been craving for so long in this country. Given Mauricio Pochettino's track record of developing youth it wouldn't be a surprise to see him in Spurs' squad next season though they may opt to loan him out  to a smaller Premier League club. Alex Pritchard takes on Liverpool's Emre Can during an Under 21 international last month . Tyrone Mings . Club: Ipswich. Position: Left back. Age: 22. Games: 35. Goals: 1. Linked with Arsenal and Crystal Palace in January, Mings' form has tailed off of late with Ipswich's but he has all the attributes required to succeed at the highest level. Tall for a full back at 6ft 5in Mings is nonetheless quick and full of attacking intent. He was let go by both Southampton and Bristol Rovers as a teen before arriving at Ipswich in 2012 via non-league. Giant Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings attracted interest from Premier League clubs in January . We’ve also come up with a composite XI made up by the best players from the eight clubs.

"Melissa Wilson and her team-mates are on the brink of making history. On Saturday, at the 161st Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race, the women’s crews will battle the same Thames course as the men, who will follow an hour later. After decades of campaigning and 88 years since the first women to race were jeered by male spectators, they get equal billing. And for Wilson’s grandfather, 85-year-old Richard Cowell, from East Kilbride, it will be a momentous day. He is not up to the journey to watch his granddaughter compete for Cambridge but will still see the race, which will be televised for the first time. Wilson, 21, said: ‘I remember when I was 14 watching with my dad and my brother and saying “Are there going to be women on?” They laughed — not in a malicious way — and said: “There aren’t any women, you could cox I guess”. So the fact that 10 years on there is a women’s race on the Tideway and I’m in it is pretty remarkable. It’s so wonderful that my grandfather will be able to watch it, too.’ Melissa Wilson (left) and Caroline Reid of Cambridge Women's boat crew at Thames Rowing Club in London . Clare Balding gave up her regular stint on Channel 4’s Grand National coverage to present the event because she wants to send a message about the importance of women’s sport. ‘It was a big decision to make,’ said Balding. ‘But there will never be another first women’s Boat Race on the Tideway.’ Her statement was welcomed by Caroline Reid, the Cambridge president. ‘It brings the attention of another audience, people who follow Clare,’ said Reid, 24. ‘Maybe people who support the Grand National disagree but they will at least be aware it’s happening and that is a good thing.’ Wilson, a third year English literature student and Reid, in her fifth year of veterinary medicine, rise at 5.30am each day for training, gym work and lectures, then it’s back out on the river in the afternoon. Cambridge Women's Boat Crew including Wilson (front) rowing the Thames . Reid, Claire Watkins and Wilson prepare ahead of the Boat Race next Saturday . Until this year, the women’s race was held a week before the men’s at Henley. The course was 1.2 miles compared with this year’s 4.22 mile battle from Putney to Mortlake. ‘At Henley it’s straight, so conditions are largely the same the whole way down,’ said Reid. ‘Tideway conditions change because the river bends. There’s a different mental and tactical side, which is exciting.’ But Reid refuses to be seen as a pioneer. ‘The first women’s race was in 1927 and there were a lot of people against it, talking about whether women should be rowing at all and what they should be wearing, so they were the pioneers. We’re just carrying on in their footsteps,’ she said.","After decades of campaign the women's crews are to make history .

"Chelsea defender Gary Cahill has backed captain John Terry to shrug off a hostile reception when they head to Loftus Road to face QPR on Sunday. It was on the same ground in 2011 that Terry was caught up in a race controversy with ex-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, later cleared in court of racially abusing the player but banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association for 'using abusive language related to colour'. Anton may no longer be at Loftus Road, but brother Rio could feature under Chris Ramsey. Terry's former central defensive partner with England has called him the 'biggest idiot' in the past for the way he handled the racism row. John Terry was caught up in a race controversy with then-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in 2011 . Terry was cleared in court of racially abusing Ferdinand but was banned and fined by the FA . The Football Association fined Terry, pictured at Westminster Magistrates Court in 2012, £220,000 for 'using abusive language related to colour' 'He has been through a lot football-wise in his career,' Cahill said. 'He has been through so many good times, winning trophies and whatnot, and bad times. So in terms of personality he is obviously thick-skinned and that's why I say it won't affect him, and it won't affect us.' Terry was stripped of the England captaincy amid the fall-out, and subsequently announced his retirement from international football. On Sunday, he may come up against Anton Ferdinand's brother Rio, who branded him an 'idiot' over the affair, and the QPR fans can be expected to remind him of what happened. Anton Ferdinand avoids shaking hands with Terry during the Premier League game at Loftus Road in 2012 . But Cahill added: 'It's a local derby so the atmosphere will be intense and it will be another huge game to try to win. 'I think he has been there already. It's not as if it's the first time he has been back, he has played there.' Chelsea go into the weekend seven points clear of Arsenal having played a game less, but Cahill said there was no sense of easing up, with the Gunners still to come on the fixture list. 'There is still that element of pressure to finish the job,' he said. 'We've worked so hard this season to be where we are and to put ourselves in the position we are in, so we want to go all the way and finish it.'

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution come to the assistance of the Oxford University Women's team . The Oxford crew were training on the Thames for the Boat Race which  takes place on Saturday, April 11 . The RNLI revealed the conditions were caused by strong wind against the tide creating three successive waves that poured over the boat's riggers, 'creating an influx of water that could not be managed by the craft's bilge pump'. In a statement RNLI helmsman Ian Owen said: 'While we have rescued quite a number of rowers over the years, this is the first time I've been involved in helping such a prestigious team. 'The weather can be unpredictable on the Thames, and the Oxford University team dealt with the situation as safely and calmly as possible. We wish them all the best for their upcoming race.'

"Wasps will appeal against the three-week ban issued to Nathan Hughes, but their protest will not enable the back row to play in Sunday's Champions Cup quarter-final against Toulon. The club have said in a statement they will appeal on the grounds the incident that left Northampton wing George North unconscious and resulted in a red card for Hughes was an accident and no foul play had occurred. With the hearing scheduled to be held next Friday, it means Hughes can not be reprieved in time to face the reigning European champions in Toulon this weekend. Wasps are set to appeal the three-match ban handed to No 8 Nathan Hughes for knocking out George North . North was out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . Hughes' knee collided with North's head as he crossed the line to score a try for Northampton . Hughes was given the suspension - to include three meaningful fixtures - after being found guilty of striking North in the 52-30 Aviva Premiership defeat at Franklin's Gardens on March 27. Commenting on the judgement made on Tuesday night, disciplinary officer Sir James Dingemans said: 'This was a three week ban on the basis that no intention was found. 'However, there was recklessness meaning that, notwithstanding the harm, it was a low entry point of four weeks with mitigation of one week to reflect his previous clean playing record.' Wales winger North suffered a third confirmed concussion in just four months against Wasps last Friday .","Wasps No 8 Nathan Hughes was given a three-match ban for a late challenge on George North which left the Northampton winger concussed .

"Jose Mourinho will play Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas against Queens Park Rangers, despite the threat of the duo missing the crunch clashes against Arsenal and Manchester United. The pair are both just one booking away from suspension, a dangerous situation given the top of the table clash against the Gunners next weekend and trip to Old Trafford on April 17. But Mourinho insists his midfield twosome will play at Loftus Road on Sunday. Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas will start against QPR despite being one booking away from a two-game ban . Nemanja Matic would miss games against Arsenal and Manchester United if he is shown a yellow card . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is unwilling to look beyond Sunday's London derby at Loftus Road . Asked if the pair would start  in his pre-match press conference, Mourinho said: 'Yeah. Always the same. We don't want bookings. We try not to get yellow cards. 'In the last match our opponent had 22 fouls and we had five. The way we play it's not easy for our players to be booked. 'The game is a three points game. We need points, we need victories. It doesn't make sense to think about some games (Arsenal and Manchester United) and not about others. 'We have to win every game. We have to win the next game. We don't think about the points we have or the match we have in hand. 'They (QPR) need points in these remaining six games. It's a difficult game.' Mourinho has never taken a team to Loftus Road before but he expects the home fans to create a tough atmosphere for his players. Loic Remy is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring a vital goal against Stoke last weekend . Striker Diego Costa is the only player on Mourinho's injury list after coming off against Stoke last weekend . Asked whether he thought Sunday's game would be hostile, Mourinho said: 'That's what people tell me. We go to play, we go to win. People in the stands can play a role but they cannot score goals. 'I'm not worried. I'm focused on playing our game.' Mourinho would not be drawn on John Terry's return to Loftus Road after the former England captain was given a four-match ban and fined £220,000 for allegedly racially abusing Hoops defender Anton Ferdinand in 2011. Ferdinand's brother, Rio, is now part of Chris Ramsey's squad  but Mourinho does not believe the incident will affect his skipper. He said: 'I think it's just a football match. A very important game for both teams. We know they want to win and they know we want to win. It's not an easy match.'","Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic will miss games against Arsenal and Manchester United if they are booked against QPR .

"Leeds showed they are in good shape to cope with Kevin Sinfield's retirement as they claimed a 26-12 derby victory over Castleford in front of a sell-out crowd at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle. The First Utility Super League leaders were without their inspirational captain, who this week announced he is to switch codes at the end of 2015, for the third successive game on Good Friday, but they continue to thrive without him. The Rhinos had beaten Wigan and Catalans Dragons in Sinfield's absence and added Castleford to that list thanks to an excellent team performance, with young winger Ash Handley particularly impressive up against the formidable Justin Carney. Leeds Rhino's Adam Cuthbertson celebrates a try with Jamie Peacock (left) Ryan Hall was sent to the sin-bin for the first time in his career in a frenetic opening but Castleford failed to take advantage and it was the Rhinos who struck first as Joel Moon scored his first try of the season. Hall made amends by extending Leeds' lead and Stevie Ward's converted try cancelled out Michael Shenton's effort to give the Rhinos a 16-6 half-time lead. There were chances aplenty at the start of the second period but brilliant defence by both sides meant there was no further addition to the score until the 63rd minute, when Hall completed his double. Adam Cuthbertson then crossed for a try his performance deserved and despite Shenton's late second, Leeds extended their unbeaten run against the Tigers to six matches. Leeds Rhino's Joel Moon scores the first try for his side during their victory . Brian McDermott warned the Rhinos to be wary of a fast start by Castleford and although it was Leeds who came out of the blocks quickest, the Tigers were handed an early advantage when Hall was sent to the sin-bin for a professional foul. Leeds youth product Luke Gale failed to exploit the gap in the Rhinos' left side when his pass to James Clare from the resultant penalty floated forwards. Liam Sutcliffe was next to fluff his lines as he spilled the ball reaching for the tryline, but Leeds did not have to wait much longer for their first try of the afternoon. The Rhinos rolled downfield after a knock-on by Scott Moore, and Danny McGuire exchanged passes with Brad Singleton before putting Moon through a hole to score. Hall had returned to the field just in time to congratulate his team-mate and he was celebrating a try of his own soon after. Leeds Rhino's Ryan Hall goes over the line for their third try of the clash . McGuire was hauled down just short of the line after Moon's break but Cuthbertson kept his cool on the next play to give Hall an easy finish in the corner. Sutcliffe landed the touchline conversion to give Leeds a 10-0 lead. The Rhinos went in search of a crucial third try - with Brett Delaney just held up over the line - but their lead was cut to four points when Shenton reacted quickest to Liam Finn's dab through and Gale kicked a goal from out wide. The momentum was suddenly with Castleford as they probed for another try to level up the contest, but such was its nature that Leeds re-established their 10-point lead. Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield sat out during the week he announced he was switching codes . Kallum Watkins played a big part in taking the Rhinos close to the Tigers' line and Sutcliffe's neat reverse kick sat up nicely for Ward to get downward pressure on the ball. Good defence by Sutcliffe denied Shenton his second try at the start of the second half before Cuthbertson was held up over the line at the other end. The excitement continued as Carney picked up a loose Leeds pass well inside his own half and raced clear seemingly destined to score, only for McGuire to slow him down with an ankle tap before Handley hauled him down. Leeds Rhino's Zak Hardaker makes a run during the Super League match at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle . Carney then turned try-saver when he stopped Zak Hardaker finishing off a Rhinos break and Leeds were denied by more impressive Castleford defence as Singleton was held up. The visitors finally broke through for a fourth time when McGuire spotted his side had numbers on the left and found Moon, who gave Hall another simple task in the corner. Australian forward Cuthbertson continued his fine first season in England with a powerful finish, but the Tigers had the last word as Shenton exchanged passes with Carney to score.","Leeds Rhinos claim victory in front of sell-out crowd at Castleford .

"Northampton ruled George North out of their game against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday and sent him to see a neurosurgeon. The Wales and Lions wing has been removed from the firing line by his club ahead of the biggest game of their season to date following his third alarming head injury in the space of two months. The 22-year-old was knocked unconscious when struck by Wasps No 8 Nathan Hughes's knee as he was scoring a try at Franklin's Gardens last Friday night. Northampton have ruled out winger George North for the game against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday . North lies motionless on the Franklin's Gardens turf after being knocked out against Wasps . Having opted to act in the best interests of their marquee player — despite the importance of a Champions Cup quarter-final in France — the Saints have taken an encouraging step in response to fears about North's long-term health. Instead of merely abiding by the minimum, six-day return-to-play protocols, the Aviva Premiership champions have erred on the side of caution. 'In theory we could consider him,' said Jim Mallinder, Northampton's director of rugby. 'If it was his first one (head knock), then we would be considering him if he passed all the protocols and was available. Seeing as it's not his first, then it's the sensible thing to take specialist opinion. 'We won't play him at the weekend. Clearly he had a nasty knock. It was unfortunate. He did get knocked unconscious for a very short period of time. We'll listen to what the neurologist says. He's the expert. As always we'll listen to his advice.' In Tuesday's Sportsmail, former Scotland full back Rory Lamont — who has suffered the after-effects of concussion injuries — called for the Welsh icon (left) to be rested for six months, saying: 'It's a complete disgrace that it has got to this stage. George has been let down.' He was not the only voice raising the alarm, but the Saints are aggrieved that distant observers are weighing in with comments without being completely aware of the specifics. Mallinder called for a calm, measured assessment of the situation. 'There's been lots of opinion over the last few days in particular,' he said. 'We've got to be careful that we don't blow anything out of proportion. 'It's a tough game. George has said that himself. We're always going to have incidents, but player welfare will always come first.There's a balance to it. We've got to make sure we don't get hysterical about it, but we are sensible. Clearly there are players who, if they've had a knock, need time off to make sure that their bodies recover. A head injury is no different to any other type of injury. 'You can't just stop people playing rugby. People who play the game understand that there are inherent dangers. 'Players are now very well looked after and I think it's probably not at the senior level where you need to worry. It's probably a little bit lower down, maybe schoolboys and junior rugby, where players don't get as well looked after as ours.' Nathan Hughes arrives late as North touches down - moments later his leg connected with the wing's head . The Welshman receives medical treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher . In reference to last Friday night's incident, Mallinder stressed that North had considerable medical support, in contrast to how it used to be in rugby — when attitudes were very different. 'It's something now in the game which has improved,' he added. 'It's brilliant. Straight after the incident the players recognised it (the severity of the injury). 'We've got two doctors available, physios available — and they know exactly what to do. 'It's not right, but I remember playing 30 years ago and your touch judge was the man who looked after you and basically you got a sponge on your head and you were back out if you could walk. 'Clearly the game is much improved for what we've got now. I'm not concerned for him (North). We've got to look after him.' On Tuesday night, Hughes was banned until April 28 for his 'reckless' actions — colliding with North when the try scorer was on the ground, unable to protect his head. The sanction has divided opinion, with Wasps players incensed by what they regard as an unduly heavy-handed punishment for an offence which the disciplinary panel accepted was not malicious. Asked if he had any sympathy with Hughes, Mallinder initially refused to comment, but added: 'I said at the time I think it was a red-card offence. I still do. 'Therefore the disciplinary process has taken place and that's what he's got. Meanwhile, Wasps will make a statement over whether they will appeal Hughes' ban. After receiving the full written judgement explaining the decision, the club stated: 'We'll consider our options and make a decision.' North is congratulated by team-mates after scoring the first of his two tries against Wasps last Friday night .","Northampton have ruled out winger George North for the game against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday .

"Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 to make it back-to-back wins for the first time since last June. Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.","Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching display .

"George North has been ordered by a neurologist to take at least one month off after suffering his third concussion in four months playing for Northampton last week. The Wales and Lions wing will be reassessed at the end of April and could face an even longer spell on the sidelines if specialist consultants are not convinced that he is ready to return to action. Saints medics will monitor his progress throughout the stand-down period and - with the weight of impact required to induce concussion reducing the more times a player suffers head injuries – there have been growing concerns about the 22-year-old's welfare. George North suffered a third confirmed concussion in just four months against Wasps last Friday . Nathan Hughes' knee collided with North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . 'We have listened to the advice we sought and George will be taking some time away from the field,' said Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder. 'Throughout this process it is important that George's welfare comes first and that he is treated patiently and calmly, only returning to action when all of the medical team are happy for him to do so.' North was knocked out following a collision with the knee of Wasps back-row Nathan Hughes. The No 8 was been subsequently suspended for three weeks, however his club yesterday launched an appeal against ban on the grounds that it was an accident. North receives treatment for his head injury on the pitch and has now been ruled out for at least a month . Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks after knocking out North with his right leg .

"Jonathan Trott prepared for his first Test appearance since leaving the Ashes tour in turmoil 18 months ago with back-to-back failures in St Kitts. Trott, who looks sure to open with Alastair Cook in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday, fell for just two, top-edging an attempted pull against a St Kitts side bolstered by England bowlers Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood. It follows his third-ball duck at the hands of his England team-mate Jimmy Anderson but Trott at least made 72 on the first of what became four practice days instead of proper matches in St Kitts ahead of the main business next week. Jonathan Trott failed twice with the bat during England's warm-up for the first Test in Basseterre . Trott is dismissed by his England team-mate James Anderson in St Kitts . Trott’s only rival for the opener slot, Yorkshire’s Adam Lyth, was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off-stump for 23 but Alastair Cook and Ian Bell looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match. England gave what appeared to be a sneak preview of their side for the first Test as their low-key warm-up week meandered to a close. Their four days of cricket  have been desperately short of competitive edge and they at least ensured each of their likely team saw some batting action. Trott looks set to open the batting with Alastair Cook in Antigua in the first Test next week . England completed four days of low-key, uncompetitive warm-up action in Basseterre on Thursday . Alastair Cook . Jonathan Trott . Gary Ballance . Ian Bell . Joe Root . Ben Stokes . Jos Buttler . Chris Jordan . Stuart Broad . James Tredwell . Jimmy Anderson . The decision to linger in the middle after two rain delays in order to allow Chris Jordan and James Tredwell to face some admittedly low-quality bowling, suggested those two would claim the disputed places in the team. Barring a raging turner in Antigua next week there will be only one spinning place and Tredwell, already a likelier pick than Yorkshire's Adil Rashid, was sent in ahead of his counterpart for a late hit. His dismissal gave Rashid a chance of his own but Tredwell was given priority and can now start preparing for a second Test cap. Jordan, meanwhile, was afforded a decent stint at the crease in the final session, when England pressed for an extra half-hour's play following rain delays. That suggests he has done enough to remain ahead of Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett, who both bowled for the hosts without doing anything compelling to push their case. Captain Cook made 22 runs in the morning session before retiring on Thursday . Ian Bell looked in fluent touch as he was unbeaten on 43 when he retired . England will leave St Kitts and head to Antigua for the first Test against the West Indies on Monday . Those decisions aside the second in a pair of two-day fixtures has been little more than a glorified training drill, with Plunkett, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow dropped in to strengthen the flimsy local side, while Gary Ballance, Trott and Root featured for both teams at various points. Bell looked in best form, making a fluent 43 before retiring, while captain Cook also opted to end his own innings having ground out 22 runs in the morning session.","Jonathan Trott out cheaply twice in Basseterre .

"Ben Stokes starred with the ball on the first day of England's warm-up match in St Kitts, but it was the runs of Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott that pleased him most. England dominated against a modest St Kitts & Nevis XI, dismissing them for a paltry 59 inside 27 overs and then compiling 181 for one in reply. The quality of the home batsmen made the first innings seem like little more than a glorified net session, though Stokes still impressed with a lively spell that yielded three wickets for 10. Alastair Cook plays behind square on his way to an unbeaten 95 in the tour match against a St Kitts' XI . Cook and teammate Jonathan Trott talk in between overs during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI game . More important for England's Test prospects, though, was the stand of 158 between Cook (95 not out) and Trott (72). Both men needed the comfort of big runs, Cook having been axed from the one-day side on the eve of the World Cup and Trott on his first England appearance since November 2013 - a period that has seen him battle a case of situational anxiety. He now has the chance to nail down the role of Cook's opening partner and made a solid start in admittedly favourable circumstances. 'Trotty and Cooky gave them nothing and it will stand us in good stead for the Test matches,' said Stokes. Ben Stokes spoke strongly about his team-mates after the two batsmen looked assured at the crease . Stokes had earlier taken three for 10 in an impressive spell with the ball, as England dominated the day . 'The biggest thing for a batsman is time out in the middle. You can do all the training in the nets you want but nothing quite compares to a game and they both did that well today. Trotty has been great, it is almost like he hasn't left. To see him go out and score some runs, the way he has been known to for England over the last five years, was really good to see.' Stokes arguably went over the top in his assessment of Cook's knock, but with the captain having come under pressure for his lack of major scores, it could yet prove an important effort. Stokes described his captain Cook as one of the best players in the world after his return to form . 'It was fantastic for Cooky too,' said Stokes. 'He's been out of the game for a while so to come in and look like the one of the best batsmen in the world, like he once was, was great. The tempo he played at was fantastic and any bad ball he managed to put it away, which was good to see.' For his part, Stokes looks a certainty to return to the Test side in the Caribbean. Having announced himself as an all-rounder of unusual promise in the 2013-14 Ashes, he saw his glittering rise checked by struggles for form and fitness for long periods last year. He did not even make the cut for the World Cup but now has a chance to prove his credentials once again in the longer form. Trott plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI England tour match . 'It was nice to make an impact back in the first game, even if it was just a warm-up game in an England shirt,' he said. 'I still had the nerves there and it was pretty pleasing to do well. 'I'm still working very hard on getting back into the team, which is what I want to do. Hopefully that is just the start. 'I need performances to back that up. To keep my place I know I need to keep performing, which is something I haven't been consistent with since Australia so hopefully I get a chance in the Test matches here and I can build on that.'","Ben Stokes took three wickets for 10 runs as England bowled St Kitts & Nevis XI out for just 59 in tour match .

"Richie Benaud spent a lifetime in the sun and in his final years he ruefully admitted that he was paying the price for it with skin cancers on his forehead and the top of his head. The 84-year-old, who died on Friday, talked about his cancer and the treatment he was undergoing with typical candour. 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap,' Benaud told the Nine Network about growing up in Australia in the 1930s and 40s. 'I wish I had. You live and learn as you go along.' The cricket commentary box legend talked about the radiation treatment he was receiving for his skin cancer. Scroll down for video . Skin cancer: Richie Benaud, pictured at the SCG in January 2013, revealed late last year that he had skin cancer and was receiving radiation treatment, admitting that 'as a kid we never ever wore a cap' but using the opportunity to advise all Australians to cover their heads . Marvellous: Richie Benaud, pictured in 1961 in Britain when he was captaining the Test series, admitted last year that he had never worn head gear as a young player because he had been influence by legendary all rounder Keith Miller, saying 'when I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap ... that's because Keith Miller never wore a cap' Benaud, who hadn't returned to his commentary job for the Nine Network following a car accident in October 2013 in which he suffered serious injuries, had looked increasingly frail and had lost weight. But he had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne for 40 minutes every morning, in the hope that he could return to work. Benaud had been driving his beloved car - a 1963 Sunbeam Alpine - back from hitting practice golf balls at the Australian Golf Club in Sydney when he lost control and hit a parked car and then a small brick fence. He was hospitalised with shoulder, spinal and chest injuries and a broken sternum. He was subsequently diagnosed with skin cancer and began treatment last year, revealing that doctors were pleased with his progress. He told reporters last November he was 'coping with it very well'. The cricket legend said he believed the cancers were caused by playing cricket in the sun without a hat or sunscreen. Long history behind the microphone: Richie Benaud looks on during the fifth test match between England and Australia in August 1989, wearing one of his trademark light-coloured jackets which were his signature along with his unique commentary . Fan favourite: Richie Benaud was such a legend as a cricet commentator in his trademark cream jacket that he inspired a legion of fans dressed up in Australian cricket fans dressed up and wearing silver wigs and and carrying foam microphones at the Ashes Test at the SCG in January 2014 . The voice of Australian cricket: Richie Benaud, pictured at The Oval during the September 2005 Ashes Test, was one of Australian sport's great personalities and the boss of the commentary box at Test matches in Australia and Britain . Richie Benaud, pictured with Worcestor captain Don Kenyon before an Australia v Worcester match in England, captained Australia and played 63 Test matches in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, helping to restore the country's reputation as a cricketing nation . What a catch: Richie Benaud, pictured with his beloved wife, Daphne, at  Randwick racecourse in 2007, said that following a serious car crash and then treatment for skin cancer he and Daphne had been walking for '40 minutes a day' to ease him back to good health in the hope he could return to the commentary box . The former Australian test cricketer seized on the opportunity to encourage Australians to protect themselves from the sun. 'I recommend to everyone they wear protection on their heads,' he said. 'Eighty-four-year-olds don't seem to mend as well as they used to.' He said he was still recovering from the car accident injuries which included two fractured vertebrae. However, he expressed the belief he would make a return to cover the fourth Test against India at the SCG in Sydney, and had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne every morning in an effort to regain his health.

'Progress is slow,' he said. 'I've been doing a lot of walking. 'We are out every morning, doing 40-minute walks every morning and it's showing beneficial effects.' Without the information on skin cancer danger now available during his playing days, Benaud revealed he was influenced by the example of great all rounder Keith Miller. 'When I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap - not a flash one,' Benaud said. 'That's because Keith Miller never wore a cap. Arthur Morris did when he went out to bat. 'We follow various people and 'Nugget' Miller never wore anything on his head, so I didn't. 'I wish I had.'","Richie Benaud revealed late last year he was suffering from skin cancer .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has heaped praise upon Loic Remy after the striker scored his second consecutive winner in the 2-1 victory over Stoke on Saturday. Remy's goal meant Mourinho's side took another step towards securing the Premier League title with  three points, despite an injury to Diego Costa. Costa hobbled off 10 minutes after replacing Oscar at half-time, with another hamstring problem leaving him set for a spell on the sidelines.

'When Eden (Hazard) recovered the ball from a loose throw from Asmir Begovic, you could see immediately Remy sprinted to score what I call an easy goal, but I love strikers to score easy goals,' Mourinho said. 'The tap-in when the goalkeeper has an incomplete save, attacking the ball on a low cross, rebounds - I love the easy goals from a striker. Remy (centre) also netted Chelsea's winner against Hull before the international break . Mourinho said Remy has already made a crucial contribution to Chelsea despite not playing too often . 'Remy keeps himself in great condition, even without having played many minutes, to be ready for us. 'He's a great boy and his contribution is already crucial, with these two match-winners in the last two matches.'","Loic Remy hit the decisive goal as Chelsea beat Stoke 2-1 on Saturday .

"Louis Smith is man of many talents. A medal-winning Olympic gymnast of course...and even a Strictly Come Dancing champion. However, it appears the athlete, 25, is gaining expertise in an area previously dominated by queen of the 'Belfie', Kim Kardashian. Yes, Louis Smith, MBE, is now also very good at exciting his fans with selfies. Topless selfies, where we're treated to a view of his rippling muscles in full flexed action, to be more specific. If you've got it, flaunt it: Former Olympic gymnast, Louis Smith,  is constantly sharing images of his honed torso with an endless stream of topless selfies on Instagram . The Strictly Come Dancing star shot to fame after winning both a bronze and silver medal at the 2012 London Olympic Games . Mostly taken between the pine door of his stone wall bathroom and what can only be an impressively large mirror, Louis' selfies have become something of a phenomenon. So much so, that when interviewed by the Telegraph recently, primarily about his latest project to help communities learn how to dance, they felt compelled to ask him about it. 'I’m just sharing my physique,' the hunk of the gymnastics world said of his snaps. 'I’m just sharing my physique,' the hunk of the gymnastics world said of his snaps in an interview . Some of which, are far saucier than others. For example, there are pics taken in his bathroom where he's clearly wearing jeans, despite the lack of a shirt. Others, however, have ranged from a view of his very tight boxers, to a topless sunbathing selfie where nothing but a strategically placed cocktail glass covered up a full frontal view of his manhood.

Though the pair have been together for just four months, they've both been extremely open about their feelings for each other. 'Having someone to share things with was the one thing missing from my puzzle, so it’s lovely to be with Lucy,' the Strictly champ said.

There were fears the England defender may have fractured his right foot after taking a hefty blow from a collision with Kieran Trippier during the draw at Burnley on Sunday.

She has long dreamed of becoming an actress and wanted to pursue her career freely . ‘I think as you get older, you find out more and more about yourself and what you like and what you don’t like,’ she adds. The interview follows the release of a short film last month for the fashion house. It features Miss Bonas, 26, dancing round an old court house and English country garden in a £1,800 dress. Asked if it was ‘nice’ being single, she replied: ‘It is actually, it is, it is’ Miss Bonas dated Prince Harry for two years until last April when they broke up, reportedly over a disagreement about the costs of attending Harry’s friend Guy Pelly’s wedding in America. Since then, Miss Bonas, a trained dancer, has been focusing on her acting and modelling career. She has just finished playing Cecily in The Importance of Being Ernest at the London Oratory, the Catholic comprehensive which counts Nick Clegg’s son as a pupil. In an interview to promote her role as Mulberry’s new muse, trained dancer Miss Bonas - who also appeared on the front cover of Miss Vogue magazine for the April edition - said: ‘I’m a strong, independent woman' Mulberry has released a short film featuring Miss Bonas, 26, dancing round an old court house and English country garden in a £1,800 dress (pictured). Miss Bonas dated Prince Harry for two years until last April . The three-night production was put on by Band of Others, a London-based theatre group which is raising funds for the Action on Addiction charity, of which Harry’s sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, is patron. Indeed, Prince Harry even attended the opening night of his former girlfriend’s play, and was heard laughing loudly throughout. Last month, she also appeared on the front cover of Miss Vogue magazine, and later this year will make her film debut in Harvey Weinstein’s Tulip Fever, also starring Dame Judi Dench. ‘I hope the focus is becoming more about skills that I have,’ she said in the interview with the Sunday Time’s Style magazine. ‘It’s really important to me not just to be known as…’ she added, drifting off without finishing the sentence, presumably referring to being known as Prince Harry’s ex. She refused to discuss her relationship with the prince, only to comment on the media attention their romance prompted. ‘All that stuff is not real,’ she says. ‘It’s really important to remember that all it is is noise, noise that can be very loud at times.’ Miss Bonas is set to make her film debut in Harvey Weinstein’s Tulip Fever, also starring Dame Judi Dench .

She said she survived the attention, and speculation about their impending engagement, by being a homebody. ‘I’m not really one of those people who’s always out. I like being at home. I suppose that helps. I’ll go out with my friends or if there’s something really amazing I have been invited to, but I won’t do that all the time because that is not who I am.’ ‘But if I ever feel like “Oh, my life” or get upset by silly things like a photographer, or if someone has written something nasty that upsets me, I just think “worse things happen at sea”,’ she added, quoting her mother, Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon’s, favourite saying.

"Kevin Pietersen can resurrect his Test career and prove axed England boss Paul Downton was wrong to sack him last year, according to Chris Tremlett. Surrey paceman Tremlett believes England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Downton's departure on Wednesday night opens the door for controversial batsman Pietersen's return. South Africa-born Pietersen is gearing up for his first county championship action since June 2013 after agreeing a new deal with Surrey. Chris Tremlett has backed his Surrey team-mate Kevin Pietersen to make an international comeback . Tremlett and Pietersen were all smiles on Surrey's media day at The Oval ahead of the new season . The 34-year-old is determined to restart his Test career after he was sacked in February 2014, and Tremlett backed his county team-mate to achieve that feat. 'Maybe that's the case that those changes open a door,' said Tremlett of Downton's ECB exit. 'They were the guys who were in place that I guess made those rulings that he wasn't going to come back and play for England. 'People have heard things from Colin Graves the last few weeks that he might have a chance of coming back. 'I guess it's just wait and see, who knows what's going to happen in the next few weeks, other positions could change within the England set-up. Pietersen cancelled his Indian Premier League contract in order to play domestic cricket for Surrey . 'But I think Kevin knows he's got a chance if he goes out there and scores runs. 'I think he feels he was harshly treated by being released from the ECB a year or so ago, so I think he's got a point to prove and it will be exciting to see what happens. 'I don't see why he can't get back into the England set-up. 'There's been a couple of changes over the last couple of days with England, and I don't know what's going to happen there. 'But I'm sure if he stacks up a lot of runs then people are going to be pushing for him to get back in the England side. 'It will be interesting to see how it unravels in the next five or six weeks. The 34-year-old takes a snap on his phone during the media day at The Oval on Thursday . 'But from Surrey's point of view we're all hoping he gets out there and scores big runs.' Pietersen was back at The Oval on Thursday for Surrey's pre-season press day, posing for team photographs. The 104-Test veteran's England career went up in smoke during the disastrous 2013-14 Ashes series in Australia, with accusations and back-biting of dressing room unrest. Captain Gareth Batty claimed the Surrey dressing room is 'even better' with Pietersen around, playing down any chances of the returning star causing any backroom imbalance. 'I can only comment on things I've seen with my own eyes,' said Batty. Pietersen has not played for England since England's disastrous Ashes Tour in 2013 . Paul Downton was sacked from his position as managing director of England cricket . 'But if you go up into that changing room now, Kev will be up there taking the mickey out of someone - and someone will be taking the mickey out of him back. 'It's a very nice place to be. 'I enjoy coming to work every morning. 'Whether Kev's there or not it's a nice place to be, if anything with Kev there it's even better because there's a bit more banter, a few more of you boys kicking around and there's a bit more fun to be had at everybody else's expense. 'So it's always been a good place when Kevin's been around. 'I think he's very motivated, and I think there's a bit of fuel there that's motivating him on a daily basis. 'All I see is a young fella, who is desperate to play cricket, and desperate to get back to his absolute best.'","Kevin Pietersen has made a return to county cricket with Surrey .

"Kevin Pietersen has thrown his support behind former team-mate Michael Vaughan as the right man to 'change the brand of cricket currently being played' in England. Ten years on from his career-defining captaincy in the 2005 Ashes, Vaughan is the hot favourite to be appointed as director of England cricket, a streamlined version of the managing director's job which was abolished with Paul Downton's sacking on Wednesday. The 40-year-old has previously kept his distance from a formal role with the ECB, preferring to focus on his burgeoning media profile and business interests, but has declared himself open to discussions about the new post. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen believes Michael Vaughan is the right man to lead England Cricket . Pietersen received the lion's share of attention during a photocall for his new club Surrey . The controversial star and Vaughan were England team-mates before Pietersen was axed by the ECB . Vaughan would be a pioneering presence, having spoken with passion and candour about the need to accept England's failings and press for change at all costs. That may yet prove good news for the exiled Pietersen. The controversial batsman has largely kept his counsel on the demise of Downton, whose first act in the job was to sack Pietersen last February. But he did tell BreatheSport that his 2005 Ashes captain Vaughan had the credentials to replace him. 'He (Vaughan) is close enough to the game to make changes which need to happen for the good of English cricket,' Pietersen said. 'The way he captained shows he'll change the brand of cricket currently being played, which we need.' Vaughan has previously concentrated on his media duties but is believed to be open to the role . The former England captain speaks with Stuart Broad during last summer's Test series with India . Vaughan holds the urn after England famously reclaimed the Ashes against Australia in 2005 . Pietersen may not have played international cricket for well over a year but his shadow looms large over the current turmoil surrounding England. Downton's troubled reign was defined by the decision to martyr Pietersen after the 2013/14 Ashes. The ECB board met at Lord's on Thursday, but there was no official word on the recruitment process. Instead a short statement merely confirmed that Giles Clarke's move from chairman to president had been rubber-stamped, with Middlesex deputy chairman Ian Lovett nominated as vice-chairman. Clarke will become the first ECB president on May 14, a role that carries responsibility for ICC business, while his old post will go to Colin Graves. Graves was the man who gave new legs to Pietersen's mooted comeback when he appeared to suggest a blank slate policy would take root when he arrived at Lord's. Graves hinted that a prolific run in county cricket could see him reinstated, which led to the 34-year-old extricating himself from his Indian Premier League contract and re-signing with Surrey. Downton's exit removed one significant obstacle and should Vaughan be handed the new position, that would strengthen his hand yet further. Former director of England Cricket, Paul Downton, was sacked after the nation's dismal World Cup . Another former England captain Alex Stewart has also put his hat into the ring for the vacancy . Surrey chief Alec Stewart, another former England captain who has indicated he would be open to talks with the ECB, is a confirmed Pietersen supporter - but another possible applicant, Andrew Strauss, is unlikely to be as effusive. Strauss' relations with Pietersen deteriorated badly in his final days as England captain, and an X-rated slip of the tongue during a commentary stint last summer suggested those wounds have not healed. There was no news from the board meeting on the future of national selector James Whitaker, who appeared vulnerable after Downton's dismissal. He looks set to continue in the role for the time being and is due to join the senior side in the West Indies for the second Test in Grenada and third in Barbados.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan is favourite to replace Paul Downton as director of England cricket .

"March was an impressive month for Arsene Wenger and Arsenal as four Premier League wins from four cemented their place in the Champions League places. And the Frenchman's reward for their good form was another Manager of the Month accolade to sit on his mantelpiece. Wenger has quite a few of the gongs now - 14 to be exact - but he has quite a long way to run until he matches the 27 monthly prizes of Sir Alex Ferguson. Arsene Wenger is March's winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award - his 14th accolade . Wenger with the Manager of the Month Award for April 2002 - when his Arsenal team won the league title . A grey-suited Wenger with his award from October 2000 - one of 14 he has won at Arsenal .

The legendary Manchester United manager was the inaugural winner of the Manager of the Month award when it was introduced in August 1993, at the start of the Premier League's second season. With United winning no fewer than 12 Premier League titles during that time, it comes as little surprise to see the Scot top of the list. In the 1999-2000 campaign, he won it in August, March and April as United romped to the title by 18 points and exerted a similar dominance in 2006-2007, claiming the prize in August, October and February. The last of Ferguson's 27 awards came in October 2012, not long before he announced his retirement. A Manchester United double as Alex Ferguson and Eric Cantona celebrate their awards in 1996 . Ferguson won 27 monthly prizes in all, including this one for February 1997 . Ferguson and Wayne Rooney were celebrating in February 2005 as they claimed the monthly prizes . Wenger first got his hands on the award in March 1998 and also won it the following month as Arsenal claimed the Double of Premier League and FA Cup in his first full campaign. Before this month's win, Wenger had last been recognised in September 2013 as his team made a positive start in a campaign that would ultimately see them finish fourth. He may have struggled to fill Ferguson's shoes at Old Trafford, but David Moyes won this accolade 10 times when in charge of Everton. Harry Redknapp and Martin O'Neill have the monthly award listed eight times on their CVs, while Bobby Robson, Rafa Benitez and Sam Allardyce both have six. Jose Mourinho may have led Chelsea to two Premier League titles but his tally of three is not as many as the four won by Joe Kinnear during his days as Wimbledon manager. 27 - Manchester United . 14 - Arsenal, Liverpool . 13 - Newcastle United . 12 - Everton . 11 - Chelsea . 9 - Manchester City, Southampton . 8 - Tottenham Hotspur . 7 - Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers . 6 - Blackburn Rovers . 5 - Leeds United, West Ham United . 4 - Leicester City, Wimbledon . 3 - Charlton Athletic, Coventry City, Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Reading, Sheffield Wednesday, Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion, Wigan Athletic . 2 - Fulham, Swansea City . 1 - Birmingham City, Crystal Palace, Derby County, Hull City, Ipswich Town, Norwich City, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers .

Given Ferguson's dominance, it comes as little surprise that Manchester United come out on top in the clubs list. Wenger's win this month means Arsenal now have 14 overall, the same as Liverpool. Newcastle United aren't far behind with 13, followed by Everton on 12 and Chelsea on 11. English managers dominate the list looking back, with 75 managers from this country having won the prize.

"Alec Stewart has expressed his interest in becoming the new Director of England Cricket following the sacking on Wednesday of Managing Director Paul Downton. Stewart, who played in a record 133 Tests for England and is currently director of cricket at Surrey, has not yet been approached by the ECB. But he said: ‘When England come calling, you shouldn’t say no.’ The early bookies’ favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan, the former England captain who is close to the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, and has also made clear his desire to help English cricket out of its current state of chaos. Alec Stewart stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday . Stewart lines up with Surrey players for the team photo at the KIA Oval . Test matches: 133 . Highest score: 190 .

Stats via ESPNcricinfo . But Stewart, who also spoke highly of the early impression Kevin Pietersen has made on his return to the Surrey team, remains a respected figure in the game. And he is open to offers. Asked whether he’d be interested in the post – created by the ECB’s new chief executive Tom Harrison, who confirmed Downton’s demise Wednesday evening – Stewart said: ‘I can’t just say yes until I know what the role and the responsibility are. But, of course, if it was the right role, you’d be stupid not to look at it. ‘As a player I did just about anything that was asked of me. If they asked me to take on a role, and it’s the right role, of course I’d listen and have a big conversation – once the ECB have asked Surrey permission to speak to me, of course, because I’m under contract here. ‘I just want England to be the best side in the world. And if the ECB felt I was the right person to help take them to No 1, then of course I’d look at it. ‘I’ve got a big job here, and that’s what I’m concentrating on. But at the same time you’ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities, and when England come calling, you shouldn’t say no. ‘If they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket, then I’d have thought I’d be very close to being at the top of that list.’ Stewart (centre front) poses in the Surrey team photo ahead of the start of the County Championship season . Stewart was a wicketkeeper-batsman for England. Here he looks on as Australia's Steve Waugh plays a shot towards England fielder Graham Thorpe in the fifth test of an Ashes clash at Edgbaston in 1993 . Stewart is carried by team-mates Steve Harmison (left) and Andrew Flintoff, after playing his final Test match, at the Oval in September 2003 against South Africa . But Stewart made clear he’d be interested in the job only if there was a clear definition of his accountability. ‘If you do well, you get patted on the back, if you don’t do well, you get moved on. To me, it’s straightforward. But if there are too many bits and pieces in the jigsaw, people can hide. ‘I’m not one for hiding. It’s about making tough decisions, and living and dying by those decisions. And making sure the players play without fear.’ Stewart, who led England in 15 Tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs, was effusive in his praise of Pietersen, whose chances of a surprise England recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of Downton – who in turn had sacked Pietersen over a year ago. Kevin Pietersen will feature for Stewart's Surrey outfit in this year's county championships and the former wicket-keeper batsman believes the 34-year-old could still make a comeback at international level . ‘We’ve never had a problem with him,’ said Stewart. ‘I’m sure other dressing-rooms may not say the same, but we don’t have to handle him. ‘He fits in well. When he walked in, he went to his locker straightaway: it was like he’d never been away. We can only speak in glowing terms of him. And that’s how I judge people, is how I find them – not hearsay, or from other people. ‘England have said he’s not on their radar. But you should never say never. If he’s racking the runs up, and England are struggling, if the players aren’t getting runs or there’s an injury to a batsman, and he’s in top form – why wouldn’t you want to bring him back?’","Alec Stewart admits he would happily consider a role within ECB .

The Frenchman has thrived in the centre of Arsenal's midfield since returning from loan at Championship side Charlton earlier in the season to earn plaudits for his robust performances. Vieira was captain during Arsenal's trophy laden beginning to Arsene Wenger's reign and Coquelin hopes he can keep performing to emulate the club legend. Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin, who has become an integral part of their midfield, celebrates with fans . 'I’m not going to say to you I am (the new Vieira), obviously I want to be but I think it’s down to the performance I put in every week so I’m just trying to give me best every game so hopefully I can do that in the long term,' Coquelin told BT Sport. On loan at Charlton, the 23-year-old feared he may not play for the Gunners again. 'Well, obviously that was in my head and I think at the time my loan had finished the first month. I could see the injuries over there, I think Arteta was out, Ramsey and it was the time for me to either extend my loan or come back and I extended it and thought maybe I won’t get the chance now,' added Coquelin. The midfielder is determined to prove himself at Arsenal and hold down his place in the starting XI. The 23-year-old is not shy of putting in a robust challenge on opponents as he adds steel to Arsenal's midfield . 'I always had confidence in myself and belief in myself I just need the chance. I got the chance because other people got injured and tried to grab it with both hands and do as well as I could,' he told BT Sport. Arsenal have been much maligned in recent seasons for lacking grit and strength in the centre of the park, but Coquelin is happy to focus on the defensive side of the game. 'The way I think is that I’m just trying to do what’s best for the team. There are other players who can do this job and I’m trying to focus on mine which is to get the ball back and help the team defensively,' added the 23-year-old. Coquelin, tackling Manchester City's David Silva, has managed to establish a starting place in the Arsenal XI . 'Obviously sometimes you want to get involved a little bit more because we play great football and this is Arsenal, you always want to get involved moving forward. But you need to think about the defensive aspect and that is what my job is all about.' Arsene Wenger's side have been in top form in the Premier League, winning their last six matches to close the gap on Manchester City in second and establish a place in the prestigious top four. The Gunners take on Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday in a pivotal clash in the race for Champions League football, but Arsenal's 'new Vieira' is confident. 'We obviously want to win this game you know, it’s a massive one, really important and we can increase the gap to nine points if we win so yes, I think it’s really important,' said the Frenchman. 'I can’t say definitely because mathematically it won’t be over, so I can’t say that, but yes we see a lot of confidence in us because over the last few months we have had some big results and if we can beat Liverpool it will be another massive one.' Coquelin celebrates with countryman Olivier Giroud as Arsenal managed to win every game in March . See the full interview with Francis Coquelin on ‘Matchday Live with Fletch & Sav’ from 10am this Saturday on BT Sport 1. Guests include Ian Wright, Harry Redknapp, Piers Morgan and Michael Owen.","The 23-year-old has become an integral part of Arsenal's starting XI .

"The alleged racial profiling of suspects by police hit the headlines against last week following the fatal shooting of an unarmed, black father-of-four  during a routine traffic stop in South Carolina. But now, a young African-American man has released a video disputing claims that all white police officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color', insisting that 'there are good cops out there'. In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Will Stack, a 22-year-old U.S. Army National Guardsman, recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in the state's Lexington County. He explains how he was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse on Wednesday, to make a left turn, when he decided to use the empty median lane to access the left turn lane, which was full. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're bad': Will Stack, 22, a U.S. Army National Guardsman, has released a video (pictured) disputing claims that all white officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color' Moments later, he was stopped by the cop for 'improper use of the median'. 'He told me what I did, asked for my license and registration, I gave that to him,' Mr Stack says in the selfie-style video. He continues: 'Now, I will say that why he was here with me, I made sure my hands were on the steering wheel, I made sure to speak very politely as I always do. I did what he told me to do. 'I handed him the information and I sat here and waited and turned my music down.' The officer left Mr Stack's car for a few minutes, before walking back and returning the documents to him. He then explained the proper use of the median to Mr Stack, telling him it 'needs to be open for emergency vehicles'. 'I was in the wrong, I didn't realize it. I did it out of habit,' Mr Stack admits. After acknowledging the officer's words, Mr Stack, a former Psychology student at the University of South Carolina, was given a warning and both him and the cop went their respective ways. In the video,  filmed minutes after the encounter and later posted on Mr Stack's Facebook page, where it has been viewed 1.7million times, Mr Stack goes on to explain why he is telling his story. Traffic stop: In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Mr Stack recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in South Carolina. He says he was given a warning after doing everything the cop said . Praise: Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented (above) on Mr Stack's selfie-style video, with many praising him for his honesty amid a national scandal over alleged police brutality . Mixed opinion: Although many of the users' comments were positive, others were negative (as seen bottom) 'The point of this is to say that I am an African-American male, this gentleman was Caucasian. There were no problems. He did his job, I did what I was supposed to do, and that was it,' he says. 'I feel like people need to understand that not all officers are crooked, not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims. 'Just because you're black doesn't mean you're a victim, just because you're white doesn't mean you're a racist, just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're a bad person.' He adds: 'This world really needs to stop putting labels on people and things and see them as who they are: people doing things. Ignorance has no color. God doesn't see color. Why should we?' Mr Stack captured the video just days after North Charleston officer Michael Slager was arrested for murder for allegedly shooting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away. Serviceman: 'I feel like people need to understand... not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims,' says Mr Stack (pictured left and right) Scene: Mr Stack was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse (above) when he was pulled over by the cop . He told WIS that although he had concerns over the use of force  applied by Officer Slager, 33, he was keeping an open mind about the shooting - and did not believe Scott should have tried to flee. Speaking to the station, Mr Stack, who recently completed a deployment with the National Guard and is now job hunting, said: ' It's possible for African Americans and police officers to get along. 'And, not everybody shares the same mindset because nobody's the same, everybody's different.' Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented on Mr Stack's video, with many praising him for his honesty amid the national scandal over alleged police brutality. Natashalynn Hoag told him: 'Amazingly said!!!!!!! Agreed 100% You have a GREAT head on your shoulders! You were raised wonderfully, your family should be VERY proud of you!!!' And Tina Wisecup Wills wrote: 'Such wise words. Thank you for taking the time to share them.'

"The moment a pregnant woman was fatally shot by two Idaho police officers has been revealed in surveillance footage. Jeanetta Riley, 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014. The troubled Native American woman, who was addicted to meth and alcohol, had been taken to the hospital by her husband, 44-year-old Shane, following threats she made to kill herself, according to the Guardian. While parked outside of the emergency room of Bonner General Hospital, she pulled a knife from under the car seat featuring a three-and-a-half-inch blade, and was confronted by police before she was shot and killed. In the video, Jeanetta is heard in an exchange with officers as they repeatedly tell her to put the knife down but she refuses before a commotion is heard and they shoot her. Jeanetta Riley (pictured left with her husband Shane), 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014 . She was taken to hospital by her husband, Shane, after he heard her fiddling with blades and talked about killing herself and stabbing people (Jeanetta pictured above with her daughters Dayna, top, Dolly, left, and Hannah, right) Officers Michael Valenzuela, 27 and Skyler Ziegler, 29 were cleared of any wrongdoing following the incident and the case was closed in November. In the footage, Valenzuela, Ziegler and a third officer, Garrett Johnson, 23 arrived at the scene where Jeanetta was sitting in the car holding the bottle of vodka and the knife. She then walked towards them with the knife at her side, according to the Guardian. In the footage, Ziegler is heard shouting 'walk over here' and 'show me your hands' before she responds 'f*** you. no.' She is told again to put down the knife and continues to refuse and shouts 'bring it on, no.' Jeanetta then steps off the curb and into the road towards the two officers when gun fired is heard, with three bullets striking her torso and one striking her heart. Jeanetta took the knife from under the car seat and was confronted by officers who repeatedly told her to put the knife down but she refused (above scenes from the incident) After she stepped off the curb and walked towards them, they fired their guns and she was killed (above the moment she was shot) The events leading to the incident unfolded when the couple, who was homeless and living out of a 1996 Chevrolet van parked next to a lake, had spent the day with Jeanetta's daughter, 13-year-old Hannah. Jeanetta and Shane had arguments earlier in the day that were escalating when she began mentioning harming herself. The pair dropped Hannah off at her stepfather's house, and after drinking half a bottle of vodka while back at their camp, Jeanetta spoke about killing herself and stabbing people, Shane said. When he heard her fiddling with blades he decided to take her to the hospital. The Native American woman, who was addicted to alcohol and meth, and drank half a bottle of vodka before she was taken to the hospital on the day she died . In the summer of 2012, Jeanetta married Shane and two years later the couple gave up their newborn baby for adoption . Shane said he told Jeanetta at the time: 'This isn't a joke. It's not a game.' While parked outside of the emergency room, Jeanetta took out the knife and Shane ran inside and told a staff member behind the desk to call the police. Following the exchange with police, Jeanetta was shot and killed. Valenzuela told detectives he thought she was 'absolutely gonna thrust at me' when he pulled the trigger, while Ziegler said the knife looked 'huge in her hands', according to the Guardian. In November, the officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a local prosecutor. Fourteen hours after Jeanetta was shot and killed, a dog called Arfee was fatally shot by police in nearby Coeur d’Alene, in a killing that was ruled unjustified. His owner received an $80,000 payout two weeks ago as well as an apology from the mayor. Shane and Riley's three daughters so far have not even received an apology. The officers involved in the incident were cleared of any wrongdoing by a local prosecutor in November. Jeanetta and her husband were homeless and living out of their van which was parked next to a lake . On the day of the incident, Shane ran into the hospital (above) and alerted staff to call the police . Peter Reedy, an FBI-trained hostage negotiator and former sergeant, said the officers should not have gone so quickly into a tense stand-off with their guns drawn, he told the Guardian. He said: 'First of all, do nothing. Keep your distance, try to talk to her, don't even take your gun out of your holster, try to calm things down and work out what you're up against.' Reedy added: 'If they had not responded to the call they way she did, I truly believe she would be alive right now.' There are close to 1,000 people killed by police on average each year, according to a recent U.S. government study, and reportedly at least half of those fatally shot by police in the U.S. have mental health issues, another study reported.","Jeanetta Riley, 35, a mother-of-three daughters was shot and killed by two police officers on July 8, 2014 in Sandpoint, Idaho .

"Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who don’t, researchers claim. The findings come after the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said he was dubious about using technology as a teaching aid in non-IT classes. However, research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices. Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who don’t, researchers claim (stock image above) Courtney Blackwell, at Northwestern University in the US, found that, in tests, kindergarten children who shared iPads in classes over an academic year significantly outscored their peers who were in classes that had no iPads or in which each student had their own device. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users. She worked with 352 students at a Midwestern suburban school district during the research. Miss Blackwell said the findings suggest it’s the ‘collaborative learning around the technology that made the difference, not just the collaboration in and of itself’. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher in a test than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users (stock image above) She added: 'Schools might reconsider how the tablets are used, especially in earlier grades, in order to make the technology most effective.' She is due to present her findings at the 65th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association in Puerto Rico.","Students who shared an iPad scored around 30 points higher on the test .

"Hailed as one of the most imaginative minds in history, Dr Seuss created magical worlds with playful rhymes and kooky illustrations. But it seems his words have come to life somewhere in the depths of Alaska. This towering structure 130 miles from Anchorage was once a two-story home, built after a forest fire swept the valley clean of trees. Dr Seuss fans flock to Alaska to visit this 12-cabin-high structure that looks like one of his illustrations . Teetering: The owner wanted to be able to see the idyllic valley over the tall trees around their cabin . In need of renovation: It was abandoned for years but new owners are now renovating it . Eclectic: The storys are bound together with metal sticks and unusual platforms . It seemed unfathomable to Dr Seuss fans that a real life version of this tower could be created . However, when the trees eventually started shooting up again, the owner refused to relinquish his idyllic view of the mountains. So they built up. And up. And up. Now it teeters at an impressive 12 storys high, bearing a stark resemblance to the kind of houses drawn in Dr Seuss's books. Stands out: The house is miles from any other home, about 130 miles from the center of Anchorage . 'We made it!': These are just two of the hundreds of Instagram posts taken by fans outside the property . Birds-eye view: Alaska Aerial Media captured the unusual tower in all its glory after a heavy bout of snow . And it has not gone unnoticed. Hordes of Dr Seuss fans have flocked to 'climb the tower' in the past few years. According to This Is Colossal, the house was eventually abandoned by the imaginative architect. The site notes, however, that new owners are now renovating the property to withstand the heavy winds.","Homeowner built cabin near Anchorage valley after forest fire .

"Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany insists that UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations protect elite clubs rather than helping teams avoid going bust. The Premier League champions were last year deemed to have breached FFP regulations, before being fined £50million and ordered to operate with a £49m transfer kitty this season. City are debt-free, mainly thanks to the vast wealth of owner Sheikh Mansour’s heavy personal investment, whereas Manchester United were able to splash out £150m on new talent in the summer, despite being in the region of £400m in the red. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has slammed FFP for protecting the established order of clubs . Ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday, Kompany has hit back at the FFP rulings, claiming they prevent other teams challenging the established sides at the upper echelons of the game. 'Just who is FFP protecting?' Kompany told the Sunday Mirror. 'For me, it is protecting those few clubs who were already geared up to be successful. ‘Just because a club is part of the established order doesn't mean they should be guaranteed success forever,’ he added. 'I just look at it in terms of the established order protecting themselves.’ 'When I first came to England seven years ago, it was the same four clubs always in the top four. That has changed. Our owners have invested to build a successful club. That in itself will bring in more fans and create more revenue. Is that so bad? Kompany and his City team-mates react after losing to Crystal Palace over the Easter weekend . Glenn Murray holds off a challenge from Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany at Selhurst park . The Belgian international has guided City to pick up two Premier League titles, a FA Cup and the Capital One Cup in the past four seasons, having joined the club just 10 days before Sheikh Mansour bought the club. Kompany praises the impact of the owners on aspects that aren’t just beneficial to the club and claimed such a takeover and transformation would be impossible with FFP in full swing. ‘Look at what this club has done for the community and the city of Manchester – and don't forget that we pay a lot of tax in the UK as well, so that helps the economy,’ said Kompany. 'If City's owners hadn't invested like they did five years ago, it might have been too late for them to create a top club.' 'What has been introduced denies clubs like Leeds, Nottingham Forest and others with big fan-bases the opportunity to ever get to the top level again.'

"A pitcher with the Colorado Rockies is taking some time out from the sport to care for his young son, who was bitten by a rattlesnake last month in Arizona. Right-handed reliever John Axford was placed on the family medical emergency list before the Rockies game on Sunday. His son had surgery last Monday - opening day for the Rockies - on his right foot to remove necrotic tissue. John Axford, right, has been placed on the family medical emergency list by the Colorado Rockies. His son Jameson, left, was bitten twice by a rattlesnake last month and requires more treatment. Axford celebrated h is birthday on April 1 by enjoying cake with his sons, JB, left, and Jameson, right . Axford said the toes of 2-year-old Jameson 'look fine,' but doctors are trying to improve mobility as they combat infection. Jameson will board an emergency medical flight on Monday to Denver for more treatment. 'We still have a long road, a long process to go,' Axford said. 'But at least I'll be able to be closer to him.' His son was bitten twice in the yard of the house his family rented in Scottsdale for spring training. The family was hoping for 'better things' after the surgery. 'The necrotic tissue on his foot ended up being worse than we thought,' explained Axford, who also has a 3-year-old son, JB. 'There was a lot of infection in there and it was a staph infection. The tissue they thought was going to be good turned out to not be great. … His foot is in pretty rough shape in spots.' More surgery will be necessary, and Axford said one of the top surgeons is in Denver. The Axford family will board an emergency medical flight on Monday to Denver so that Jameson, center, can have more treatment . 'The doctors in Arizona have been amazing. They've texted me, called me, keeping me updated with everything,' Axford said. 'They told me they all agreed that this was the worst rattlesnake bite they'd seen in the area. It's pretty unfortunate that it went that way for him, but it was fortunate that it was in the area that it was, on his foot, not somewhere else on his body, especially with the damage that was done.' Axford will be out for at least three days and a maximum of a week. Axford has made one appearance for the Rockies this season, getting a save with a scoreless 10th inning on Wednesday at Milwaukee. But really his mind has been anywhere but the ballpark. His wife, Nicole, has been constantly by his son's side at the hospital. Given Jameson's age, Axford is hoping his son won't remember too much about this incident. 'Hopefully because he is 2 he'll be able to erase it from his memory. But he'll have an incredible scar on his foot to show people and he'll have the story from us,' Axford said. Axford, who has been given sick leave for at least three days and a maximum of a week, tweeted his thanks last month for the support his family had received after Jameson, 2, was bitten twice by a rattlesnake . Rockies manager Walt Weiss went through a health scare with his son more than a decade ago and shared his story with Axford. When Weiss was playing for Atlanta in 1998, his son, Brody, got E. coli and developed a blood disease. Brody Weiss was in critical condition for a few weeks. Now Brody is playing baseball at a community college. 'Dealt with a life-and-death situation with my son and was away from the team for a while, and so I was certainly able to empathize with him, in sharing that story,' Walt Weiss said. 'That doesn't make it any easier for John, but I think it helps when someone can share a similar experience with you.' To take Axford's spot, the Rockies selected the contract of righty Scott Oberg from Triple-A Albuquerque. They also transferred infielder Charlie Culberson (back) to the 60-day disabled list.","John Axford has been placed on the family medical emergency list by the Colorado Rockies .

"Forget football and females and other traditional pub banter - modern men are more likely to chat about their children over a pint with their friends. Relationship issues and sexual problems are also high on the agenda for discussion down the boozer. Those were the findings of more than 70 hours of footage from hidden cameras in one London pub. Session: Secret cameras at an east London boozer showed that men are more likely to discuss sexual problems and relationship issues than the weekend's football matches . They didn't pick up a single mention of football, while women were discussed only occasionally. One man in the Lord Nelson pub was heard telling his friends how he realised he was gay while dating a married woman. Three middle-aged men talked openly about erectile dysfunction and another spoke about his fears about having a kidney transplant. Secret Life of the Pub: Recordings showed how one man openly talked about erectile dysfunction . Catch up: The cameras revealed how the modern man feels happy to discuss sexual and relationship issues . Another customer at the pub on the Isle of Dogs, which attracts drinkers from all walks of life, including professionals from nearby Canary Wharf, told his companions the lack of affection shown to him by his parents means he values their friendship all the more. Landlady Kim Arrowsmith said: 'There are a lot of things today that women won't put up with. That's why the males know that now they have to be more sensible.' She said that although people knew they were being filmed for Channel 4, they soon forgot the cameras were there. The Secret Life of the Pub will be shown on Thursday.","Relationship issues and sexual problems discussed over a pint with mates .

"Louis van Gaal blamed himself for Manchester United finishing the game with 10 men, using all his substitutes before Michael Carrick came off as a precaution with a tight calf. The United boss said: ‘It was of course an error from me that I give too much minutes to my substitutes. It is not so wise. 'Some players didn’t know that we were playing with 10 men because the crowd were yelling and it was difficult to get the message to them.’ Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal (right) celebrates victory with Ander Herrera at full-time . An injured Michael Carrick walks along the touchline after coming off as a precaution with a tight calf . Aguero's quick-fire ton . It will come as little consolation to Sergio Aguero that he reached the 100-goal mark faster than any player in Manchester City’s history with his double at Old Trafford. The striker has had to wait for that honour, however, with his first goal ending a barren run stretching back eight hours and 39 minutes to the defeat home to Barcelona in February. Sergio Aguero (centre) celebrates after scoring the opening goal at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon . It was Aguero's first goal since he scored for City against Barcelona at the Etihad back in February . Milner goes off in a strop . James Milner's reaction to being substituted as he waited to come back on following treatment after a reckless challenge from Phil Jones does not augur well for the England winger ending his contract stalemate. Milner was standing on the touchline when he discovered that he was being replaced by Samir Nasri, and hurled an energy pouch to the floor in frustration before trudging back to the dugout. Manchester City's James Milner goes off with an injury during Sunday's Premier League derby . United felt that Martin Demichelis overreacted when he was caught in the face by a flailing arm from Marouane Fellaini in the second half, but the Belgian does have a rather patchy track record on that score.

"Three former England rugby internationals on a charity expedition to the North Pole continued with their trip despite the landing gear of their plane collapsing on their way out. Lewis Moody, Danny Grewcock and Josh Lewsey said they felt nothing more than a jolt. Poor visibility at the makeshift 800m strip beside the Russian operated Camp Barneo first caused an aborted landing. Three former England rugby internationals - Lewis Moody, Josh Lewsey and Danny Grewcock - continued with their trip to the North Pole despite the landing gear of their plane collapsing on their way out . The experienced pilots were then forced to break harder than usual when a crack appeared on an ice floe near the runway. But the stars played down reports of a near miss as they celebrated a safe return from their epic endeavour to raise money for the Lewis Moody Foundation and the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund. Moody, 36, said: 'We didn't know anything was wrong.' 'There were murmurs about it and instead of it being a smooth landing I think maybe they had to put the plane down a bit quicker than normal. But I wasn't particularly bothered by it.' Someone left to update Moody's Twitter account wrote that the rugby star had called and said the men were safe . Before the accident Moody reminded followers to donate and posted a picture of the plane . Grewcock, 42, said there was a jolt on impact but it wasn't until the 36 passengers were getting off that the plane's nose lifted and it sank back on its rear loading bay. The group were flying from the most northerly town in the world, Longyearbyen on the Svalbard archipelago, to the Russian operated camp when the accident happened last week. Moody, Grewcock and Lewsey were part of a nine-strong team including three Royal Marines and directors of yachting company Y.CO. Moody (left) and Lewsey (right) might be used to a pitch - but they would have found the ice floes and five-feet high ridges at the North Pole a little more challenging .

After the incident they were taken by helicopter to the exact latitude of 89 North before loading up their 60 kilo sleds and trekking to the pole. Their journey took them across ice floes and up five-feet high ridges and they endured temperatures as cold as -50C.

"Alan Stubbs hailed the bravery of his Hibs players after they ruined Hearts’ Easter Road title party with a 2-0 derby win. He saw his men hold on to second place in the Championship with a second straight win, building momentum after a run of three consecutive defeats – and setting them up for Saturday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Falkirk. Stubbs, who had seen his team play well but fail to beat Hearts in three previous outings this season, said his players had answered those who asked if they had the bottle to win at the business end of the season. ‘Two weeks ago we were being questioned,’ said Stubbs after goals from Jason Cummings and Farid El Alagui saw them remain level on points with Rangers, who have a game in hand. ‘People were asking if this was the wobble and was this Hibs; season ending again. Alan Stubbs saw his side record a win in the Edinburgh derby to put Hearts' promotion party on hold . ‘Football can change very quickly. Suddenly after two results we are building momentum again. I think the players have always answered the criticism. ‘When you have played well against the champions, as we have done this season, and not got three points, I think it is important. ‘Sometimes it can just linger on and it puts self-doubt in not just the players’ minds but the fans’ minds as well. I was proud of the players today, I really was. They were courageous and brave so I am delighted for them.’ Stubbs singled out El Alagui for special praise. The striker – not long back from seven months out with an achilles injury – played brilliantly before securing victory with his injury-time finish. ‘I’m absolutely delighted for him,’ said the Hibs manager. ‘He has had a really tough seven months, with a horrendous injury. I don’t think people understood just how bad the injury was and the fact he is back playing now is all credit to him. Hearts captain Danny Wilson picks the ball out of the back of the net after his side concede a second goal . ‘The surgeon deserves praise for the procedure he did and it’s great to have him back, because he is something we have missed. I think Farid is only going to get better, he is still not where we would like him to be. He needs more strength and speed put into him, but he will get that by playing games and working on his programme.’ Hibs defender Jordon Forster admitted he’d been motivated by a desire to silence the gloating Hearts fans, saying: ‘As much as you try and block out what the Hearts fans are planning, you see it on social media and in the papers. You know the fans are doing this and that. ‘You’d be lying if you said you don’t hear the fans during the game. I like a bit of banter because it’s the fans’ day as well as the players. You can use it to your motivation, as long as you don’t let it affect your game in a negative way. ‘It’s all a bit of fun. They have won the league - but we get the bragging rights for today. The Hibernian fans were in good spirits at full-time after getting one over their city rivals . ‘It’s probably the most important derby win I’ve been involved in. My debut was special and I’ll always remember it but it was vital to get three points and keep the pressure on Rangers. ‘All we can do is keep winning games until the end of the season and see where it takes us. They (Rangers) go to Tynecastle at the end of the season and if we win all our games we need them to drop points somewhere. If we stay focused it could be a really good season for the club and the fans.’","Hibs won the derby 2-0 to stay second in the Scottish Championship .

"The wife of legendary cricket commentator, Richie Benaud, has politely declined the offer of a state funeral for her late husband. Daphne Benaud has reportedly settled on a private gathering with only immediate family, indicating the 'no fuss' approach is the way the former Test captain would have wanted it. The private service for Benaud, who died on Friday aged 84, will take place this week, News Corp reported on Sunday. 'Godfather of cricket': Legendary commentator and former Australia captain Richie Benaud died aged 84 . Respected: Benaud died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by his wife Daphne (above) and family members . Richie Benaud, the legendary commentator described as the 'Godfather of cricket', passed away peacefully in his sleep overnight on Friday, surrounded by his wife Daphne and family. He had been receiving radiation treatment for skin cancer since November when he was admitted to a Sydney hospice on Thursday. In his recognition, Prime Minister Tony Abbott offered his family a state funeral, calling Benaud's death the 'greatest loss for cricket since the loss of Don Bradman.' While state funerals are usually reserved for politicians, Mr Abbott said ‘There would be very few Australians who have not passed a summer in the company of Richie Benaud.' News of his death threw the cricket world and beyond into mourning as tributes flowed in to a man remembered for his wry sense of humour, expertise and for simply being a 'true gentleman'. His sayings from the hundreds of Test and One Day cricket matches he commentated on across the world were often what fans remembered from important moments in these games . His dry one-liners and impeccable delivery - including one simple word 'marvellous' - were adopted as part of the Australian lexicon. Scroll down for videos . The cricket commentator had been receiving radiation treatment for skin cancer since November when he was admitted to a Sydney hospice on Thursday .

Benaud's wife, Daphne politely declined Prime Minister Tony Abbott's offer of a state funeral for her husband . A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Masses of Australian cricketers, politicians and sportspeople penned heartfelt tributes on social media in the wake of his passing. Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne called the champion leg spinner, the 'Godfather of cricket'. 'As a cricketer, commentator and as a person, you were the best there's ever been,' he wrote. Former captain Richie Benaud stands by a sculpture of himself at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2008 . Floral tributes gathered at the bronze statue of Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground . 'Our country has lost a national treasure,' Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said in a statement on Friday. 'After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.' 'He loved winning. He helped the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way. 'There's no doubt he's certainly going to be missed.' Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I grew up listening to Richie Benaud's wonderful cricket commentary. Like all fans of the sport, I will miss him very much.' Benaud was one of the world's most recognised commentators having initially started with the BBC in England before anchoring the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades . Richie Benaud married his wife Daphne in July 1967 . A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators . Former Prime Minister John Howard greeted Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground back in 2001 . Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets yet was as much renowned for his captaincy - he never lost a Test series as Australian captain. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets . Penrith-born Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964 . 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap... because Keith Miller never wore a cap, ' Benaud said at the time. 'It's one of those things in life: you live and learn as you go along.' As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests). He never lost a series as captain. Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute to Richie Benaud on social media on Friday .","Daphne Benaud has politely declined a state funeral for her late husband .

"Visitors to a wildlife park in New Zealand got to encounter a pride of lions up-close and personal. Filmed at the Orana Wildlife Park – the country’s only open-range zoo – the video shows the lions interacting with the visitors who stand inside a metal cage attached to a car. The video, which was captured by Ekant Veer, 35, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury, also shows the lions scaling the cage and eating meat through its bars. The lions at Orana Wildlife Park approach the metal cage and begin interacting with the people inside . Standing with its paws against the cage, a lion is introduced as Sakura who is around 11-years-old and weighs about 265kg. As the keeper speaks, the lion licks at a piece of meat that is held up against the bars as another lion walks across the roof of the cage. Looking down at the people below, the lion wanders around as if deciding who it would like to make its prey before staring down the lens of the camera. Set tongues wagging! One of the lions notices meat and begins sticking out its tongue in the hope of being fed . A lion stands next to one of the keepers and its large paw is the same size as the lady's head . The people inside can be seen recording the many lions from their phones, while another – with paws the same size as the keeper’s head – holds itself up against the cage and chews on some meat. Later in the video people can be seen pointing out the various felines as a keeper moves her hand along the cage, instigating the lion to follow. Still frames capture a lion standing up against the side of the cage alongside the keeper – its power and size is plain to see. A keeper holds a piece of meat up to the bars of the cage and a lion follows her hand in the hope of receiving it . A number of lions are fed directly through the metal bars, while others receive meat dropped from the back of the cage . The car then begins driving away and the lions can be seen chasing after the people in the hope of receiving more food. A keeper then drops meat from the back of it and the lions begin tailing off one by one with their own little piece of food. The video concludes with one lion picking up a final lump of meat from the floor and being chased by another, angry feline. A lion scales the cage and looks down at the people below as if deciding which one it would like to eat . The people inside can be seen pointing and filming the lion who wanders along the top of the cage above them . Orana Wildlife Park was opened in 1976 and is owned and operated by registered charity, Orana Wildlife Trust. Located on the outskirts of Christchurch, the wildlife park is unique in that the people are caged in order to view the animals, not the other way around.","Video shows the lions scaling the cage to look at the people inside .

She was just a few streets away from her home in Prahran with her french bulldog Dutchy when a man jumped out from an apartment complex . She said kickboxing classes she had taken at the gym helped her respond to the situation confidently . 'This guy stepped out from this apartment complex and it just happened really quickly... He just grabbed me and threw me back against the wall,' she continued. The attacker then threatened her life, saying 'something along the lines of ""make a noise or scream and I’ll kill you"".' 'It all happened so quickly and I just kneed him straight in the nuts,' Ms Verrall revealed. 'He went down and he was sort of groaning and cursing me and calling me the c-word so I just kicked him as hard as I could twice in the kidneys.' She then grabbed her dog and ran home as fast as she could. Victoria Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they are still searching for Ms Verrall's attacker, who is described as 'Caucasian, aged in his late 20s, approximately 180cm tall with a slim build'. He was wearing a jeans and a black hoodie at the time of the incident and officers have released an image of what they believe he looks like. Following the random attack Ms Verrall has also taken to social media to share her story of survival, and encourage other women to take part in self-defence and kickboxing classes. She was left with a broken nose, broken toe, and many other bruises and scratches . Ms Verrall has opened up about her experience and said kickboxing classes she had taken at the gym helped her defend herself . In a video posted to her Facebook page - which has so far garnered more than 735,000 views, 27,000 likes and almost 12,000 shares - the Melbourne woman opened up about the incident. 'They can try to beat you, they can try to intimidate you, they can try to make you feel like you’re nothing but women, we are all something,' Ms Verall, who is sporting a painful-looking black eye in the footage, said. The 31-year-old continues her monologue saying she was 'blessed' to have been able to do kickboxing and self-defence classes as it meant she was able to defend herself. '... I had the opportunity to use those skills and I kneed my assailant in his groin, very hard, he hit the ground very hard, and I then kicked him twice while he was down and then I grabbed my dog and I ran,' she revealed. Ms Verrall said she believes the only reason she was able to get out of that situation is because of her training. Victoria Police have released an image of the man they believe to be a suspect, who has a distinctive neck tattoo . The Melbourne woman is determined not to let the attack deter her from going about her daily life . She joked that her pooch Dutchy wasn't a very good guard dog but stayed by her side after she was attacked . 'I really really recommend anyone who has the opportunity to do either of those things (kickboxing or self-defence), that they do them because if I hadn't I don’t know where I would be now. 'Certainly it would be a lot worse than a broke nose and a broken toe,' the Melbourne woman said. However she stressed that she was in no way an expert kickboxing but had simply taken part in some classes at her gym, which she believed saved her. 'I’m actually a really uncoordinated person and I was always very intimidated by doing kickboxing and things like that,' Ms Verrall told Daily Mail Australia. Kim Jackson, founder of Personal Safety Australia and former police officer, commended Ms Verrall's response . She also said in her job as a property manager she had completed courses in self-defence, and is encouraging her staff and others in the industry to do the same. Kim Jackson, founder of Personal Safety Australia commended Ms Verrall's response, and said 'obviously she had a really strong commitment to her safety'. 'My belief is that people have that really strong commitment to their safety that survival instinct will kick in', the former police officer told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Jackson encouraged women to be aware of their surroundings and mentally checking anything that raises a red flag. 'But I don’t like women restricting their movements based on their fear,' she insisted. Instead the Personal Safety Australia founder encouraged not only women but also men to 'put in place practical strategies and be aware of when they feel safe.' 'I run at night by myself and I feel very safe doing that,' Ms Jackson said. 'Let your feelings of safety guide what you do.' Ms Verrall echoed these sentiments saying although the attack left her shaken, she wasn't going to let it get in her way. 'At the end of the day you can’t be afraid and I’m not going to let this incident stop me from enjoying my life,' she said. 'Will I be more cautious? Yes. '(But) I’m not going to live in fear because of one guy. 'At the end of the day you can’t be afraid and I’m not going to let this incident stop me from enjoying my life,' Ms Verrall insisted.

"Sebastian Vettel is determined to ensure the return of a long-standing ritual at Ferrari is not a one-off this season. Fresh from Ferrari's first victory in 35 grands prix in Malaysia 11 days ago, and ending his own 20-race drought, Vettel returned to a hero's welcome at the team's factory at Maranello last week. The win allowed Ferrari to revive a tradition not seen at their base for almost two years since their previous triumph in May 2013 at the Spanish Grand Prix courtesy of Fernando Alonso. Sebastian Vettel reflected on his stunning win for Ferrari at the Malaysian Grand Prix during the press conference before the weekend's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . The four-time world champion shares a friendly discussion with McLaren star Jenson Button . Four-times world champion Vettel said: 'It was a great victory we had in Malaysia, great for us as a team, and for myself a very emotional day - my first win with Ferrari. 'When I returned to the factory on Wednesday, to see all the people there was quite special. There are a lot of people working there and as you can imagine they were very, very happy. 'The team hadn't won for quite a while, so they enjoyed the fact they had something to celebrate. There were a couple of rituals involved, so it was nice for them to get that feeling again.' Asked as to the specific nature of the rituals, Vettel replied: 'I was supposed to be there for simulator work anyway, but it was quite nice to receive the welcome after the win. Ferrari's Vettel and Britta Roeske  arrive at the Shanghai circuit . Along with a Ferrari mechanic, Vettel caught up with members of his old team Red Bull on Thursday . 'All the factory got together for a quick lunch. It was quite nice to have all the people together in one room - it was a big room! - so we were able to celebrate altogether for a bit. 'I also learned when you win with Ferrari, at the entry gate, they raise a Ferrari flag - and obviously it's been a long time since they last did that. 'Some 10 years ago there were a lot of flags, especially at the end of a season, so this flag will stay there for the rest of the year. 'We will, of course, try and put up another one sometime soon.' Inside the Ferrari garage, Vettel shares a discussion with team staff as he looks to build on his Sepang win . Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene shares a conversation with Vettel at the team's hospitality suite . The feeling is that will not happen after this weekend's race in China as the conditions at the Shanghai International Circuit are expected to suit rivals Mercedes. Not that Vettel believes his success will be a one-off, adding: 'For here and the next races, we should be able to confirm we have a strong package and a strong car. 'We will want to make sure we stay ahead of the people we were ahead of in the first couple of races, but obviously knowing Mercedes are in a very, very strong position. 'In general, for the start of a season things can be up and down, and we want to make sure there is quite a lot of ups, not so many downs. 'But it's normal in some races you are more competitive than others. 'We managed to do a very good job in Malaysia, but for here and the next races we have to be realistic about we want to achieve.'

"Alan Gordon scored a first-half winner for LA Galaxy as they got over their nightmare start to the season against Seattle Sounders to move off the foot of the Western Conference in Major League Soccer. Robbie Keane and Clint Dempsey were both left out of their sides through injury but despite the absence of their Irish designated player - who was sat in the stands alongside David Beckham, the Galaxy were able to find just their second win of a difficult campaign so far. Gordon found the net with just his second goal of the season and it proved enough despite the Sounders having plenty of chances to equalise at the StubHub centre. Chad Marshall gets to the ball ahead of LA Galaxy striker Alan Gordon, who scored the opening goal . LA Galaxy (4-5-1): Penedo; Gargan (Meyer 86 mins), Gonzalez, De La Garza, Rogers; Ishizaki, Garcia, Husidic (Villarreal 83), Juninho, Zardes; Gordon. Unused subs: Dunivant, Jamieson, Maganto,  Rowe, Vayrynen. Booked: Gargan, Husidic, Juninho, Gordon. Manager: Bruce Arena. Seattle Sounders (4-4-2): Frei; Mears, Evans, Marshall, Remick; Roldan (Aaron 85), Rose, Alonso, Pappa (Mansaray 89); Neagle (Barrett, 74), Martins. Unused subs:  Azira, Gonzalez, Perkins, Scott. Booked: Martins, Marshall. Manager: Sigi Schmid. Referee: Mark Geiger. Both sides started strongly, but it was the Sounders' Lamar Neagle had the first chance of the game after nine minutes, flicking on from a cross that was tipped over the crossbar by Jaime Pendeo. Neagle again saw a header blocked by the keeper after 21 minutes and though it was the visitors with the best of the early chances, one minute later the Galaxy were ahead. Juninho sent a cross dep into the penalty area and centre back Omar Gonzalez rose to direct it back across Stefan Frei's goal. The Swiss goalkeeper scrambled to re-adjust but was beaten to it by Gordon who could hardly miss and duly put the Galaxy into the lead. Neagle had a third chance on the stroke of half-time but couldn't find the net having exploded through the Galaxy defence only to place his shot too close to Penedo who saved easily, diving to his right. The home side went in at the break ahead, and they came close to doubling their lead almost immediately after the break when Robbie Rogers shot low, forcing Frei into a sharp save at his near post. Juninho fired wide from distance moments later. Brad Evans  of Seattle Sounders wins a high ball against Galaxy goalscorer  Gordon in the first half . But back came the Sounders, and they should have levelled when Andy Rose latched on to a low cross but fired straight at Penedo from point-blank range when anywhere else would have led to a goal. The remainder of the game saw few clear-cut chances. Obafemi Martins had an effort easily saved from distance and while the home side looked dangerous on the break they often failed with the final ball. And so Gordon's strike proved enough as Galaxy claimed just their second win of the 2015 MLS season.","Alan Gordon put LA Galaxy into the lead after 23 minutes with a header .

"It's been a tough 18 months for Red Bull since their dominant four years at the top of Formula One ended in 2013. The team were well off the pace of Mercedes last season, but could at least count on Daniel Ricciardo to pick up a win or three when the Silver Arrows ran into trouble. However, Red Bull seem to have fallen even further back this season, with rivals, along with former driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel, taking the fight to Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at the sharp end of the grid.

"Eden Hazard is reaching the incredible standards of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo with his ‘dancing feet’, says Graeme Souness. The Chelsea star reached 100 Premier League appearances for the Blues at QPR on Sunday and has been lauded for his fine performances for Jose Mourinho’s side this season. Sky Sports pundit Souness believes Hazard, who has 35 goals and 25 assists in his century of Premier League games, will be named the PFA Player of the Year. Eden Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March . ‘He’s got dancing feet hasn’t he? When he runs with the ball it’s never more than nine inches away from his feet,’ Souness told Sky Sports. ‘So if you’re a defender, the minute you stick out a foot, he’s skipped past you,’ added Souness. ‘He’s got great feet and looks to be a strong boy too. If you look at him he’s all there, if he wants to stand up to challenges he definitely can.’ Having grown into an integral part of Chelsea’s attack, Souness compares the rapid Belgian with leading world stars such as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Hazard warms up at Loftus Road ahead of the clash with QPR, his 100th Premier League game for Chelsea . Jose Mourinho believes that 'it shouldn't even be a debate' that Hazard should claim PFA Player of the Year . ‘The way he goes past players, he makes good players look ordinary. He’s a bit like Messi and Ronaldo in that when you see them go past people, you think “that’s bad defending”, but no it’s not not. These guys are just that good and Hazard is close to that category.’ ‘He certainly needs more goals for me but he’s one of the few players that gets you on the edge of your seat every time you watch him play,’ added Souness. ‘I still think there is much more to come from him in the future.’ Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge .","Chelsea star Eden Hazard made his 100th top-flight appearance at QPR .

"It has long been a highlight of the racing calender - and the ladies of Liverpool certainly didn't disappoint  with fashion and drunken frolics once again taking centre stage. Trotting into Aintree in a collection of floral, flamboyant and eye-catching numbers, thousands of female race-goers displayed their indomitable spirit for the occasion. Clearly taking the 'Chanel-inspired' style guide to heart, many opted for outfits that wouldn't have been out of place at a wedding - whether as part of the bridal party or as the bride herself. Others seemed to have taken heed of the sunshine and instead sported full-skirted looks bedecked with blooms in pastel shades of lemon, periwinkle and peach. Most, however, were intent on nothing more than enjoying the blissful weather with many opening proceedings with a mini bottle of champagne, quaffed with the help of a booze funnel. The occasion may have commenced with glamorous group photos and sunny selfies but as Ladies' Day rolled on, the hours of drinking appeared to take their toll, not only on the female race fans but their outfits as well. Wardrobe malfunctions hit many a low-cut dress and thigh-length frock and some even chose to flash their bottom for photographers, while others struggled to keep their composure on a wooden racehorse. As the mid-afternoon sun beamed over Aintree, balancing in high heels and platforms presented more of a challenge and race-goers were seen staggering around the grounds. It wasn't just the ladies who were making the most of the occasion. Aintree's gentlemen were also out in full force, with one group donning a particularly garish selection of suits.","Racing fans dressed in their finest outfits have arrived for Ladies' Day .

"A football club chairman has warned of a new breed of hooliganism in the sport – from retired grandfathers who are trying to relive their youth and encourage violence on match days. Dave Doggett, the boss of League Two outfit Cambridge United, believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals prior to games. He said violence at matches has increased recently as the older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs'. Scroll down for video . Dave Doggett, the chairman of Cambridge United, has warned of a new breed of hooliganism and believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals . Mr Doggett said violence at matches has increased recently as older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs' Writing in his club's latest programme, Mr Doggett said: 'Unfortunately football clubs still attract an undesirable element of society that appear determined to ruin the enjoyment of real supporters of football clubs. 'Our promotion to the Football League appears to have encouraged our ""risk"" from the 1980s to come out of retirement. 'Many of them are grandparents trying to encourage the next generation to join their ""gangs"". 'It sounds pathetic but unfortunately it is reality. We are working closely with police. 'Hopefully the reality of the potential consequences will dissuade some of our younger supporters from becoming involved with these undesirables. 'Our football club is too important to so many to allow a few to ruin our great sport.' Peter Woor, a Cambridge United fan, said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as Southend United and Luton Town. He said: 'There's a tension and you feel threatened so I don't go to those places anymore. It's not worth it. 'Most places are fine though, but you still tend to go to away games and keep your colours hidden. 'I remember the 1970s and 1980s and it was horrendous and of course it's nothing like that but it's still a problem. 'These people must have something missing in their lives to want to do this. It's very sad.' Cambridge supporter Simon Dobbin, 42 (pictured with wife Nicole), remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after an away game to Southend on March 21. Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' Mr Doggett said older men were those causing violence. Pictured: Police with fans following reports of disorder outside Southend's Spread Eagle pub prior to the recent match between the Essex side and Cambridge . One Cambridge season ticket holder, who asked not to be named, said a group of about 30 fans regularly turn up to games looking for trouble afterwards. He said: 'They arrive after the game starts and then leave before it finishes to find a fight.' Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after their game away to Southend on March 21. Essex Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' and believe he was set upon by a group of thugs intent on attacking the visiting Cambridge fans. Cambridgeshire Police said the force has also seen an increase in the 'severity and volume' of football-related disorder this season. Inspector Steve Kerridge said: 'We have seen an increase in football-related violence and disorder amongst a very small minority of people, both in Cambridge and other locations when the club has travelled. 'The tragic events recently leading to a serious injury in Southend have been reported widely and sicken us all. Mr Doggett said Cambridge United had noticed an increase in violence since the club was promoted to League Two last year. Pictured: Southend United's Barry Corr beats Richard Tait to the ball in last month's match . 'The club is working hard with us to ensure that those who use football as a vehicle for violence and disorder have no place in the terraces or association with Cambridge United.' He said police are using football banning orders, which impose 'stringent court-backed' restrictions on individuals. He added: 'The increase of risk activity both in severity and volume this season means regular consideration of this level of intervention is once again - and sadly - justified and necessary.' The warning comes as football chiefs across the country continue to promote the Kick It Out Season of Action campaign to promote respect within football.","Cambridge United chairman warning of rise of violence among older fans .

"Lewis Hamilton suggested Mercedes will be back in control for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel conjured one of the biggest surprises for many a Formula One season with the team's first victory for almost two years at the last race in Malaysia. Many people expected another dominant Mercedes campaign in the wake of last season's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in Australia. Lewis Hamilton was fastest in first practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix . The Mercedes driver, who leads the championship, set the pace as he bids to win his fourth race in China .

Even Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggested Ferrari's success was 'a wake-up call' to his organisation. Without doubt Mercedes responded in the first practice session ahead of the latest race at the Shanghai International Circuit, and none more so than reigning champion Hamilton. A three-times winner at this track, including last season, Hamilton finished 0.541secs clear of team-mate Nico Rosberg, with a best lap of one minute 39.033secs. None of their rivals even came close, with Vettel a further half a second adrift at 1:40.157secs, with his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen 1.6secs down on Hamilton. Valtteri Bottas was ninth in his Williams, over two seconds shy of Hamilton's best time . Jenson Button was within three seconds of Hamilton's lap and 13th in the first practice standings . Fresh from winning in Malaysia, Vettel was best of the rest in Shanghai behind the two Mercedes drivers . To underline Mercedes' supremacy and the gap to Raikkonen, from the Finn in fourth to Force India's Nico Hulkenberg in 18th, there was a difference of just 1.5secs. Behind Mercedes and Ferrari, the best of the rest was Felipe Nasr in his Sauber, with the Brazilian rookie 1.979secs off the pace, whilst Daniel Ricciardo finished 1.996secs down for Red Bull. No other driver came within two seconds of Hamilton, with Daniil Kvyat seventh for Red Bull, followed by Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz. The Williams duo of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa completed the top 10, 2.27secs adrift and split by a mere one thousandth of a second. As for McLaren, Jenson Button was 13th and Fernando Alonso 17th, with the latter 3.128secs behind Hamilton, with even Jolyon Palmer ahead of him on his debut for Lotus. Last year's GP2 champion, serving as reserve with Lotus this season, was 15th and 2.934secs down, with highly-experienced team-mate Pastor Maldonado only 0.6secs ahead. Manor pair Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi both enjoyed plenty of track time, completing 38 laps between them. For young British rookie Stevens his 18 laps were crucial as he had so far failed to take part in either qualifying session or race in Australia and Malaysia. Stevens finished 6.346secs behind Hamilton, with Merhi bringing up the rear another 1.1secs down.","Lewis Hamilton over half-a-second clear of team-mate Nico Rosberg .

"Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves made no secret of his passion for Formula One when visited and sampled the atmosphere at the Red Bull headquarters in Milton Keynes. Reeves, who has starred in blockbusters such as the Matrix trilogy, has been pictured at Grand Prix in the past and is a self-confessed petrolhead. The 50-year-old grilled Red Bull's chief technical officer Adrian Newey - who has been a part of ten world championship wins in the past - and checked out pit stops during his time at the factory with Sky Sports F1.

Petrolhead Reeves also checked out pitstops and more at the Red Bull factory with Sky Sports . And Reeves, who is also a director, producer, musician, and author, also said that his love for the sport comes partly from its similarity to the film business. He said: The whole thing is the most impressive thing. It reminds me of telling stories or making a film. All of the different parts -  costume, cinematographer, wardrobe, all of the fuel dynamics, the power plant, body design, construction. All of these kind of teams that go to people that go to an idea that goes to a passion going towards this one event is what's impressive. 'There's something great and human about it, everyone coming together for this thing. Despite Reeves' excitement at the factory, he conseded he was 'absolutely not' the key to catching Mercedes and Ferrari this season, while he admitted he was more of a bike lover. Talking about his early love for F1, he added: 'When I was a kid it was the classic thing where you see the cars on television. Loving the shape and sound of them, then as I was older it was the racing.' Reeves sat down with Natalie Pinkham and said Formula One was similar to the film business .

"Fernando Alonso, whose youthful brilliance usurped even Michael Schumacher in the autumn of his career, considered a life beyond Formula One. This full-blooded driver, who has proved himself probably the best of his generation during 15 dazzling yet sometimes turbulent seasons, said McLaren would be his last team and that when he walks out of the paddock for ever he will barely take a backward glance. ‘I will close the loop on that part of my life,’ he said ahead of Sunday’s Chinese Grand Prix. Fernando Alonso says he will retire from Formula One once his deal with McLaren-Honda comes to an end . ‘I started with McLaren-Honda when I was three years old — a replica from my father; I will finish with McLaren-Honda, but the real one. That will be one third of my life. It will end with great experiences, great memories, great friendships, but normal life will start the day I retire. I don’t think I’ll become a driver manager or anything. After 15 or 16 or 17 years of Formula One it’s enough.’ Such are McLaren’s difficulties that Alonso may finish his career with two titles, a noble haul but fewer than his talents warrant — and fewer than anyone could have imagined when the Spaniard, then driving for Renault, denied Schumacher a record eighth crown in 2006. But Alonso, 33, is almost self-consciously happy about his lot despite leaving Ferrari to join McLaren, who are struggling for pace and reliability. Alonso left McLaren in 2007 after a bitter year but says he is glad to be back for the 2015 season . McLaren have struggled for pace - and with mechanical faults - during the first two Grand Prix of the season . ‘I was second in the championship with Ferrari three times and I didn’t want to be second for a fourth time,’ he said. ‘If they win the championship, I might have another opinion on leaving. I’ve been lucky to win championships and to win many grands prix, but now sometimes I feel happier and prouder doing the things we are doing now as a team than winning a trophy. ‘There are times when you arrive at a maturity and stage of mind that gives you different priorities in life.’ That was one of the great racers talking as he has never talked before.

"Sergio Perez fears 'a very painful year' lies ahead if Force India's roll out of their upgraded car this season proves a dud. Build-time pressure over the winter resulted in the Silverstone-based marque starting the campaign with a car that is considerably off the pace. The additional knock-on effect means a delay in the introduction of the team's B-spec model, which is now not due to be unveiled until the Austrian Grand Prix in June. Sergio Perez walks through the paddock in Shanghai ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Perez locks his brakes on his way to 10th place finish in the Australian Grand Prix in March . The hope is Perez and team-mate Nico Hulkenberg will then finally be able to compete for points finishes, rather than crossing fingers a top-10 spot comes their way via reliability issues for their rivals. If performance is lacking, however, Perez fears the worst. 'We're hoping to make a big step forward,' said Perez. 'If we make that step then we can still have a good year as there will be plenty of races remaining, a lot of time to recover. 'But if we don't make the step we're hoping for then it's going to be a very painful year.' For the team and the Mexican, who was 10th in the season-opening race in Australia - where only 15 started and 11 finished - and 13th in Malaysia recently, the current struggles are already tough to endure. Perez fears for Force India's pace and was hounded by the equally troubled McLaren duo of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in the Malaysia Grand Prix near the back of the grid . Perez finished 13th at Sepang and admits Force India are relying on their June upgrade to come good . 'It is frustrating knowing we don't have a competitive car that can take us into the points on pure pace. It's really hard,' Perez added. 'It is also really hard to keep motivated. Going into a race, knowing it is going to be very hard without any advantage, is not the easiest for a driver. 'At the moment, on pure pace, it is quite difficult to make it into the points. We're quite far from the teams ahead of us. 'We are in a position where it's very easy to make mistakes, to lose the car as it is very difficult with degradation and stuff. 'From now on we are going to have hard races, but it is what it is at the moment. We have to be professional and do the job as if we are going to win the race. 'We're going to give 100 per cent and try to be there with whatever we have, to try to get into the points before we get the new package that can hopefully get us back into the points on pure pace.'","Sergio Perez admits Force India are relying on June upgrade to improve .

"Tony McCoy gave a bumper crowd what they were hoping for as he steered Jezki to a thumping victory in the Grade One Aintree Hurdle. Having been out of luck with his opening three rides – the closest he got was third place in the Betfred Bowl on Holywell – McCoy broke his duck on the Jessica Harrington-trained gelding. His task was made a little more straightforward than it might have been, as Arctic Fire – the favourite, ridden by Ruby Walsh – took a crashing fall at the final flight when poised to challenge Jezki. AP McCoy claimed victory in the Aintree Hurdles as he rode Jezki (right) to victory after Ruby Walsh, riding Arctic Fire (left, downed), fell at the final hurdle at this year's Grand National Festival on Thursday afternoon . McCoy was eventually was able to coast to the finish with a wide margin of victory after the fall . Ominously, screens were erected around Arctic Fire, who had finished runner-up on his last in the Champion Hurdle, but, thankfully, both horse and jockey got to their feet and, upon hearing that news, McCoy was able to savour the latest big victory of his glittering career. Jezki has been a model of consistency this winter and the retiring champion feels the gelding deserved this moment in the sun, as he beat Rock On Ruby by 13 lengths. ‘I was glad to see Ruby and Arctic Fire get up,’ said McCoy, who has been besieged by autograph hunters and well-wishers all afternoon. ‘I knew it was going to be a hard race and at the second last, I thought he might have me beat but 50 yards from the last hurdle, I was sticking in there. ‘My horse is bred to stay and he won over two-and-a-half miles at Fairyhouse. Whether he could have won had Arctic Fire stood up, I don’t know. But it would have been close.’ Arctic Fire takes a tumble at the final hurdle to allow Jezki to take the lead and take the win at Aintree . Walsh and his horse escaped without serious injury, although the Irishman pulled out of his last ride . McCoy, who will ride hot favourite Shutthefrontdoor in the Crabbie’s Grand National on Saturday, said: ‘I’m just trying to keep things as normal as possible and do my job. I can leave the worrying until after I walk out of here on Saturday night. ‘I would love to win the Grand National but I don’t want it to be my final ride. I really don’t want to retire but if I win the race, I will do retirement after that. Aintree is a great place and a meeting that I have always enjoyed.’ Of his other mounts, McCoy said: ‘Hargam (well beaten in the 4-Y-O Hurdle) was disappointing but Holywell ran well.’ The soon-to-retire 40-year-old from County Antrim has promised to call it quits if he wins the Grand National .","AP McCoy claimed his first win of this year's Grand National on Thursday .

"On the eve of the County Championship season, Charlie Hemphrey has finally secured the professional cricket contract he has been striving for over the past decade. Only it is not with one of the 18 teams that make up our domestic game. For Hemphrey, a 25-year-old former Folkestone grammar school pupil who suffered habitual rejection in his attempts to breakthrough into the English system, has an amazing story to tell, after forging an unlikely first-class career in Australia. It has been an extraordinary journey for Hemphrey from a second XI debut for Kent at 15 to his recent status as the first Englishman to hit a Sheffield Shield hundred since John Hampshire for Tasmania in 1978. That feat was accomplished in Queensland's final match of the 2014-15 season, a victory over South Australia at the Gabba. Charlie Hemphrey during his Kent career (left) and as a youngster for Notts under 11s where he scored his first hundred (right) When he emigrated to Brisbane 18 months ago, he admits his desire for a shot at the top level had regressed into an 'unrealistic dream'. That it became a reality was due to polar opposite experiences to the ones he endured over here. Every time he was faced with a door it opened whereas previously they had slammed in his face. Kent, Derbyshire and Essex all knocked him back. A stunning first season down under – in which he finished third top scorer in Queensland's grade competition – was followed by a state second XI debut last October. The following month he struck 140 out of 297 all out in the first innings of a game against New South Wales. It put him in the frame for higher honours when the Shield season reopened post-Big Bash and a new year injury to Australia batsman Usman Khawaja gave him his chance. On February 7 he pulled on the maroon cap for the first time. James Pattinson dismissed him for a second-ball duck but Queensland – showing numerous changes in the wake of Stuart Law's removal as coach – crushed eventual champions Victoria by an innings. The following week Hemphrey hit 58 and Tasmania were defeated in Hobart by a similar scoreline. Two matches, two victories; the Pom had hit the jackpot. Queensland were not going to change a winning side and that very fact secured his future. Matches 5 . Innings 8 . Not Outs 0 . Runs 310 . Highest Innings Score 118 . Batting Average 38.75 . Balls Faced 809 . Batting Strike Rate 38.31 . 100s 1 . 50s 1 . 4s 37 . 6s 0 . 'The system over here guarantees you a minimum contract if you play three state games,' Hemphrey explained to Sportsmail. 'Cricket Australia upgrade you to a 12-month deal which is about $60,000 (£30,000), so after three games I told work I was leaving. I knew I was going to be paid well and the match payments on top are good at just over $4,500 (£2300).' Hemphrey immediately gave up his early morning job for Virgin at Brisbane Airport, co-ordinating their aircraft loads out on the ramps in sweltering heat. A fortnight later, in his fifth appearance for Queensland, he struck 118 on his adopted home ground. The celebratory removal of his helmet and glance to the heavens at reaching three figures an acknowledgement of his late Belgian grandfather Jim Charlier, who while not a cricket aficionado had witnessed his lowest ebb six years earlier when he made 163 for Kent seconds against MCC Young Cricketers. 'I am not really an extrovert, I keep my emotions fairly intact but what happened when I was released from Kent came back to me. A week after basically being told that I wasn't good enough my granddad came to watch and it was great afterwards listening to him talk about how I'd played from his non-cricket perspective,' Hemphrey explained. 'He passed away last year and so when I got to 100 I looked up and thought about him. I knew how proud he would have been. To me, scoring a first-class hundred in Australia is quite something but he taught me a lot about life, and I have to say I was a lot more nervous when I stood up to speak at his funeral than I was when I was on 97.' Although raised in Kent, Hemphrey was born in Doncaster and Geoffrey Boycott, arguably the greatest Yorkshire batsman of them all, would have doffed his cap at the price he places on his wicket. According to Hemphrey, a combination of leaving outside off-stump and playing the ball late is his modus operandi. 'The one thing I have learned over here is that the best time to bat is in the second half of the day, so getting through the first half has been important. Then I have cashed in.' Hemphrey's rise is all the more remarkable given that the three counties in his first incarnation as a cricketer were at least as interested in his off-spin (he has not bowled this past winter due to a labral tear in his shoulder). At Canterbury, it meant the presence of James Tredwell blocked his path. Although the three South Africans and two Pakistanis in a Kent side that made consecutive Twenty20 finals days in 2008 and 2009, when he held two summer contracts, were probably more to blame for his lack of opportunities. 'The club had other priorities, there was little focus on the second XI,' he says. In contrast, his performances were catching the eyes of Justin Sterns and Trevor Hohns - state coach and convenor of selectors respectively - not long after Australia Twenty20 international Chris Lynn, with whom a friendship developed during a previous three-year stint in Queensland grade cricket, lured him to Toombul. Naturally, there is a tinge of bitterness that his break has come on the other side of the globe: 'I just feel that you can't decide someone's career at the age of 19. It's too early. Different people develop at different rates. Look at Ryan Harris, Nathan Lyon, Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen. Those four all hit their prime in their late twenties.' Not that he completely rules out a return: 'I don't want to close any doors. I am open to anything and at the end of the day cricket is a very short career in the grad scheme of things.' But for now he is running with the Bulls as English cricket's unsung export.","Charlie Hemphrey fulfilled an 'unrealistic dream' to become a first-class cricketer .

"In a maneuver with ominous echoes of the Cold War, a Russian fighter jet 'aggressively' intercepted an American plane over Poland, the Pentagon claims. Filing an official complaint to Russia, the State Department alleges a U.S. RC-135U reconnaissance aircraft was flying near the Baltic Sea in international airspace when a Russian SU-27 Flanker cut into its path. Pentagon officials have slammed the move as 'unprofessional' and 'unsafe'. A Russian jet 'aggressively' intercepted a U.S. RC-135U plane (pictured) over Poland, the Pentagon claims . Spokesman Mark Wright told CNN the Russian jet performed 'aggressive maneuvers' at high speed in close proximity to the plane. He added that the State Department will consequently be filing a complaint to Russia 'through diplomatic channels'. Russia has rubbished claims it was a deliberate and aggressive interception. State news agency Sputnik reported that the jet was circling the plane to determine its tail number, as its transponder was switched off. The Russian SU-27 Flanker 'aggressively' cut into the American plane's path, the spokesman stated . The Pentagon and the U.S. European Command have dismissed the account. The incident occurred almost exactly a year after Pentagon officials accused a Russian fighter jet of purposely flying 100 feet in front of the nose of an American spy plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan.

"Steven Finn believes pace does not matter in his quest to break back into England's Test squad. The Middlesex seamer admitted he finds it 'baffling' he faces criticism for not hitting the highly-prized 90mph mark, vowing to chase an England recall despite missing the West Indies tour. The 26-year-old was one of the few pluses of a dismal World Cup run, and is now intent on forcing his way into the reckoning for next summer's Test challenges against New Zealand and Australia. Finn, pictured at the Middlesex photo call ahead of the county season, has vowed to regain his England place . Finn hit back at those critics who say he should be hitting the 90mph mark with his bowling . 'The frustrating thing is that I've never been somebody who bowls 90 miles an hour for a whole day of cricket, that's simply never happened in my career,' said Finn. 'So it's frustrating when people say 'you've lost pace, you've lost this, you've lost that' when I haven't. 'Maybe I bowled the odd spell up above 90 that I'm working back towards, but consistently my paces have been the same as they have in the past. 'But because there are other bowlers in the world who are bowling 95 miles an hour consistently, it's like we're searching for that, and it's almost falling on my head. 'It's as though people are saying 'you're the guy who's done it for a few spells, so why aren't you doing it all the time?'. 'So it's frustrating that people keep talking about that, because if you're taking wickets, why does it matter if you're bowling 87 or 93 miles an hour. Finn celebrates a wicket during England's World Cup win over Scotland back in February . Finn, seen after taking five wickets in England's World Cup warm-up over India, was a high point of the tour . 'What does it matter? You're taking wickets. 'So that to me is baffling and it's silly to me, I find it stupid, but each to their own. 'Yes there might be a couple of extra miles an hour in there, as I've always been searching for. 'Ever since I was 20 and came into international cricket I've always been looking at how I am going to get better and make myself a member of the England team who is hard to be left out. 'And that's what I'm working back towards, and I certainly feel I'm on the way.' Watford-born Finn was sent home midway through England's disastrous Ashes tour that ended in 5-0 defeat early last year. The pace bowler wrestled with his action for months, but has since hit back to form, and is now confident he can reach new heights and resurrect his Test career. Coach Peter Moores overlooked Finn for the current three-Test West Indies tour, but has told the Middlesex star he remains in England's plans. Finn fixes the hair of team-mate Tim Murtagh as Middlesex posed for their traditional pre-season photograph . Finn shares a joke with Neil Dexter as the team convened at Lord's ahead of the new county campaign . 'I've been told I'm doing nothing wrong, but obviously to be left out of a tour obviously I am doing something wrong,' said Finn. 'So again, all I can do, and this is what they said to me, is to go and take wickets, enjoy playing for Middlesex, and 'you're very much in our thoughts'. 'It's reassuring for me to know that I've not been totally discarded as England cricketer because that would frustrate me and anger me deeply because I still feel I've got something to give to English cricket. 'I'm moving in the right direction, I feel like I'm there and that I can compete in international cricket, because I did this winter. 'And it's just about finding that extra little bit that's going to turn me from being a fringe player into someone who's in the team. 'That's where I was a couple of years ago, I'm not saying I'm looking to the past: I don't want to be the bowler I used to be, I want to be the bowler that I can be. 'And if I do that I think I've got a very good chance of being involved with England.'","Finn says it is 'baffling' he faces criticism for not hitting 90mph mark .

"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted of the 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon. A federal jury found Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday over the terror attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260. He kept his hands folded in front of him and looked down at the defence table in the Boston courtroom as the guilty verdicts were read. A sketch shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (second left) and his defence team as the guilty verdicts on all charges against him were read on Wednesday. The jury will now decide if he gets the death penalty . Boston Police patrol the outside the John J Moakley Federal Courthouse after the jury verdict . The jury will now decide whether the 21-year-old former student should be sentenced to death or receive life in prison. Tsarnaev's conviction was widely expected, given his lawyer's startling admission during opening statements that he took part in the bombing. But the lawyer also argued that Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, masterminded the attack and enlisted his then-19-year-old brother to help. On April 19, 2013, Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat and had written notes inside suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries . Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as full partners in a plan to retaliate against the US for its wars in Muslim countries. The court will likely meet early next week to resume the penalty phase. Families of the victims were also present to hear the verdict but there was no celebration after each 'guilty' was read and jury members were similarly somber. COUNT 1: GUILTY .

"Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez will trigger a contract extension at Newcastle should he start the remaining seven matches of the campaign. The 31-year-old was the only United player to emerge with any credit in the wake of last weekend’s 1-0 defeat at Sunderland. It was Gutierrez’s first start for the Magpies in 20 months having twice beaten testicular cancer. The Argentine has said he will never forgive Newcastle for their handling of his illness after he was told to find a new club when he first returned from treatment in December, 2013. Jonas Gutierrez (left) will trigger contract extension  should he start the remaining seven matches . Gutierrez and Sebastian Larsson compete for the ball during the Wear-Tyne derby . But the midfielder is one of the very few players currently respected by a disgruntled fanbase who are threatening to boycott the next home match against Spurs. Before then Gutierrez is in line to start at Liverpool on Monday night, meaning he will be one game closer to winning a new contract at St James’ Park. The club’s hierarchy are unlikely to want to keep Gutierrez on their books next season, although head coach John Carver insists he will not be swayed by contract clauses when it comes to picking his strongest team. Adam Johnson  shakes hands with Gutierrez after the match between Sunderland and Newcastle . ‘I'm unaware of it (the clause),’ he said. ‘I like it that way as I make my judgement during the week on the training ground. ‘I pick a team on what I think will be the best team on the pitch. Sometimes you can get distracted. That (the clause) will not be in my mind.’ Gutierrez was the only Newcastle player to win applause from the club’s fans following the fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby defeat. Carver made a point of praising him afterwards and admits his recovery and return to top-flight action has come as a welcome surprise. Gutierrez shakes hands with current Newcastle United boss John Carver ahead of the Manchester United tie . ‘Everybody is delighted with how he has come back in and how he has progressed,’ said Carver. ‘He's fought and worked hard and done all the right things. ‘I don't think he ever thought he'd be playing as soon as he has done. I don't even think he thought he'd play again when you have an illness like Jonas had. ‘It must have been a proud moment for him, and for us as well, it was great to see him back out there.’ Ryan Giggs competes with Gutierrez during the match between Manchester United and Newcastle in 2011 .

"Tim Sherwood has warned Tottenham Hotspur to keep pace with Harry Kane’s rapid rise or the England striker might one day be too big for the club. On the eve of taking Aston Villa to White Hart Lane, Sherwood insisted his former club must improve at a similar rate or risk losing their academy star. Kane was handed his first Premier League start for Spurs by Sherwood 12 months ago and has taken the top-flight by storm this season, scoring 29 goals in all competitions. He penned a new five-and-a-half year contract at Spurs in February before scoring 78 seconds into his England debut last month. Tim Sherwood believes Tottenham need to keep pace with Harry Kane's progression or risk losing him . Kane has scored 29 goals so far this season and also netted on his England debut in March . Villa striker Christian Benteke scored a hat trick in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday . ‘I wouldn’t want to put a price on him, they wouldn’t want to sell,’ said Sherwood. ‘He’d be a commodity now for the club, he has earned that right through his performances this season. ‘He needs to continue to do that for a number of seasons and perhaps he will be outgrowing that football club. ‘Not at the moment, he has a long way to go before he outgrows a club the size of Tottenham. For their sake they need to keep hold of him. ‘I have communicated with him since I’ve left, just to wish him well when he’s played for England and congratulate him on his call-ups.’ Sherwood joked that he would be the first to try to tempt Kane away from Spurs by bidding in the summer but said the form of Christian Benteke and Gabby Agbonlahor would keep out the 21-year-old. ‘With Christian banging the goals in and Gabby playing like he is I haven’t got room for Harry!’ he laughed. Benteke has scored seven goals in his last five games and has a decision to make on his future once the season is over. Two years ago he handed in a transfer request to try to get a move to Tottenham and Sherwood admitted there was interest. He said it would be his dream to partner Benteke and Kane together. ‘I’d want them both,’ he said when asked which striker he would choose. Sherwood also praised the form of Benteke's strike partner, Gabriel Agbonlahor (right) Sherwood believes Benteke's upturn in form is a result of improved service for the Belgium striker . Benteke will look to continue his scoring form for Villa when they take on Tottenham and Kane on Saturday . Sherwood said Benteke’s improved form, having only scored three times before Villa sacked Paul Lambert, was down to the medicine of greater service. ‘Do you think he was starved of service? It’s like a little bit of medicine. If people keep throwing it down your throat all of a sudden you feel better and you feel more about yourself and that’s where I think he is now. ‘He knows if he gets chances he’ll score. He’s just proved that. He’s a prolific goalscorer, he’s a one in two striker.’","Harry Kane has 29 goals for Tottenham this season and played for England .

"Defiant Stuart McCall on Thursday night urged Rangers to show an immediate response to the first defeat of his tenure and maintain belief in their promotion push. The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston as Derek Lyle, Gavin Reilly and a Lee Wallace own goal gave Queen of the South’s play-off hopes a massive boost. But McCall is adamant that confidence will not be dented by the scale of the loss and he expects his players to bounce back in Sunday’s home meeting with Raith Rovers. Stuart McCall  urged Rangers to show an immediate response to the first defeat of his tenure . The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston . ‘We’ve already spoken about going into the play-offs with good momentum,’ said McCall. ‘Tonight is a set-back but we’ve got to make sure on Sunday that we don’t have another set-back or then it can become a problem. ‘We will be fully focused on Sunday and we will be looking for the three points. ‘There will be no confidence factor come Sunday — I can assure you of that. Sometimes you get beat and you just have to hold your hands up and give credit to the opposition. ‘I was pleased with certain things leading up to their first goal. I thought we were doing well. ‘I said to the lads that we will put a line under it. Yeah, we know we weren’t good tonight but we will be good on Sunday.’ Rangers remain third in the table — behind Hibernian on goal difference but with a game in hand — after what was their biggest-ever loss to Queens. ‘Fair play to them,’ said McCall, who expects Cammy Bell to be fit to face Raith after a minor knee injury. ‘They were clinical when they had their chances. New manager McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park . Lewis Kidd celebrates after doubling Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half . ‘We controlled large parts of the first half but they got a lot of good blocks in. It’s about scoring goals and they got the first one. ‘Then we lost a goal that was really poor defending straight from the kick-off. Then you are chasing the game and that suited them with their pace on the counter attack. ‘We had some chances in the second half but we never really did enough. We weren’t good enough to win the game but we move on. ‘I’ve said it before and I will say it again, there will be ups and downs between now and the end of the season. It’s how we react to it, and Sunday can’ t come quickly enough for me.’ Jubilant Queen of the South boss James Fowler was thrilled with a result that saw his team leapfrog Falkirk into that crucial fourth place in the Championship standings. ‘We were backs to the wall a wee bit in the first half,’ admitted Fowler. ‘But we managed to cope with that. We got the goal and then getting another one so early in the second half was great. ‘All the players were great and we are pushing hard.’","Rangers lost 3-0 against Queen of the South on Thursday night .

"For the last few years the self-styled biggest club in the world, Manchester United, have not even appeared the biggest club on their home patch. The ‘noisy neighbours’ of Manchester City have spent more and won more. And the Sir Alex Ferguson factor vanished from Old Trafford when he retired in 2013. In fact the last time United won a derby at home was in 2011 when Wayne Rooney’s late spectacular acrobatic goal earned them a 2-1 victory. Wayne Rooney scored a spectacular overhead kick as Manchester United beat Manchester City 2-1 in 2011 . United sit above  City in the Premier League table for the first time in 16 months after having played the same amount of matches - following the latest round of results . Rooney (centre) scored a stunning half-volley as  United beat Aston Villa 3-1 on April 4 . Meanwhile City players look crestfallen during their 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace on Easter Monday night . But there has been a sudden and surprising shift this season. United have forced their way above City in the Premier League table for the first time since November 2013, and should Louis van Gaal’s red-hot team beat their suddenly-fragile rivals on Sunday afternoon, they will move four points clear of the defending champions. For many, then, the natural balance of power will have been restored. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is no longer trying to hide the collapse of his side’s season, which has seen them slip to fourth and make an early exit from three cup competitions, including the coveted Champions League. Having defended his side earlier following losses at Burnley and Crystal Palace, the Chilean has decided to be more candid ahead of the derby. ‘It has not been a good season, definitely not a good season,’ he said. ‘It was not so bad until the end of 2014, we were top of the table and still in the Champions League. But in the last three months, we have thrown it into the garbage, all that we did earlier. We are doing some things very badly, that’s why we must improve.’ Admitting there is a problem is always the first step to recovery but Pellegrini, who has won his last three games against United, appears a little less sure about how to fix it. City boss Manuel Pellegrini has branded the last three months of their season as 'garbage' due to poor form . The Chilean (left) cut a frustrated figure during City's 2-1 defeat at Palace on Easter Monday night . His players have been derided as an ageing first-team squad. Fifteen of them are 29 or over, including captain Vincent Kompany, who is experiencing his worst season at City. But Pellegrini will not go along with such a theory, saying defensively: ‘I don’t think the best players at the end can suddenly grow old in three months.’ Nonetheless, he clearly believes City must flex their financial muscles again to replenish the squad, just as they did in 2008 when the new Abu Dhabi owners broke the British transfer record within 24 hours of their arrival to sign Robinho for £32.5million. Since then, they have spent £500m on transfer fees. ‘I will try to continue being noisy,’ said the Chilean, referring to Ferguson’s famous quote about City in 2010. ‘All the big teams spend a lot of money, always. People just talk about it when it’s City.’ The problem for Pellegrini is that United are back in the game, competing for the top players following a brief post-Fergie wobble. United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who has overall responsibility for the budget, is determined his club will not be bullied out of deals as they were when City beat them to Samir Nasri, from Arsenal. Pellegrini wants City to flex their financial muscle in this summer's transfer market to bolster their squad . City pipped rivals United to the signing of Samir Nasri (right) from Arsenal in August 2011 . Van Gaal, after five consecutive Premier League wins, is equally bullish, declaring: ‘I don’t have any doubt that players are coming to Manchester United.’ Negotiations for Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels and Ilkay Gundogan are understood to be under way but the acid test will be for Juventus and France star Paul Pogba, 22, rated the best young midfield player in Europe and coveted by United and City. Both will throw money and the promise of titles at £60m Pogba, who began his career at Old Trafford but was allowed to leave for Serie A after a rare error of judgment by Ferguson. City say there are mitigating factors why they are a point behind United. David Silva thinks United’s absence from the Champions League has helped them. ‘It doesn’t surprise me United are doing well, they have had the advantage of only having the Premier League to play for, just as Liverpool did last season,’ said the Spaniard. ‘It will be a hard game for us but we can definitely win.’ The future of Pellegrini will come under huge scrutiny if he loses this match. He has been given some comfort by Van Gaal, who dismisses City’s last result, a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace, as a virtual fluke. Ilkay Gundogan (right) anchors Borussia Dortmund's midfield and could be brought by United in the summer . Mats Hummels (left) looks likely to join United this summer to strengthen their porous rearguard . Juventus' £60million-rated midfielder Paul Pogba is also a summer target for United and their rivals City . ‘I saw the game, watching on TV at home with a cup of coffee. Crystal Palace went 2-0 ahead but you could not imagine it was a 2-0 game,’ said the United manager. ‘We have also played these kind of matches. The opponents crossed the halfway line three times and they scored two goals but that’s football, and more so in England than in other countries. ‘Manchester City were unlucky and, of course, confidence is a big thing in football. But Sunday is another game, a special game and it shall not influence a lot.’ Rooney’s brilliant winner against City in 2011 was voted the best Premier League goal of all-time. The United captain still regards it as his favourite. ‘It was my best goal because of the importance of it. We won the game and soon after we won the title,’ he said. Should United win on Sunday, their supporters will dare to dream of such moments again. But if City can upset the odds and prove they are still a major force to be reckoned with, the noise will reverberate around Europe - and even reach Pogba. United manager Louis van Gaal believes City's defeat at Crystal Palace won't influence Sunday's derby . Expected team line-ups for the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon . So far Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has a 100 per cent record against United since he succeeded Roberto Mancini. Manchester City 4-1 Manchester United, September 2013 . Sergio Aguero scored twice as Pellegrini celebrated victory in his first Manchester derby while another managerial debutant, David Moyes, watched his United side taken apart.

"Palermo defender Roberto Vitiello hopes the Sicilian outfit can improve its dismal form on the road starting on Sunday at Udinese. The Islanders have not tasted victory away from home since November 2 when they won 2-0 at AC Milan. Mired in a three-game losing streak following last weekend's 2-1 defeat at home to Milan, Palermo are in 11th place and feeling a sense of urgency to turn things around. Roberto Vitiello (left) feels his side need to start winning away from home and ending their poor record . 'We need to keep working hard in order to defend our Serie A status as soon as possible,' Vitiello said to the Italian press. 'We are disappointed not to have collected anything from our last three league games. 'But we must bounce back. Sunday's game at Udinese is important and we will give our all to clinch our second win on the road this season in Friuli.' Palermo, coached by Giuseppe Iachini, have picked up just two points in their last six league games. Udinese are 13th in the standings and one point adrift of Palermo. Mattia Destro (right) fights for the ball with Vitiello during the Italian Serie A football match Palermo vs Milan . After falling victim to bottom-side Parma in midweek, the Friuli side are vulnerable in their own stadium. Udinese have not won in their last four games and coach Andrea Stramaccioni is desperate for a positive reaction from his players. 'Against Parma, we had the wrong approach to the game,' he said. 'My players underestimated Parma and we paid the price. 'We lacked determination and didn't take a shot on goal. 'Now we must turn the page immediately and show against Palermo, the real Udinese.' Udinese were beaten by bottom-side Udinese last time out as they slip closer to the relegation zone . Udinese have struggled to deliver at home and have mustered just one win in their last nine games at Friuli stadium. The hosts must overcome the absence of defender Ivan Piris and midfielder Giampiero Pinzi, both serving a one-match ban. Palermo are without midfielder Edgar Barreto, who is sidelined for three weeks with a muscular injury. Argentinian forward Paulo Dybala, who is Palermo's top scorer with 13 goals, will lead the Rossaneri's attack on Sunday with Franco Vazquez playing in support. Highly-coveted forward Paulo Dybala will lead the line for Palermo as they look to pick up three points .","Palermo defender Roberto Vitiello must improve their poor away record .

"There was poetic symmetry in Glenn Murray's humbling of Vincent Kompany at Selhurst Park on Monday night. Ten years ago this month, the Crystal Palace striker humiliated another of the world's best defenders, World Cup and Champions League winner Gerard Pique. Sure, Pique was just 18 at the time and playing for Manchester United's reserves but he, like Kompany, is all too aware of Murray's talents after the Cumbrian scored a hat-trick against him in Carlisle colours. Glenn Murray jumps for joy after putting Crystal Palace 1-0 up against Manchester City on Monday night . Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique once conceded three against Murray in a reserve match in 2005 . Their careers have taken wholly different paths in the last decade but after a man-of-the-match display which all but ended the Premier League champions' title defence in a match viewed by millions around the world, Murray now gets a little taste of the limelight that Pique has basked in at Barcelona for years. His poachers' effort on Monday was his fifth goal in his last five games. Murray now boasts the fifth-best goals-per-minute ratio in Europe's top five leagues. He may lack pace but Murray's speed of thought is rapid and you will struggle to find a frontman in the land with a better ability to win the ball in the air, bring others in to play and generally unsettle defenders. Just look at how troubled the vastly experienced and physically powerfully Manchester City pair of Kompany and Martin Demichelis were on Monday night. Much of Murray's success comes from his cunning, a nous to win duels and subtly influence referees no doubt enhanced by years playing at the lower levels. Murray holds off a challenge from Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany . Kompany looks inconsolable at the end of the game after Manchester City were beaten 2-1 . And we're not just talking Leagues One and Two here, where Murray first began to shine with Rochdale and Brighton. Before then he had turned out in non-league for Workington, Barrow, Carlisle and even had a spell at Wilmington Hammerheads in America’s third tier. Footballers just don't take that sort of path to the top anymore, but there is no doubt Murray, now 31, deserves his chance. His telepathic understanding with flying wingers Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie brought him 30 goals in 2012-13 and with it Crystal Palace's promotion. Cruelly, he ruptured his cruciate knee ligament in the play-off semi-final victory over Brighton that year and missed the majority of last season recovering. He had notched up 14 appearances by the end of the campaign, mostly off the bench, but looked a shadow of his former self under Tony Pulis, with the exception of a typically bullying display in Liverpool's famous implosion at Selhurst last May. Murray celebrates scoring at Old Trafford as Palace beat Manchester United in December 2011 . Murray scores against Manchester City for Brighton in the League Cup back in September 2008 . Despite his rugged style Murray, like most players, needs a proverbial arm around the shoulder to produce his best - something Alan Pardew has undoubtedly afforded him and that Neil Warnock before him emphatically failed to do. Pardew's predecessor shipped Murray out on loan to Reading to make room in his squad for Kevin Doyle, a striker who had scored just three goals in 23 games in League One for Wolves the season before. How foolish that move looks now. Pardew, in contrast, immediately reinstalled Murray in the Palace side and gave him a new contract to the end of next season when he took over in January. His faith has been rewarded with a rich vein of goalscoring form that gives Murray the best goals-per-minute ratio of anyone in the Premier League. Murray wheels away to celebrate as City's defenders appeal in vain for offside . The Cumbrian striker signed a new contract for Crystal Palace back in January . Only four players in Europe have a better ratio than Murray – though he has some way to go to catch Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. One thing is for sure though, Kompany will certainly be glad to see the back of him, as was Pique 10 years ago.","Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night .

"Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti is facing a midfield selection conundrum for Wednesday's La Liga match across town at Rayo Vallecano as the European champions look to keep up the pressure on leaders Barcelona. Second-placed Real, who hammered Granada 9-1 on Sunday with Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo netting his first five-goal haul, are four points behind Barca, who host Almeria earlier on Wednesday, with nine games left. Barring last-minute injuries, Ancelotti will have both Isco and James Rodriguez available for the first time in two months since James broke a bone in his foot and must decide which of the two playmakers joins Toni Kroos and Luka Modric across the centre. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti faces a selection dilemma ahead of Wednesday's match with Rayo . Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in Real Madrid's 9-1 rout of Granada on Sunday . Ronaldo's five-star performance is hailed in the Monday edition of the Spanish sports daily AS . 'The man in the bag' ran the headline on the front cover of Monday's edition of Marca . Real Madrid are four points behind Barcelona in the race for the La Liga title . Isco, a Spain international who was suspended for the Granada game, performed well first during Modric's lengthy injury lay-off and then during the absence of James and has become a huge favourite with the Real fans. Ancelotti, by contrast, has been whistled by some sections of the Bernabeu crowd as Real stumbled since the turn of the year and if he drops Isco and the team stutter again the Italian could be in for a torrid time. James returned to action against Granada and Ancelotti praised him after the game, suggesting he favours the Colombian, who joined from Monaco for a fee of £63m in the close season. James Rodriguez returned to the Real Madrid team during the match with Granada after two months out . Isco (left), seen here with Luka Modric in training last week, is also set to return to action soon . 'He played very well, it didn't look as though he hadn't played for two months,' Ancelotti said. 'He showed his quality, his intensity and his ability to keep possession. He is a very direct player and always shows great vision and awareness.' After edging Celta Vigo 1-0 on Sunday, Barca will be looking for a more convincing performance at home to struggling Almeria, who sacked coach Juan Ignacio Martinez after Saturday's 4-1 home defeat by Levante. Barca's Argentina forward Lionel Messi, in particular, will be keen to get back among the goals after failing to score in his last three outings in all competitions. Ronaldo leapfrogged Messi to the top of La Liga's scoring chart with Sunday's five and has 36, with Messi, who holds the record for a single season of 50, on 32. Lionel Messi will be hoping to return to scoring form when Barcelona play Almeria on Wednesday .

"Manchester City's grip on the Barclays Premier League title was loosened further after a controversial Glenn Murray goal put Crystal Palace on the way to a 2-1 victory. Murray fired Palace ahead in the first half, despite both he and Scott Dann appearing to be offside, and Jason Puncheon crashed in a superb second to deal what looks to be a fatal blow to City's already slim hopes of retaining their crown. The fading champions pulled one back through Yaya Toure but are now nine points adrift of leaders Chelsea, having slipped to fourth place. Crystal Palace striker Glenn Murray (left) celebrates after opening the scoring against Manchester City . Crystal Palace (4-1-4-1) Julian Speroni 7 . Made two good saves of David Silva efforts in the first half and marshalled his defence well. Joel Ward 6 . Has not been out of team all season, made his 100th appearance last night and was reliable as always. Scott Dann 6.5 . Phil Neville thinks he’s up there with the best centre backs in the division. Certainly underrated on the evidence of this game, he made a few vital interceptions and played part in the goal. Manchester City appealed for offside but Murray's first-half goal stood on Monday night . Damien Delaney 6 . Picked up a booking for cutting down Aguero but otherwise solid. Martin Kelly 6 . A lovely low ball into the penalty area in the second minute to almost set up a Palace goal if Zaha could have converted. Joe Ledley 6.5 . Put his body on the line to resist a City onslaught in the first half. James McArthur 8 . A superb, full hearted performance by the midfielder who made several vital clearances. Joe Hart appeals to the officials as Murray celebrates after putting Palace ahead . Wilfried Zaha 6.5 . Should have put Palace ahead in the second minute but sliced shot high and wide of the target . Yannick Bolasie 6 . Might not be renowned for his defending but made an excellent first half tackle on Yaya Toure when the midfielder looked ominous . Jason Puncheon 7.5 . His curling free kick to double Palace’s lead was superb, worked tirelessly and made an important first half tackle on Toure. Glenn Murray 8.5 . Against the run of play does not do justice to his 35th minute tap in but it was his fifth in as many games and he was a constant threat in the air, too. Very lucky to get away with a blatant handball. Subs . Sanogo 83, Souare 84 and Gayle 88 . Manager . Alan Pardew 8 .

Manchester City (4-4-2) Joe Hart 6 . Was tested just once in the opening half . Bacary Sagna 6.5 . Right back 300th premier league appearance . Vincent Kompany 6 . Seemed distracted by feelings of injustice after the Palace goal which he deemed to be offside . City striker Sergio Aguero could not find a way through a steadfast Palace defence . Martin Demichelis 6 . Rightly booked for a hefty challenge on Glenn Murray . Gael Clichy 5.5 . He and Sagna struggled to deal with the pace of Bolasie and Zaha and offered little in attack. Jesus Navas 5 . Another game where too many of his passes routinely went astray and replaced by Nasri before the Toure goal. Will have to reassess his pre-match comment that City were still title contenders. Fernandinho 6 . Made a senseless and unnecessary challenge on Glenn Murray to give away the free kick which led to the second goal. City midfielder Fernandinho failed to sparkle at Selhurst Park . Yaya Toure 7 . Was quiet in the opening half and twice prompted wolf whistles with his shots high into the stands at Selhurst Park but his goal was an absolute scorcher. David Silva 7.5 . City’s best man, hungry for the ball and characteristically intelligent passing. Forced a couple of saves from Speroni in the first half. Edin Dzeko 5 . A quiet game for the striker who seemed furious at his manager at being replaced by Lampard after 66 minutes but surely he could have no complaints? The pressure is mounting on Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini . Sergio Aguero 6 . Expert at finding space in a crowded penalty box and hit the post in the first half, just could not find a way through a steadfast Palace defence. Subs . Lampard 66 - 5.5, Nasri 77 and Milner 88. Manager . Manuel Pellegrini 5 . Manchester’s premier home removal firms might look to clear some space in their diary around the end of May because surely his time at the Etihad is limited. Referee . Michael Oliver 5.5 . A mixed game for the youngest referee in the Barclay’s Premier League. He does not lack cojones, backing up his linesman who was probably right to rule Scott Dann and Glenn Murray onside for the goal and dealt well with the excessive protestations of City players. But he missed an obvious Glenn Murray handball in the second half.

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is braced for a ferocious derby clash at Old Trafford this weekend. The fading Barclays Premier League champions take on Manchester United on Sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch-rivals in the table. For most of the season City, if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences, at least seemed destined for a top-two finish. Manuel Pellegrini is relishing the prospect of taking on Manchester United with Manchester City on Sunday . David Silva (centre) leaves the pitch looking despondent after City's 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday . Sergio Aguero (centre) is blocked out by Damien Delaney (left) and James McArthur of Palace . That is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while United, ordinary for much of the campaign, appear to have clicked into gear in the last month. With just a point separating them in third and fourth, the stage is set for a battle of high intensity. Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the Premier League every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city. Both teams want to win. 'It is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game, not only intensity is better but quality. 'Both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so I hope (for a good game for) the fans, for whom you play, and after that I hope we can win.' City have held the edge over United in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend. A win would also see them become the first club to beat United five times in a row in the Premier League. United had the last laugh over City after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights. Pellegrini said: 'I think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but I think we dominated also the Premier League. It is not easy for a team. 'In the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up. This year we have been runner-up the whole year. 'We have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay, but I think for them, they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years.' City are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the Crystal Palace side that frustrated them last Monday. Louis van Gaal's United have been fluid of late, winning impressively against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa to take their run of victories to five. Facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit City but Pellegrini is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at Palace and Burnley. The Chilean said: 'You never know but I don't think it will be easy. It will be different. 'United are a big team that like to play - especially with Van Gaal. He's always an attacking manager. We hope we will see a good game. 'We have a different problem, we have to make sure we don't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players.' Despite a wretched run of just four league wins in 11 games since pulling level at the top with Chelsea on New Year's Day, Pellegrini maintains all possibilities remain open to his side. City boss Pellegrini remains positive about City's achievements this season despite dropping down to fourth . Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday . 'I never think in a negative way,' said the 61-year-old, who will await the outcome of a fitness test on captain Vincent Kompany's hamstring injury. 'I don't think of one, two or three points difference when you have to play seven games. 'When you have mathematical options in football you must never give up and always believe you can do it.'","Manchester City are in fourth, a point behind rivals Manchester United .

"Manchester United defender Chris Smalling took a trip down memory lane as the 25-year-old went back to his old judo club. Photos of the visit, during which he presented some members with replica United jerseys, were posted on the International Judo Federation's official Twitter account alongside a flashback picture of Smalling as a youngster. The England international, who only made the decision to join the social networking site on Friday, excelled at the martial art as a teen and was even named national champion for his age group, before football took precedence at 15.

Smalling began his footballing career with minnows Maidstone United in Kent, before a string of impressive performances saw him snapped up by then Premier League side Fulham in 2008. After only a handful appearances for the Cottagers, his talent was clear and Smalling signed for Manchester United one year later. It has been a remarkable rise for the former Chatham Grammar School student, who if football had not worked out, was set to study Business Management at Loughborough University, having gained a decent set of A-Levels.

"Late goals, a famous overhead kick and a rare Paul Scholes header are all included in Wayne Rooney's top five derby days moments ahead of Sunday's crucial clash. The two sides are locked in a battle with Arsenal for the second automatic Champions League qualification place and neither side know that a defeat could see them slip out of contention. Listed on his website, the Manchester United striker spoke about his most memorable moments, which included FOUR stoppage time winners. Wayne Rooney (right) has listed his five most memorable moments of the Manchester derby . 1) Manchester United 2-1 Manchester City, February 2011, Rooney overhead kick . Sir Alex Ferguson's side recorded a crucial win over their city rivals in the race for the Premier League back in 2011,and Rooney's spectacular overhead kick cemented his place in United folklore when it flew into the top corner past the helpless Joe Hart. The England striker couldn't quite believe that had happened at full-time: 'It was a massive game for both teams and to score in that way was something I will never forget, the feeling was unbelievable. 'I knew Nani was going to cross it so I was getting ready for an header, then it took a little deflection and come behind me, I never really had time to think and just tried the overhead and thankfully it went in the top corner.' The England captain scored a spectacular overhead kick to win the derby and keep their title hopes alive . 2) Manchester United 4-3 Manchester City, September 2009, Michael Owen 96 minute winner . In a ding-dong game at Old Trafford, Craig Bellamy scored a late equaliser for the visitors, as the home fans fell silent but with virtually the last kick of the game, Ryan Giggs found Michael Owen, who slotted home past the on-rushing Shay Given. Rooney says it's a game he'll never forget: 'It was end to end for a lot of the game and when Craig Bellamy equalised in the 90th minute everyone thought that was it, so when Michael Owen scored in the last few seconds it was an unbelievable moment for both Michael and the team and it's certainly a moment I will never forget.' Michael Owen (right) scored a 96 minute winner not long after Craig Bellamy had equalised for the visitors . 3) Manchester United 3-1 Manchester City, January 2010, Rooney sends his side to Wembley . Former United striker Carlos Tevez looked like he'd sent the Carling Cup semi-final into extra-time after cancelling out goals from Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick, but Rooney had other ideas, when he headed home a stoppage time goal and send his side to Wembley. Rooney said: 'To score the decisive goal late on in any game is a special feeling for any player, but to do it in a derby and to send your team into a final makes it even better.' Rooney scored a stoppage time winner to send United through to the Carling Cup final at Wembley . 4) Manchester City 0-1 Manchester United, April 2010, Scholes heads home last-gasp goal . The midfield maestro's rare header was the third stoppage time goal United had scored against their rivals in that season, as they kept their title hopes alive in a game they couldn't afford to slip-up, which is why Rooney ranks this goal as one of the most important. He said: 'Paul Scholes's header was vital for us that season and kept us in the title race. At that stage of the season every game is massive, especially when you need to win, so for something like that to happen just when you think the game is coming to an end is incredible.' Paul Scholes headed home an injury time to keep his side in the hunt for the Premier League title . 5) Manchester City 2-3 Manchester United, December 2012, Van Persie stoppage time free-kick . United's big signing of the season, Robin van Persie, proved his worth when he fired home a free-kick from the edge of the box for another stoppage time winner, putting Rooney and co six points clear at the top of the Premier League table. 'This was a massive game, they came to Old Trafford as the champions, said Rooney. 'So for Robin to score the winner late on and take us 6 points clear at the top of the table was very important'. Robin van Persie's deflected free-kick put United six points clear at the top on their to winning the league .","Wayne Rooney listed his five most memorable moments of the derby .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has praised the resurrection of Marouane Fellaini as the big Belgian prepares to play in the fixture that marked the low point of his Old Trafford career 12 months ago. On March 25 last year, Fellaini was jeered by both City and United fans as he was substituted in a 3-0 United defeat that proved the deathknell to the manager who signed him, David Moyes. Even more hurtfully, Reds legend Paul Scholes was scathing about Fellaini's United career up that point, saying on television: 'I'd be expecting a lot more of him.' Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has praised the rebirth of resurrection Marouane Fellaini . Fellaini, pictured against Aston Villa on April 4, is expected to start against Manchester City on Sunday . In the corresponding fixture last season, the Belgian (back) was criticised by fans and pundits in a 3-0 loss . Things have changed dramatically since then with Fellaini developing into a more effective No10 than Juan Mata, Rooney or Angel di Maria have been this season. Playing off Rooney, Fellaini has allowed van Gaal to play 4-3-3 with Ashley Young and Juan Mata either side of the centre-forward. United have won five league games in a row and are in third place, a point ahead of City for Sunday's derby. 'Marouane always does the things that we want from him. He is performing what we want from a midfielder, we have other players who are too creative and too emotional to do the job,' said van Gaal. 'I’ve always said for the balance of our team you have to also defend as well as attack and you have to beat the pressure from the opponent. Marouane plays a factor in all these aspects, we needed him in the team, now he has that role and he plays his role very well.' Fellaini, who cost £27million when Moyes signed him from Everton, has scored three goals in United's revival and also scored three times for his country in their two recent Euro 2016 qualifiers. As importantly, his aerial presence in both penalty areas has helped United. His overall physicality has helped LVG bring back a formation that he used earlier in the season against Chelsea, Manchester City and West Brom, without winning any of them. This season though, Van Gaal has been impressed with the midfielder's (right) ability in defence and attack . 'We haven't got the tallest team and have problems with the long ball,' admitted van Gaal. 'So we press more than we used to. We have changed our shape to 4-3-3 because you can press better, I tried it at that time but we couldn't do it. It’s a process and now we can do it.' Typically for van Gaal though, there was a sting in the tail in case Fellaini should start to believe the good publicity. 'I took him off against Villa in the last game, that wasn't for no reason,' stressed the manager. Van Gaal also had praise for Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea who is interesting Real Madrid. The United boss has until now been reserved in his praise for de Gea but he went on a charm offensive yesterday after the keeper made a rare mistake to allow Aston Villa's Christian Benteke to score last weekend. 'De Gea has had a marvellous season and everybody knows that. He was very important in a lot of matches and therefore I can’t change him,' said van Gaal.

"Jose Mourinho has lauded Chelsea's consistency, with a hint of caution, as his side bid to wrap up a wire-to-wire Premier League victory. The Blues have led or shared the lead since the opening round of fixtures and entered this weekend's matches seven points clear with eight matches remaining, beginning at QPR on Sunday. 'To be top of the league since day one shows consistency, stability, confidence and a brave approach to every game,' Mourinho said.

Blues captain John Terry has been a pivotal figure in keeping the west Londoners in consistent form . Diego Costa celebrates his goal in Chelsea's 3-1 win against Burnley on the opening day of the season . 'We are there, we deserve to be there, but every game is difficult. And we still have eight matches to play.' Mourinho knows the Premier League - a championship more competitive than Italy's Serie A or Spain's Primera Division, in his opinion - can throw up twists and turns in the closing weeks. The Blues boss was not surprised to see holders Manchester City slip up at Crystal Palace last Monday to all but end their title hopes. Crystal Palace striker Glenn Murray opened the scoring in the Eagles' surprise win against Manchester City . Jason Puncheon curls his free kick over the Manchester City wall in Palace's 2-1 win at home on Monday . Mourinho added: 'This is the Premier League. In other competitions it's difficult to believe that the top team can lose four, five, six, seven matches. 'In almost every country it's very difficult for a top team to lose so many matches. 'Here, yes. It's possible. I'm not surprised. It's happening to everybody. Everybody loses matches, everybody loses points.' Mourinho will hope Chelsea are not among them at Loftus Road.","Jose Mourinho praised Chelsea's consistency since the opening fixtures .

"QPR boss Chris Ramsey believes Sunday's west London derby is more crucial to his side than it is to title-chasing Chelsea. Jose Mourinho's Blues visit Loftus Road looking for a win that will maintain their position as firm favourites to claim the Premier League crown - whilst QPR need the points in their own battle to avoid dropping out of the division all together. The Rs could start Sunday's derby just one point off the foot of the table despite taking four points from their previous two fixtures. Chris Ramsey believes Sunday's west London derby is more crucial to QPR than it is to Chelsea . Ramsey puts QPR wideman Junior Hoilett through his paces during the Hoops' training session on Friday . And, with games running out, Ramsey feels Chelsea's lead at the top means the game takes on extra significance for the hosts. 'It's a big game for us,' he said. 'They can afford to have a blip and still win the league but on the flip side, we need to pick up every point we can. 'We all know what it means to the supporters - at this stage of the season, with what is at stake for both teams, it gives it added spice.' Charlie Austin celebrates with Matt Phillips after scoring during QPR's 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday . Defender Clint Hill, who scored in Tuesday night's 3-3 draw at Aston Villa, enjoyed the taste of victory in his first west London derby when QPR won 1-0 at home to Chelsea in 2011. That game may now be remembered more for the verbal clash between John Terry and Anton Ferdinand which landed the Chelsea skipper a £220,000 fine and a four-game ban for racial abuse, but Hill wants to see the positives from that performance replicated on Sunday. 'I think we shocked them that day,' he told Hoops Player. 'If we can show the same desire both on and off the pitch then hopefully we can get a result again. Nobody expects us to win but we believe we can give them a game. 'We are playing Chelsea who are top of the Premier League and if you can't get up for that challenge then there's something wrong.'

"Steve Cotterill could be just a week away from putting Bristol City back into the Championship. The 50-year-old needs just two more wins to achieve the fourth promotion of a career that has been mostly spent rescuing clubs from relegation after goals by Kieran Agard, Joe Bryan and Aaron Wilbraham clinched a local derby victory. In front of a sold-out Ashton Gate, City took revenge for a bitterly fought 1-0 defeat back in November which ended their unbeaten start to the season. Bristol City's Aaron Wilbraham (left) tussles for the ball with Swindon Town's Yaser Kasim (right) Swindon Town's Michael Smith (left) shields the ball from the challenge of the oncoming Luke Ayling (right) Bristol City (4-4-2): Fielding, Ayling, Flint, Williams, Tavernier, Smith, Pack, Freeman (Wagstaff 93), Bryan, Agard (Emmanuel-Thomas 86), Wilbraham (Elliott 94) Subs not used: Saville, Richards, Cunningham, Osborne . Booked: Agard . Scorers: Agard 36, Bryan 80, Wilbraham 87 . Swindon (4-4-2): Foderingham, Branco, Ricketts, Turnbull, Byrne, Kasim, Stephens, Luongo, Gladwin (Swift 78), Michael Smith, Williams (Obika 69) Subs not used: Barker, Barthram, Hylton, Rodgers, Cameron Belford . Booked: Turnbull, Kasim . Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire) Attendance: 12,302 . That finished with Swindon chairman Lee Power accusing Cotterill of 'lacking class'. But it was the City boss who had the last laugh with a victory that left Swindon boss Mark Cooper having to pick his side up from two 3-0 defeats in four days that have finished their last hope of automatic promotion. Just to add to their woes they had both Yaser Kasim and Raphael Branco booked, meaning both will now serve suspensions. City had actually needed to ride their luck for much of the first half, with goalkeeper Frank Fielding pulling off three saves in two frantic minutes at one point. And Swindon striker Andy Williams cost Cooper's side their best chance of going in front when he cashed in on a mistake by Aden Flint to go through. He should have squared the ball back to strike partner Michael Smith who couldn' t have missed but instead tried to go it alone and gave Fielding the chance to save. Bristol City striker Kieran Agard (centre) celebrates giving his side the 1-0 lead against Swindon Town . Ben Gladwin (left) brings the ball for Swindon as Bristol City's Joe Bryan (centre) gives chace in midfield . As if that miss wasn't frustrating enough for the visitors, they were then architects of their own downfall when City took the lead on 35 minutes. Yaser Kasim was put under pressure as Swindon tried to play the ball out from the back from a goal kick, and gave it away to Joe Bryan. The young wing back hit a perfect pass to send Agard clear to make no mistake with his 11th goal of the season. City had earned that goal for the way they worked to put pressure on defenders, and they made their own luck again when Derrick Williams stretched to divert Ben Gladwin's shot onto the underside of the bar. Swindon's strike partnership of Williams and Smith had shared 36 goals and it wasn't hard to see why as their movement constantly troubled City's defence. But Williams, who had 21 of them, couldn't quite find his shooting range and put another gilt edged opportunity over the bar just after half time when Massimo Luongo had sent him clear. But that summed up the story of the night with no end product to so much possession, and the game swung back City's way when Jordan Turnbull turned Bryan's cross onto the top of his own bar. With 11 minutes gone Bryan wriggled into some space on the edge of the box, put the ball onto his left foot, and beat Wes Foderingham with a perfectly placed shot into the top corner. And the win was wrapped up when Luke Freeman reached the byline and cut the ball back for skipper Wilbraham to fire home his 19th of the season.

"Bristol City will become the first Football League club to win promotion this season should they beat Bradford on Tuesday night. The League One leaders managed to come away from second-placed Preston North End unscathed, drawing 1-1 thanks to Aaron Wilbraham’s equaliser after Jermaine Beckford had opened the scoring just before the hour. Regardless, Steve Cotterill’s side had been destined not to seal promotion at Deepdale because results elsewhere didn’t go their way. Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill was happy to avoid defeat against Preston on Saturday . Three points at Bradford on Tuesday will do the trick. It would take something to go seriously awry for the Robins not to be returning to the second tier after a two-year absence, and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west. ‘That’ll be good,’ Cotterill said. ‘We’ll digest that and try and prepare properly for the game. ‘It was important not to get beat here. If you look at it, if we had and then got nothing at Bradford (on Tuesday) then we’re stuck on 88 points. Preston would’ve gone to 83 points today and then have Gillingham at home. ‘You always look at the worst case scenario.’ Bristol City’s elevation to the second tier appears a formality, and Preston remain in pole position to join them. Nevertheless, manager Simon Grayson has warned his players not to get carried away. ‘We’ve said to the players we can only influence our own games, but it’s another point to our tally and another game chalked off,’ he said. ‘But there will be no complacency from the team, we know we have to keep working.’ Cotterill, meanwhile, has always gunned for the League One title rather than just promotion and this result preserved their eight-point lead over Preston, although they have played a game more. His squad are staying in a nearby hotel until the trip to Valley Parade and will train at Burnley in preparation.","Bristol City held second-place Preston to 1-1 draw at Deepdale on Saturday .

"Hibernian claimed their first Edinburgh derby victory of the season as goals from Jason Cummings and Farid El Alagui sealed a 2-0 win over Hearts and allowed them to collect a valuable three points in the push for second place in the Championship. The Leith outfit were rewarded for a dominant first-half performance against the champions when Cummings - a former youth player at Tynecastle - found the net from close range after 30 minutes. Hearts improved after the break but Hibs sealed the win in the first minute of injury time with a cool finish from El Alagui. Hibernian goalscorer Farid El Alagui celebrates with Liam Craig following Sunday's 2-0 win over Hearts . Jason Cummings (left), who also found the back of the net, celebrates his goal with team-mate Martin Boyle . With the title wrapped up, Hearts went into this match with only derby bragging rights at stake. On paper, the game meant more to promotion-chasing Hibs and Alan Stubbs' side fully deserved all the spoils. There was no guard of honour by Hibs for their city rivals but the travelling fans were in full voice as the teams emerged from the tunnel, blasting out 'championees'. Edinburgh derbies are never short of passion and there was a coming together of Adam Eckersley and Scott Allan inside the first two minutes. No action was taken by referee Kevin Clancy even though Hearts defender Eckersley appeared to move his head towards Allan's. Hibs settled the better of the two teams and created a handful of chances. On 12 minutes, Fraser Fyvie lifted a first-time curling effort over the crossbar from 18 yards before Hearts full-back Callum Paterson headed the ball onto the top of his own bar from a teasing Allan free-kick. Hibs continued to press and Neil Alexander was forced into the first save of the game to push away a curling Cummings effort at the edge of the area after the forward did well to create a yard of space up against Danny Wilson. Hearts goalkeeper Neil Alexander watches on as Cummings shot goes past him and into the back of the net . Hibs finally got a tangible reward for their dominance on the half-hour mark when Cummings put the home side in front. Allan's corner was only partially cleared and El Alagui's flick was slotted into the net by Cummings from three yards. Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson did not like what he was seeing and, in reverting to an orthodox 4-4-2, replaced Kevin McHattie with Sam Nicholson. But Hibs created the next chance as the bar again came to Hearts' rescue. Allan's corner caused problems and Liam Fontaine cracked a superb left-footed volley off the woodwork. Hearts made a brighter start to the second period and had a chance to test Hibs goalkeeper Mark Oxley after Jamie Walker was tripped 20 yards from goal. But Alim Ozturk flashed a free-kick wide of the far post. Walker then unleashed a venomous drive from 25 yards that was expertly tipped over by Oxley. Cummings is crongratulated by his team-mates as Hibernian claimed a vital win in the race for second place . Hearts were pressing but Hibs wasted another great chance to add a second in the 67th minute through El Alagui. Allan's corner was lifted back into the area by Fontaine and the unmarked forward swung a tame left-footed volley at Alexander from inside the six-yard box. Hibs survived a goal-mouth scramble in the 74th minute that saw Jordon Forster make a great block to deny Genero Zeefuik. The hosts then went on a three-against-one counter-attack charge led by Dominique Malonga but the Congo international selfishly hit the ball wide when Martin Boyle was in vast amounts of space at the edge of the area. Hearts responded with an opening of their own but Oxley did well to get down to Osman Sow's low effort from 12 yards at his near post. Hibs wrapped up the win in injury time when substitute Franck Dja Djedje found El Alagui in space and the marksman chipped the ball over Alexander from close range.","Jason Cummings and Farid El Alagui scored in Edinburgh derby victory .

"Wigan chairman David Sharpe is adamant the decision to axe Malky Mackay in favour of rookie boss Gary Caldwell less than 24 hours later was the right call. Struggling Latics moved on to their third manager of the season on Tuesday as former club captain Caldwell was swiftly appointed in a permanent capacity after Mackay's disastrous five-month tenure had ended the previous day. Mackay left the club languishing in the Sky Bet Championship relegation zone after taking just 19 points from a possible 72 and Caldwell, who at 32 is the Football League's youngest manager, inherits a team eight points adrift of safety with just five games to go. Gary Caldwell has been officially unveiled as the new Wigan Athletic manager at the DW Stadium . Wigan chairman David Sharpe is confident he has made the right appointment in Caldwell . Gary Caldwell (Wigan) 32 . Adam Murray (Mansfield) 33 . Alex Neil (Norwich City) 33 . Lee Johnson (Barnsley) 33 . Karl Robinson (MK Dons) 34 . But rather than making an interim appointment until the end of the season, Sharpe made the bold call to hand Caldwell a rolling contract which will see him in charge at the DW Stadium next season, regardless of what division they are in. 'That shows how much I believe in Gary,' the 23-year-old Sharpe said. 'It's definitely not just for the next five games, he's got a free hit at it really. If he keeps us up it's a miracle and if we go down it's expected by everybody in this room but Gary will back himself to keep us up. 'This is a long-term thing and we're looking forward to the future with him that gets us back to our identity on and off the pitch and bring the positive times back to this football club.' The good times seem an increasingly distant memory for Wigan, who have had unsuccessful stints with Owen Coyle, Uwe Rosler and Mackay at the helm after winning the FA Cup under Roberto Martinez two years ago.

'I've known with my grandad, he's got a reputation for making decisive decisions and I've learned from the best,' said Sharpe. 'It had to be done and I'm looking forward to the future. 'We speak a lot but he's over in Barbados. He didn't know what I was doing on Monday night. I spoke to him after and he's 100 per cent behind me and Gary. He's looking forward to us winning football games again. 'We've won two games here all season and it's bang average for a club of our size.' Both Sharpe and Caldwell himself played down the risky element attached to appointing somebody whose only managerial experience has come with Latics' youth teams. Former defender Caldwell is one of the few remaining squad members who played in the top flight at Wigan and he hopes his leadership qualities on the pitch will translate to the touchline. 'It's a massive opportunity and people who saw me as a player will know I don't really believe in risks,' he said. 'I played with desire and passion and that's something that I want to bring to management. People will see it as a risk but I just see the opportunity and the chance to do something great for this club and take it back to where it should be.'","Caldwell was unveiled as the new Wigan Athletic manager on Wednesday .

"Team Sky's Geraint Thomas had to settle for 14th place in an incident-packed Tour of Flanders as Norwegian Alexander Kristoff took victory in a sprint finish with Holland's Niki Terpstra. With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff . Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014.","Norway's Alexander Kristoff won race after sprint finish with Niki Terpstra .

Dinorah Santana, the player's agent and ex-wife, said at a press conference on Thursday that her client had rejected the offer of a three-year contract extension, which was dependent on the player taking part in 60 per cent of matches for the club. 'The negotiations are over,' she said. 'If they say this is the final offer, then they (negotiations) are over. 'It doesn't make sense. It's very hard that we get to April and Barcelona haven't thought about renewing Dani's contract. 'Dani is sad.'

The former Sevilla full-back has been linked with Manchester United and Manchester City, as well as Paris St Germain. Santana said Alves has two offers on the table at the moment, but has not yet been approached by big-spending PSG. 'He has had conversations with future candidates,' Santana said.

"Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew joked Glenn Murray has a 'bionic' knee and hopes the striker can continue to torment Premier League defences. Murray missed the majority of last season after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament as Palace won promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2013. The 31-year-old has netted five goals in five games, including in last Monday's defeat of Manchester City, to earn the best goals-per-minute ratio of anyone in the top-flight. Glenn Murray wheels away after scoring the winner for Crystal Palace against Manchester City . The Eagles striker has scored five in five games since returning from a serious knee injury . Pardew said: 'What he did surprise me with on Monday night is his aerial ability. He really was outstanding. 'I don't know if he's got a bionic knee, but he's got an extra spring from somewhere.' Pardew says the Cumbrian has many qualities - pace is not among them - and may have had to adapt his game, like Alan Shearer did, after serious injuries. 'Glenn has had to change his game a little bit and he goes to Sunderland, goals per minute, as the best striker in the Premier League,' Pardew added. 'That is great for him, it really is. It is a great tag for him and he can try and keep it for as long as he can.' Alan Pardew has impressed by Murray's aerial ability, which he claims is down to being fitted with a new knee . The Toon boss believes the Cumbrian forward is reaping rewards from a loan spell with Reading . Pardew believes he is reaping the rewards of Murray being given a chance to find his feet at Reading earlier this season. Murray scored eight goals in 18 games for the Royals, before committing to Palace on Pardew's arrival in January. 'In defending that decision, of Neil Warnock and the board here, of him going out on loan, he probably did need a few games and it's difficult to get them in the Premier League,' Pardew said. 'In a way the loan, which I think was perceived as a negative by our fans, might not have been a bad thing. I'm obviously getting the benefit of that.'","Glenn Murray has scored five goals in his last five Premier League games .

"A video taken from the point of view of a train driver captures a ride on the highest railway in Europe, the Jungfrau. The time lapse footage speeds along the 9km long electrified track, which leads from Kleine Scheidegg to Jungraujoch and stands at an elevation of 2061m and 3454m respectively. Opening in a tunnel built into a Swiss mountain, the train careers towards the light and out onto the snowy slopes to race alongside the many skiers. Turning a corner, the train moves at a slow and steady pace – the track barely visible from under the snow. Two people quickly cross the track in front of the train as it begins picking up speed and passes alongside a ledge that looks down on chalets below. The video then shows the train beginning its descent of the mountain, passing very close to a number of skiers who make their own way to the bottom of the slope. The video opens inside a tunnel build into the Swiss mountain as the train makes its way along the 9km long electrified track . Turning right the train enters another tunnel and plunges back into darkness before re-emerging next to even more skiers.

"A cheeky monkey was captured on camera snatching a banana from a female tourist before slapping her GoPro when she got too close. Filmed in the Thai town of Kanchanaburi, the monkey approaches the woman, who holds a banana, with its outstretched hands. Grabbing it in both hands, the monkey takes a small bite before pulling it from its skin, which he leaves with the lady. Removing her hand from the shot, the lady can be heard laughing as the greedy monkey begins tucking into the banana while its friends sit around and watch. Moving in for a closer look, the woman leans forward and the monkey copies her by lunging forward itself. Getting right up into the camera’s lens the monkey  appears to sniff it while diverting its eyes, as if hoping that it is food. The cheeky money snatches the banana from the woman's hand and begins scoffing it down . Realising that it is out of luck, it returns to its original position and continues tucking into the banana. The lady once again begins moving closer to the monkey, but the primate is less keen to play this time. Cradling its food under its arm as if protecting it from the oncoming threat, the monkey raises its left hand and gives the camera a slap. Up close and personal! The curious monkey gets right up to the camera lens and gives it a sniff . Startled by the monkey’s reaction, its friend who sits next to it looks genuinely shocked and rather hilariously raises its eyebrows in surprise.

"It may be a far cry from an opening day of an Ashes Test in Sydney or a tour date in St Lucia, but former England bowler Steve Harmison seems to be doing a fine job with Ashington AFC. After shocking the sporting world by taking the job with the Northern League Division One side in the ninth tier of English football, the local lad, 36, has now won seven on the spin with his club side. Recent victories against West Allotment Celtic, Penrith and Celtic Nation were particularly impressive, Harmison is only looking up as a football coach. Steve Harmison seems to be doing a fine job at Ashington AFC and has led them to seven wins on the spin . Harmison celebrates with Andrew Strauss during a Ashes Test at the Oval in 2009 . And former England skipper has supported his former England team-mate, posting a tongue-in-cheek tweet on Tuesday night: '(sic) Hearing @Harmy611 has now won 7 on the bounce as Ashington Manager..... Mike Ashley will come calling soon...' Current Newcastle boss John Carver says he has invited Harmison to training to catch a glimpse of his favourite team, who are reeling from a 1-0 derby day defeat to Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. Harmison though, is having no such troubles. When he took on the job, Ashington were 17th ub the league - now, they are the form side and are comfortable in mid-table. The 36-year-old is a boyhood Newcastle fan and is doing well with the non-league side . After Saturday's victory against Crook Town, Harmison was targeting even more success, his players not settling for just the three points. 'The positive thing is that despite winning 4-1, the players are disappointed,' he said. 'All in all it was a good 90 minutes for Ashington FC. It's a results business and we have kept the run going.' Harmison, who took 226 Test wickets for England between 2002 and 2009, played for Ashington briefly as a teenager.

"A man who stabbed a young father to death has been filmed partying with prison hooch and singing to explicit rap lyrics in a sickening jail video. Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, is seen in the 50-second clip captured on a banned mobile phone as he dances outside his cell  with other inmates at Coldingley prison in Surrey. He clutches a glass of the homemade illegal brew in the clip, which also shows a stash of drink bottles, biscuits and crisps on a window ledge, before it was shared with friends on WhatsApp. Scroll down for video . Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, who was jailed for stabbing a young father, has been filmed partying behind bars . He was caught on camera drinking illegal alcohol and dancing to explicit rap music with other inmates at Coldingley prison in Surrey . Prison officers reportedly turned a blind eye to the partying, which happened in the run-up to Christmas in December last year. Tesfamichael was jailed for life with a minimum of 13 years after he used a broken champagne bottle to stab Olu Olagbaju, 26, in Shadan's nightclub in the City of London in December 2006. The music producer collapsed and died after the attack, where witnesses described seeing the young father being held with his arms behind his back before he was stabbed in the chest. Eritrean-born Tesfamichael, then 23 and living in Camden, north London, made his getaway in a Mercedes before fleeing to Italy and then Miami, U.S., before he was extradited back to Britain. The 50-second video clip was captured on a banned mobile phone and shared with friends on WhatsApp . Eritrean-born Tesfamichael will spend a minimum of 13 years behind bars for the stabbing of Olu Olagbaju, 26 . Mr Olagbaju was looking forward to the birth of his second child with fiancee Terri Jacob, who he already had a daughter with, when he was killed. The Ministry of Justice launched an internal investigation at the Category C prison, which houses 500 inmates, and dealt with those involved. A spokesperson from the Prison Service said: 'All identified prisoners have faced disciplinary action. This type of behaviour will not be tolerated.' Tesfamichael wears a grey vest as he dances around the prison with another inmate, who wears sunglasses . The footage also shows a stash of drinks bottles, crisps and biscuits being stored on a window ledge . The video has outraged members of the public after it was shared on social media. Vikki Heywood, wrote on Facebook: 'I think it's disgusting the stuff they can get up to in prison these days. I've seen other ones of take aways and stuff like that. 'They are there to be punished not rewarded. If they have it soo cosy they will never learn from there's mistakes [sic].' Richard Jones added: 'What's more shameless is that it's the authorities allowing the ""party"" to take place.'  Others described it as 'shocking' and 'disgraceful'. Dashem Tesfamichael (left) stabbed Olu Olagbaju, 26, (right) with a broken champagne bottle at a London nighclub in December 2006 . Prison officers at Coldingley prison in Surrey reportedly turned a blind eye to the partying, which happened in the run up to Christmas in December last year . Prison inmates use the yeast food spread to make illegal hooch dubbed 'Marmite Mule' behind bars . Prisoners are infamous for brewing illicit alcohol while they're behind bars with the DIY concoctions carrying a variety of names from 'pruno' to 'hooch'. But it is perhaps surprising to learn how inmates are able to make the beverages on such a limited amount of resources. In 2009 it was reported that Marmite had been banned from Dartmoor prison in Devon because inmates were using it to make super strength hooch. Dubbed 'Martmite Mule', prisoners added it to fruit, vegetables, bread and water, with the yeast in the food spread triggering the fermenting process of turning the sugars in the fruit into alcohol. The brew is then left over two weeks in old soft drink bottles or plastic bags before it is strained with a T-shirt or sock to remove the remains of the fruit and veg. It was also reportedly being used at privately-run Addiewell Prison in Scotland. Pruno, or prison wine, is renowned for being made by inmates because it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to them. It is usually made using a variation of apples, oranges, fruit cocktail, candy, ketchup, sugar, milk, and possibly other ingredients, including crumbled bread. Again, the use of a plastic bag, hot running water and a sock are needed during the fermentation process. The longer the concoction is left the stronger it will be with the alcohol volume ranging from 2 per cent to 14 per cent.","Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, filmed dancing outside cell at Coldingley prison .

"Right from the moment he breezed through the doors at Old Trafford, Louis van Gaal was a man with a plan. The first season, he stated, would see him deliver Manchester United back into their rightful place in the Champions League. He would restore them to the Premier League top four but loftier aims of silverware would have to wait. His three-year vision would allow for such thoughts but, first things first, United needed to be dining from European football's top table again. Louis van Gaal is close to delivering his first-season aim of returning Man United into Champions League . Wayne Rooney smashes home during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Saturday . United's win over Aston Villa took them third, eight points ahead of fifth-placed Liverpool in the table . April 12 Manchester City (H) April 18 Chelsea (A) April 26 Everton (A) May 2 West Bromwich Albion (H) May 9 Crystal Palace (A) May 17 Arsenal (H) May 24 Hull City (A) One season out of the Champions League was far from ideal, but two seasons would be an absolute disaster and something, he understood, that would not be tolerated. In November, even that was looking optimistic. A 1-0 defeat to Manchester City meant that United had taken just 13 points from their opening 10 matches - it was their worst start to a league campaign since 1986, when Ron Atkinson only lasted until November. They had also been humiliated in the Capital One Cup by League One side MK Dons. Once again, with a more than a hint of desperation, Van Gaal reminded everyone after the derby defeat that this was a long-term project. 'It's not good enough,' he said. 'But on the other hand, we are in a process, as I have said from the beginning. The process shall take more than one year, it shall take three years.' Suddenly, it seemed like Van Gaal was shifting the goalposts. Instead of finishing top four in his first season, was he now suggesting that United might only be worthy of those positions by year three? That didn't sound good. It took some time for United to hit their stride under Van Gaal but things have finally come together . United were again at their best in Saturday's 3-1 home win over Aston Villa, which took them third . United celebrate their title triumph in 2013 - Van Gaal's aim is to return such success to Old Trafford . But Van Gaal has been true to his word. Barring a catastrophic late collapse in form, United will be gracing the Champions League again next season. With an eight-point cushion established over Liverpool in fifth, United's faithful can look forward to those electric European nights against next season. Their failure to qualify for the continent's premier club competition this year is a mere blip, rather than a symbol of sustained decline. With matches against Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City still to come, there is even far-fetched talk of United winning the title. Now that really would be an acceleration of the Van Gaal masterplan. That won't happen but there's no reason why United can't finish second or third, avoiding the necessity of a potentially tricky Champions League qualifier in August. United are on course, the plan is on track and Van Gaal can be satisfied. There are growing signs too that Van Gaal's team are looking like the Manchester United of old. Ander Herrera scored twice in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Aston Villa at the weekend . Juan Mata, who scored twice in the 2-1 win over Liverpool, has been excellent under Van Gaal . Angel di Maria (right) has been mainly playing from the bench during United's recent good run of form . Radamel Falcao (right) has also had to be content with a place on the bench . The 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Saturday was another indication that United are now a settled side. The fluent, possession-based football and the waves of attack that were hallmarks of the Alex Ferguson era are slowly beginning to return. Van Gaal, after trying what seems like a million combinations, has found the shape and system that best makes use of the resources at his disposal. It seems to exclude Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao - combined value £103.5m - but while the money men won't be happy, everyone else is. Now that United have manoeuvred themselves into a strong position in the top four, Van Gaal can regard his first season in English football as a job well done. But year two demands further improvement. United must mount a sustained challenge for the Premier League title and reach the later stages of the Champions League. Those are the expectations. Now we wait and see if Van Gaal can deliver.","Man United have an eight-point cushion from fifth-place Liverpool .

"The 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to contest the Masters next week told Sportsmail of his immense relief that he held on to claim the last spot. Paul Casey was at home in Arizona when the matter was decided last Sunday and admitted he went through all sorts of agonies as his Augusta fate swung back and forth. The Englishman got in due to staying in the world’s top 50 but at one point, as events unfolded in Morocco and at the Texas Open, he was projected to fall to 54th. Paul Casey, pictured in action last month, is the 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to play at the Masters . ‘I was very relieved and now I am just so excited,’ said Casey, who made the last of his eight Masters appearances in 2012. 'On the outside looking in is hardly where you want to be for the season’s first major. I’ve missed the whole experience.’ The classy ball striker has got all the tools to do well at Augusta and showed as much when he forced his way into contention on several occasions. The 37-year-old finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round. He then called a penalty shot on himself at the sixth after his ball moved a fraction when he addressed it with his putter. Casey finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round . It’s a stupid rule that has subsequently been changed and Casey said, smiling:’It would be nice to wind the clock back, wouldn’t it? It did affect me for a few holes and I fell away (he finished 10th). But I’m going back a lot wiser and far better equipped if I got in contention again.’ Casey will wrap up his preparation at the Shell Houston Open, the site of his only PGA Tour victory. Also in the field are Justin Rose, Lee Westwood and a quartet of high class Americans in Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson. Meanwhile, there’s still no word on whether Tiger Woods will play the Masters, although he did at least declare his intent by pitching up for a practice round at Augusta on Tuesday.","Paul Casey was the 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to play at Augusta .

"No need to tell Padraig Harrington what a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago he stood on the same spot on the same practice ground at the same tournament, the Houston Open, looking as crestfallen as I have ever seen him. Now look at him. There’s an obvious contentment as he hits a few shots and breaks off to chat with his long-time caddie, Ronan Flood. He’s taking in the surroundings with the grateful bearing of a man handed an unlikely lifeline. In short, here’s a three-time major champion who’s got his mojo back. Three time major winner Padraig Harrington has rediscovered his form ahead of the Masters . The Irishman practices during the pro-am before the start of the Houston Open in Texas . The small miracles that occur in this game. A month ago Harrington had fallen outside the world’s top 300 when he accepted an invitation to play in the Honda Classic in Florida. He ended up winning his first tournament in America since the 2008 USPGA Championship. How on earth does that happen? First, let’s return to the depths of despair. ‘Last year? Yeah I was devastated, there’s no other word for it,’ he admits. ‘I thought all along I’d do something that would get me to the Masters. A year earlier I’d been in contention to win and now I wasn’t good enough even to start. It was a huge shock.’ It was the first major championship this century for which he’d failed to qualify and he ended up watching it sulking on the sofa at home. ‘It was very tough,’ he says. ‘I watched it all and it wasn’t nice. Even though I was out of form, you always think you have a chance at any major, so I was gutted to miss out.’ Harrington had falled out of the world's top 300 before accepting an invitation to the Honda Classic . The 43-year-old ended up winning the tournament after a play-off victory against Daniel Berger . He looked for all the world like he would miss out this year as well until that dramatic play-off victory in the Sunshine State. The spoils of success included an invitation to Augusta. Ask him about next week and he sounds like a kid who’s just discovered chocolate. ‘I feel like I’m going to play in the Masters for the first time, I’m that excited,’ he said. ‘It’s funny, all my family are going this year, while in other years it was, like:“Ah, not to worry, we’ll wait and go another year.” Now that I’ve missed one they’re fearing this will be the last time they will have the chance. ‘As a player, a bit of that creeps in as well. When you’re playing great you think you’re never going to miss these events. But hopefully I shall play well for a while now. That’s been my thing over the years. It’s always been about peaks and troughs and keeping the peaks for as long as you can. My wins tend to come together so hopefully I’ll win a few more now.’ Harrington was 'devastated' after failing to qualify for last year's Masters following poor results . The Dunliner kisses the famous Claret Jug after winning the 2008 Open at Royal Birkdale . Harrington's recent upturn in form began after winning the Indonesia Open at the end of last year . Two of his wins together were the Open and USPGA in 2008. So, as the last player to go to Augusta looking for a third straight major victory, how does he rate Rory McIlroy’s chances? ‘The good thing is that expectation is already at saturation point, so I don’ t think that will be an issue,’ he said. ‘Every week he’s the main man so he’s used to it. I think the main issue for Rory is that so many other players are playing so well. Take Dustin Johnson. Rory’s big thing was that he’d hit a driver everywhere while most players would hit three wood. And he’d hit it straight so that made him not just long but doubly long. But Dustin does the same thing – and he’s 20 yards longer than Rory. ‘Having said that, Rory has shown when he has his A game he wins. I’d go there with the attitude that if I win the Masters next year it’ll still be the career grand slam. He’s just got to try and stay out of his own way as much as he possibly can.’ Harrington, of course, knows all about this mental side of the game, having read every volume on the subject. Rory McIlroy heads to Augusta looking to complete a grand slam of winning all four majors . The world No 1 faces competition from Dustin Johnson and his mammoth drives . Last summer he started working with Steve Peters, the renowned psychologist who helped Britain’s cycling team to glory and is now working with Liverpool football club and England. Harrington was one of the 200,000 people who bought Peters’s book ‘The Chimp Paradox.’ Basically, it’s about how to manage your inner chimp - the part of the brain that runs on emotions and gut instincts. ‘He has really helped me out,’ said Harrington. ‘He’s helped me rediscover some essential truths about my game.

"Rotherham claimed a vital win against Brighton to significantly boost their survival hopes and send foot-of-the-table Blackpool down. The game presented both Rotherham and Brighton with an opportunity to pull away from the trouble they currently find themselves in at the wrong end of the Sky Bet Championship table. Matt Derbyshire's early finish proved to be the difference between the two teams at the AES Seal New York Stadium and moved Rotherham to just two points behind the visitors. Matt Derbyshire gets to the ball first to apply the finish and give Rotherham the lead against Brighton . David Stockdale is unable to stop Derbyshire's near post effort after a good cross by Jordan Bowery . Rotherham: Martinez; Hunt, Rawson, Broadfoot, Lafferty, Green, Arnason, Smallwood, Pringle, Bowery (Ward 77), Derbyshire . Subs not used: Rowe, Hammill, Milsom, Newton, Frecklington .

Booked: Kayal, Ince . Manager: Chris Hughton . Referee: Kevin Wright . Rotheram's Ben Pringle and Brighton's Kazenga LuaLua tested the keepers at either end in the opening stages, but it was Derbyshire who made the breakthrough after eight minutes when he cleverly turned in Jordan Bowery's cross with the outside of his boot. Rotherham, who were hoping to avoid a fifth straight defeat, continued to produce the better football and chances throughout what was a stop-start first half. Bowery blew a good opportunity for the home side when Kirk Broadfoot guided a Pringle free-kick back across goal and into the striker's path, but he headed well over under little pressure. Paul Green also missed a big chance when Derbyshire slipped him the ball from a well-worked move. The midfielder delayed his shot and eventually dragged it wide of David Stockdale's goal. Brighton had to improve in the second half and brought on Leon Best for the largely ineffective Chris O'Grady. The former Nottingham Forest striker celebrates his goal at the New York Stadium . Derbyshire is congratulated by his team-mates after putting the home side a goal up on Monday . They started the second half far better and Beram Kayal, just moments after being booked for blocking a kick from goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, should have put the visitors on level terms. The Israeli international was put clean through on goal but a heavy touch gave Martinez the advantage and he managed to deny Kayal a path to goal with a diving save. The lively Best then flashed a dangerous cross into the box which Bowery poked just over his own bar for a Brighton corner. At the right end, Bowery dragged an effort just wide of the mark before a good interception from Farrend Rawson stopped Best from getting in on goal. A good run from Rotherham full-back Jack Hunt resulted in a shot on goal as the Millers tried to make the points safe. Down the other flank Danny Lafferty laid on a big chance for Derbyshire to score his second but his shot on the angle was palmed away by Stockdale. LuaLua then miscued a volley wide for the visitors but was then replaced by Craig Mackail-Smith, who was just inches away from making an immediate impact when he narrowly failed to get a touch on to Kayal's dangerous looking centre.

"Flanked by Johnny Russell and Will Hughes, Eric Steele jigged over to the travelling Derby supporters - the popular goalkeeping coach was in the mood to celebrate. After a first win in eight, they are back in this consuming promotion race and that six-week wobble is no longer. Steele lapped up the adulation, entertaining 4,000 behind one goal of the DW Stadium at which the Rams wrapped up three crucial points. This felt very important indeed, the outpouring of each olé obvious. Derby's players celebrate after Chris Martin's goal gave them the lead in the second half . Steve McClaren was all smiles as he took his place in the stands before the game . Wigan (4-4-2): Al Habsi; Boyce (McCann 63), Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Bo-kyung, Kvist, Perch McClean; Clarke (Waghorn 75), Fortune (Murphy 65). Subs not used: Carson, Pennant, Barnett, Ojo. Booked: Boyce, Clarke . Derby (4-2-3-1): Grant; Keogh, Forsyth, Albentosa, Warnock (Christie 88); Hughes, Hendrick, Ward (Martin 46), Russell, Ince (Dawkins 90); Bent. Subs not used: Roos, Lingard, Whitbread, Hanson. Goals: Martin 51, Bent 81. Booked: Hughes, Hendrick. Referee: S. Hooper. Attendance: 14,697. Make no mistake, these have been tough times for Steve McClaren. Top of the tree back on February 24, the Derby manager is now only looking at promotion via the play-offs, labelling an automatic spot a ‘long shot’. Their ticket for those extra games is by no means booked, but goals from substitute Chris Martin and Darren Bent mean they are back on track. Martin climbed off the bench at half-time to change the game, slamming in the opener six minutes after the restart before Bent capitalised on shambolic defending to prod in a late second. ‘I didn’t think Chris would make the impact that he did,’ McClaren admitted after Martin’s first appearance in almost two months. ‘He could only play 45 minutes. ‘It’s a massive win. Huge character. We showed the quality we’ve been missing. The away following was absolutely incredible. We’ve stuck together.’ Wigan, by contrast, are staring at relegation and a first season in the third tier since 2003. Now eight points adrift, their fans chanted for the head of Malky Mackay. Chairman David Sharpe didn’t know where to look at full-time and they need two wins from trips to Fulham and Millwall - on Friday and next Tuesday respectively - to stand any chance of survival. Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant does well to tip over a header from a Wigan corner . Derby winger Tom Ince has a low effort saved by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi . Jeff Hendrick rides a challenge from South Korea international Kim Bo-kyung . ‘It’s still mathematically possible and we need to keep giving it everything we’ve got,’ Mackay said. ‘It was criminal to miss those chances but that has haunted the club all season. ‘I thought we were terrific first half - 17 crosses into their box. That should bring a return of two goals.’ It did not, and Mackay’s use of ‘mathematical’ tends to suggest the writing is on the wall. James McClean and Kim Bo-kyung both went close but Wigan ran out of steam, their fans streaming out after Bent’s 81st-minute clincher. Kim shifted the ball to his left foot and found James McClean, storming towards the six-yard box but the winger’s bullet header was met in stature by Lee Grant’s splendid one-handed stop, tipping over while airborne. Tom Ince had the beating of his man inside the box, but could only fluff right-footed straight at Ali Al Habsi. Maguire almost put through his own net from a Jamie Ward corner but those two moments were all McClaren’s side could muster before the break, finding the quagmire of a playing surface at the DW Stadium quite a deterrent. This had been used for the Warriors’ win against St Helens in their Rugby League encounter on Good Friday, and you could tell; a tame Kim drive bobbled three times to test Grant when otherwise it would not have. But, frankly, that is the least of Wigan’s worries. They face an almighty task to escape relegation, made all the harder when Martin linked up with Russell to score. ‘The difference with him and without him shows you what a top striker can do,’ Mackay rued. Chris Martin celebrates after giving Derby the lead in the crucial promotion clash . Grant saves at the feet of Leon Clarke as relegation-threatened Wigan press for a second-half equaliser . It’s 20 for the season now and how they have missed the Scotland international’s presence. He came on with purpose, knocked the normally immovable Maguire from pillar to post and gave the Rams a focus. Ince just poked over the bar after super build-up involving Martin and Bent, before the on-loan Aston Villa striker wrapped up the points after 81 minutes. Bent comes alive in the 18-yard box and reacted quickest to Jason Pearce’s terrible mix-up to add a second. Wigan did have their chances. McClean was smothered brilliantly by Grant as the Ireland international looked to equalise; William Kvist then saw a half-volley superbly blocked by Hughes. They displayed guts, but not an awful lot of quality, and a first season below the top two divisions since 2003 looks to be the legacy created by Dave Whelan in controversially appointing Mackay. ‘We want Malky out,’ was the summation of 10,000 home fans. Five wins since taking over in November suggests they are right. Substitute Darren Bent puts the result beyond doubt by finishing from close range .

"Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur missed out on the opportunity to narrow the gap to Under 21 league leaders Manchester United after playing out a goalless draw at Wheatsheaf Park. Spurs went into the game at Staines Town sitting sixth in the league but victory would have taken them joint top with the Red Devils, while the defending champions were only three points behind the north London outfit.

"Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows. Decades of cheap package holidays mean that thousands of retired people every year are paying with their health for sunburn they experienced in their youth. According to Cancer Research UK, men aged 65 and over are around ten times more likely to be diagnosed with malignant melanoma than those of their parents’ generation. Scroll down for video . Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows . And older women are about five times more likely to develop this disease than someone of the same age were in the mid-1970s. Around 5,700 pensioners are now diagnosed with melanoma each year in the UK compared with just 600 a year four decades ago. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn when they were young, experts said last night. Although age is a major risk factor for melanoma, the huge increase is blamed on the cheap package holiday boom dating from the 1960s. Overall, 55.2 of every 100,000 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with skin cancer every year. In 1975 just 7.9 per 100,000 were diagnosed - a seven-fold increase. The figures are part of a worrying increase in incidents that affects all age groups. The continuing obsession with sporting a tan means the toll is likely to keep rising. Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person’s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest . Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person’s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest. Around 13,300 people across a wide range of ages are diagnosed with malignant melanoma in the UK each year making it the country’s fifth most common cancer overall and the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34. And with sunbeds still very popular, the number of diagnoses is expected to rise to 20,000 a year by 2027. In 1975 the figure was just 1,800. Professor Richard Marais, Cancer Research UK’s skin cancer expert: ‘It’s worrying to see melanoma rates increasing at such a fast pace, and across all age groups. ‘It’s very important for people to take care of their skin in the sun. ‘It’s also important for them to keep an eye on their skin and seek medical opinion if they see any changes to their moles, or even to normal areas of skin. ‘Melanoma is often detected on men’s backs and women’s legs but can appear on any part of the body.’ Each year, 2,100 Britons die from the disease. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK’s head of health information, said: ‘Many cases of malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, are preventable by taking precautions in the sun and making sure you don’t burn. ‘Sun damage accumulates over time so avoiding sunburn - and sunbeds - is key, as well as getting to know your skin type so you don’t overdo it on the beach or even in the garden. ‘You can burn at home just as easily as you can on holiday, so remember to spend time in the shade, wear a T shirt and a hat to protect your skin and regularly apply sunscreen that is at least Factor 15 and has four stars. ‘Swapping bad sun habits for good ones could save your life.’ Sue Deans, a 69-year-old retired teacher and mother-of-three from Croydon, south London, who was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2000 after having a mole removed, said: ‘I was part of the generation where package holidays became affordable and you could go abroad nearly every year. ‘I don’t think there was much understanding at the time about the impact that too much sun can have on your risk of getting skin cancer. ‘And I loved the sun but suffered quite a bit of sunburn over the years. ‘I’ve always been quite body aware so my cancer was spotted early. ‘I had successful surgery and have been healthy since, but I’m always vigilant in keeping an eye out for anything unusual or persistent that might need to be checked. ‘Now I make sure my grandson knows the dangers of getting caught out in the sun.’","Decades of cheap holidays means retirees are paying for sunburn in youth .

"If the team with momentum hold an ace card heading into the play-offs, then watch out for Wolves. Kenny Jackett’s team moved into sixth place in the Championship with a fourth successive victory after David Edwards, the substitute, headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game. Pre-match results had offered Wolves a prospective route into the play-off zone, with Brentford and Ipswich Town dropping points unexpectedly, and Kenny Jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within Molineux by naming an unchanged starting line-up from the side that prevailed 2-1 at Nottingham Forest on Friday for a third successive victory. Wolves substitute David Edwards races away in celebration after scoring a late winner . Edwards is congratulated by his Wolves team-mates following his 88th-minute winner against Leeds .

With a day less to recover, Leeds had also been on a decent run before Saturday’s 3-0 home defeat by Blackburn Rovers topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history. Neil Redfearn, the head coach, had said he would consider his future after this game at Wolves after his assistant Steve Thompson had been suspended without explanation. Although Massimon Cellini, Leeds’ banned owner, has subsequently claimed Thomson had used abusive language towards sporting director Nicola Salerno, it was only another spanner in the works for this once-proud club who need stability more than anything. Still, it was Leeds who struck the first blow, courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from Kevin McDonald who, penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant Kalvin Phillips, attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off Richard Stearman, his own team-mate, for Charlie Taylor to sidefoot under Carl Ikeme. Even before the January arrival of Benik Afobe, now level with Harry Kane as the leading goalscorer in all four divisions, Wolves have happily relied on either and both of the Mali combination of Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko. It was the latter who earned Jackett’s team the lead by half-time. Dicko equalised from the tightest of angles when a cross-shot from Afobe, all loping legs and dizzying stepovers, eluded Marco Silvestri. It still needed a cute finish as the former Wigan striker lifted his shot over Scott Wootton from the byline for his 12th goal of an increasingly impressive season. Alex Mowatt looks delighted after putting Leeds back on level terms by scoring his side's third goal . Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme  dives in vain as Mowatt makes it 3-3 before Edwards' late winner . Leeds attempted to disrupt Wolves’ rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling, Phillips receiving one caution for fouling McDonald then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former Sheffield United midfielder’s sock. The home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half-time approached however and, in stoppage time, Leeds conceded at what appeared to be the worst time. Their defence appeared to disappear as Sako played in Dicko who took his time before firing in off the near post. Wolves turned the screw at the start of the second half as Afobe joined in the goalscoring fun three minutes after the restart. The former Arsenal striker, who scored 19 times on loan for MK Dons in the first half of the season, attempted an audacious overhead kick from Jack Price’s cross into the area. Sako kept play alive, dropping the ball back for Batth, whose shot hit Dicko but fell back for Afobe to smash in his tenth goal for Wolves. Leeds looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before Wolves offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute. Alex Mowatt’s dink into the penalty area looked pretty harmless and a cry of ‘leave it’ could be heard from the press box, presumably from Ikeme, only for Batth to lunge and divert the ball past his own goalkeeper. Richard Stearman was the next guilty party in the Wolves defence as he gave the ball away cheaply to Mowatt who cut inside and from outside the penalty area curled home a superb equaliser into the top corner. Wolves do possess strength in depth however and in David Edwards they have a midfielder who not only works as hard as anyone in pressing the ball but also chips in with crucial goals. So it was that the substitute rose two minutes from time to head McDonald’s telling cross into the top corner to wrap up the win that took Wolves into sixth place.

Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc started to come from his line then hesitated and before he knew it the striker had sent the ball over him and in. ‘We want eight,’ the travelling Birmingham supporters chanted in jest, demanding vengeance for Bournemouth thrashing them 8-0 in the reverse of this fixture back in October. That scoreline became less fantastical when they added a second in the 21st minute. Birmingham winger David Cotterill made a strong run down the right and with a defender backing off he buried a strike across goal into the bottom left corner. ‘That didn’t feel too good,’ Howe admitted. ‘I’d be lying if I said nerves won’ t come into it, it’s only natural considering what’s at stake.’ But Bournemouth have not got around the automatic qualification places by buckling under pressure and they scored twice before the break. Callum Wilson rounds Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph to draw Bournemouth level . Wilson celebrates his 17th league goal of the season as Bournemouth fight back from two goals down . Steve Cook (centre) battles past a host of Birmingham defenders to score for Bournemouth and make it 2-1 . On 39 minutes, Matt Ritchie whipped in a corner from the right-hand side and Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook both leapt for it, the latter eventually bundling the ball over the line. Then in first-half stoppage time Yann Kermorgant played a delicate ball through Birmingham’s defence, perfectly weighted between defender and goalkeeper for Callum Wilson to round Darren Randolph and tap in. Only three minutes into the second half and they were in front. Wilson broke free down the right, carried the ball into the box and was scythed down by Birmingham defender Paul Robinson after a cheeky turn. Kermogant stoked in the penalty. ‘I felt the officials were inconsistent,’ Birmingham manager Gary Rowett said. 'We had three clear onsides given off and Wilson was level when he won the penalty. Elphick tried to slap Rob Kiernan in a melee at the end and the referee was right next to it but gave nothing.’ If Birmingham’s two goals in three minutes were impressive, Bournemouth’s three in nine were even more devastating and they added to that in the 74th minute. Substitute Adam Smith first had a shot from the edge of the box blocked, which left Randolph on the floor, and the midfielder went for the opposite corner only for the keeper to dive back. But there was nothing Randolph could do when the ball came out to Charlie Daniels who struck a shot into the ground which looped in off the bar. The game was over in the 77th minute when Robinson was sent off for a foul last man. Referee Andy Woolmer handed out a straight red card, but it was hard to make out amongst the Birmingham red faces. David Cotterill celebrates making it 2-0 to Birmingham after just 21 minutes . Clayton Donaldson (centre) opens the scoring for Birmingham with a sublime lob over Artur Boruc .

Video technology is not allowed in Argentine football and, after a melee ensued on the pitch involving players and coaching staff, Velez manager Miguel Angel Russo said: 'Delfino has every right to change his decision. But by his own decision, not off the television. 'The Fifa rules are very clear, they don't accept technology... If cameras are to exist then let them be used for everyone.'

I changed the decision because of my colleague, we are a team. 'If it was handball by Pavone then I'm happy that there was justice... but it was sloppy and I'm responsible.'

"Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has expressed his desire to remain at Old Trafford for years to come, describing the Red Devils as the 'right team in the right league'. The Spaniard has come through a testing first six months in English football which saw him begin the season in the team before having a reduced role as a substitute. That led to suggestions manager Louis van Gaal did not rate the £29million summer signing from Athletic Bilbao. However, the 25-year-old has now started the last eight matches and scored twice in Saturday's 3-1 win over Aston Villa.

"Bradley Johnson's season to remember continued as Norwich recorded a comfortable 2-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday to move into the Sky Bet Championship's top two for the first time since October. The midfielder netted his 12th and 13th goals of the season late in the first half to settle a scrappy encounter which the Canaries dominated without looking particularly convincing. Norwich should now fancy their chances of going on to complete a swift return to the top flight, with excellent form behind them and a favourable run of fixtures between now and the end of the season. Bradley Johnson heads home to give Norwich City the lead against Sheffield Wednesday at Carrow Road . Johnson scores his second for the Canaries as they maintain their automatic promotion hopes with victory . Norwich City: Ruddy, Whittaker, Martin, Bassong, Olsson, Howson, Tettey, Dorrans, (Hooper 88), Johnson, (Odjidja-Ofoe 93), Hoolahan, (Redmond 79), Jerome . Unused Subs: Becchio, R Bennett, Rudd, O'Neil . Sheffield Wednesday: Westwood, Vermijl, (Buxton 45), Lees, Dielna, Mattock, Maguire, Lee, Melo Silva, Isgrove (Nuhiu 45), McGugan, Lavery (Bus 78) Substitutes: Hutchinson, May, Zayatte, Kirkland . Ref: Carl Boyeson . Att: 22,993 . Alex Neil's side had an early shout for a penalty waved away when Tom Lees appeared to bundle over Cameron Jerome in the box but referee Carl Boyeson awarded a corner. When the ball came in it was only half-cleared and Stephen Whittaker's well-struck effort was deflected over. The in-form Canaries continued to look the side more likely to break the deadlock although they were almost caught on the break when Martin Olsson carelessly lost possession on the halfway line. Lloyd Isgrove drove into the box but the angle was tight and he dragged his shot just wide of the far post. Caolan Lavery then failed to get a free header on target as the Owls continued to pose a threat on the break but Norwich were generally on the front foot and went close again when Alex Tettey tested Keiran Westwood with another stinging drive from distance. Whittaker then fired wastefully over the top after being set up by Wes Hoolahan before Norwich took a deserved lead on 33 minutes after conjuring up a goal out of nothing.

Norwich City captain Russell Martin celebrates with the match ball as hosts grab their second of the match . The Norwich City fans celebrate as Johnson's double sends them on their way to victory at Carrow Road . Wednesday should really have cleared their lines after a cross from the left was overhit but Jonny Howson forced a hurried punt that ended up picking up Johnson at the back post and the midfielder outjumped his marker to head past Westwood. Norwich now had their tails up and made it 2-0 in first-half stoppage time when Johnson doubled his tally from a corner. More poor defending from the visitors saw the ball drop kindly for the midfielder and he needed no second invitation to blast the ball home from just outside the six-yard box via a slight deflection. Johnson might have completed a swift hat-trick on 49 minutes with a deflected low drive from Hoolahan's free-kick but Westwood did well to gather the ball cleanly. The second half developed into a somewhat scrappy affair, with neither side dominating, although Kieran Lee shot just wide on 62 minutes as the visitors gave as good as they got. Norwich were looking comfortable without posing much of a threat, safe in the knowledge they had the points wrapped up barring an unlikely comeback from a side with nothing but pride to play for. Howson tried his luck from 25 yards with no success as the game drifted towards its conclusion, with Wednesday having to play the last eight minutes with 10 men as defender Claude Dielna went off with a hamstring injury with all the substitutes used.

"While most football fans face travel misery over Easter, Manchester City have laid on free coaches to take their supporters to London for Monday's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace. The reigning champions have shelled out for six coaches to transport around 3,000 people to Selhurst Park, notoriously one of the most difficult top flight grounds for Northern club fans to reach. The move was made after TV scheduling for the 8pm kick-off made it virtually impossible for supporters to return home by either train or plane on the same night. David Silva (right) celebrates scoring in City's 3-0 defeat of Crystal Palace earlier this season . Around 300 City fans have been afforded free travel on six coaches to take them to Selhurst Park . Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of football fans are facing a travel nightmare this weekend because of the Easter rail shut down. Despite more than 30 Premiership and Championship games scheduled for the long weekend, large parts of the rail network are set to be closed for repair works. More than half the games are set to be affected by delays and disruption, forcing fans onto the roads. Many grounds will not reach full capacity over Easter as rail closures disrupt travel plans . Labour has accused the Government of failing to learn from the Boxing Day chaos, when nearly a million football fans faced nightmare journeys to follow their team. Ministers were warned of the potential problems in advance Labour has claimed – but they failed to scrutinise the planned level of maintenance work. Every single major artery on Britain's railways was shut down. No trains ran between England and Scotland or Wales on the East Coast, West Coast or Great Western mainlines. The Midland, Cross Country and East Anglia were also shut.","Manchester City face Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday .

"Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy was feeling less vibrant than his team's bright orange strip after they blew a chance to climb into the play-off places. The Tractor Boys, who have now lost four of their last five away games, were caught cold by goals in the opening 30 minutes by Huddersfield strike pair Nahki Wells and James Vaughan. McCarthy responded by making two changes at half-time and was rewarded when Luke Varney reduced arrears earlier in the second period. Nakhi Wells celebrates after giving his Huddersfield side the lead at the John Smith's Stadium . James Vaughan (right) doubled the lead for the home side and dent Ipswich's play-off hopes . Huddersfield (4-4-2): Smithies; Smith, Goberin, Hudson, Lynch, James; Scannell (Wallace 89), Goberin Coady, Butterfield; Wells (Edgar 83), Vaughan (Lolley 90) Goals: Wells 12, Vaughan 30 . Ipswich: Bialkowski; Chambers, Smith, Berra, Fryers; Chaplow (Bishop 45), Skuse, Tabb (Williams 67); Varney, Murphy, Wood (Sears 45) Goal: Varney 48 . Bookings: Smith, Berra . But Ipswich couldn't force an equaliser let alone manage the victory that would have seen them leapfrog Brentford into the top six. 'We were poor – nowhere near as competitive as usual,' said McCarthy. 'I was very angry at half-time and strong words were spoken. 'I had to walk off at the end to calm down slightly rather than shake all the players' hands. It's been disappointing, let's leave it at that.' Huddersfield, who hadn't won in seven matches, went ahead after 12 minutes. Wells capitalised on loose play from Zeki Fryers and curled a left-footer into the corner for his 13th goal of the season. Luke Varney (centre left) heads home early in the second half but it wasn't enough for Mick McCarthy's men . After Ipswich's 23-goal top scorer Daryl Murphy had seen an effort cleared off the line, the home side extended their lead after half-an-hour when James Vaughan rose well to head in Jacob Butterfield's cross at the far post. Luke Varney headed a goal back after 48 minutes but Huddersfield deservedly held out to leave manager Chris Powell declaring: 'We deserved it. 'Our first-half display was arguably the best we've played since I've been here. 'Vaughan and Wells took it to them from minute one. Fortunately for Ipswich's promotion hopes, three of their remaining five matches are at Portman Road starting with bottom-of-the-table Blackpool on Saturday. McCarthy added: 'I don't feel happy-slappy at the moment but me and (assistant) Terry Connor will watch this game back at seven o'clock in the morning and we'll start preparing for the next one.

"Former AFL star Ben Cousins left court with a smug smirk on his face following a morning spent in handcuffs and in police custody before he finally fronted court. Cousins smiled as he left Fremantle Magistrates Court, despite the magistrate labelling him 'a risk to the public' and warning him that he now faces a jail term for the 'serious' offences he has committed. 'It doesn't matter if you're Mother Theresa or Jack the Ripper,' Magistrate Steven Malley told Cousins in court on Thursday, according to ABC News. 'You commit those offences and the legislation says you have to go to jail. 'I accept you have issues but I cannot allow the public to be put at risk.' Scroll down for video .

With a smirk on his face Ben Cousins, a former AFL player, leaves Perth's Fremantle Court on Thursday . Cousins handed himself in to police after failing to make a court appearance over traffic charges . Cousins was supposed to appear in court to face reckless driving charges on Wednesday morning but he failed to show up. His lawyer Adain Craus represented him during the session and claimed the former West Coast Eagles captain had conflicting medical appointments. The magistrate had ordered Cousins to produce written evidence of the conflicting appointments before 4pm WST or an arrest warrant would be issued. The arrest warrant was issued and on Thursday morning the former AFL star, Perth-based Cousins surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station. There are reports he is likely to face court later on Thursday . The 2005 Brownlow medallist was arrested on March 11 after allegedly leading police on a low speed chase from Bicton to Mosman Park. When Cousins finally appeared in court, Magistrate Malley told Cousins his decision not to front up was the wrong one, ascertaining Cousins had followed the 'unwise' advice of his lawyer, Mr Craus. 'When you're on bail you're under an obligation to appear, unless you're strapped to a bed on a drip,' Magistrate Malley said in court. Magistrate Malley pointed out that there was no legitimate conflict of appointment as court had been scheduled for a 10am start, whilst Cousins' appointment was not until midday. The court session would only have lasted a matter of minutes, leading the Magistrate to assume Cousins had been advised not to appear in court by Mr Craus.

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored five, including a eight-minute hat-trick, as Real Madrid beat sorry Granada 9-1. Gareth Bale broke the deadlock and Carlo Ancelotti’s team were 4-0 up before half-time as they put memories of their Clasico defeat to Barcelona a fortnight ago behind them. The huge gulf in class showed in the midday sunshine at the Bernabeu right from minute 20 when Bale bullied Diego Mainz off the ball and charged through on goal. He dribbled around flailing Granada keeper Oier Olazabal before nudging the ball over the line for the opener. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals against Granada on Sunday to help Real Madrid to a thumping 9-1 win at the Bernabeu . Ronaldo's five goals included an eight-minute first-half hat-trick as the visitors were comfortably swept aside . Marcelo links up with Ronaldo as the duo dance after one of the forward's goals in the first half at the Bernabeu . Real Madrid bounced back from their El Clasico defeat by Barcelona with a thumping win on Easter Sunday . REAL MADRID: Casillas; Arbeloa, Ramos, Varane, Marcelo; Rodriguez (Jese 61) Kroos (Illaramendi 57), Modric; Bale, Benzema (Hernandez 61), Ronaldo . Subs not used: Navas, Nacho, Coentrao, Silva .

Booked: Piti, Murillo . Goal: Ibanez 74 . Referee: Jesus Gil . If Bale’s goal had dented Granada’s fragile defence, Ronaldo was about to crush it into one of those breakers’ yard scrap metal cubes with three quick goals that ended the match as a contest before the break. On the half hour he took a pass from James Rodriguez – back in action after 60 days out with a broken toe – and found Oier’s far corner. Six minutes later Ronaldo played the ball out to Marcelo and when Oier parried the full-back’s cross the Portuguese was on the spot to sweep it home. And two minutes after that he completed his hat-trick from Bale’s pass. The Welsman’s ball found him in space down the left. Rodriguez made a run on the outside and as the defenders were dragged one way, Ronaldo dropped his shoulder the other and beat Oier who could only flap at the ball as it whooshed past him. Granada came into the game having only won once at the Bernabeu back in 1974 – this clearly was not going to be the second win here in their history. Not that they had not had chances to score themselves in the first half. When the score was still 0-0 Iker Casillas threw the ball straight to Robert Ibanez but the Granada winger sent his shot straight back at the Spain goalkeeper who was whistled by home supporters for his sloppy distribution. Their next chance came when they were already four down with El Arabi’s shot crashing down off the underside of Casillas bar and spinning to safety just before half-time. It did not spark a second half revival. Benzema scored goal number five, five minutes into the second half criminally given time to bring the ball down on his chest after a Rodriguez corner.

That includes 24 in La Liga, equalling Lionel Messi’s record in the competition. 1.05 - Ronaldo's goals per game average at Real. Real Madrid were able to take off Rodriguez and Kroos – the first making a convincing return after his two month absence and the second needing the rest having been ever-present all season. Ancelotti was also able to give Benzema the remainder of the afternoon off as Javier Hernandez came on for the last 25 minutes. He went close with a header and Ronaldo shot wide from another Bale assist as Real looked for more goals. Granada made it 7-1 with Ibañez getting away from Arbeloa and sliding the ball beneath Casillas. But the seven goal defecit was restored when Mainz put past his own keeper, converting a Modric cross for fear the ball would reach Ronaldo lurking at the back post hoping to score his fifth of the game. It didn't stop him getting his fifth of the game right on full-time. Again it was a Modric cross and this time no-one prevented it reaching Ronaldo who headed in his 37th league goal of the season to make it 9-1. Three minutes later Bale selfishly set-up Ronaldo for his fourth goal of the afternoon after receiving Marcelo’s pass.

"Arsene Wenger admits he did not expect Arsenal’s late charge for the top of the Barclays Premier League to be powered by Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin. Wenger had all but given up on Coquelin when he was sent on loan to Charlton before Christmas and did not expect Bellerin to progress with such speed after a year at Watford. ‘Honestly, I couldn’t say that in my head Coquelin was one of the first-choice players,’ said the Arsenal manager. ‘But my job is to remain open-minded and make decisions when you have to. Francis Coquelin (right) has played a vital role in Arsenal's late push for the Premier League title . ‘Bellerin is one of the surprises of the season. He was at Watford on loan last year and didn’t get the games. He’s just 20 years old and you can look at what he does at 20 years of age.’ Spanish full-back Bellerin scored his second Arsenal goal against Liverpool, on Saturday, a wonderful curling left-footer to break the deadlock and launch his team towards a 4-1 win. He was also responsible for keeping Raheem Sterling under control when Daniel Sturridge came off the bench at half-time and Liverpool reshuffled. ‘He played against a great player in Sterling,’ said Wenger. ‘I selected him because of his pace. I thought Sturridge would play and Sterling would be on the flank. And because of his low centre of gravity. Sterling changes direction very quickly and Hector is a short as well. Hector Bellerin celebrates scoring Arsenal's first goal during the 4-1 victory against Liverpool . Bellerin broke the Emirates deadlock for Arsenal, cutting in and curling a left-foot strike into the corner . Arsene Wenger admits he didn't expect Bellerin and Coquelin to be playing such key roles . ‘Maybe he still has some experience to gain but his defending one-against-one is good and going forward he is good. He scored an important goal in a big game and that always shows that the guy has the mental quality to be there.’ The Arsenal boss did admit Bellerin might have been lucky not to be sent off, having been already booked when he mistimed a slide tackle on Sterling and conceded a penalty, scored by Jordan Henderson. ‘He was a bit lucky there,' said Wenger. ‘He could have got one but I think he genuinely went for the ball. I was just thinking: What do I do if he gets a second yellow? In the end the referee decided not to give him a yellow because he went for the ball. He was unlucky for the first yellow.’ Nacho Monreal and Oliver Giroud are among the first to congratulate the unlikely opening goalscorer .

"The crew of a Turkish airlines flight are being investigated after they allowed Turkish football team captain Arda Turan into the cockpit so he could use the tannoy to congratulate his team-mates. He was celebrating after the team's 2-1 international friendly victory against Luxembourg and had gone to the cockpit to announce his congratulations over the PA system last week. But after the move was reported in Turkish media, Turkish aviation officials in the country's Civilian Aviation Directorate (SHGM) said it was a serious breach of the safety rules of the flight back from the capital Luxembourg City and warned that there would be consequences for the cabin crew. Turkish skipper Arda Turan is pictured inside the plane's cockpit during the flight in breach of aviation rules after his side's 2-1 victory in an international friendly against Luxembourg . They said that nobody other than the crew should be allowed in the cockpit during the flight and exception should be made for nobody, even the Turkish team captain and Atletico Madrid midfielder Turan. The SHGM criticised the flight crew's decision to ignore the standard safety regulations in several tweets it posted on its official Twitter account. The first tweet noted that 'Flight teams must abide by ""Safe Cockpit"" rules for the duration of the entire flight. No one but the flight crew should be admitted to the cockpit.' A second tweet pointed out how the pilots were in violation of the 'Safe Cockpit' rules and are subject to a £260 fine, at the very least. The safety breach comes amid heightened concerns over aviation security after the Germanwings airliner crash in which all 150 people on board died when the plane's co-pilot deliberately flew the Airbus jet into the ground.

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini believes the club may need to splash out again this summer to keep pace with their rivals. With hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League crown looking increasingly forlorn, City have again failed to build on a title success. They were hampered last summer, however, with their punishment for breaching the Financial Fair Play regulations of European governing body UEFA including a £49million net spending cap. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his side must splash the cash in the summer . Pellegrini has said Manchester City must sign a 'crack' player such as striker Sergio Aguero . Man City are currently fourth in the Premier League . A return to the heavy spending of the era immediately after Sheikh Mansour's 2008 takeover is clearly not an option, for fear of invoking even tougher sanctions, but Pellegrini has warned they cannot stay idle. Pellegrini recently spoke of a need to sign a 'crack' player - in other words a superstar of the calibre of striker Sergio Aguero - and has now suggested this summer is the time to do it. The Chilean, whose side have slipped to fourth place ahead of Monday's trip to Crystal Palace, said: 'Well, it is just the way of thinking, that big teams need to sign a big player. It is very difficult to do it every year - but every two years you must do it. 'I'm not just talking about Manchester City. You see Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - all the big clubs - they all do it. It is important to have big names.' Given the general disappointments of last summer's principle signings - Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Eliaquim Mangala - Pellegrini's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash. But when pushed further, Pellegrini, perhaps not surprisingly given that his own position could be uncertain, would not say whether a spending spree might be sanctioned. Pellegrini still believes his Manchester City side are capable of retaining the Premier Legaue title . He said: 'I don't want to talk about (plans) for next season because we have to finish this season. It is very important the way we finish this season before we analyse all the players. So it is not the right moment to talk about it.' Pellegrini's immediate concern is his side's league position. Results elsewhere have seen City drop two places over the weekend and, although Pellegrini has not given up on the title, he clearly cannot even take the runners-up spot for granted. He said: 'Well we are not thinking about just one team. I think it is important for our team to finish at the top of the table but if we can't win the Premier League then we must try to be second. 'But it is important to play from now until the end of the season in a way that shows you are an important team and are prepared to fight until the last game to try and retain the title.'","Manuel Pellegrini believes Man City need to sign a world class superstar .

"Another day, another baton change, another away defeat for Middlesbrough. Aitor Karanka would surely have made his defenders walk home from Watford were it not for the probability they’d spend most of the journey travelling in circles. This was that kind of game, a top-of-the-table occasion when Middlesbrough needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale – they did not create, they did not contain. They might have survived with deficiencies in one department, but not both. What a cruel time to deliver one of their worst performances of a brilliant season. What a cruel time for the Championship’s best defence to explode at the seams. Odion Ighalo's shot flies into the top corner of Dimi Konstantopoulos' net on 65 minutes . Watford (3-5-2): Gomes; Cathcart (Connolly 60), Angella, Hoban; Paredes, Guedioura (Layun 90), Watson, Tozser, Anya; Deeney, Ighalo (Vydra 69). Subs not used: Bond, Pudil, Munari, Abdi. Booked: Guedioura, Layun. Goals: Deeney 37, Ighalo 65. Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1): Konstantopoulos; Tiendalli (Kalas 63), Woodgate, Amorebieta, Friend; Leadbitter, Clayton (Forshaw 84); Adomah, Tomlin (Kike 62), Reach; Bamford. Subs not used: Ripley, Gibson, Whitehead, Vossen. Booked: Reach. Referee: Mike Jones (Cheshire) Attendance: 19,656. They gifted Troy Deeney his 20th goal of the season and they contributed significantly to Odion Ighalo scoring his 19th in the second half. With that, Watford rose and Middlesbrough fell. That has been the way of this remarkable season in this peculiar division, for which everyone and no-one has staked a claim. The Championship lead which Boro held at the start of play has now changed hands 16 times, with Watford back in prominence and Karanka sounding like a man searching for a positive note. Karanka said: ‘The players are completely destroyed but I am very proud of them. We have players who have come from League One and other teams in the Championship, a lot of young players, and we are fighting with the best teams in the Championship. No one could have expected this position. ‘The people who know me and this team know we will fight to the last second. I don’t want to forget our position is amazing.’ True enough, but the reality is Boro have a chance to turn a good season into multi-million pound jackpot. They were woeful in falling at Bournemouth last month and have now lost four of their past five away games. Jonathan Woodgate slides in vain to try and block Troy Deeney's opening goal . The Watford captain managed to slide the ball under Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos . Deeney celebrates with his team-mates after giving Watford a first-half lead . But their misery has been Watford’s gain. What a luxury to have two strikers as effective as Deeney and Ighalo. They were, as Karanka said, ‘the difference’. And in the context of the season, their combined 39 goals are pulling the sleigh. Here, they had help. In the first instance, for Deeney’s 37th-minute opener, Jonathan Woodgate and Dwight Tiendalli made a hash of the basics. Adlene Guedioura was given too much time to cross from the right and Woodgate misread the flight, allowing the ball to fall in the space behind him. Tiendalli could have covered but was out of position. At this level, in that situation, there can be fewer worse sights for a pair of defenders than Deeney. His touch was perfect and so was the finish - ruthless brilliance from a striker who has now scored 20 goals in each of his past three campaigns. He is the only Watford player in history to do that; he more than most deserves a chance to see what he can do at the higher level. ‘He’s a Premier League player,’ said Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic. ‘It’s just a question of whether we are all together as a Premier League team.’ Watford made it 2-0 with 25 minutes to go. Again, the ease with which Ighalo turned Woodgate will have bothered Karanka, as will Grant Leadbitter’s sloppy concession of the ball in the build-up. But, really, it was all about the finish, the striker’s shot hitting the top corner from the edge of the area. Ighalo said he only joined Watford for the prospect of Premier League football. He might just get it. Jokanovic said: ‘I expect this victory can help us to win points a little bit more easily in the future. But in front of us is a very serious job.’ Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes gets a boot to the face from Middlesbrough forward Patrick bamford .

"Malky Mackay's bid to rescue his managerial career was left in tatters on Monday night after he was sensationally sacked by Wigan Athletic. The 43-year-old was told of the decision during a brief meeting with new chairman David Sharpe after the Latics lost 2-0 at home against Derby County. Mackay was handed the job by former owner Dave Whelan back in November to a backdrop of an FA investigation into a shocking series of text messages, exposed by Sportsmail. Wigan manager Malky Mackay has been sacked after just five months in charge, with Wigan facing relegation . Mackay gesticulates on the touchline during the defeat to Derby County, which would prove to be his last . Cardiff City manager at the time, Mackay is accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic messages in an exchange with former head of recruitment Iain Moody. The Scot remains under investigation by the FA and Monday’s developments will not alter the speed in which his case is dealt with. Sharpe, 23, looked forlorn after defeat against Derby and made a snap decision to axe the boss just a month into the new role. It was a result to leave the club eight points off Championship safety with only five games left and the chairman was potentially swayed by terrace chants to sack the manager as goals from Chris Martin and Darren Bent plunged Wigan closer to relegation. They must win their next two games against Fulham and Millwall to stand any chance of survival. Although Wigan did not announce a caretaker manager, such was the haste of Sharpe’s decision, Gary Caldwell is expected to be handed the job on a temporary basis. Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs is highly thought of. John Doolan, who formed part of Uwe Rosler’s backroom staff at Wigan, is first team coach to Stubbs. Ex-player Danny Wilson presents another option. Mackay won just five of his 25 fixtures in charge and picked up only three home points - damning statistics referenced in the club’s official statement last night. Sharpe said: ‘This is a very difficult decision to make but I feel that, for the long-term future of the club, there needs to be a change now.’ Sportsmail understands Mackay was close to suffering the sack back in February but victory away at Reading granted him a stay of execution. Wigan were content with keeping their boss until at least the end of the season and had faith in the divisive figure. Sources at the DW Stadium also indicated that Mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at Cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so. He remained defiant that they could stay in the division immediately after losing against Derby: ‘It’s still mathematically possible. I’ve got a team there which is putting performances in every week. It’s fine lines between winning and losing in this league.’ Derby's players celebrate after Chris Martin's goal gave them the lead in their win over Wigan on Monday . Substitute Darren Bent puts the result beyond doubt, sealing Mackay's fate as Wigan lost again . May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City. June 2011: After Dave Jones is sacked following a Championship play-off semi-final defeat, Malky Mackay is appointed manager. February 2012: Mackay leads Cardiff to their first League Cup final, which they lose to Liverpool on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time. May 2012: Cardiff lose in the play-off semi-final again, but Mackay retains his post.

August 2013: After around £35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight, Tan publicly tells Mackay to ensure there is a positive return on his investment. October 2013: Mackay's head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds. December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given 'a single penny' for transfers.

December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager 'for the foreseeable future'.
