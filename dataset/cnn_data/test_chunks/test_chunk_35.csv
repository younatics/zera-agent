"Photographs of two teenagers who flew to Turkey in a bid to join ISIS were revealed last night, as a Muslim leader warned they could be followed by friends. Farouk Younis, the imam of the mosque used by relatives of Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal, said Muslims must talk to other teenagers who ‘might be looking at them and thinking this is the way’. The 17-year-olds from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire - billed by their families as two ‘ordinary Yorkshire lads’ - are believed to have travelled to war-torn Syria after going to Turkey on Tuesday last week. 'Ordinary Yorkshire lads': Hassan Munshi (left) and Talha Asmal (right), both 17 and from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, are thought to have fled to war-torn Syria after travelling to Turkey on March 31 . Mosque: Farouk Younis, the imam of the Masjid e Zakaria (above) in Dewsbury used by relatives of the boys, said Muslims must talk to other teenagers who 'might be looking at them and thinking this is the way' And Mr Younis told The Times: ‘We need to talk to their friends and show them the barbaric things that are going on there [in Syria] which are totally against Islam.’ The imam of the Masjid e Zakaria in the Savile Town area of Dewsbury added that it was important for the teenagers’ friends to ‘understand the right thing’. The next-door neighbours are close friends and were seen playing snooker at Dewsbury Snooker Centre about a week ago, acquaintances told the newspaper. Earlier this week, police said the boys from Dewsbury were last seen by their families on the day they are believed to have flown from Manchester to Dalaman. Snooker game: The next-door neighbours were reportedly seen at Dewsbury Snooker Centre a week ago . Flew to Turkey: Teenage girls Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum are believed to be in Syria . West Yorkshire Police said it has been supporting the missing teenagers' families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the North East counter-terrorism unit. Link: Hassan is believed to be related to Hammaad Munshi (pictured) - arrested in 2005 and convicted over his role in a plot to murder non-Muslims . A statement released on behalf of the two families on Tuesday said they are devastated at what has happened. It said: ‘Our number one priority is to get Hassan and Talha back home with their families and we implore anyone who may have any information whatsoever to get in contact with the police. ‘Naturally, we are in a state of profound shock and are trying to come to terms with the predicament we find ourselves in and we hope and pray that no other family finds itself in our situation. ‘These were just two ordinary Yorkshire lads who enjoyed the things that all young people enjoy at their age. ‘Both Hassan and Talha had a promising future, as an apprentice and an A-level student respectively, and we are praying they will be back with us soon and are able to realise that future.’ The families have urged parents to be extra vigilant, saying it is ‘near impossible’ to know if children have been groomed and brainwashed. Hassan is believed to be related to Hammaad Munshi, who was arrested by counter-terrorism police in 2006 at the age of 15 and later convicted over his role in a plot to murder non-Muslims, reported The Times. The Metropolitan Police believe around 600 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq since the conflict began, while around half are believed to have returned to the UK. Nine Britons - including the son of a Labour councillor - were arrested in Turkey last week on suspicion of trying to cross the border into the neighbouring country. Waheed Ahmed was one of five adults and four children being held by Turkish authorities after they were stopped in Hatay last Wednesday. Meanwhile, teenage girls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are said to be inside Syria after flying to Turkey in February. It is understood the Bethnal Green Academy pupils from east London were following another 15-year-old girl who travelled to Syria in December.","Photos reveal 'ordinary lads' Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal, both 17 .

"With a mother as glamorous and as make-up savvy as Kim Kardashian, it's no surprise that her one-year-old daughter North West is already developing an obsession with beauty products - and shoes. The 34-year-old mom, who married rapper Kanye West in May last year, spoke with Elle.com about her daughter's budding independence and style preferences while sharing her approach to being a businesswoman, mother, wife and dressing her post-baby body. '[North] is obsessed with make-up and watching me get ready and getting ready herself,' Kim told the website. 'She just loves the process. She could not be more ultimately girly-girl.' Scroll down for video . Mini-me: Kim Kardashian and her 22-month-old daughter North West wear matching back while sightseeing in Armenia last week . The mother-of-one noted that after she gives North, who will turn two in June, a bath her adorable daughter always asks for her 'purse' because she really wants to grab her mom's make-up bag, which is inside. Kim said that if she turns around for a second, North will have her lipstick 'all over her face', so she had to give her a 'little make-up bag' of her own. Not surprisingly, the reality TV star, who often matches North's outfits to her own, admitted that she likes it when kid's wear 'mini-me styles' and she loves 'seeing kids in black'. While Kim insisted that North 'gravitates towards really simple things' when it comes to clothing, she noted that her little girl 'loves accessories'. Hot mommy: The 34-year-old, pictured in a figure-hugging nude skirt, said she thinks she dresses sexier now that is a mother . Family time: Kim can be seen holding North's hand while she and Kanye tour Armenia . Stellar style: North wore a black fringed dress, black combat boots and an olive green jacket while out with her parents . According to Kim, the toddler always requests a pair of shoes to wear first thing in the morning. She added that North 'just discovered backpacks so she loves to put them on'. In fact, North loves luggage in general. The precious tot, who has been photographed lugging a small Frozen-themed suitcase through the airport, always tries to take her mom's luggage. 'We got the Frozen suitcase so she has to carry it everywhere,' she explained. 'It took us about 30 minutes longer to get through the airport because she had to carry her suitcase herself.’ She noted that North didn't want to be picked up, adding: 'She's very independent . Holiday spirit: North donned a flower and a white ensemble that matched her mother's dress when the Kardashian family went to church on Easter . Matching looks: Kim and North donned neutral coats during a trip to the airport . Kim believes that her daughter's independence may have to do with the fact she was adamant about North sleeping in her own room - and now that's where she prefers to be. 'She kind of likes to be in her own room and that has allowed [Kanye and I] to have our time together,' she said. Kim said that she doesn't want to tell anyone how to parent, but it was important to her as a new mom that she set boundaries and dedicate five to ten percent of her day to herself in order to maintain her sanity. 'It worked for me to be able to get my work out in, make me feel good about myself, put my daughter down to bed at a decent time, and have the night with my husband,' she said. In sync: North, who loves accessories, was photographed wearing a YSL bag to the airport and striped pants that matched her mom's button-down shirt . And because those post-baby workouts helped her get back in shape, she has a newfound confidence that has has inspired her to flaunt her body in cleavage-baring tops and figure-hugging dresses. '[I think I dress] sexier now than I did before,' she said of her mommy style. Kim and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe are preparing for the launch of their latest Kardashian Kids children's collection at Nordstrom.com on Monday, and the entrepreneur noted that she always gives 100per cent of herself to every project she takes on. 'Nothing comes easy,' she said. 'I know that people joke all the time and try to figure out, you know, what it is that I do, but I work really hard. I get up every day at 5 a.m. and start my day.'","The 34-year-old also revealed that she spends five to ten percent of her day away from her daughter so she can workout and be alone with her husband .

"Awaiting his execution in a six-by-eight foot death row cell, Christian Longo believes he can no longer be redeemed for his horrific crimes. The father-of-three was sentenced to death for murdering his family, stuffing them in suitcases and dumping their bodies in coastal bays in Oregon in December 2001 to 'escape the shackles of domestic life'. He then went on a booze-fuelled holiday to the resort of Cancun, Mexico, where he posed as a shamed New York Times reporter - before he was captured by the FBI, arrested and charged. Now a film about his life, True Story, starring James Franco and Jonah Hill, has been released, and the brutal killer has spoken out from behind bars. Scroll down for video . Christian Longo, who murdered his wife and three children in Oregon in 2001 before going on an alcohol-fulled Mexican trip believes he can no longer be redeemed for his horrific crimes. He is pictured during his defense testimony before he was sentenced to death . A film about his life starring Jonah Hill as former New York Times journalist Mike Finkel (left) has been released. The murderer is being played by James Franco (right) Writing letters to People from Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem, he says guilt is a 'pervasive part of my daily existence, the reality that all my frequent nightmares are made from. 'But I realize I can't do anything about it now, except to try to live as positively as possible with a view that I don't deserve the breaths I get to take... I don't feel that I can be redeemed. 'I believe that some actions are so terrible that nothing can ever atone for them.' The case began to unravel when the body of Longo's four-year-old son Zachary was discovered on December 19, 2001. A pillowcase filled with rocks had been tied to his leg. His sister Sadie, three, was found three days later. Then the remains of his wife, Mary Jane, 34, and a third sibling Madison, two were retrieved on December 27. The pair were found stuffed inside a suitcase weighted down by dumbbells. As soon as the bodies were found in coastal areas near the family's condominium, Longo became the prime suspect. But he had disappeared south of the border and assumed the identity of Mike Finkel, a New York Times journalist who had been fired for inventing a character in a piece about the African slave trade. After snorkeling, swigging beer, hitting nightclubs and romancing a German woman he had met, he was spotted. His wife Mary Jane (top left) and his three children Zach, four (far right), Sadie, three (center), and two-year-old Madison were all killed, stuffed in bags or suitcases, weighed down and then thrown in rivers. Prosecutors say Longo (top right) killed his family to 'escape the shackles of domestic life' Longo (left) is played by Franco in the movie which is based on the relationship he built with shamed New York Times journalist Mike Finkel - who fabricated a story . Plastic-covered photos of Mary Jane (left), and her children sit on the dock at a makeshift memorial in Newport, Oregon . The FBI transferred him stateside, where he was arrested and charged with murder. He was found guilty after a month-long trial and sentenced to death. True Story is based by Finkel, who formed an unlikely friendship with Longo. What unfolds is a complex relationship as Finkel, played by Jonah Hill, meets Franco's Longo, an Oregon man awaiting trial for brutally killing his wife and three children. The two men find common ground in writing but the dynamic wavers as each man struggles with his search for intellectual credibility. Finkel told People: 'The scariest thing about him is that there is nothing scary about him. 'He's a witty, very intelligent guy, and I'm still completely flummoxed by what drove him. I don't believe in the death penalty, but I believe he belongs exactly where he is. He's despicable to the core.' In preparation for the film he dined with Jonah Hill in New York, but in a recent interview with his former employer, conducted after he had seen the film, Finkel claimed some of the scenes had been fabricated. He also visited the set once as Longo's trial was being recreated, an experience he admitted was traumatic. Finkel told the Times: 'It brought back some very uncomfortable flashbacks. I never forget at the heart of this story is three murdered children and a murdered wife. That's the nature of this material - it's tragic, creepy and compelling.' Longo travelled to Mexico and assumed the identity of  shamed New York Times reporter Mike Finkel. After learning of the alias, Finkel travelled to Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem to meet the murderer. The film True Story  is based on his experiences and the unlikely friendship he struck up . The journalist still keeps in contact with Longo on a regular basis. The prisoner calls him on the first Sunday of every month. 'There's always this internal tug of war over whether I should pick up the phone or not, but I usually do,' Finkel added. In January, Franco, who is playing the killer, said: 'He's probably the worst person that I've ever played, just because I have such a great family and there's just something so horrible about killing your kids. So I have very little connection to him.' To prepare, Franco watched tapes of Longo testifying at his 2003 trial, which he called 'chilling,' but he opted not to visit the convicted killer currently on Death Row. 'There was no need to go and meet him, and I certainly didn't want to give him any attention or validation by doing that.' From his cell is campaigning to donate his organs after he is executed in an attempt to repay society. In 2011, he was denied a request to drop his appeals in exchange for being allowed to donate organs and donation officials have labelled the idea 'morally reprehensible'. 'Why go out and waste your organs when you have the potential to go out and save six to 12 lives?' Longo said from his cell. A moratorium on executions has been in place in Oregon since 2011. While Longo awaits his death sentence, he is locked in a cell for 21 hours a day.

"The First Family has kicked off this year's Easter celebrations. President Barack Obama arrived at the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, on Sunday morning with his wife and daughters for the festive service. Rev Howard-John Wesley opened the service by welcoming the president, before urging the congregation not to take selfies with him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Festive: The First Family pictured outside Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, after the service . President in the house: Obama can be seen to the right of the picture above worshiping on Sunday . Singalong: The family (pictured in the second row of the congregation) joined in with upbeat hymns . 'How fitting that on the day we celebrate the rising of our Lord and savior, we also welcome our sitting president,' Wesley said, as the congregation rose to their feet in applause. 'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' It acted as the warm up for the annual Easter Roll, during which Barack and Michelle will perform their highly-anticipated dance to Uptown Funk. Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents. The choir- including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties- sang a lively rendition of the hymn 'He Lives,' stirring most of the church, filled to capacity, to clap, sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering. The lively pastor based his sermon around a scripture from 1 Corinthians 15 on the life and resurrection of Christ. People queued around the block for the service in Alexandria, monitored by federal security officers . Gathered in their Sunday best, the crowds prepared to worship in the 1803 church where Bill Clinton once sang . 'Where do you stand in the resurrection of Christ,' he asked. 'You either believe it or reject it.' Wesley said the sacrifices of Christ allowed the congregation to be forgiven for their own sins. 'He took the pain for me. I owe him my life. I owe him my praise. I owe him my hallelujah,' he said. On Monday, children will flock from every state to decorate eggs on the South Lawn of the White House. Guests, around 35,000 of them, will enjoy a yoga garden and outdoor food stalls. The 'roll' is a race, with children pushing an egg down a grass track using a long spoon. And this year's performance will come from the president himself, it has emerged. Appearing on Jimmy Fallon's talk show this week, the First Lady revealed that she will be performing a routine with So You Think You Can Dance contestants on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. Well wishes: Michelle Obama tweeted this message to her thousands of followers on Sunday morning . Getting ready: This cardboard cut out of the presidential dogs Bo and Sunny is out for tomorrow's Easter Roll . Not dressed up yet: The pups are expected to make an appearance at the event... but not in bunny ears . It will be to the tune of Uptown Funk. Michelle said she has been practicing the dance, called Gimme Five!, for over a year in the hope that it will inspire children to exercise. Alfred Street Baptist Church dates back to the time when Thomas Jefferson was in the White House. According to the church's website, the Alexandria Baptist Society was formed in 1803 when members split from another church in the Northern Virginia city, and a slave was baptized that year as its first black member. Three years later, black members established the Colored Baptist Society as a 'conjoined' church. In 2000, President Bill Clinton visited Alfred Street a few days before the November election as he sang with the gospel choir and appealed for a large turnout of black voters for Vice President Al Gore in his race against Republican George W. Bush.","Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha Obama attended Alfred St Baptist Church .

"Janet Faal, who has suffered from agoraphobia for a decade, fell down an uncovered manhole . An agoraphobic grandmother who conquered her fear of open spaces and left home for the third time in 10 years only to fall down a manhole. Janet Faal, 57, was out with a friend in Crawley, West Sussex, as part of her rehabilitation when she moved a wooden pallet to help them reverse and plunged down into the open gap. She now has two black eyes and a suspected fractured leg after smashing her face on the pallet and was left in a 'splits' position as only one of her legs went down the hole when she slipped. The grandmother-of-four said: 'I was with a friend helping her reverse out of a car park, and there was this wooden pallet in the way. 'I moved the pallet out of the way with my foot and I was going to turn around to my friend say ""is that far enough?"". 'I took a step over - never in my life did I think there was a hole underneath, I thought it had just fallen over. The next thing I remember is the pain. It was awful. 'I fell and smashed my face on the pallet, and I was in the hole with blood all over me and I couldn't move.' She reckons she has been set back 'years' in her battle with the debilitating condition, which has left her housebound for a decade, and fears she'll never leave her home again. Miss Faal, who lives in Crawley, said: 'It's hard for me to go anywhere, but I was getting better. Now I'm not so sure.' She spent nearly an hour waiting in agony on the forecourt of Complete Tyre Services on Friday, April 10, before a paramedic arrived to take her to East Surrey hospital. Scroll down for video . Her son Andy MacDonald, 39, a painter and decorator, said: 'I'm absolutely livid. Whoever owns that manhole should get it fixed and get it fixed right now. 'It's ruined my mother's recovery. I can't believe it. Whoever owns that manhole has something serious to answer for. Miss Faal was trying to move a wooden pallet when she fell down the gap, smashing her face and trapping her leg on the way down. She's been left with two black eyes and bruising . 'I'm self-employed, and I have to take time off work to care for my disabled mum, who has been knocked for six by negligence. 'If she was smaller she would have gone all of the way down - a slender woman or child could have been very seriously hurt.' An employee at the company, where Miss Faal's friend had driven her to get a new tyre for her car, claimed the holes have been reported 'loads of times' to the owner of the site. The manhole (pictured) at Complete Tyre Services in Crawley had been covered by a wooden pallet . The site is leased from the owner of JP Supplies, which sells safety clothing to the construction industry in the neighbouring unit. A spokesman for South East Coast Ambulance Service confirmed its attendance and explained why it took so long for an ambulance to arrive. He said: 'When the call came in, with the information provided by the caller, it was classified as a ""class C"" call. 'We always do our best to back up the first paramedic as soon as we can but life-threatening calls have to take priority.' Neither the tyre shop or their landlord JP Supplies are accepting responsibility for fixing the broken manhole. A worker at the garage said: 'We have been trying to get the manholes in the forecourt fixed for years, but what's happened is they were covered with pallets.' The building owner, who also runs nearby business JP Services, said: 'They are the tenants, so it's down to them to fix the manhole cover. 'I'm the landlord, but they have not spoken to me about it.' Agoraphobia is 'a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn't be available if things went wrong', according to the NHS website. The site explains that though it's often thought that the condition is a fear of open spaces the reality is not quite as straightforward, with some sufferers also fearing public transport and shopping centres. When agoraphobics are exposed to their fears several symptoms can sweep over them, including a feeling of nausea, rapid heartbeat and breathing, and rising temperature. The cause of agoraphobia can vary from person to person, with some people developing a fear of a certain situation or place because they experienced a panic attack there and then try to avoid it. Others may develop the condition through a fear of crime or being involved in an accident. Treatments may involve counselling, relaxation training or taking antidepressants. NHS Direct says: 'In the UK, up to two people in 100 have a panic disorder and it is . thought around a third of those will go on to develop agoraphobia as a . result.'

"She's a household name and has graced Australian TV screens  throughout the early Seventies and Eighties, but it's her appearance as a bubbly, upbeat housewife on the Ajax Spray'n'Wipe advertisements that is perhaps Paula Duncan's most famous role. However, despite the glossy, upbeat image portrayed on our screens, Duncan, now 62, has revealed she attempted to commit suicide at age 43, and that her teenage daughter Jessica Orcsik was the one who found her. 'I woke up and there was an ambulance and Jess was waiting for me at home,' Duncan told Studio 10 in a sobering interview. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Actress Paula Duncan revealed her battle with depression and attempt to take her own life in an interview with Studio 10 . Harrowing: The actress' daughter Jessica Orcsik explained her memories of finding her mother and calling an ambulance . 'I said ‘What happened?’ and she said, ‘Mum, the supermarket rang to say you’d collapsed in a foetal position in the park.’ 'I had no idea when or how. I don’t know if I was losing brain cells or if the pain was that hard to endure I just didn’t even want to think or feel anymore,' she told Studio 10. A few days later she began taking antidepressants, and it was during this time Duncan reveals she attempted to take her own life, with daughter Jessica finding her after a suicide attempt. Distressing: Orcsik (pictured with her mother in 2002) being the one to discover her was the hardest part of Duncan's experience, the pair explained in the interview . Behind the screen: The actress, best known these days as the bubbly face of Spray'n'Wipe, has revealed her marriage breakdowns contributed to her depression . 'My first instinct was to call 000, roll her on her side, it was kind of crazy,' said Orcsik. 'I think for her knowing I found her like that, is probably the hardest thing.' Cop shop crew: Paula Duncan with former husband and co worker John Orcsik . Duncan, who suffered a marriage break down to fellow actor John Orcsik, and then subsequently a second marriage breakdown to Steve Mason, the cycle of rejection were devastating blows in her life. John Orcsik, a fellow actor from  Cop Shop, was Duncan's first love. She admits that she felt so overpowered with love for him, so much so it took precedence over the love of her baby. This left her  feeling like a bad mother, and was the start of a series of triggers she says lead to 'episode depression.' Episodic depression, according to Duncan, meant she could feel low as a result of one specific episode, despite there being a lot of happy things still happening in her life. For Duncan,  these episodes included -  feeling like a bad mother,  suffering a marriage breakdown, her mother  passing away and then her marriage to Steve Mason taking an unexpected turn for the worse. 'I was filming Strange Bedfellows and Paul Hogan and Michael Caton came up and said, ""I wouldn't read the Sunday paper if I were you.""' They said ""your husband’s just admitted he’s found his true love."" And I couldn't work anymore, I went into a very, very dark place,' she says. Around this same period she attempted suicide, Duncan received an 'Order of Australia' award from the Queen and was given a 'This is your Life' tribute, a somewhat cruel irony, that she couldn't fathom celebrating during such a dark time in her life. Her salvation came though by getting involved in charity work. From cop to cleaning queen: Cop Shop actress Paula Duncan is also famous for Ajax Spray'n'Wipe ad . Raising over nine million for paralympians and the Special Olympic program (whom she still is a patron of now), Duncan admits helping others has served more to her than she could ever give back to them. 'For anyone who is really down or depressed, the first thing you should do before anything else, is do something for someone else. If you do you will feel appreciated and you’ll find an element of self worthiness you’ll never have otherwise felt,' she says. Anyone who is suffering from depression or mental health issues should contact Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 (Australia), the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1800 273 8255 (USA) or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 (UK), or a local help group.

"When Utah photographer Alan Lawrence learned that his newborn son, Wil, had Down Syndrome his 'mind was flooded with many emotions, most of which were not positive.' Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video . 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying . The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog -- That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign . 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

"A 23-year-old resident of Columbus, Ohio, who trained with a group affiliated with al Qaeda has been arrested and charged with plotting an attack on American soil, the Justice Department revealed today. Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a naturalized American citizen of Somali descent, had been instructed by a cleric to return to the United States and carry out an act of terrorism, the indictment said. The Justice Department stated that Mohamud was also an Islamic State sympathizer, and that his brother, Abdifatah Aden, was killed fighting with the group in Syria in 2013. Terror suspect: Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, from Columbus, Ohio, has been arrested and charged with supporting terrorism after getting training in Syria . According to court documents, Mohamud left the US a year ago with the intent to go to Syria and train with a terrorist group linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. In April 2014, he purchased a one-way ticket to Greece, but during a layover in Istanbul he failed to board a connecting flight to Athens and instead made his way to Syria. Once he reached his destination, Mohamud stated that he received training in shooting weapons, breaking into houses, explosives and hand-to-hand combat. The 23-year-old Columbus man aloes said that after completing his training, a cleric with the group Jabhat al-Nusrah instructed him to return to the US and commit an act of terror. The 23-year-old returned to the US in June 2014 with a plot to attack a military base or a correctional facility, targeting people in uniform, according to court documents. 'Mohamud talked about doing something big in the United States,' the papers cited by ABC News indicate. 'He wanted to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style.' On Thursday, Mohamud was indicted on one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to terrorists, one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and one count of making false statements to the FBI. The first two counts, providing material support to terrorists and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization are each crimes punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, left, speaks with his defense attorney, Sam Shamansky, during a hearing to set bond on state charges of money laundering and providing support for terrorism in February . Making false statements involving international terrorism carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison. Mohamud was arrested on state charges February 21, 2015, and is expected to be transferred into federal custody based on today’s indictment. Before Mohamud's brother was killed in battle on or around June 3, 2014, the two had exchanged emails discussing the 23-year-old's plans to travel to Syria and fight with Islamic State. In February, Mohamud asked Abdifatah Aden how he could send him money. Later that month, Mohamud was arrested at his Columbus home for allegedly providing a computer tablet an other material support to terroist organizations aborad. Prosecutor Ron O'Brien at the time asked a judge to set Mohamud's bond at $1million saying he was a flight risk and posed a threat to public safety. Mohamud's attorney, Sam Shamansky, insisted that his client was not a terrorist and would not flee because he was taking care of his ailing mother in Ohio.","Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, from Columbus, said he got training from terror group linked to al Qaeda in Syria .

"A married Mormon elementary school teacher had a sexual relationship with one of his 12-year-old students - and was only stopped when her classmates told other teachers, police have revealed. Kenne Worthen, 27, allegedly started flirting with the sixth grader at Longview Elementary School in Phoenix last August and the relationship turned sexual in January, Fox10 reported. The father-of-one allegedly kept in contact with the girl outside school by messaging her on an iPod app, Google Hangouts, where she labeled his profile with a fake name, 'Jesse Smith'. Some of the conversations were sexual in nature, according to police, while in another, the teacher told the student he was worried she would feel guilty and tell his wife or the police. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Kenne Worthen, pictured left in his mug shot and right in his teacher's headshot, was arrested on Friday after it emerged that he allegedly had a sexual relationship with one of his 12-year-old students . Earlier this year, he allegedly asked her mother if the girl could stay behind after class. On April 10, they had sexual contact at the school, the girl told police. 'He contacted my daughter's mother and said, ""Can she stay after school and help with something?"" and mom said, ""Of course, why not?""' the girl's enraged father told Fox10. 'There should've been no reason why my child was in a classroom alone with a teacher.' The father, who has not been identified, called the alleged relationship 'sickening' but applauded his daughter's fellow students, who told another staff member last Friday that they thought Worthen and the student were having inappropriate contact. 'I honestly couldn't thank them enough for what they've done for my daughter in this case, because who knows how much longer this would have gone on had they not said anything,' he said. After the students told staff, they called the police, according to a statement from the school district. When asked about the relationship, the girl initially denied it but later admitted to it, according to KPHO. Family: 27-year-old Worthen is pictured with his wife Danielle and their two-year-old daughter . 'Fears': In messages to the girl, he allegedly expressed fears she would tell his wife about the relationship . 'Sick': He allegedly kept in contact with the girl outside of school by messaging her on an iPod app . Worthen, who has no criminal record, also allegedly admitted to having sexual contact with the girl after contacting her over the internet. He was arrested at the school on Friday afternoon and is facing charges of luring a minor for sexual exploitation, child molestation and sexual conduct with a minor. He has been denied bond. On Monday, Osborn School District Superintendent Patricia Tate sent a letter to parents about the incident. 'He has been put on administrative leave and will not be returning to Longview,' the letter read. 'If anyone has information or questions specific to this case, please contact the Phoenix Police Department at 602-262-6151. The safety of your children is and always will be our first priority.' Police said they do not believe there are other victims. Speaking to Fox10, the girl's father said he was overwhelmed with anger towards Worthen. 'You have this anger, the anger towards the perpetrator, and a feeling that you physically want to harm that person,' he said. 'Then there's an anger at least for me towards the school, because you send your child there thinking they're going to be safe.' In court: Following his arrest on Friday, the teacher appeared in court (pictured) but was denied bond . Scene: Worthen, who has worked at the school (pictured) for two years, allegedly had sexual contact with her there on April 10 after getting her mother's permission to let the girl stay late after school . Worthen has taught sixth grade at the school for nearly two years. He is also an International Pathway Adjunct Professor at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where he teaches life skills and English to international students, according to his Linkedin page. 'Mr. Worthen was employed by the university as an online adjunct instructor,' a university spokesperson told DailyMail.com. 'However, his employment was terminated as soon as the university was made aware of his arrest.' He has also previously held after-school teacher roles in Idaho and volunteered as a Boy Scuots supervisor, according to his Linkedin page. The profile also suggests he is a follower of the Church of Latter-Day Saints. His wife, Danielle, also lists herself as a Mormon online. They have a two-year-old daughter together. Hangouts is a Google app that allows users to share conversations, photos and video chats.

"Between iPhones, flat-screens and designer headphones, Australians are spending more on technology than ever. A new report from Suncorp Bank suggests Australian's have spent 50 per cent more on digital devices than they planned in the last year. The report found Australians spent $20 billion on digital devices and services - or on average $2,300 each - on technology and communication devices in the last 12 months. A new report from Suncorp Bank suggests Australian's have spent 50 per cent more on digital devices than they planned in the last year, with mobile phone bills as the biggest expense . Men spent twice as much as women on computers, digital accessories, mobile apps, and streaming services. On average, men spent $2618 over the last 12 months, $475 more than women. The report also found that families with children living at home are spending 50 per cent more to stay digitally connected to the world than singles, couples without children and empty nesters. 'The report found adults without children living at home spent an average of $2,006 on technology and communication each year, while those costs ballooned to $2,993 per adult if they have at least one child under their roof,' said Suncorp Bank Regional Manager, Monique Reynolds.

"A large protest opposing the closure of remote indigenous communities in WA has shut down streets in central Melbourne. Several thousand people gathered outside the city's main railway station Flinders Street at 4pm on Friday. 'Enough is enough - where is the justice for Aboriginal people?' a speaker shouted to the crowd before the walk through CBD streets, flanked by police. This comes as the Queensland Police Service refuses to issue an apology to an Indigenous officer after claims the word 'Abor' was written on his station roster by a senior sergeant, the ABC reports.

Several thousand people gathered outside the city's main railway station Flinders Street at 4pm on Friday . Protesters take part in a traditional smoking ceremony in Melbourne during the rally . Indigenous leaders have also been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people . The rally forced the closure of Flinders and Elizabeth streets, where surrounding streets soon became clogged with cars and trams forced to stop. Rally goers gathered again outside Flinders Street station, blocking the intersection, just on 5pm. Police, on foot and on riot horses, followed the marchers all the way. Jason Maxwell, 31 of South East Dandenong Ranges, was among the protesters. 'I disagree, strongly disagree, in selling out on the aboriginal communities just for money,' Mr Maxwell told AAP.

The rally forced the closure of Flinders and Elizabeth streets, where surrounding streets soon became clogged with cars and trams forced to stop . He said the WA and Federal governments should recognise the importance of the link between indigenous people and their lands, and it was wrong to describe this as a lifestyle choice. 'It is the worst thing that a modern government could ever say,' Mr Maxwell said. 'It's a political tool to separate us, and I think it is wrong.' The protesters did not enjoy universal support, with a heckler heard to shout 'move over to WA'. Hugh Jackman spoke up against the West Australian government's effort to shut down as many as half of the state's 270 remote communities . Just last month, Hollywood star Hugh Jackman spoke up against the West Australian government's effort to shut down as many as half of the state's 270 remote communities. In a message posted on social media, Jackman said: 'While living in a remote community I came to understand the 'connection' to land is a fundamental part of Indigenous identity, think about the past, have quality conversations. I SUPPORT YOU'. Indigenous leaders have also been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people. Following this is an ABC report of a senior sergeant referring to an Indigenous officer as 'Abor' on a station roster and also writing 'gay' next to the name of another at Coolangatta Police Station. The two Queensland officers reportedly sought an apology as they lodged complaints regarding the senior sergeant to the Anti-Discrimination Commission. However the ABC believes both the police service and senior officer have refused to make the apology, as the two incidences had been taken 'out of context'. The senior sergeant further refuted the claims and also blamed officers for taking notes from his desk. The matters are currently before the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal.

"Children who watch films featuring alcohol consumption are more likely to binge drink, a new study has revealed. Scientists quizzed more than 5,000 British teenagers about their drinking habits and the films they had watched from a list of 50, including Bridget Jones' Diary and Aviator. Those who had watched the most films which featured characters drinking alcohol were 20 per cent more likely to have tried alcohol and 70 per cent more likely to binge drink. Danger: Young people who watch films where characters drink alcohol (such as The Hangover) are more likely to binge drink . The research also revealed that between 1989 and 2008 almost three quarters of popular UK box office films depicted alcohol use - but only six per cent were classified as adult only. Lead author Andrea Waylen, from Bristol University, said children were not getting an accurate perception of drinking  - and called for films to be rated by alcohol content. She said: 'Alcohol is a drug and it has potentially adverse effects, not only for individuals but also for family and friends. 'It's not very often that we see the adverse effects of alcohol portrayed - like vomiting, rotten hangovers. 'In my view, we don't really get an accurate representation of what alcohol is like.' The research is the latest installment from the Children of the 90s study. It involved 5,000 British 15-year-olds who were questioned on a variety of topics in the mid-2000s. They were asked which films they had seen from a list of 50 popular releases the researchers had already watched  - and had added up the minutes in each film that showed alcohol use. Role model: Daniel Craig's character James Bond (left) is partial to a vodka martini. The new research revealed that between 1989 and 2008 almost three quarters of popular UK box office films depicted alcohol use - but only six per cent were classified as adult only . The results revealed that children who had watched the most alcohol scenes were almost two-and-a-half times more likely to have a drink more than once per week. They were also twice as likely to have alcohol-related problems than those less exposed. The study concluded that the current rating system was not adequate for parents trying to limit their childrens' exposure to drinking. Dr Waylen added: 'My guess is there needs to be a level of identification with the drinker in the film. 'Kids are more likely to identify with consuming characters in films where alcohol use is made to look cool, get you friends, win the girl or boy. 'Adverse outcomes from alcohol use are a large societal public health problem and rating films according to alcohol content may reduce problem-related alcohol use and associated harm in young people.' The study was published in the journal Pediatrics.","Scientists quizzed more than 5,000 teenagers about their drinking habits .

"Vijay Chokal-Ingam claims that he posed as a black man while he applied to medical schools in 1998 because he believed he had a better chance of gaining acceptance . The older brother of comedienne Mindy Kaling has controversially claimed he was only accepted into medical school in the late 1990s because he posed as a black man. Writing on his blog, Almost Black, Vijay Chokal-Ingam says that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the St. Louis University School of Medicine and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the United States. 'I was determined to become a doctor and I knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were, let's say… less stringent?' wrote Chokal-Ingam. 'I got into medical school because I said I was black. The funny thing is I'm not.' Chokal-Ingam admits that his sister did not support him during his social experiment and specifically asked him not to do it. He claims in 1998 he shaved his head, trimmed his 'long Indian eyelashes' and joined the Organization of Black Students during the process. His change in appearance was 'so startling that my own fraternity brothers didn't recognize me'. 'Vijay the Indian-American frat boy became Jojo the African American Affirmative Action applicant to medical school,' he said, claiming that Jojo was the middle name he was born with. Though his website, AlmostBlack.com, shows side-by-side qualifications and pictures of Chokal-Ingam as an Indian-American man (left) and a black man (right), he doesn't specify if he went through the same application process as an Inidan-American man as he did a black man . As an Indian-American with a GPA of 3.1, MCAT of 31 and a member of the South Asian Student Association, he didn't think he'd get into medical school, but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization, he thought he could get in to some of the top schools in the nation. 'I became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in America, including Harvard, Wash U, UPenn, Case Western, and Columbia,' he said about the application process. 'In all, I interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across America, while posing a black man,' he added. Despite his startling claims, Chokal-Ingam fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an Indian-American man. He also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise have gone to an African-American. When he was finally accepted to St. Louis University School of Medicine, he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was 'wrong' with affirmative action. Chokal-Ingam said that his sister, sitcom star and comedienne Mindy Kaling told him not to move forward with the book . Indeed, Chokal-Ingam admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor. Chokal-Ingam also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating. 'Not everything worked out as planned,' he wrote on his website. 'Cops harassed me. Store clerks accused me of shoplifting. Women were either scared of me or couldn't keep their hands off me. What started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment.' Unsurprisingly, Chokal-Ingam has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims. The Daily Beast claims that though his experience 'revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism', he didn't bring everything he could to the table. 'He chooses to sidestep, downplay, or flat-out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations,' Stereo Williams wrote. 'It's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who 'gets it', while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary,' he added. And though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man, he doesn't specify if he went through the application process as an American-Indian man. 'Chokal-Ingam seems to have assumed that he would've gotten nowhere as an Indian American applicant and dove head first into this poorly-conceived 'experiment' before determining otherwise,' Williams wrote. And more so, Williams claims that Chokal-Ingam's experiment 'is insulting to what black people endure in this country, both institutionally and culturally'. Williams claims: 'And as a person of color, it's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies. 'Black people can't be as 'racist' as whites societally, Mr. Chokal-Ingam. You didn't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black-owned and operated hospitals. 'And a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work. 'The attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false 'equality' is truly regrettable. But when you conduct social 'experiments' that cite C. Thomas Howell's Soul Man as an inspiration, it's obvious that you don't take these issues all that seriously.' A spokesperson for Mindy Kaling was unavailable for comment.","Vijay Chokal-Ingam claims he posed as a black man and was accepted into the St. Louis University School of Medicine in 1998 .

"President Barack Obama staunchly defended a framework nuclear agreement with Iran as a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' to prevent a bomb and bring longer-term stability to the Middle East. He insisted the U.S. would stand by Israel if it were to come under attack, but acknowledged that his pursuit of diplomacy with Tehran has caused strain with the close ally. 'It's been a hard period,' Obama said in a weekend interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. He added that it is 'personally difficult' for him to hear his administration accused of not looking out for Israel's interests. Scroll down for video . On the back foot: Barack Obama phrased his actions in negotiations with Iran as an attempt to 'take the nuclear issue off the table'. Iran has agreed to restrict its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions . Now in his seventh year in office, Obama cast the Iran talks as part of a broader foreign policy doctrine that sees American power as a safeguard that gives him the ability to take calculated risks. 'We are powerful enough to be able to test these propositions without putting ourselves at risk,' he said, citing his overtures to Cuba and Myanmar as other examples of his approach. The president's comments come days after the U.S. and other world powers reached a tentative agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The framework cleared the way for negotiators to hammer out technical details ahead of a June 30 deadline for a final deal. Negotiations: Secretary of State John Kerry, right with Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, was involved in the nuclear talks in Lausanne, Switzerland . Obama argued that successful negotiations presented the most effective way to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but insisted he would keep all options on the table if Tehran were to violate the terms. 'I've been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it,' Obama said in the interview published Sunday. 'But I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement — and that it ushers a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations — and, just as importantly, over time, a new era in Iranian relations with its neighbors.' The president said there are many details that still need to be worked out with the Iranians and cautioned that there would be 'real political difficulties' in implementing an agreement in both countries. He reiterated his opposition to a legislation that would give the U.S. Congress final say in approving or rejecting a deal, but said he hoped to find a path to allow Congress to 'express itself.' Victory? Obama looked forward to 'a new era' of relations with Iran. Pictured above is the nation's president, Hassan Rouhani . The White House plans an aggressive campaign to sell the deal to Congress, as well as to skeptical Arab allies who worry about Iran's destabilizing activity in the region. The president has invited leaders of six Gulf nations to Washington this spring and said he wanted to 'formalize' U.S. assistance. On the substance of the Iran framework agreement, Obama outlined more specifics of how the U.S. would seek to verify that Tehran wasn't cheating. He said there would be an 'international mechanism' that would assess whether there needed to be an inspection at a suspicious site and could overrule Iranian objections. The nuclear talks have marked a remarkable shift in the frozen relationship between the U.S. and Iran. It has become normal for officials from both countries to communicate and hold face-to-face meetings. Obama is yet to meet with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, though they did speak on the phone. He has also exchanged letters with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Obama said the letters include 'a lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran.' But he said the concessions Khamenei allowed his negotiators to make in the nuclear talks suggests that 'he does realize that the sanctions regime that we put together was weakening Iran over the long term, and that if in fact he wanted to see Iran re-enter the community of nations, then there were going to have to be changes.'","President defended negotiations that will lift sanctions on Iran .

"Lindsay Jo Rimer went missing from Hebden Bridge and her body was found in a canal five months later . The sister of murdered schoolgirl Lindsay Jo Rimer has spoken of her family's agony as they still hope to find her killer 20 years after her death. Lindsay Jo was 13 when she went missing after going to the shops in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire. Her body was discovered in Rochdale canal five months later, weighed down with a 20lb rock. The teenager's sister Kate described her family's struggle since Lindsay Jo's death as a 'life sentence'. She has spoken out for the first time as detectives launch a new bid to find Lindsay Jo's killer as they admit they are still searching for the 'golden nugget' to bring justice to her family. Ms Rimer said: 'I was 20 at the time and still remember when mum called me to say my little sister was missing. I felt instantly that something was wrong. 'And then five months later she was found. 'From the beginning we have been filled with grief and we cannot stop the grief and instead remember her with love until this comes to an end. 'We miss her so much but every memory of her is tainted - it is so painful and bleeds into everything we do.' Ms Rimer, who now lives on the south coast, decided to speak out in a video as the 20th anniversary of when her sister's body was found approaches this Sunday. She added: 'It is about time this came to an end - it is a life sentence for this family. Ms Rimer said when her own daughter started school a teacher, who had also moved to the south from Bradford, asked if she had any connection to the Lindsay Jo case because of her surname. Scroll down for video . 'She had to say that Lindsay would have been her auntie,' said Ms Rimer. Lindsay Jo was last seen in Hebden Bridge on November 7 1994. She left her home on Cambridge Street to go to the shops and paused briefly at the Trades Club on Holme Street where she met her mother before buying cornflakes at the Spar shop. As the 20th anniversary of her sister's body being found approaches, Kate Rimer speaks about the struggle the family have faced as Lindsay Jo's killer has not been found for two decades . CCTV from the shop on Crown Street shows her buying the cornflakes at 10.22pm. It is not known what happened to her then. Her body was found in the Rochdale Canal on April 12 1995. Detective Superintendent Simon Atkinson, from West Yorkshire Police, said previous publicity has helped generate new leads and they are hopeful that they may be able to find fresh clues as to the identity of her killer. But he said: 'We are, however, still waiting for that one 'golden nugget' of information that will finally crack the case and bring closure to Lindsay's grieving family. 'Anyone who watches the clip of Kate's interview will be moved by what she has to say. It is clear that the pain still runs as deep as it did 20 years ago and nothing will ever completely erase the memory but bringing Lindsay's killer to justice will at least bring some closure to the family. 'Someone somewhere knows what happened to Lindsay and I am appealing again, directly, to that person to come forward and help me solve the case. CCTV from 1994 show Lindsay Jo walking along the aisles of the Spar shop where she bought cornflakes . 'For 20 years Lindsay's family have had to live with the pain and the hurt of not knowing what happened to her as her killer continues to enjoy their liberty.' The officer said: 'All we know is that Lindsay's body was found five months later on Wednesday April 12 1995, with the ultimate indignity to her and to her family that her body was left to rot in a watery grave. 'Someone prepared to do this doesn't deserve any protection. It is time they were brought to justice.' Two years ago a church minister and his parishioners urged police to investigate any links with prolific paedophile Jimmy Savile, who used to stay in a caravan in Cragg Vale - close to where Lindsay Jo lived in Hebden Bridge and previously at Lower Rough Head Farm. Savile would stay at Cragg Vale, just miles from where Lindsay Jo Rimer lived, first at Lower Rough Head Farm, then Hebden Bridge .","Lindsay Jo Rimer, 13, went missing from Hebden Bridge 20 years ago .

"They are one of the most feared animals on the planet. Now fascinating images reveal how fish make a collective effort to stay out of the way of sharks. The striking photographs show a shoal of fish making way for the blacktip shark swimming in the shallow waters of Heron Island in Queensland, Australia. Incredible images show a shoal of fish making way for a blacktip shark (pictured), perhaps proving that they are instinctively frightened of it . It is thought that the reef shark was not interested in catching a meal, but the fish naturally keep their distance, creating circles of clear water around the predator. Dr Ken Collins, Senior Research Fellow and Diving Officer at the University of Southampton, told MailOnline: 'This is fairly typical behaviour for shoaling fish, the same would happen if it were a diver in the photograph rather than a shark. 'Something big is automatically accepted as a potential threat and swimming in a swirling dense shoal is a defensive move which provides mutual protection simply reducing the chances of an individual being picked off and confusing the potential “enemy"". 'Flocks of small birds will react the same way to hawks.' Fish are thought to gain many benefits from shoaling behaviour, such as keeping safe from predators as well as boosting their chances of feeding and finding a mate. It’s known that shoals of fish can change shapes and directions in seconds - as if they are thinking as one - and in these images, the fish manage to keep a pocket of clear water between themselves and the shark, even the pocket does change shape. Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the shark. The photos show a shark swimming in the shallow waters, where they are guaranteed a clear path because ‘terrified’ fish move out of their way . Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across fish trying to avoid the shark off Heron Island in Queensland, Australia (marked) It’s thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators’ jaws, because they confuse larger creatures. The ‘predator confusion effect’ is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because similar-looking fish create a sensory overload for predators. Fin movements made by a shoal seem to overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal, perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking. The fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way. The look-out is shared between individuals to let the group feed safely and swim away from predators as a group. Luckily, the 32-year-old was carrying his camera to snap the scene. ‘There were four blacktip reef sharks circling the area and there was one other type of shark - a lemon shark,’ he said. ‘We walked along the jetty looking down at a large school of fish just beneath the jetty. ‘We noticed a number of reef sharks patrolling the area near the jetty and as we watched the reef sharks slowly moved into the school of fish, with the fish retreating away from the immediate area around the shark. ‘This progressed for about 15 to 20 minutes and a lemon shark joined in on the action late in the piece. ‘It seems like the fish are well aware of the threat and are trying to keep a safer distance from it. They want to avoid being eaten!’ He noted that the sharks were ‘remarkably calm’ when moving though the fish. ‘It was certainly not what I would describe as a feeding frenzy at the time. ‘There was an occasional swift manoeuvre to attempt to catch a fish and the sharks were successful in some of these attempts. He added: ‘Watching the continuous parting of the school of fish as each shark moved through the mass of fish was absolutely spectacular!’ Whether fish feel fear (illustrated by a still from the film Finding Nemo' is a slippery question for scientists. Some studies claim that fish feel pain, but shoaling behaviour's thought to be purely instinctive . Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the sharks (pictured left and right) near a jetty . Whether fish have emotions, is a slippery question for scientists, whose studies have shown that they can feel pain in an abstract way, as well as other emotions. Whether fish feel fear, or simply act instinctively, they swim in large shoals that offer individuals more protection from predators than going it alone. Shifts in the shape of the shoal is thought to be driven by feeding, travelling and avoiding predators. It’s thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators’ jaws, because they confuse larger creatures. Proposed in 1978, the ‘predator confusion effect’ is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because the many moving targets create a sensory overload of the predator's visual channel – a theory that’s been proved in the wild and in computer simulations. There is also a theory that fin movements made by a shoal overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal, perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking. It’s possible that if one shark was found among the shoal (pictured) and others around it, they could act collectively to corral a shoal for a quick meal. The fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way. The look-out is shared between individuals to let the group feed safely and swim away from predators as a group. It’s possible that if one shark was found among the shoal and others around it, they could act collectively to corral a shoal. This behaviour isn’t common in sharks, but dolphins have been shown to surround and herd fish as a group, while individuals take it in turns to swim through the shoal, eating unlucky members. Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured and Atlantic bottlenose dolphins even chase fish onto mud banks for an easy meal. In the shark world, Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fish. Before striking they confine lots of fish in a small space by swimming round them, and then splash then strike them with the upper lobe of the tail to stun them.","Photographs show reef shark passing though a shoal in Queensland .

"Police have discovered a body they believe to be a young Indiana woman who was reported missing with her newborn daughter weeks ago in a city 180 miles away from their home. Samantha Fleming and her newborn daughter Serenity were last seen in Anderson on April 5, when they left with a woman who said she was from Indiana's Department of Child Services, according to police. The three-week-old infant was discovered unharmed at a home in Gary on Friday and will be returned to relatives. Police have discovered a body they believe to be Indiana woman Samantha Fleming (left), who was reported missing with her newborn daughter Serenity (right) weeks ago in a city 180 miles away . In the same home, police found a body doused with bleach, wrapped in plastic and stuffed in a plastic storage bin, according to Lt. Thomas Pawlak. Police were led to Gary after Fleming's cell phone signal was picked up in the city, where the young mother's wallet was also found. Fleming was reported missing by her boyfriend. According to police, Fleming left the home they shared with her daughter Serenity after the woman who claimed to be from Child Protective Services told the new mother she had to appear at a hearing. Police said the woman told Fleming the hearing was at Lake Superior Court in Hammond, which is 13 miles from the home where the body was discovered. The infant was handed over to police by a woman who is believed to be the alleged kidnapper's sister, according to the Chicago Tribune. Police have not released the name of the woman. Pawlak said the woman had arrived at the house of the alleged kidnapper, who was not there, to pick up items for the baby. The house had a nursery. 'It appears that she had been planning this,' Pawlak said. 'There was everything you would buy for a new baby. A crib, changing table, diaper bag, carrier, new clothes.' According to police, the alleged kidnapper had asked her sister to care for the baby she was passing off as her own. That is the same story one neighbor of the woman said she was also told. The body was found on Friday in the 1900 block of Cleveland Street in Gary, Indiana. Police found a nursery inside the home and a neighbor said the owner of the house had said she was pregnant with twins . The neighbor told Chicago Tribune she was friends with the alleged kidnapper, who had told her she was pregnant with twins. The 36-year-old woman then told her neighbor around Easter that one of the twins had died after she had given birth, and that the other child was in the hospital with jaundice. When the neighbor eventually saw the woman with the child, she said she found the baby to be 'lighter-skinned' than she expected. The woman also had a bandage on her hand. The alleged kidnapper asked her neighbor to watch her house because she was going out of town. Just days before the woman left, the neighbor said she saw her going back and forth from her house to garage and carrying small plastic grocery bags. The neighbor said she and her friend had been texting regularly since the woman left. But when she texted the alleged kidnapper after she saw police enter her home on Friday, the messages stopped. The alleged kidnapper was located at a hospital in Texas. Police said she is a person of interest but has not yet been arrested. Pawlak believes the alleged kidnapper was very familiar with Fleming. 'She knew a lot about this mother,' he said. 'Enough to convince her she was with CPS.'","Samantha Fleming and daughter Serenity were last seen in Anderson, Indiana on April 5 .

"The mystery hero who raced to the edge of a cliff and pulled a driver from his precariously-balanced car has been identified as a 29-year-old man who fled the scene to go to work. Jason Warnock was named as the hero who rescued 23-year-old Mathew Sitko after he crashed his car on Wednesday morning, causing it to hang off a canyon cliff in Lewiston, Idaho. But after saving the man, Warnock said he could not stay and rushed away from the scene. A photo of the moment he pulled the panicked man from the wrecked car was shared online as authorities tried to identify him. Incredible rescue: Jason Warnock, 29, has been identified as the man who saved Matthew Sitko, 23, from his car as it dangled over a cliff on Wednesday morning. He left shortly after pulling the man to safety . After he was named on Thursday, he met with the Lewiston Police Department for an interview and it emerged he had been working at the time of the crash and had to get back to his job. He told officers he had been traveling along a nearby road when he noticed debris in the road and the vehicle hanging near the edge of the cliff - so he jumped into action. He ran up to a pedestrian footbridge, climbed above the cliff face and then crossed an embankment to reach the vehicle. Once there, he tried to break the window, but couldn't. Instead, he calmed Sitko down and asked him to roll down the window, and he was then able to pull him out to safety. Afterwards, he took off. 'He said he had to go, and he left,' Lewiston police officer Eric Olson said. Driver: Mathew Sitko, 23, of Lewiston, Idaho, is believed to have suffered from an emotional episode before he crashed his car on Wednesday morning. He only suffered minor injuries and is recovering . Thankful: He wrote on his Facebook page on Wednesday that he feels 'blessed' for how his ordeal ended . Police and paramedics arrived shortly after to assist the man. 'The Lewiston Police Department would like to thank Jason Warnock for his quick and decisive actions in helping Mr. Sitko and preventing the situation from worsening,' the department said. The crash occurred about 8am Wednesday in Lewiston, at a drop called Bryden Canyon. Sitko had driven through a yard and over two terraces before getting snared in a chain-link fence. The fence is the only reason the car vehicle did not topple over into the canyon with Sitko still behind the wheel, police told the Lewiston Tribune. Police previously said the incident was triggered when Sitko had 'some sort of mental or emotional episode' and he only suffered minor injuries. Scene: Sitko crashed while driving along the winding road before crashing through the property and dangling over the edge of the drop. Warnock managed to reach him by climbing the pedestrian bridge, pictured . Witnesses say Sitko was driving erratically and swerved to miss another motorist when the crash occurred. It is unclear how far the canyon drop actually measured. Not long after the crash Sitko posted to his Facebook page that he felt blessed. 'Good morning everyone! I am truly blessed by God today!! Thank you God & Jesus for taking care of me!! I love you!' he wrote on his Facebook. Sitko lists his job as working for Moscow and Lewiston Landscaping.","Mathew Sitko, 23, crashed his car and ended up hanging over a cliff edge in Lewiston, Idaho in an 'emotional episode' Wednesday morning .

"Tabby cat George turned up 128 miles from its home after apparently hitching a ride in a caravan . A runaway cat turned up 128 miles from his home after apparently hitching a ride in a caravan. George was last seen running off in the direction of a caravan park near his home in North Wales and was found on a doorstep in West Yorkshire five weeks later. He has now been reunited with his owners after Julia Hill, who found the 18-year-old tabby outside her home in Calderdale last week, posted on a lost and found cats Facebook group. Owners Steven Davison, 71, and his wife Susan, 68, from Llanrwst in the Conwy Valley, couldn't believe their luck when their daughter Gemma Davison-Lemalle, 30, saw a picture of her childhood pet on the page. Mrs Davison-Lemalle said: 'It's a miracle. Around a month ago, my dad drove to the garage in Llanrwst and as he got out of the car, he thought he saw a cat running off in the corner of his eye. 'At the time he thought nothing of it and didn't say anything but when we got home that afternoon George was nowhere to be seen. 'We think George must have sneaked into the car and ran towards the caravan site that is nearby. 'We can't think of any other way of him getting to Yorkshire other than stowing away in a vehicle or caravan belonging to a tourist. 'It's absolutely bonkers to think he travelled so far. We won't be letting him out of our sight ever again.' She revealed her pet had been was rescued from the Bryn-y-Maen animal shelter in Colwyn Bay when he was a kitten and was living with her parents when he disappeared. Her mother, Susan, said: 'Goodness only knows how he got that far - he's always been a curious cat but he's never done anything like this before. He has now been reunited with owners Steven Davison and his wife Susan (pictured together with George) 'We thought we'd lost him for good so it's amazing to have him back. We're over the moon.' But the mammoth cross-country journey took its toll on the 18-year-old cat and when the family went to collect him they realised he had cat flu. 'When we got there we realised he wasn't very well. He had cat flu,' said Gemma. 'He's back where he belongs and he is happy and settled.' Ms Hill, who found George and started the appeal, said the cat was 'poorly, thin and grumpy' when he turned up on her doorstep. 'The cat just turned up outside my house last week,' she said. Gemma Davison-Lemalle, 30, saw a picture of her childhood pet on the Facebook group and got in touch . The 128-mile journey from Llanrwst in the Conwy Valley to Calderdale, West Yorkshire, would have taken a minimum of four-and-a-half hours including two bus trips and three train changes . 'I took him to the local vets to see if he was chipped and they found he was registered to an address in North Wales. 'He was so poorly, thin and grumpy, I think he may have died if we hadn't taken pity on him. She added: 'I'm sad he's gone but I'm really pleased he has gone home to his owners. 'Steve and Sue were so pleased to see him, he was sat outside when they arrived. 'It's still a mystery how he got here, but hopefully he's none the worse for his adventure.'

After a low-key day campaigning in his constituency in Doncaster on Saturday, the Labour leader spent all of Sunday and Monday with his family. At the same time, David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon was prominent on the campaign trail. The Prime Minister was pictured kissing an orphaned lamb on Easter Sunday, and he delivered a major speech on the economy on Bank Holiday Monday yesterday. Mr Clegg spent Easter Sunday with his family, but he made a series of campaign visits yesterday. David Cameron - greeted in Belfast by Tory minister Theresa Villiers - is on a whirlwind tour of the UK his wife Samantha  - visiting Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England . Mr Cameron, holding his wife's hand, visited the Titanic Studios in Belfast, where they saw the film sets for the TV drama Game of Thrones . The Prime Minister visited Edinburgh this morning - where he tucked into breakfast with Samantha . Both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg recorded televised Easter messages, while the Labour Leader only posted a statement to Facebook. The Prime Minister has also ramped up his campaigning today – visiting constituencies in all four countries of the United Kingdom while Mr Miliband is appearing at an event in Bristol. A number of Labour MPs are concerned at Mr Miliband’s decision to appear in a third TV debate a week on Thursday. The showdown – dubbed the ‘Challengers Debate’ – will not feature the Prime Minister or his Mr Clegg, leaving the Labour leader open to attacks from the SNP, Plaid and the Greens. One MP said it was ‘madness’ for him to take part in the debate minor parties without the Tories and Lib Dems. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg works while traveling on a train to the north west of England while on the  campaign trail . Nigel Farage - who was campaigning in Kent yesterday - met workers at Bird and Yates car repairs during campaigning in Cannock in the Midlands today . First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP Nicola Sturgeon met with residents of Livingston, west Lothian . A Labour source told the Telegraph: ‘We understand that there are different views but we took a simple decision: the more people see a man with the energy, principles and the ideas to change Britain the better it is. ‘And the more opportunity we can have to speak directly with the public the better it is. ‘You can gameplay 100 different scenarios but if someone offers us 90 minutes of airtime to talk to the public, if he has a chance to talk to millions of people, we should take it.’ Mr Miliband this morning used his first campaign appearance since Saturday to launch a fresh attack on the Tory record on the NHS. The Labour leader said A&E waiting times had soared because the Government had failed to keep GP surgeries open at evenings and weekends. Addressing an audience in Bristol, he said: ‘The NHS cannot go forward if queues to see your GP are stretching backwards and I believe that Britain can do a lot better than people waiting day after day for basic healthcare. That's what our plan will do.’ While Ed Miliband went to ground yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the campaign trail - visiting supporters in Poole, Dorset . Ukip leader Nigel Farage was also out campaigning yesterday, on Bank Holiday Monday, visiting families in South Thanet, Kent . Mr Cameron meanwhile was on a whirlwind tour visiting all four nations of the UK in a day. He kicked off his aeroplane tour in Edinburgh, visiting the Scottish Widows headquarters for breakfast with wife Samantha. The Prime Minister chatted to staff about pension changes as he tucked into haggis, egg and fried bread, while Mrs Cameron had a bacon roll. He was later due to fly to Wales before addressing a rally of supporters in the south-west of England. Ahead of the 600-mile trip, Mr Cameron insisted he had a ‘simple message’. He said: ‘We have one month to save our economy from the disaster of an Ed Miliband government. ‘We have one month to save Britain from his mountain of debt; one month to save Britain from his punitive taxes; one month to save Britain, and British families, from his anti-business and anti-aspiration agenda.’ The premier said Britain had been put back on its feet over the past five years, adding all four parts of the UK were now growing.","Mr Miliband makes first appearance on the campaign trail in over 48 hours .

"Sofia Vergara's ex-fiancé has hit out at the Modern Family star, claiming that she wants to destroy two fertilized embryos that the couple created together. 'I have always strongly believed that life begins at conception and that every embryo is life on the journey towards birth,' businessman Nick Loeb, said in a statement. 'I created these two female embryos with the purpose of taking them to term and not destruction, because I have always dreamed of being a father.' Scroll down for video... Drama: Sofia Vergara's ex Nick Loeb (pictured here together in May last year) says he's always 'dreamed' of being a father ...as he defends lawsuit to keep frozen embryos . The 39-year-old filed a lawsuit last August over the two embryos. On Monday he implied that he wants to use them to have children of his own - either with the involvement of his 42-year-old ex or without her. 'I have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex, and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future, should she change her mind,' his statement, released through his lawyer Mark J. Heller, said. 'I take the responsibility and obligation of being a parent very seriously.' In a full statement to UsWeekly Loeb added: 'Where a man does want to become a father, and wants to impose no obligations on the other party, he should have that corresponding right.' Loeb is a a scion of the Loeb and Lehman families and his father ran the prestigious Wall Street investment firm Loeb, Rhoades & Co. before becoming US Ambassador to Denmark and a delegate to the United Nations. Loeb and Vergara created the embryos through in vitro fertilization in November 2013 and they remain frozen at a Beverly Hills clinic. In a full statement released to UsWeekly Nick said: 'I have always strongly believed that life begins at fertilization and that every embryo is a life on the journey towards birth. I created these two female embryos with the purpose of taking them to term and not destruction, because I have always dreamed of being a father. I have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex, and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future, should she change her mind. I take the responsibility and obligation of being a parent very seriously. Creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations, even where a man doesn’t want to become a father. Where a man does want to become a father, and wants to impose no obligations on the other party, he should have that corresponding right. However life comes to be created, it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent.' Vergara, TV's highest paid actress and one of Hollywood's hottest stars, denies that she wants to destroy the embryos - but says she has no desire to have children with her ex-fiancé, either. Last week, the Colombian beauty said through her attorney that her plan is to keep the embryos frozen indefinitely. She has a 22-year-old son Manolo with ex-husband Joe Gonzalez. Vergara broke up with Loeb last May after nearly two years of engagement. Last Christmas, she became engaged to True Blood star Joe Manganiello.

"Scientists say they have found 50 galaxies  that may contain intelligent alien races. These galaxies were found to be emitting ‘unusually high’ levels of radiation - possibly indicating ‘the presence of a highly advanced civilisation.’ Within these galaxies, the researchers said it was possible that an alien race could be harnessing the power of the stars - emitting huge amounts of noticeable heat in the process. Pennsylvania scientists have found evidence that we may not be alone. They found 50 galaxies emitting unusually high levels of radiation. This could be because aliens are harnessing the power of  stars. However, further research is needed to confirm that is the case. Shown is Arp 220, one promising galaxy candidate . The study was led by Dr Jason Wright from the Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds at Penn State University in Pennsylvania. The Glimpsing Heat from Alien Technologies Survey (G-Hat), published in the Astrophysical Journal, details how the team thought they might see the infrared signature of a race far more advanced than ours. A proposed method for harnessing the power of an entire star is known as a Dyson sphere. First proposed by theoretical physicist freeman Dyson in 1960, this would be a swarm of satellites that surrounds a star. They could be an enclosed shell, or spacecraft spread out to gather its energy - known as a Dyson swarm. If such structures do exist, they would emit huge amounts of noticeable infrared radiation back on Earth. But as of yet, such a structure has not been detected. Source: All About Space magazine . ‘The idea behind our research is that, if an entire galaxy had been colonised by an advanced spacefaring civilisation, the energy produced by that civilisation's technologies would be detectable in mid-infrared wavelengths,’ said Dr Wright. The energy used by such a race to be noticeable would have to be huge - likely harnessing the power of a galaxy’s stars. But Dr Wright said that ‘fundamental thermodynamics tells us that this energy must be radiated away as heat in the mid-infrared wavelengths’. This would make them noticeable to Nasa's Wise telescope, used in the study. The researchers picked out 100,000 galaxies of interest, and found that 50 of them were emitting ‘unusually high levels of mid-infrared radiation.’ ‘Our follow-up studies of those galaxies may reveal if the origin of their radiation results from natural astronomical processes, or if it could indicate the presence of a highly advanced civilization,’ said Dr Wright. A proposed method for harnessing the power of an entire star is known as a Dyson sphere (artist's impression shown). First proposed by theoretical physicist freeman Dyson in 1960, this would be a swarm of satellites that surrounds a star to gather its energy . The findings were made using Nasa’s orbiting Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) telescope (artist's illustration shown). This telescope is perfect for detecting mid-infrared radiation that an advanced alien race might be emitting . However, talking to MailOnline, Dr Wright noted that the findings were not a sure-fire sign of alien life. The observations could simply be due to natural phenomena, such as dust and star formation. He said, including the 50 galaxies, none of the 100,000 were found ‘with more than 85 per cent of their light being used by alien industry.’ However, it’s possible that some galaxies do harbour advanced alien life - but they are emitting less energy than we can currently detect. ‘The harder we look and the longer we work, the better our detection limit will be, and the less energy a galaxy-spanning civilization would need to use for us to discover it,’ he added. Another possibility, of course, is that such civilisations simply don’t exist. But Dr Wright and his colleagues will be hoping that is not the case - and they are continuing to study galaxies for signs that we are not alone. The Glimpsing Heat from Alien Technologies Survey (G-Hat), published in the Astrophysical Journal, details how the team thought they might see the infrared signature of a race far more advanced than ours. None have been confirmed yet - but the signs so far could be considered promising .","Pennsylvania scientists find evidence that we might not be alone .

This could be because aliens are harnessing the power of entire stars .

"Clare Balding has admitted she was on TV too much following her success presenting the London Olympics . Clare Balding has admitted she was on TV too much following her success presenting the London Olympics. The broadcaster, who recently hosted coverage of the Boat Race, has vowed to do less after presenting everything from the BBC's rugby league coverage to Crufts. She told Radio Times magazine: 'I used to say yes to everything I was offered because I thought it would all stop tomorrow. Now I think it might stop tomorrow precisely because I say yes to everything. 'In 2014 I didn't do a single panel show because they get repeated so much. From December 10 last year when I hosted Sports Personality until I did Crufts on March 10, I was not on television presenting anything. Yet people still say, 'You're on everything'.' The 44-year-old, who married Alice Arnold in a private ceremony earlier this year, said that it was 'exhausting' to be constantly asked about being gay. 'I tell you what ... I'm not going to talk in this interview about being gay. I suspect Gabby Logan isn't asked about being married or being a mother,' she said. 'I get criticised for two things - doing too much and talking about being gay. But the facts don't necessarily support that I do too much, and I get asked about being gay all the time. Every single interview I do, that ends up being the lead. 'I'm very aware that it's important for people to see a couple in the mainstream. But it can get a bit exhausting. I don't walk down the street saying, 'Hi! I'm gay!' 'At the same time, I want to be one of the people who helps. What am I meant to do? I don't know what the bloody answer is.' The 44-year-old, who married Alice Arnold in a private ceremony earlier this year, said that it was 'exhausting' to be constantly asked about being gay . Balding added: 'I have never wanted children. It's my choice, but of course it's not something that's going to happen by accident. Yes, it could happen if I wished it to. 'I have two nephews, a niece and eight godchildren, and I love that. But I don't want kids. I just never had that urge. One of the many benefits of being gay is that people don't assume you want children, so they don't ask you. 'My brother Andrew's relationship with his wife Anna Lisa is almost as long-standing as mine with Alice, and all they were ever asked is 'When are you getting married?' and 'When are you having children?'.

"Spiders on Mars may have been predicted by David Bowie, but in fact spiders in space could help us get to the red planet. Tether Unlimited has revealed a system of robo spiders than can construct solar panels, trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit. The Nasa-back firm says it could dramatically reduce the cost of building spacecraft by allowing the final construction to take place in orbit. Scroll down for video . The system uses arachnid-like robots to construct large objects in orbit around the Earth by 'spinning' building material into shape. SpiderFab uses arachnid-like droids to construct large objects in orbit. SpiderFab could cut construction costs by only launching raw materials such as carbon fibre into orbit. The robots can then piece together the materials while in orbit, finishing off the spacecraft. The futuristic new system – dubbed SpiderFab – is being developed by a company called Tethers Unlimited. The system uses arachnid-like robots to construct large objects in orbit around the Earth or further into the Solar System. 'This process will enable space systems to be launched in a compact and durable 'embryonic' state,' the firm says. 'Once on orbit, these systems will use techniques evolved from emerging additive manufacturing and automated assembly technologies to fabricate and integrate components such as antennas, shrouds, booms, concentrators, and optics. 'The primary benefit of this on-orbit fabrication capability will be order-of-magnitude improvements in packing efficiency and system mass, which will enable NASA to use small, low-cost launch vehicles to deploy systems dramatically larger than possible with current state-of-the-art technologies. 'The net payoff will be to enable NASA to acquire and distribute a variety of forms of data at higher resolution, higher bandwidth, higher signal-to-noise, and lower life-cycle cost.' 'Our really long-term objective for all of this work is to eventually enable the use of in-situ resources to construct the infrastructure in space needed to support humanity's expansion throughout the solar system,' Dr. Robert Hoyt claimed last month during a presentation with NASA's Future In-Space Operations (FISO) working group. Under a Nasa contract, the firm is currently implementing the first step in the SpiderFab architecture: a machine that uses 3D printing techniques and robotic assembly to fabricate long, high-performance truss structures. He says the current way we build spacecraft is flawed. 'It's a very expensive and time-consuming process, and also, the size of systems is somewhat limited by the size of the deployables that are possible to fold up and fit within a launch shroud,' he said. Tethers Unlimited hopes to launch its first working construction robot into space within the next couple of years. 'In a perfect world — if funding flowed and the contracting process didn't drag on forever — we think we could get to be able to build very large support structures for antennas and solar arrays, and those sorts of components, in the early 2020s,' Dr. Hoyt said. The 'Trusselator' device will enable construction of large support structures for systems such as multi-hundred-kilowat solar arrays, large solar sails, and football-field sized antennas.

It was the loud all-night parties that eventually busted the secret stripper training school hiding inside Pharaoh's Palace, a $2million mansion next door to an exclusive gated community in Tampa, Florida . The Egyptian-themed mansion promises a 'perfect private location' on seven secluded acres on the Gulf Coast on its website advertisement . An August 2014 adult-themed party dubbed 'Midsummer Night Wet Dream' got the mansion, bought by Canadian millionaire Gordon Lownds, its first noise complaint . Neighbor Ron Nagy had seen ads for the party and filed a complaint with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and Code Enforcement. 'This to me seems like there was an undercurrent of very sexually-related activities,' Nagy told the Tampa Tribune. 'They're gaming the system.' After months of complaints both Lownds and Sean Grey, the mansion's manager, got hit with code violations. Grey was also charged with violating the county's noise ordinance, which was dismissed by a circuit judge on Monday. On its website, Pharaoh's Palace was advertised as the 'perfect' place for entertaining. Other ads on the internet said it was available for rent to producers for music videos, television and film, as well as event planners and professional photographers.

Clinton, whose mother Hillary is expected to formally announce her presidential campaign this Sunday, said it is time the United States had a female leader. 'One of our core values in this country is that we are the land of equal opportunity, but when equal hasn't yet included gender, there is a fundamental challenge there that, I believe, having our first woman president—whenever that is—will help resolve,' said Clinton.

Being the daughter of two of the most influential people on the planet doesn't seem to faze Chelsea. She gave a candid interview to Elle magazine this month about motherhood and talks of how her own mom should be the first female president of the United States.

'I now understand all of the enthusiastic, bombastically spectacular, wonderful things people say about their children,' says Clinton of her daughter (Above with her family shortly after the birth) In the interview with Elle, Clinton does not however say too much about her mother's campaign plans, and focuses instead on the general lack of female representation in politics. 'We've made real progress on legal protections for women, but in no way are women at parity to men in our country in the workplace,' she explains. 'And if we look in the political sphere, it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of Congress is treated as a real success. Since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality?' She then adds; 'And so when you ask about the importance of having a woman president, absolutely it's important, for, yes, symbolic reasons—symbols are important; it is important who and what we choose to elevate, and to celebrate.' Clinton, who looks almost unrecognizable in the accompanying fashion spread, also talks about life with daughter Charlotte. Clinton says that though the US is the 'land of equal opportunity,' that is not true about gender, and a female president would change that .

'I now understand—this is something else that Marc and I talk about all the time—all of the enthusiastic, bombastically spectacular, wonderful things people say about their children, because we also feel and think all those things about Charlotte,' said Clinton. And now, almost 25 years after she first hit the campaign trail as a child, Clinton seems ready to do it all over again, as the 35-year-old may once again return to the role of first daughter. Elle's editor-in-chief Robbie Myers is certainly excited about this prospect, describing Clinton as 'innately regal' in her editor's letter. 'She’s a person of substance for sure, a young woman who, while measured in her manner, has a fierceness of conviction, and a calling to make the world a better place,' says Myers. Clinton meanwhile is focused on seeing that first female president. 'Yes, we've seen again and again, when women have been in positions of leadership, they have had different degrees of success versus their male counterparts, historically being able to build more consensus so that decisions have longer-term effects, whether in economic investments or in building social capital,' says Clinton. 'Who sits around the table matters. And who sits at the head of the table matters, too.' As for her mom, her big announcement is expected to come on Twitter, and from there she is off to Iowa to get to work.","Chelsea Clinton is opening up about motherhood, life in the public eye and why the United States needs a female president in a new interview with Elle .

"The flag-burning father of a runaway British jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13. Abase Hussen – who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year – conceded the teenager was ‘maybe’ influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of ‘nothing’ to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video . Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 . Abase Hussen, circled,  marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 . It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies – with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. ‘The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,’ he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: ‘We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.’ Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: ‘Not at all. Nothing.’ Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, tweeted: ‘Remember that Amira Abase’s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.’ Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: ‘I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.’ Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria . Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: ‘The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.’ Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came ‘for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English’. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was ‘just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists’. Mr Hussen said he felt ‘terrible’ to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby’s killers and said: ‘It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don’t do things like this.’ Amira fled to become a ‘jihadi bride’ with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16. A fourth girl from their school, Sharmeena Begum, left for Syria in December. Giving evidence to the MPs’ committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the committee, said: ‘I would certainly be in favour of Mr Hussen being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us. ‘It’s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13-year-old to such a rally. But then to tell a House of Commons committee you have no idea why a young teenager should seek to travel to Syria, when you have taken her to more than one of these events, is simply breathtaking.’","Abase Hussen said maybe his daughter was influenced by attending a rally .

"Padding such a long way back was a tall order for a little lapdog with stumpy legs. So when Alfie the Yorkshire terrier was dumped by thieves 120 miles from his home, he found a novel way to bring about a snappy rescue. With great presence of mind – or luck – he dashed into a deserted country lane just as an RSPCA van drove by. Reunited: Alfie the Yorkshire Terrier (with owner Kirsty Mitton, right) - who travelled from Wednesbury, West Midlands, to Buckinghamshire to pick him up after he was rescued the RSPCA inspector Stephanie Law (left) Safe now: The seven-year-old dog ran out of the woods in front of the inspector's van and started barking . The near-miss, plus a lot of barking, made RSPCA inspector Stephanie Law pull over. When she opened her cab door, Alfie bounded in and started licking her face appreciatively. Because the seven-year-old was microchipped, RSPCA staff were able to trace his owner, Kirsty Mitton, in Wednesbury, West Midlands – the opposite end of the M40 from where he was found in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. Inquiries revealed Alfie had been missing for 12 days after being stolen with Miss Mitton’s other Yorkshire terrier, Lillie, during a raid on her home. Miss Mitton, 23, put up 400 posters near her home and launched an appeal on Facebook to find the dogs after the burglary on March 21. Yesterday, Inspector Law said: ‘I was just driving down the deserted road when I saw Alfie run towards me, clearly trying to attract my attention. He ran right in front of the van, barking, and as soon as I stopped and opened the door he just bounded in and jumped on the seat. ‘It was as if he recognised my uniform and knew I was there to rescue him. Taken: Alfie (left) is back, but Miss Mitton’s second terrier Lillie (right), who was also stolen, is still missing . Distaance: Inspector Law reunited Alfie with a delighted Miss Mitton, who drove 112 miles from Wednesbury in the West Midlands (point A) to Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire (point B) to collect her beloved pet . ‘I have had plenty of people wave me down for help but I have never actually been flagged down by a dog in need of rescue before.’ Miss Mitton, who runs her family’s haulage firm, has had Alfie since he was a puppy. Lillie, five, is not microchipped and is still missing. The pets are thought to have been stolen by dognappers who cash in on the lucrative trade in Yorkshire terrier puppies, which can sell for £900. They have become increasingly popular after being photographed with celebrity owners such as Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. The two dogs were the only things taken in the break-in. It is thought Alfie was dumped by the thieves when they realised he is neutered. Lillie has not been spayed so can still breed. Miss Mitton, said: ‘It was like he just flagged her down and knew who she was. It is incredible that he rescued himself like that.’ Anyone with information about missing Lillie should call the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018 .","Alfie taken when burglars raided Kirsty Mitton's home in West Midlands .

"A California judge has reduced a child rapist's mandatory 25-year sentence down to only 10 - saying anything longer would be 'cruel and unusual punishment'. Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly told an Orange County jury that 20-year-old Kevin Jonas Rojano-Nieto 'did not intend to harm' the three-year-old girl he raped at his family home in June. The judge said that he was sure that although Rojano-Nieto sodomized the girl and covered her mouth so she couldn't scream out, 'there was no violence or callous disregard for the victim's well-being'. Controversial: Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly (seen here with a colleague in 2010) has handed a 10-year sentence to a 20-year-old child rapist. The mandatory sentence should be 25-years to life . Judge Kelly also said Rojano-Nieto, 'inexplicably became sexually aroused but did not appear to consciously intend to harm the victim.' Prosecutor have said they will appeal the controversial decision and will be pushing for the minimum sentence of 25-years to life to be reinstated. Rojano-Nieto was found guilty on December 3 of raping the girl who wandered into a garage where he was playing video games. According to the court news service, Rojano-Nieto said he became aroused by the girl and pulled her pants down to rape her during the sickening attack. While this was going on, he could apparently hear her mother calling out for her, so covered her mouth so she couldn't scream back. The girl told her mother after the assault that she was in pain and her mother called the police who found injuries consistent with rape. Rapist: Kevin Jonas Rojano-Nieto has been sentenced to 10-years behind bars for the rape of a 3-year-old girl . “Although serious and despicable, this does not compare to a situation where a pedophilic child predator preys on an innocent child,” Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly said according to KTLA. Deputy District Attorney Whitney Bokosky said she disagrees and will appeal. She said that Rojano-Nieto knew what he was doing was wrong because he covered the girl's mouth during the rape so she couldn't call out.","Superior Court Judge M.

"It is one of the biggest celebrations in the Catholic calendar and the Spanish Royal Family kept up their tradition of spending the Easter holiday on the island of Mallorca. King Felipe, Queen Letizia and their daughters Princess Sofia and Princess Leonor looked immaculate as they arrived at Palma cathedral on the Balearic isle. Queen Letizia, 42, teamed a white jacket with smart black trousers and heels for the service while her daughters wore pretty above-the-knee outfits reflecting the spring sunshine. Smiling in the Mallorcan sunshine: Clockwise from left, Queen Sofia, King Felipe, Queen Letizia, Princess Sofia and Princess Leonor pose for photographers  at Palma de Mallorca Cathedral . A spring breeze in the air: The family make their way into the cathedral. Hundreds of people gathered to watch the Spanish royals arrive at the service . It is the first time that Princess Leonor, 9, and Princess Sofia, 7, have been spotted at a public engagement for several months; they are on the island for the family's annual holiday at the Marivent Palace royal holiday residence. Well-wishers were in their hundreds, all keen to catch a glimpse of the young princesses who have been on a break from royal duties since appearing at a military parade back in October 2014. King Felipe VI, 47, has not yet completed a full year on the throne but looked happy to be continuing the family tradition of spending Easter away from the royal residence in Madrid. The family were also joined by Queen Sofia, who looked elegant in a grey overcoat. The former Queen is reported to have landed on Mallorca ahead of the rest of her family, taking time to enjoy a break with her sister Irene. Spring in her step: Queen Letizia arrives at the cathedral in Mallorca's capital. Right, her elegant daughters (from left)  Princess Sofia and Princess Leonor are the double of their mother .

The Spanish monarch waves to well-wishers in the crowd before adjusting his tie for a formal family photograph . All eyes are on them: The family take their pew in the beautiful cathedral, widely considered one the island's biggest architectural masterpieces . Meet and greet: After a period away from the spotlight, Princess Leonor, 9, appeared to enjoy shaking hands with fellow attendees of the religious service . June will mark one year since King Felipe ascended the throne and the royal couple have been regular visitors to Mallorca since, using it for family holidays inbetween engagements. The couple have been married since 2004 with Letizia enjoying a media career prior to her role as the Spanish Queen. After a stint at Asturian daily paper, La Nueva España, she went on to work for ABC, a popular national newspaper that enjoys the third largest circulation in Spain.","The Spanish Royal Family attended Easter Mass at Palma's cathedral .

"Nigel Farage has dismissed criticism of the lack of diversity in Ukip's manifesto by claiming there was a 'half black' party spokesman featured prominently - and 'one fully black person'. The Ukip leader made the remarks after being asked at his manifesto launch last week to justify the scarcity of black and Asian faces in the Ukip manifesto. It includes several photographs of the party's top team although it was suggested the only black face in the document appeared on a page about overseas aid. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage has dismissed criticism of the lack of diversity in Ukip's manifesto by claiming there was a 'half black' party spokesman featured prominently - and 'one fully black person' The question provoked noisy barracking, including from a group of black and Asian candidates attending the launch. Mr Farage said the premise was wrong, with the picture of the party's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe ignored. He told Magic Radio: 'Well firstly there was one fully black person.' Mr Farage added: 'There was another one of our leading spokesman who is half black and that didn't get a mention. And he featured very prominently on page six. So the premise was wrong. 'I thought what happened was really interesting. There was a journalist from one of our leading daily newspapers who made the comment you know, there's only one black. 'And what happened was that there was an eruption in the room as our black and ethnic minority candidates stood up and looked at this guy in a pretty hostile way.' The Ukip leader - trying on hats at a campaign stop in Canterbury, Kent, today - made the remarks after being asked at his manifesto launch last week to justify the scarcity of black and Asian faces in the Ukip manifesto . The Ukip manifesto included several photographs of the party's top team although it was suggested the only black face in the document appeared on a page about overseas aid . Mr Farage added: 'What they were saying was we're just about sick to death of the sneering media class trying to make Ukip out to be something completely other than it is. 'We're a non-racist, non-sectarian political party but we don't have all female quotas, we don't have all black quotas, we treat everybody as being equal. 'I think we're a multi-racial society. I think the multicultural society is a much more contentious point and perhaps that's the bit that may have gone slightly wrong. 'Over 10% of our candidates come from BME backgrounds. We're probably more diverse in our membership than some of the other parties who talk about all of this in a sort of 'holier than thou' way.' Mr Farage said the party's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe - who has dual heritage - was 'half black' The Ukip manifesto launch was overshadowed by a row over the number of black and Asian people included, after a journalist pointed out that the only image showed someone from an ethnic minority - an African woman in the overseas aid section . Ukip has also proposed to amend the smoking ban to allow pubs and clubs to open smoking rooms. The manifesto states these rooms would have to be properly ventilated and physically separate from non-smoking areas. Mr Farage said: 'There are 76 pages in our manifesto and that is one little sentence tucked away in there. 'It's about freedom of choice that's the point. Thirty pubs a week are closing and a lot of them particularly in built up areas where they haven't got a big food trade. 'They rely on people going into the pub at five, six o'clock after a hard day's work and a lot of those people might not smoke all day but they want a smoke with their drink that evening.' He added of his party's policy: 'Would that burden the health service? Well let's put it like this: the NHS says, that smoking related illnesses cost it £2 billion a year, all right? Tobacco tax is £12billion a year so I don't quite buy the argument.'","Ukip leader asked to justify lack of black and Asian faces in manifesto .

"Britain was hailed as a ‘job-creating machine’ last night as the number of people in work soared to its highest level in history. The Conservatives’ economic strategy also won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne. Employment rose above 31million in the three months to February, official figures showed – 557,000 higher than a year before. The Conservatives’ economic strategy  won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together. ‘There are now two million more people in work than in 2010,’ the Prime Minister said. The encouraging numbers came as Rolls-Royce announced its biggest-ever order, worth more than £6billion, to power passenger jets for the Middle Eastern airline Emirates. IMF chief Christine Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble praised Mr Osborne’s ‘wonderful job’ of handling the economy. In a blow to Labour, which has opposed most of the Government’s austerity measures, Mrs Lagarde said the Government had provided the ‘right balance’ of spending cuts and tax rises. The plan had reduced the deficit from a record £153billion under Labour in 2009-10 to £90billion last year. She said she had ‘no doubt that can continue to be the case in the future’ under Mr Osborne’s plans to return Britain to the black in 2018-19, a pledge Labour has failed to match. David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together . ‘The fiscal deficit has been significantly reduced over the last few years,’ said Mrs Lagarde. ‘Added to that it is clearly also delivering results. It is obvious that what is happening in the UK has actually worked.’ Mr Schaeuble said he was ‘full of respect’ for what the Chancellor has achieved and delivered what amounted to a highly unusual endorsement of the Tories. ‘The UK and the UK economy has done a wonderful job in the last couple of years,’ he said. ‘The UK and George Osborne has a very good plan for the future. I am very much in favour of what has been achieved and what has been forecast.’ The Chancellor, speaking at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, said the UK ‘is one of the brightest spots in the world economy at the moment’. ‘I am here representing the UK with an economy that is firmly on course – the deficit halved as a share of GDP, strong growth, record high employment, record low inflation,’ he said. Greece poses the biggest threat to the global economy and the deepening crisis could hit Britain, George Osborne warned yesterday. Fears are mounting that the recession-battered country will default on its debts and be forced to leave the eurozone, creating an economic and political earthquake. The Chancellor (pictured with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde) said the crisis in Greece had made the mood at International Monetary Fund talks in Washington this week ‘notably more gloomy’ The Chancellor said the crisis in Greece had made the mood at International Monetary Fund talks in Washington this week ‘notably more gloomy’. Mr Osborne added: ‘It is clear that a misstep or miscalculation on either side [in Greece] could easily return European economies to the type of perilous situation we saw three to four years ago. ‘It would be a mistake to think that the UK could be immune to a return to this instability in European financial systems and the European economy.’ ‘The British economy is a job-creating machine and we have set out, as a Conservative Party, plans to go on creating jobs, two million further jobs, in the next parliament.’ Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander hailed Britain as the ‘job-creation powerhouse of the western economies’. The Rolls-Royce deal means the Derby-based firm will make the engines for 50 of Emirates’ Airbus A380 planes from its UK factories, where it employs 24,500 people. Emirates’ use of the A380 is said to have created 7,000 UK jobs. Rolls-Royce has worked with Emirates since 1996 but this is the first time it has made engines for the Gulf carrier’s super-jumbo fleet. Labour was forced to welcome the latest employment figures, but Ed Miliband insisted that ‘too often jobs in our country are low-paid, low-skilled and insecure’. ‘It is not just about zero-hours contracts. Young people have done badly, with growing debt, an insecure job and owning a home a distant dream,’ he said. Ed Miliband (pictured) has insisted that ‘too often jobs in our country are low-paid, low-skilled and insecure’ But John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist website, said two-thirds of the new jobs were full-time and ‘almost all’ were permanent. In more good news, yesterday’s figures showed the unemployment rate has also fallen to pre-crisis levels of 5.6 per cent. It was last this low in June 2008. Wages excluding bonuses are also rising at 1.8 per cent – the highest level since 2012, the Office for National Statistics revealed. This wage increase will feel even higher for workers because the inflation rate is zero.","Employment in UK rose above 31million in last three months to February .

"Armenia is a country in Eurasia's South Caucasus region famous for its mountainous landscapes and rich history ... but mainly, right now at least, for the fact Kim Kardashian and her posse are there. Kim Kardashian, her husband Kanye West, their daughter North and Kim's sister Khloe arrived in the capital Yerevan on Wednesday to a rock star welcome and over eight days are checking out a plethora of local landmarks. The visit is their first to the country their late father, Robert Kardashian, fled for America and both Kim and Khloe have expressed their excitement at the chance to explore his homeland. Kim Kardashian is in Armenia with her husband Kanye West and their daughter North on an eight-day visit to the country of her dad's birth . The celebrity visitors are in the capital Yerevan, a culturally rich city where the Opera House (centre) is among its most notable landmarks . The Yerevan Opera House is a must-visit place in the Armenian capital where local music and dance performances are highly regarded . Kim, Kanye and Khloe Kardashian are staying at the Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan which is on Republic Square, formerly Lenin Square . Republic Square is a tourist attraction in itself, with its combination of Soviet-era architecture and Neo-Classical official buildings . And from what Lonely Planet says of the city, it's made for the icons of modern-day entertainment. 'While it's the undeniable cultural, economic and political heart of the nation, Yerevan can at times feel like a city on permanent holiday,' Lonely Planet's introduction to its guide of the city. 'All summer long, Yerevanites saunter up and down the main boulevards, preening in high fashion and fast cars while occasionally popping into a parkside cafe to schmooze over a drink or two.' Sounds familiar... While there, the Kardashian-West crew are staying in the capital's finest digs, the Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan, which frames Republic Square at the heart of the city, and have the burliest of bodyguards and police in tow as they take in the sights. But what would we, the mere mortals not of reality TV fame, see and do if we followed in their footsteps? Yerevan's Zvartnots International Airport is well connected to major centres throughout Europe although cheaper flights (upwards of £300 during summer and less in colder months) from London require a transfer somewhere like Moscow, Kiev or Vienna. Without the need to book out the two executive floors of the hotel for our entourage and filming crew, as the Kardashian crew have, a standard room from 67,150 Armenian Drams is good value (sounds like a lot but works out at about £96). A smartphone view of the Katoghiken church in the World Heritage-listed Geghard Monastery, where Kim, Kanye and North visited . The monastery is a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain and date back to the fourth century . Documenting every moment: Camera crews followed the family as they took a tour of historical sites . Outside the Monastery of Geghard women sell the same traditional sweet bread that was offered to Kim on their arrival in Armenia . The hotel is well chosen by their people as it's right in the middle of this relatively easy to get around city, where the majority of main sights are free. The square is a tourist attraction in itself, with its combination of Soviet-era architecture and Neo-Classical buildings such as the Houses of Government and the Marriott itself, but with their own Armenian twists. In the heart of the cultural and business hub of Yerevan, the square is connected to the other main area of the city that has the impressive Opera House at its centre. While Kanye's hip-hop may not be the preferred genre of the nation - fans appear to be more interested in the stars of Keeping Up with the Kardashians - the city isn't short on culture with a disproportionately large amount of theatres, galleries and clubs for its size, with plenty of live music to be found. Their minders say the timing has nothing to do with it, but the Kardashians' arrival comes as the nation counts down to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide on April 24 which honours up 1.5 million people were killed by the Ottomans between 1915 and 1917. Turkey dispute the figures - they claim 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians died during a civil uprising against the Ottomans - but Armenians have fought for international recognition of the tragedy for decades. But the memory of those whose lives were taken are very much honoured in this city and throughout the country. The Cascades is the main part of the Cafesjian Museum, found in the centre of Yerevan, which features an array of  modern  Armenian art . Khachkars, an Armenian cross stone, are common features of medieval Christian art found in the Cascades . The Sculture Park features works from Botero and other internationally-recognised artists and a stellar view of the city . This statue at the Cascades represents Russian-born architect Alexander Tamanian, whose greatest work was planning modern Yerevan . Among the major sights on the Kardashian's itinerary is Yerevan's extensive Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/index.php along with the National Archives where they hope to see documents relating to their ancestors. The party has already visited Yerevan's Mother Armenia statue, a large representation of a women holding a big sword that is said to be the female personification of the country and proved quite an inspiration for the sisters. A visit to their father's home city of Gyumri would find a smaller version of the statue minus the collection of decommissioned tanks, rocket launchers and other military items. 'The Mother Armenia statue symbolizes peace through strength,' Khloe wrote on Instagram. 'It can remind viewers of some of the prominent female figures in Armenian history. Who took up arms to help their husbands in their clashes with Turkish troops and Kurdish irregulars. I am woman hear me roar! Blessed to be here!' Victory Park, home to the statue, also offers a brilliant view of the city . Kim echoed the sentiment: 'This statue reminds visitors of the strong female figures in Armenian history. I love how powerful women are and respected so much in our culture!' The huge Mother Armenia statue (said to be the female personification of the nation) and military museum at Victory Park in Yerevan . While there said to be more Armenians living abroad than in the country itself, due to millions who fled the alleged genocide, local culture has been diligently preserved. Their welcome to a packed airport included a traditional gift of bread and salt from women in traditional Armenian dress. Similar breads are found sold by locals at the Unesco World Heritage-listed Monastery of Geghard, a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain where where Kim and Kanye have taken North. The main chapel was built in 1215 but the complex originated in the fourth century and has a rich and varied history. Other sights include the 3,000-year-old Erebuni Fortress that was the beginning of Yerevan and the more modern Cascades, Sculpture Park and Cafesjian Museum, their modern art centre. Or romantics could visit Lover's Park, a Japanese-style garden which hosts open-air concerts and art exhibitions. While a minority are unimpressed with the celebrities' arrival most are delighted to see them, including the government. The group has met with the nation's prime minister Hovik Abrahamyan, who praised their contribution to 'international recognition and condemnation of the Armenian genocide.' Parliament speaker Galust Saakian said their visit can only be a good thing. 'Kim Kardashian is a lady who's known worldwide. We should be happy she came here,' he said. The Kardashian family tree has rich historical roots in Armenia . Robert Kardashian, father of Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Robert Jr, was a third-generation Armenian American. The celebrity lawyer, who passed away in 2003 just eight weeks after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, passed on his pride in his heritage to his family, who have been vocal about their Armenian roots. Robert's ancestors fled the Armenian Genocide in the early 20th century, thanks to a 'prophet' who urged them to uproot to America. Known at the time as the Kardaschoffs, in Russian style, the family made their way from their home village of Karakale in the late 19th Century to German ports. From there, they travelled to a new life in America on the passenger vessels SS Brandenberg and SS Koln. By doing so, they escaped the triple horror of the First World War from 1914-18, the 'Armenian Genocide' starting in 1915 - exactly a century ago this year - and the Russian Revolution in 1917. Among those fleeing Erzurum - then in Armenia, and ruled by last Russian Tsar Nicholas II - was family patriarch Hovhannes Miroyan and Kim's great great grandfather, born in 1844. He married  Luciag Chorbajian, born in 1853. The couple wed in Erzurum, which is now in Turkey, in 1867 but escaped along with their daughter Vartanoosh Mironyan, born in 1886, in the early 20th century. Vartanoosh's distinctly blonde daughter Haigoohi Arakelian, known as Helen, was born in America in 1917, the year the Bolshevik Revolution rocked the Russian Empire. She was Kim's grandmother, who later married into the Kardashian clan. The glamorous and 'dynamic' Helen wed Arthur who ran the largest meat-packing business in southern California. Helen's son Robert married Kris Houghton and fathered the 21st Century's biggest reality TV stars Kourtney, Khloe, Robert Jr and Kim. Their mother Kris eventually married Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner and together they raised two more TV personalities, Kendall and Kylie.","Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, along with their daughter North and sister Khloe, are visiting Armenia .

"A dog breeder and her husband have been jailed for animal cruelty after their animals were found in the 'worst conditions ever seen'. Margaret and Gary Mazan from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had their 14 Red Setters seized by RSPCA inspectors after the animals were discovered in filthy cages in a garden shed. The court heard how the animals had matted fur, were dehydrated and had not been provided with a suitable diet. Cruel: Margaret Mazan (pictured) and her husband Gary were found guilty of animal cruelty after their 14 Red Setters were found in appalling conditions . Sentenced: Margaret (left) and Gary Mazan (right) were jailed for 26 weeks and given a lifetime ban from owning or keeping pets, which they cannot appeal for 25 years . Three of the fully grown dogs were found by inspectors crammed in puppy cages and the majority were kept in a squalid garden shed. Magistrates heard the couple caused unnecessary suffering to some of the dogs by failing to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails. Mrs Mazan, 53, who was said to have shown and bred setters for more than 10 years, chose not to give evidence at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates' Court during the two-day trial. Her husband Gary, 51, who is a long-distance lorry driver, claimed it was Mrs Mazan who had sole responsibility for the dogs. Crammed: The animals were found with matted fur and inside cramped, filthy cages inside a garden shed . Seized: RSPCA inspectors discovered the animals in some of the 'worst conditions' they had ever seen . Owner: Mrs Mazan, who was said to have shown and bred setters for more than 10 years, chose not to give evidence at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates' Court during the two-day trial . The animals had been kept at the family's home since they moved from Leeds to Bradford in February 2013. A month after the move the RSPCA served a warning notice due to the conditions the dogs were being kept in, which had been adhered to by the time they visited again in April 2013. But concerns over the welfare of the animals were raised by a dog warden after they were refused access to the property and called the RSPCA. Emma Ellis, an RSPCA inspector for Bradford who attended the scene and helped to seize the animals, said it was the worst conditions she has seen in her 12 years as an inspector. She said: 'To see 12 dogs living in a small shed, with three fully grown setters living in a puppy cage is horrific. 'They could not sit down or turn around and there fur was matted, covered in urine and faeces. 'When the shed was opened, the smell literally hit you and it was a small like I had never experienced before. I still recall the smell every time I see the photos. Caged: The animals had been kept at the Bradford home since the family moved from Leeds in February 2013 . Matted: The couple were said to have caused unnecessary suffering to the dogs as they failed to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails (pictured) 'To keep animals in these conditions is unacceptable for anyone, let a alone a dog breeder.' The animals are now currently under the care of the RSPCA, after the charity demanded ownership of all the Mazans' pets, including an additional dog, called Clever. The dog, which belonged to the family's daughter who was away at university, had been chipped in Mrs Mazan's name and magistrates decided to transfer custody of the animal, alongside the other 14 dogs, to the RSPCA. Dingle Clark, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, told the court that boarding costs for the dogs since they were seized had reached £48,000, with an additional £7,000 in vets fees. Filthy: Three of the fully grown dogs were found by RSPCA inspectors crammed in puppy cages and the majority were kept in a squalid garden shed. All animals are now in the charity's care . Sentencing the pair to 26 weeks in jail, Allie Coward, chairman of the bench, said: 'We have considered all the evidence, and this was the most heinous act of cruelty against defenceless animals we have ever seen.' An immediate appeal against the sentence was made and a request for bail ahead of any appeal hearing at the Crown Court, but the application for bail was denied by the court. The pair were also given a lifetime ban against owning or keeping any animal, and told they cannot appeal against the order for at least 25 years.","WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"The European Union will today accuse Google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market. Brussels will say that Google has used its massive dominance as a search engine to divert internet users from rivals to its own services, which include YouTube and the Google+ social network. In one of the most high-profile competition cases of recent years, Europe could fine Google more than £4 billion amid a wave of political opposition in Europe to the perceived dominance of US tech companies. Google currently boasts a 90 per cent share in Europe's search engine market. The European Union will accuse Google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market . But the ruling - the result of a five-year investigation into the American search giant – means Google may ultimately have to change its business model and pay multi-billion pound fines to Brussels. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, will today serve the company with a formal charge sheet alleging that it breached anti-trust rules, according to the Financial Times. Google's competitors, including the computer giant Microsoft and sites such as travel booking firm Expedia and TripAdvisor, claim that its method of promoting its own companies above rivals on its search site stops them competing on a level playing field. And in a further blow to Google, the EU is also expected to probe Google's operating system for Android smartphones. The investigation will centre on whether Google imposes restrictions on phone makers that force them to favour their own apps, such as YouTube. Google has previously rejected the allegations, and insisted that Android is an open platform that is distributed for free. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, will today serve Google with a formal charge sheet . After charges are issued, Google will have ten weeks to reply to Brussels, according to the Financial Times. They will also get the chance to argue their case in a formal hearing. The investigation into Google began in 2010 but was repeatedly delayed because the commission could not agree on settlement terms. Google offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case. Most recently, just over a year ago, it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website. However Europe initially accepted that deal, only to reverse the decision six months later and demand more concessions. Vestager, Europe's competition boss who was the inspiration for the hit Danish political drama series Borgen, took over the job in November and vowed to take Google on. Insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the EU's decade-long battle with Microsoft, which ultimately cost the company £1.6 billion in fines. If Google fails to rebut any formal charges imposed by Brussels, the commission could impose a huge fine which could exceed £4 billion - about 10 per cent of Google's most recent annual revenue. The move will stop short of previous threats that the EU executive could consider breaking up Google to separate its business from the search engine. Google has faced searching antitrust questions across three continents for several years. But the latest move by the EU marks the first time the company has been accused of wrongdoing. The search engine is far more dominant in Europe than it is in the United States – where rivals like Microsoft's Bing enjoy a share of the market. And there has been fierce opposition to the dominance of Google from many countries in the EU. In fact twenty complainants want the search engine to abide by strict rules than ensure it treats its own services the same as it would its rivals. More than two dozen European organisations have filed antitrust complaints against Google. Many are from powerful publishing groups and online firms in Germany. They have previously called on the European regulator to force the American search engine to stop blocking competition in areas like online maps, shopping and travel services. And in France, lawyers have this week called on Google to reveal its secret formula for ranking websites – but Google argues such transparency would expose its business secrets to rivals and leave the search engine vulnerable to spam. Google and the EU commission declined to comment last night. Vestager's department is also looking into the tax affairs of Amazon, Starbucks, Fiat and Apple. In a recent Sunday Times article she said big companies should pay more as they 'are part of our society.' Insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the EU's decade-long battle with Microsoft .","The European Union will accuse Google of illegally abusing its supremacy .

Countering President Barack Obama's previous assertion, Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'. The 62-year-old politician continued: 'We just set in place a process to ensure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.' Making an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Corker  said that Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one. Scroll down for video . Chairman: Senator Bob Corker (pictured), of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities . He said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it, before finally voting on it. 'It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,' Corker said. Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. Meanwhile, the Committee is due to meet April 14 to consider Corker's legislation to ensure that Congress debates and signs off on any pact. The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation. With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons, while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Argument: Countering President Barack Obama's (pictured) previous assertion, Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Fox News Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal' These will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight, Moniz said during an appearance on CBS' 'Face The Nation. This is a long-term arrangement, he stressed, with requirements lasting a quarter century or more. 'We'll have eyes on the entire supply chain of uranium,' he added on the program. 'Going back to mines, the mills, we'll have continuous surveillance of centrifuge production.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Sunday the proposed deal is a bad one - but was the best one Obama could get because the Iranians don't fear or respect him. Response: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has criticized the framework deal as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. But in defending the framework, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (right) cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities . He said that he favors waiting until a new president, Democratic or Republican, takes office in January 2017 and then trying again. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' But a senior Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, warned that bashing the proposed deal could backfire on Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister and other critics of the framework agreement have offered no viable alternatives, she said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor. 'I wish he would contain himself,' Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Netanyahu. Officials (L-r) European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, and an unidentified Russian official, look on as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond shakes hands with Secretary of State John Kerry in Switzerland . The preliminary deal,  announced in Switzerland on Thursday, sees Iran agree to not build any new centrifuges for 15 years, and not enrich uranium at the previously secret Fordow site for 15 years. The country also agrees to reduce nuclear-material centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, let the IAEA store all the extra centrifuges, give IAEA inspectors access to its uranium mills for 25 years and rebuild heavy-water reactor at Arak so it can't produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it would not build any new heavy-water reactors for 15 years. In return, the West will give Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions 'if it verifiably abides by its commitments', and lift 'all past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue' as soon as Iran has completed all its promised 'nuclear-related actions'. America's sanctions on Iran relating to 'terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles' will remain in place.","Senator Bob Corker has countered Barack Obama's previous assertion .

"When you consider 80 per cent of our information about the outside world comes through our eyes, it's hardly surprising studies show eye contact to be the most effective way to signal sexual interest. Eighteen times more sensitive than our ears, our eyes are capable of responding to one and a half million simultaneous messages. So finely tuned, they'll subconsciously spot when someone starts looking at us - even if we haven't noticed - and start taking mental notes. Scroll down for video . Tracey Cox says that it takes more than just simple eye contact to get someone's attention here she gives her advice on how to use your peepers to get someone's attention . If that person is checking everyone out, they'll stop registering the information; if it's just us they're interested in, they'll signal the brain to give us a nudge that someone's watching. Spring is the season for flirting so the perfect time to find out the five eye contact techniques that are scientifically proven to get you noticed! THE FOUR-AND-HALF SECOND SCAN . A normal face scan lasts three seconds, scan for four-and-a-half and it's clear someone has 'caught your eye'. Eye contact of more than ten seconds between two people means one of two things: you're about to fight or have sex (well, you want to anyway). Prolonged eye contact produces intense emotional reactions regardless of whether it's a fist or a pair of lips heading your way. It activates the nervous system, raises our heart rate and blood flow and stimulates the production of certain hormones. On average we scan a face for three seconds, scan for four and a half to register your interest . THE SLIDE AND SETTLE . Studies have shown this to be an almost foolproof way to find out if a stranger is interested in you. Let your eyes settle on someone so they're aware you've noticed them, then as they're still watching you, slide your eyes around the room before settling back on them again. This effectively says, 'You instantly attracted me and you're still the pick of the room even after I've checked out the competition.' If they're interested, most people drop their eyes straight down, then directly up again to lock eyes after a few seconds. If someone's eyes instead slide away from yours and don't return after a minute or two, they're almost definitely not interested. Tracey says the simple act of blinking can also make someone aware that you're attracted to them . It's a quick movement - the whole thing's over in ten to 15 seconds – but it's impressively accurate. THE FLIRTING TRIANGLE . Eye movement studies show we look at different parts of other people's faces depending on the situation and level of attractiveness. When looking at strangers or in business situations, we make a small triangle by moving our eyes from eye to eye, dipping them as we move across the bridge of the nose. With friends, the triangle widens as our eyes drop below eye level to include the nose and the mouth. With lovers and people we fancy, the triangle broadens even further, dropping below the mouth to include the breasts and other good bits like the genitals. As flirting becomes more intense, eye to eye contact becomes fast, furious and constant, seconded by long periods spent staring at the mouth. Our eyes spend the rest of the time making little side journeys to the bits at the bottom of the triangle. THE BLINK . It's easy to see where the term 'batting your eyelashes' originated from: if someone looks at us and likes what they see, they tend to blink more. Because the brain associates rapid blinking with finding someone sexually attractive, the more you blink at someone, the more attracted you feel to them. The function of blinking is to clean the eye and keep the moisture level constant. As intense emotion almost always produces tears, it stands to reason our blink rate increases when we're incredibly happy, sad, attracted or excited as the eye tries to clear excess liquid. THE LOVER'S GAZE . Staring directly into someone's eyes triggers an arousal reaction. Sadly, this doesn't mean you boring a hole into Poldark's smouldering brown pair will guarantee he'll gallop you off into the sunset. How the arousal develops depends on who is staring at who. If it's an unattractive stranger, it will turn into a fear response. But if you like the look of the person looking at you, the brain interprets it as a sexual signal and responds by getting your body ready for sex.

"The Transportation Security Administration will 'enhance' officer training for hair pat-downs after  complaints that African-American women  were being racially targeted for unnecessary screenings. New training will commence at Los Angeles International Airport, one of the airports named in the complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The complaint was filed on behalf of Malaika Singleton, who said she was subjected to a hair pat-down with weeks of each other while traveling from Los Angeles to London in December 2013. The Transportation Security Administration will 'enhance' officer training for hair pat-downs after complaints that African-American women were being racially targeted for unnecessary screenings (file photo) According to an ACLU statement, TSA agents grabbed Singleton's hair, which was styled in tightly-wound 'sisterlocks,' and proceeded to 'squeeze it from top to bottom' at LAX airport. Singleton's hair was patted down again two weeks later during a layover at Minneapolis International Airport and, once again, nothing was found. New training will commence at Los Angeles International Airport, one of the airports named in the complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union . 'The humiliating experience on countless black women who are routinely targeted for hair pat-downs because their hair is ""different"" is not only wrong, but also a great misuse of TSA agents' time and resources,' Novella Coleman, Singleton's ACLU attorney, said in a statement. In a letter sent to Coleman, the TSA said the re-training will stress 'race neutrality', and that a special emphasis will be placed on the 'hair patdowns of African-American female travelers'. TSA said the administration will also track of pat-down complaints filed by African-American women throughout the country to 'assess whether a discriminatory impact may be occurring at a specific' airport, according to the letter posted by Buzzfeed. This is not the first time TSA's pat-down policy has come under harsh light. Solange Knowles claimed in 2012 she was racially profiled while going through security at Miami airport, dubbing it 'Discrim-FRO-nation' because she wears her hair in the Afro style. 'My hair is not a storage drawer,' she tweeted. An agency spokesman later told CNN that the 'advanced imaging technology machine' only shows 'an outline of an individual' that was 'the same for every single person'. 'If the hair area is highlighted, the machine may have picked up an anomaly or a possible threat in the head area', such as bobby pins, hair and extension clips, or head wraps. Solange Knowles claimed in 2012 she was racially profiled while going through security at Miami airport, dubbing it 'Discrim-FRO-nation' because she wears her hair in the Afro style . But ACLU said it was these kinds of 'subjective rules' that made the agency more susceptible to 'unconsciously interpret the circumstances in a way that is consistent with racial stereotypes'. In a statement released Friday, the TSA said they do not tolerate racial profiling, according to The Hill. 'Not only is racial profiling prohibited under DHS and agency policy, but it is also an ineffective security tactic.' Coleman told the Huffington Post she will be looking for 'clear and objective guidelines' from the TSA when she attends the LAX training later this month.","TSA agreed to make changes after ACLU filed official complaint .

"Jordan Sharifi, 17,  confessed to giving a gun to friend Raymond Howell, who killed himself . A teenager who allegedly gave his best friend a gun for protection from bullies has been arrested after the boy used the weapon to kill himself. Jordan Sharifi, 17, was taken into custody on Friday by police in McKinney, Texas, who say he confessed to giving a gun and  ammunition to 14-year-old Raymond Howell, Jr. On Thursday, Raymond was found in a ditch from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Sharifi discovered Raymond's body in a rain culvert after the boy's mother called to ask him if he'd seen her son, according to an affidavit, the Dallas Morning News reported. When he saw his friend in a fetal position in the ditch, he initially thought he was sleeping and called his name, he told police. But when Raymond failed to respond, Sharifi turned him over and saw blood on his face, and found no pulse, he said. At that point, he noticed the weapon beneath Raymond's body and threw it into a nearby drainage tunnel. Sharifi led police to the scene and they initially thought Raymond had been murdered because they did not find a weapon, the affidavit states. Speaking to police, Sharifi initially denied seeing a weapon but later admitted that he had given the boy the gun and had tried to hide it when he found it beneath his body. Loss: The body of Raymond Howell, Jr., pictured, was found early on Thursday morning a few miles from his school. Sharifi found his friend's body after Raymond's mother told him the boy was missing . Friends: The boys, who became friends after Sharifi moved next door, are pictured together with a friend . On social media, he also indicated that his friend had left him a note before taking his life. The two teenagers became friends after Sharifi moved in with one of Raymond's neighbors. 'No one understands how hard it is to lose someone so close to them, and to have found them before anyone else knew,' Sharifi wrote on Instagram last week. 'But I knew that you wanted me to find you and me to tell your mom and no one else, I will always cherish the letter that you wrote to me, and left for me to find, I love you so much man.' Sharifi, who once attended McKinney Boyd High School with Howell but is no longer enrolled there, allegedly confessed to police that he'd stolen the gun from the family he was staying with. He says he gave Howell the gun to protect himself after he'd gotten into some fights recently. Sharifi was charged with fabricating or tampering with evidence, theft of a firearm and making a firearm accessible to a child. His bond has been set at $300,000. Confessed: Police say Sharifi, pictured left, led them to Howell's body before confessing he stole a gun from a family he was staying with and gave it, along with several rounds of ammunition, to Howell . Discovery: Sharifi says he found Howell's body after he got a call from Howell's mom asking him if he'd seen her son. On social media, he also indicated that the boy had left him a note before taking his life . Howell's devastated parents released a statement on Monday. 'We want to thank our friends, family and the public for the outpouring of support that we have received regarding the loss of our son and brother, Raymond ""Junior"" Howell. 'Even at the tender age of 14, Raymond lived a life of love, strong values and integrity that some people never fully experience... 'Our hope is that it one day allows for a truly meaningful conversation…and more importantly real change for the way we treat others in our schools and throughout our communities.' Friends recalled him as a happy and friendly teenager, but said he had recently asked for a transfer after being bullied by older students, CBS reported last week. 'There were people who didn't like him, but it's life - there's always someone that won't like you,' family friend Aleena Rogers, 16, told the Dallas Morning News. 'But those were very few and far between for him. He was loved by most everyone.' Tragedy: Howell was discovered dead near this rain culvert just a few miles from his high school . School: He was a freshman at McKinney Boyd High but had reportedly asked for a transfer because he was being bullied. The school district said on Monday it has found no evidence he had reported the bullying . She said he was always helping other people and called him 'an amazing guy with a huge heart'. But the high school said it had not found any evidence that the teenager or his parents had contacted administrators with concerns that he was the victim of bullying. The district's anti-bullying policy forbids name-calling, threats, taunting, teasing and assault, the Morning News reported. It also asks students to report bullying to school or district employees. 'The natural inclination is to find blame in these situations,' spokesman Cody Cunningham said on Monday. 'But as of today, we still have not found any reports from the family, from other peers, from teachers, of any potential bullying.' District officials continue to investigate. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Jordan Sharifi, 17, 'gave Raymond Howell, Jr., 14, a gun and ammunition to protect himself from bullies but Raymond used the gun to take his life'

"A gang of armed robbers used pink umbrellas to hide themselves as they stole £145,000 from 13 shops in a two-month crime spree. The brolly-clad thieves targeted supermarkets, convenience stores and electrical shops, swiping £2,000 worth of cigarettes and cars valued at £30,000 in the process. CCTV footage from one of the raids in Tipton, West Midlands, shows the gang using umbrellas to conceal their entrance as they burst into a supermarket, where they stole cash from the offices. Scroll down for video . Umbrella thieves: A gang of armed robbers used pink brollies to confuse staff as they raided 13 shops in a two-month crime spree in the West Midlands . The gang  also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives and screwdrivers, before punching one employee in the face. In a separate raid, the men stole the store manager's Mercedes E200 which they used as their getaway car. The group have now been jailed for more than 27 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to rob. Police caught the thieves following a raid on an Asda supermarket in Coseley, West Midlands, where they were armed with hammers and what was reported to be a gun in a plastic bag. Detectives then used forensic evidence found on the weapon to link the various burglaries, before executing search warrants on the homes of the four suspects. During the searches, police found fluorescent jackets, identical to those used in the raids, along with banks statements showing large transfers of cash. Armed: The gang also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives, golf clubs and screwdrivers . They also discovered numerous cash bags from a shop known as Farmfords, one of those targeted by the group, as well as £2,500 in cash. Mobile phones found at the addresses also showed several calls made between the group, while number plate analysis linked the defendants to the areas where the crimes had been committed. Liam Bell, 19, from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, and 22-year-old Trea Richardson, from Hansworth, were arrested in June last year, at the time of the warrants being executed. Marcus Morgan, 21, from Tividale, West Midlands, went on the run for five months before being detained in November. Guilty: Ashleigh Evans, 26 (left) from West Bromwich and Marcus Morgan, 21 (right) from Tividale, West Midlands, were jailed for ten years and seven years respectively for their parts in the 13 robberies . Jailed: Liam Bell, 19 (left), from Rowley Regis was jailed for six years and six months while Trea Richardson, 22 (right) from Hansowrth, was sentened to a four-year jail term . Ashleigh Evans, 26, from West Bromwich, was arrested on a flight back from Amsterdam. Officers even found the umbrella captured on CCTV in his luggage. On Friday, Evans was sentenced to 10 years in prison, while Bell was jailed for six years and six months. Richardson received a four-year jail term while Morgan was sentenced to seven years. Sentencing Morgan, Recorder William Mousley QC said to Morgan: 'No doubt you would have seen the fear in the eyes of the people you were robbing yet you carried on thereafter. 'It was not a one-off, it was a course of conduct you decided to engage in quite freely for a few weeks. 'This was professional, commercial robbery for significant financial gain where people were disguised and premises targeted that were vulnerable where people worked hard for not much money. 'They were not the type of premises where workers would expect people like you to come in and rob the store. The only mitigation I can find other than your guilty plea is your youth.' Speaking after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Rich Whitehouse, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The money and value of goods stolen, while significant, is nothing compared to the impact these offences have had on the staff members of the targeted premises. 'These offences were carefully planned and the group went to great lengths to conceal their involvement, often using umbrellas as cover when walking from the street to the shops, so as not to draw attention to their face coverings. 'However, the more offences they committed the more arrogant they became. There was also a clear escalation in the type of weapons used in the robberies and I am in no doubt they would have gone on to seriously hurt someone had they not been stopped.'","Thieves raided supermarkets and electrical shops during 55-day spree .

"One of the closest friends of Georgina Bartter, who died after consuming an ecstasy pill at a music festival last year, has pleaded guilty to supplying the teenager with the fatal pills that led to her death. A lawyer for Rebecca Hannibal, 19, appeared in front of Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday. Ms Hannibal had pleaded not guilty to single supply charge at a previous hearing but her defence representative told Magistrate Mark Buscombe she was changing her plea to guilty. Police alleged Ms Hannibal, of Cammeray, supplied a number of 'purple speaker' pills between 2pm and 3:30pm on November 7, the day before the Harbourlife dance festival near Mrs Macquarie's Chair where Ms Bartter collapsed. Rebecca Hannibal (centre) has pleaded guilty to supplying her best friend Georgina Bartter (far right) with 'purple speaker' ecstasy pills in the lead up to the Harbourlife dance festival .

Ms Bartter is believed to have had an extremely rare adverse reaction to the 'one and a half pills' she took on the night. She collapsed on the dance floor and was rushed to St Vincent's Hospital but died from multiple organ failure. Police charge sheets seen by Daily Mail Australia allege the pills were purchased from Matthew Forti, 19, who has been charged with supplying a prohibited drug between October 27 and November 8 last year. He has also been charged with supplying a prohibited drug in Northbridge in January this year and possessing a drug in Willoughby in February.

"A woman stabbed her boyfriend through the heart after he arrived home to find her in a short dress and stockings about to have sex with her lover, a court heard. Natasha Elderfield, 41, chased her partner off the boat they shared after he discovered her below deck with her lover, whose trousers were around his ankles, a jury was told yesterday. The court heard how she flew into a rage when boyfriend Robert Dobinson interrupted her attempts to have sex with another man. Natasha Elderfield, 41, is on trial at Oxford Crown Court accused of the murder of her boyfriend Robert Dobinson, 33, in Abingdon, Oxfordshire . She told police officers who arrested her, ‘my God, it’s so ******g funny’, after stabbing Mr Dobinson and leaving him to die on the banks of the Thames, the jury was told. Mr Dobinson, 33, had been dating mother-of-two Elderfield for about two years. The couple had had sex in the morning of the day he was killed, the court heard. The court heard that Elderfield’s lover, Tony Steggles, had brought a large amount of alcohol to the boat, and a ‘sulky’ Mr Dobinson had left to spend the afternoon with a friend. As Elderfield and Mr Steggles spent the afternoon drinking and dancing, Mr Dobinson repeatedly called his girlfriend in a jealous rage – with his constant interruptions making her more and more infuriated. At one point, she became so enraged that she called the police, telling the 999 operator ‘he’s had his ******g due, I’m not having this any more’. The court heard how, within ten minutes of that phone call, blood-soaked Mr Dobinson was staggering desperately along the bank of the river, yelling ‘help me, I’ve been stabbed’. Describing the afternoon the two lovers spent on the boat, prosecutor Charles Ward-Jackson told the court: ‘Natasha Elderfield had on a short dress and for a while she also had on stockings and they were getting affectionate and were on the point of having sexual contact. ‘She had spent a very pleasurable evening with her new lover Mr Steggles – drinking, dancing, the promise of sex – and it was being interrupted by her very irritating ex-partner and she was fed up of it. ‘That is the background against which Mr Dobinson arrived.’ After storming back to the boat, moored where the couple lived in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, Mr Dobinson went below deck to find his girlfriend and her lover in a tryst. The scene of the alleged murder on the banks of the River Thames in Abingdon, Oxfordshire . Mr Ward-Jackson told the jury: ‘It is likely that Mr Dobinson knew or suspected about this affair and not surprisingly resented it. ‘Within a short space of time Mr Dobinson arrived on the boat. Natasha Elderfield and Mr Steggles were down in the cabin and were about to have sex. ‘He had his trousers down when Mr Dobinson came down into the cabin and his arrival must have been extremely unwelcome.’ The court heard a fight broke out, with Elderfield throwing crockery at Mr Dobinson’s head and he in turn hitting her over the head with a fire extinguisher. The jury heard she then chased him out of the cabin armed with a 4.5in kitchen knife and stabbed him through the heart. ‘She returned to the boat, still holding the knife in an overhand grip, and told Mr Steggles: ‘I’ve stabbed the bastard.’ Elderfield, who told police that Mr Dobinson had accidentally walked on to the knife during a heated argument, denies murder. The trial continues. Police cordoned off a large section of the river bank after Mr Dobinson was found with fatal stab wounds .

"Earlier this week, Brazilian commuter Nelson Felippe was deeply offended by a scene he witnessed on a train platform. He proceeded to take a photo, and express his disapproval on Facebook, after which the image was shared more than 100,000 times in 24 hours. In the picture, taken on a train platform in Rio de Janeiro, two women hug and gaze into each others' eyes, but the source of his outrage soon becomes clear in a post that cleverly spoofs conservative attitudes. Brazilian man, Nelson Felippe posted this image, expressing his disapproval at the 'scene'. The viewer believes he is conducting a homophobic rant, as he mentions: 'They are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous' In his Facebook post, Felippe stated: 'I am not prejudiced, I think everyone does what they want out of your life. But I find it absurd that I should be forced to witness a scene like this. 'What one does in private is your business, but what you do in public concerns me yes. And I refuse to see a scene like this and consider it normal.' A man breaks safety regulations by standing with his foot on the yellow line . 'I do not wish ill of anyone, but people should be preserved. [They] are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous. Continuing with what the unknowing reader assumes at this point is a homophobic rant, the next part of the post starts to become confusing. 'If after a tragedy strikes, or worse, if someone dies, who will put the blame on who? On me? Worst of all is the example for children. Suddenly it becomes clear what Felippe, who works at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, is really warning against - with his tongue firmly in this cheek. 'What would happen to a child who sees this scene every day? 'Kids will think it's normal to wait for the subway on the yellow line. So, don't act like that guy over there. 'Follow the example of the girls.' It seems the Brazilian commuter was in fact observing a public transport safety regulation, which the man in the far top-right is clearly breaking. Felippe warns others not to follow in the delinquent man's footsteps. The post has received thousands of comments with users applauding his witty way of exposing homophobia. Leando Da Silver wrote: 'Great text. Shows that do not need to be boring to combat homophobia.'

"Islam will become America's second-largest religion by 2050 according to a report outlining the world's religious landscape 35 years from now. The number of Christians in the US will decline from three quarters of the population in 2010 to just two thirds in 2050, researchers claim. Statistics revealed by the Pew Research Center show the percentage of atheists across the globe is expected to fall across the same time frame while Muslims will outnumber Christians by 2070. Click on the graphic below for a breakdown on each country . Research shows that although Islam will be the fastest growing religion in the world over the next four decades, Christians will remain the largest group in 2050. At the same time, those who do not affiliate with any religion, including atheists and agnostics, will make up a 'declining share of the world's population' - even if their numbers are increasing in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and France. The map created by Razzmazz above shows the status of the world's faiths in 35 years' time, and how the percentage of those that consider themselves 'religiously unaffiliated' is expected to increase in the West. By 2050 in Europe, Muslims will make up one in ten of the overall population. The region's Christian population will shrink from 553million to 454million, according to projections. Islam will be the fastest growing religion in the world over the next four decades but Christians will remain the largest group in 2050, the report reveals. Pope Francis is pictured in Tirana, Albania last year . Changing landscape: This graphic, taken from the map above, shows how the percentage of those that consider themselves religiously unaffiliated is expected to increase in the West 35 years from now . The global Buddhist population will remain roughly the same but Hindu and Jewish populations will  be larger than they are today, according to the report. It reveals that five years ago, there were 2.2billion Christians in the world making it 'by far' the world's largest religion with Islam second with 1.6billion out of a global population of 6.9billion. By 2050, there will be 2.8billion Muslims and 2.9billion Christians, it is estimated. According to the Daily Telegraph, the report suggests the increase in Muslim populations could be put down to the fact those following the faith are younger while infant mortality rates are decreasing. Meanwhile, a number of countries are expected to have changing religious majorities in four decades. Christians are projected to fall below 50 per cent the population in the United Kingdom, Australia, Benin, Bosnia-Herzegovina, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the Republic of Macedonia.

"V.Stiviano, the alleged mistress of Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who he showered with expensive gifts, has been ordered to pay his wife $2.6million. Los Angeles judge Richard Fruin Jr. awarded Shelly Sterling most of the nearly $3million she had sought. Lawyers for Sterling had claimed that money used to buy V. Stiviano a house, luxury cars and stocks was her community property the couple had acquired over six decades of marriage. Stiviano's lawyer had argued that the gifts were made when Donald and Shelly were separated and that Shelly Sterling couldn't seek them from a third party. Scroll down for video . Shelly Sterling has been awarded nearly all of the $3 million she had sought to be returned from V. Stiviano, who had argued that the gifts were made when Donald Sterling was separated from his wife . Tuesday's ruling comes nearly a year after Stiviano's recording of Donald Sterling making racially offensive remarks bounced him from the NBA and cost him team ownership. Shelly Sterling's lawyers used other recordings to show he bought Stiviano a house, a Ferrari and other things. In the recordings on Stiviano's iPhone, she and the 80-year-old billionaire are heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife. 'The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,' Stiviano said in snippet played in court. During the course of their 2 1/2 years together, Sterling gave her a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex. Sterling testified that he paid for the entire house, though Stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer. During the course of their 2 1/2 years together, Donald Sterling had given Stiviano a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex . Donald Sterling said Stiviano hadn't contributed '50 cents' to the house and, noting that Stiviano is part black and Hispanic, said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending Hispanic bank and escrow employees. Shelly Sterling filed the suit against Stiviano about a month before the recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the NBA to ban him for life and fine him $2.5 million. In closing arguments, late last month, Shelly Sterling's lawyer had relied on the words of Miss Stiviano to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy. Testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court wasn't as clear-cut even after Sterling's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks Donald Sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of Stiviano's $1.8 million Spanish-style duplex near Beverly Hills. While an accountant for Sterling conservatively estimated that Stiviano got more than $3.6 million in Sterling gifts that included a Ferrari and Paris shopping spree, O'Donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $1 million in cash, saying the lower figure lined up with Stiviano's own admissions on the witness stand, depositions and court filings. V. Stiviano, 32, pictured arriving at Los Angeles Superior court last month, painted two conflicting portraits of Donald Sterling, saying he was a kind, generous mentor and father figure to her but also a 'bigot' who was mean to others . Judge Richard Fruin Jr had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the Sterling family's real estate company to Stiviano's bank accounts. Defense lawyer Mac Nehoray reiterated that point in his closing argument. He attacked the credibility of witnesses, particularly Donald Sterling, who had suggested Stiviano got her name on the home title illegally. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Donald Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers basketball games. In the furor sparked when the remarks were made public, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2 billion. Nehoray spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law doesn't allow Shelly Sterling to go after a third party like Stiviano because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband. 'Say he gave $2,000 to a call girl,' Nehoray said. 'Mrs. Sterling can't go and try to get that money back. We know that's not how it works.' In her testimony, Stiviano testified that the 80-year-old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant, driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children. 'We were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual. He became my everything and I became his all,' she said, though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature. Shelly Sterling, who accused Stiviano of fraud when she testified, painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and was now out to hurt him. Wife speaks: Shelly Sterling, estranged wife of former Los Angeles Clippers basketball team owner Donald Sterling, and her attorney Pierce O'Donnell arrive at Los Angeles Superior Court last month. Mrs Sterling painted Stiviano as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts . Stiviano, seen here outside the court during last month's trial, testified that tolerating Sterling's racist moments was 'part of the job' Platonic relationship: The 32-year-old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the Clippers owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature . Stiviano never not disputed Donald Sterling's largesse, though she quibbled with the sums at stake and emphatically denied that she used sex to manipulate him. She repeatedly testified that Sterling tried to manipulate her. The apparent contradictions finally led Shelly Sterling's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, to confront Stiviano with the question: 'Who is the real Donald Sterling?' 'The real Donald Sterling is a con artist, a bigot ... he's mean, he's despicable,' Stiviano replied, before quickly adding that to her, he was 'kind, loving, sweet ... a mentor, a father. ... He treated me as he treated no one else.' She added that tolerating his racist moments was 'part of the job' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family. Stiviano broke down in tears as she described the Clippers owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys. In her testimony, Miss Stiviano claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor, and she named a male friend of Sterling's who accompanied them on trips to Dubai, Paris and Thailand. Shelly Sterling said outside court that the assertion was crazy, and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises Stiviano. The judge allowed the testimony as Stiviano's lawyer tried to show where large, unexplained checks may have gone from Sterling's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $1.8million duplex, luxury cars, jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman Shelly Sterling asserts was his mistress. Stiviano said she saw cashier's checks given to the man for $800,000 for a 'so-called business deal' involving a property in Los Angeles and a check for $75,000 to reimburse him for the Dubai travel. Stiviano couldn't say if any of that money ended up in accounts identified as sources for the home purchase. She has denied that those were her bank accounts, and Sterling's lawyers couldn't make that connection. The 32-year-old witness said she had worked for Sterling's charity and spent about 12 hours a day with him over more than two years, driving him to view real estate or attending Clippers meetings and games together. She said he provided money, but it was not regular income — and that became a problem in late 2013 when she wanted a job. 'As long as you're with me side by side, I will take care of everything you need,' she said he assured her. But Stiviano became suspicious when he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement. She said she was offended and refused twice to sign any such paperwork. 'I know how he works his trickery,' she said. 'I knew something wasn't right.'","Shelly Sterling has been awarded most of the nearly $3 million she had sought to be returned .

"A vaccine has been developed to help prevent the recurrence of prostate cancer (cells pictured) A vaccine has been developed to help prevent the recurrence of prostate cancer, and potentially other cancers. It's designed to teach the immune system to recognise compounds found in prostate cancer cells and is being given to men who have already been treated for the cancer. The vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called TARP that's found in about 95 per cent of prostate cancers. Animal studies have shown that the protein can effectively stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer. The thinking is that the vaccine will prime the immune system so that it creates antibodies when it detects TARP-related cancers. Then, should the cancer reappear, the antibodies will be dispatched to attack the malignant cells. Those antibodies, along with other immune cells, can then destroy cancer cells without harming non-cancer cells, so minimising side-effects. It is initially being tested as a way to treat cancer that has returned but, if successful, could be used as a first line treatment for prostate and potentially breast cancer in the future. TARP is also found in about 50 per cent of breast cancers. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. In many cases the cancer develops slowly and patients may simply be monitored rather than actively treated. But in cases where the cancer is more aggressive, even after treatment there is a high risk of recurrence. Researchers at the U.S. National Cancer Institute are using the vaccine on 70 men who have been treated for the cancer, but whose PSA is rising again (posed by model) Once they have been treated, men are monitored with regular blood tests that check for a protein called prostate specific antigen or PSA, which can indicate cancer. The time it takes for the PSA reading to double is called the PSADT. Men with a PSADT of less than three months are at high risk of dying from prostate cancer. Around 11,000 men in the UK die from the disease a year. Researchers at the U.S. National Cancer Institute are using the vaccine on 70 men who have been treated for the cancer, but whose PSA is rising again. Men on the trial will have a PSADT greater than three months and less than 15. The trial will last nearly two years, and men will be given six injections of the vaccine or a placebo during that time. The number of men in Britain with, or who have had, prostate cancer . Professor Raj Persad, urology consultant at the Bristol Urological Institute, says that the idea of boosting the body's own immune defences is an 'excellent strategy' for preventing a recurrence of the disease. 'Toxicity studies will have to be done, and then clinical effectiveness studies are needed, and it will need to be compared to existing treatments,' he says. 'But despite these time constraints, the research looks very promising indeed and we must watch this space.' Meanwhile, the MMR vaccine may be a new way to tackle problem warts. Researchers have found that injecting the vaccine into warts that have resisted other treatments leads to six out of ten disappearing. Warts are caused by infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Although they can clear up without treatment within one to two years, about a third or more do not resolve and may multiply and enlarge, making treatment more difficult. In the new study, researchers used the jab on 65 patients who'd had warts for between two and 15 years. They had an average of three treatments. In 63 per cent of cases, the warts disappeared, while 6 per cent showed no response. The remainder had some improvement. Side-effects included pain during injection, itching and flu-like symptoms. The warts recurred in only two patients, according to the researchers from Zagazig University, Egypt, whose findings are published in the International Journal of Dermatology. The theory is that the vaccine stimulates the immune system, which then spots and attacks the HPV virus and the warts it had previously overlooked.","Vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called TARP .

"The five-year-old girl who survived when a car driven by her mother plunged into a lake believes her three siblings who died in the crash were eaten by crocodiles. Awel Manyang, who is recovering in hospital, believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Her siblings - one-year-old brother Bol and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger - died after their mother Akon Guode crashed her 4WD into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west on Wednesday. The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang, says five-year-old Awel remains in a serious condition at the Royal Children's Hospital but she remembers the accident. Scroll down for videos . Awel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode, believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water . 'Always when they see water they think of crocodiles, so that's what she said. She said they'd fallen into the water and there were crocodiles eating my younger brothers and sister,' Mr Manyang said, according to the Herald Sun. 'I went to see her yesterday and she was happy to see me. She knew me when I asked: 'Do you know me?' She said, 'Yeah, you're Daddy'.' Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody on Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told him she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her children crying out. The crash on Wednesday killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake . One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west just before 4pm on Wednesday . Ms Guode has been sent to stay with a relative after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash, The Age reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother earlier on Thursday saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He  made an emotional visit to the crash site on Thursday where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday . Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman . Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' It follows as the four-wheel-drive was removed from the lake on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. 'It's a shock for everyone,' Mr Kok said, according to the Herald Sun. 'We spent all night at hospital until 3 in the morning.' It comes as the tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. 'As soon as I saw the community coming towards this scene where the incident's happened, it's making me feel like people care,' Mr Kok said.

Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children . Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' A witness Michelle relived the tragic moment the car ploughed into the lake on Thursday morning. 'It is still in my mind now, every time you close your eyes you just see someone so little,' she told Nine News in tears. 'My heart goes out to the family and to everybody who witnessed it. 'Those rescuers, those workers, when it was winding down it was just devastating seeing them sitting in the gutter.' Michelle told 3AW late on Wednesday that her friend Travis rescued one of the young boys from the vehicle. 'Travis jumped into the water and smashed the back windscreen and got one little boy out. (Emergency workers) then started working on the child,' she said. 'I only saw three get taken out. I believe they were travelling down the boulevard...and they've just gone over and into the lake.' Emotions were still raw on Thursday morning for neighbour Michelle who witnessed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger plunging into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore . Locals are shocked as to how the car was able to get into the centre of the lake as it is 'pretty far from the road' Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred. Police particularly wish to speak to anyone who saw the car between 3.30 and 3.45pm. Witnesses or anyone with further information about the incident should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

"Professor Stephen Hawking: world-renowned physicist, best-selling author - and now he's shown off his musical talents as well. One of the world's greatest scientists has covered Monty Python's classic Galaxy Song, taking listeners on a journey out of the Milky Way. The author of A Brief History Of Time can be seen in the music video whizzing through space in his wheelchair, while the footage is interspersed with scenes of the Monty Python live shows. Scroll down for video . British physicist Stephen Hawking has sung Monty Python's Galaxy Song (clip from the video shown). The song is being released digitally and on vinyl for Record Store Day 2015. It is a cover of the song from 1983 film Monty Python's Meaning of Life. Professor Hawking, 73, appeared on film alongside Professor Brian Cox . Professor Hawking can be heard singing the show's famous song, which is being released digitally this week, and available on vinyl this weekend as part of Record Store Day 2015. In the video, Professor Hawking ‘runs over’ Professor Brian Cox before taking to the sky and making his trip through the universe. The video is interspersed with clips of Monty Python's recent live shows. It is a recreation of the song from the 1983 film Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, when Eric Idle originally took viewers on a journey through the cosmos. Interestingly, much of the science in the song is right - or at least, fairly accurate, with a few exceptions for artistic reasons. For example, the lyrics state that Earth is ‘revolving at nine hundred miles an hour.’ Measured in nautical miles, this is true, but the current estimate near the equator is actually 1,040mph (1,670km/h). It is also stated that ‘the sun is the source of all our power,’ which fails to consider that geothermal energy and the moon both also play a part in our planet’s life. Our galaxy is correctly said to have a hundred billion stars, though, while its size - a hundred thousand light-years across - is correctly stated. Towards the end of the song, the speed of light is said to be 12 million miles per minute - which is pretty close to the actual figure of 11.16 million miles. Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown . And things seem hard or tough . And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft . And you feel that you've had quite enough . Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving . And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour . That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned . A sun that is the source of all our power . The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see . Are moving at a million miles a day . In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour . Of the galaxy we call the 'Milky Way' Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars . It's a hundred thousand light years side to side . It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick . But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide . We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point . We go 'round every two hundred million years . And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions . In this amazing and expanding universe . The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding . In all of the directions it can whizz . As fast as it can go, the speed of light, you know . Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is . So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure . How amazingly unlikely is your birth . And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space . 'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth . Pictured here are Eric Idle (left), Stephen Hawking (centre) and Brian Cox.

Jenny Wallenda survived the invasion of Berlin by Soviet forces at the end of World War II and returned to the United States in 1947 to perform with her family. Her parents sent her to Germany to live with her grandparents in 1934 at age 6. Jenny Wallenda walked the high wire as an adult and performed on bareback horses as a child. According to the Sarasota Herald Tribune Wallenda advocated for causes important to the circus community in her later years and helped create the Circus Ring of Fame. She was inducted into the Ring of Fame in 2008. Nik Wallenda paid tribute to the woman he called Oma on his Facebook page. 'She was an amazing woman who lived a truly incredible life. She will be missed everyday. Oma in your honor, I will never give up,' he wrote.

"Rock Hudson once called him his 'one true love,' and now Lee Garlington is opening up about his three year relationship with the iconic Hollywood actor - and the lengths they went to in order to keep his sexuality a secret. Garlington says he was an extra on a movie set when he first decided to check out Hudson, having heard rumors the star was gay, but had to wait an entire year until he heard from the star. 'I think he had me checked out,' says Garlington in an interview with People. Scroll down for video . Lee Garlington is opening up about his secret gay relationship with Hollywood star Rock Hudson (above with James Dean and Elizabeth Taylor on the set of Giant) Hudson  was briefly married to Phyllis Gates (wedding photo above) from 1955 to 1958 . Garlington says the first meeting with the actor was a little nerve-racking, and that nothing happened other than the two having a beer, but soon they were spending all their time together. 'I'd come over after work, spend the night and leave the next morning,' says Garlington. 'I'd sneak out at 6am in my Chevy Nova and coast down the street without turning on the engine so the neighbors wouldn't hear. We thought we were being so clever.' Garlington says he would sneak over to the Hudson's house (above with friend Doris Day) after work, and leave first thing in the morning . As for social events, he says the two would just each bring a date so people did not know they were in fact dating. This lasted for three years, from 1962 until 1965, and while their sneaking around seemed to work for awhile, Hudson became concerned after learning that a female fan had broken into his home as he had photos of Garlington, a stockbroker, in his bedside table. 'She didn't find them, but it shook him up,' say Garlington. 'He realized he was vulnerable. He put gates on the house after that.' Soon after the couple parted ways, but Garlington reveals he had no idea how much the actor cared for him until he read his biography, released after he died of AIDs in 1985, in which he called him his 'true love.' 'I broke down and cried,' he says. 'I just lost it. He said his mother and I were the only people he ever loved. I had no idea I meant that much to him.' Garlington says Hudson (left with Taylor, right with Marilyn Monroe) would being a female date whenever they went out . Hudson, who was briefly married to Phyllis Gates from 1955 to 1958, would never publicly come out of the closet before his death, though many of his closets friends, including Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, were said to have known about his lifestyle. The actor, whose breakout role came opposite Taylor and James Dean in the 1956 film Giant, for which he would go on to be nominated for an Oscar, would have other relationships with men over the course of his life, most notably Marc Christian. Christian, who met Hudson in 1982, would later sue the actor's estate after his death and win $5.5million after claiming he never informed him that he had AIDs, and continued to have sexual contact with him after he was diagnosed.

"Nearly 90 years after she would have graduated from high school, a 103-year-old Wisconsin woman finally got her diploma. Marie Hunt of Spring Green, Wisconsin, had to drop out of school after completing eighth grade when she found herself unable to get to her local high school,which was located six miles away from her home. Now a resident at Meadows Assisted Living and Memory Care in Spring Green, the centenarian was presented with an honorary degree by River Valley High School, 87 years after her fellow classmates graduated. Never too late: 103-year-old Marie Hunt received an honorary high school diploma 87 years after she would have graduated . 'I was born in 1911, and there was no way that country kids six miles away could go to high school,' she said, adding that instead she stayed at home and helped to take care of her eight younger siblings. When she expressed that she always regretted not graduating, her hospice nurse contacted the local high school to see if they could make Ms. Hunt's dreams come true. 'It's something I always wanted, and I didn't have the opportunity to go. And now, a hundred years later, here I am,' she told ABC's WKOW on her graduation day, 87 years after her classmates graduated in 1928. Interrupted education: Unable to get to her high school six miles away, Ms. Hunt dropped out and helped to care for her eight younger brothers and sisters . A different time: Born in 1911, Ms. Hunt didn't have easy access to transportation to commute to school . Friends, family, and fellow residents at her assisted living center were on hand to watch her walk in her black cap and gown as the traditional graduation song 'Pomp and Circumstance' played. River Valley High School's principal, the school board president and the district's superintendent were also in attendance to award the school's first honorary degree of its kind; before giving one to Ms. Hunt, the school had only ever issued honorary degrees to veterans. 'It is my great honor, as a high school principal, to be presenting you with your honorary high school diploma,' principal Kimbert Kaukl told her during the ceremony. School of life: Ms. Hunt was presented with a diploma after her hospice nurse contacted the local high school . Ceremonial rituals: Supportive friends and family laughed and applauded as Ms. Hunt moved the tassel on her graduation cap from the right to the left sides, signifying that she had graduated . Ms. Hunt, who has lived in Spring Green her whole life, did not share whether she had designs on higher education, but she did say that she 'might have been college material,' had she graduated when she was supposed to,as three of her siblings went on as three of her siblings went to college. For now, having her high school diploma has given Ms. Hunt plenty to be proud of. 'It says I've had a successful life,' she told WISC-TV Madison.","Marie Hunt of Wisconsin would have been in the class of 1928 .

"A man has gone to extreme lengths to avoid a $600-a-month hike in child support. Matthew Bird, from Ashburton, New Zealand, halved his income by quitting his well-paid job as an agricultural adviser to become a mechanic after he realised he would be expected to pay around $1,900 a month in child support payments. He said he was happy to give up is $70,000 a year pay check for a meagre wage of $38,000 a year, if it meant his child support payment dropped to $554 a month. Matthew Bird said he was happy to give up is $70,000 a year pay check for a meagre wage of $38,000 a year, if it meant his child support payment dropped to $554 a month . Inland Revenue recently amended their child support formula which was enforced on April 1. Mr Bird has fathered three children and was previously expected to pay $1,300 a month in child support. He said once the changes were implemented his payment rose by $600, to a total of $1,900 a month. ‘I’m on half wage but I pay a third of what I used to,’ Mr Bird told NZ media. He said the increased figure is ‘unreasonable’ and he believes illegal employment will flourish under the new system. Truck driver Dean Sorenson, 28, said he's also facing financial difficulty after his child support payments increased by $172-a-month. He said while he had considered changing jobs to reduce his payment, he thought his family would end up worse off if he did. New Zealand MP Jo Goodhew said those who were struggling with the new formula could come into her office to discuss how changing jobs could affect their future payment. Ms Goodhew has invited parents to her office to discuss how the new calculations are affecting their wage . As child support payments are calculated on information provided to Inland Revenue by parents, they have advised that parents check the information they gave is still up to date to ensure their payment has been calculated correctly. A spokeswoman for Waitaki MP Jacqui Dean said her office had received three inquiries about the changes to child support payments. Ms Goodhew’s Timaru office confirmed they had dealt with five cases in 2015, however, none were in relation to the changes that took effect on April 1.","New Zealand recently changed how they calculate child support figures .

He recalled his second day on the job was 49 degrees, the hottest day in Australia that year. ‘It’s a very sharp learning curve for policing out here.

"Demi Moore may be about to boost her fortune, but not because of any new film contract. The actress is selling the Manhattan penthouse she once shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis with an asking price of $75million which is exactly half of her total estimated fortune of $150million. And if the penthouse sells for that much, it will break the record for the most expensive co-op apartment ever sold on the Upper West Side. Moore and Willis purchased the south tower penthouse on the 28th floor of the historic San Remo apartment building in 1990 from Saturday Night Fever producer Robert Stigwood, in addition to a two-bedroom maisonette on the lobby floor. Scroll down for video . Moving out: Demi Moore is selling the Manhattan penthouse apartment she once shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis for a $75million asking price . 'We looked at everything on the park, Fifth Avenue, Central Park South and Central Park West, and there was just nothing like it,' Moore told the New York Times of her house search. 'The location, architecture and history of the San Remo were on a completely different level.' The 14-bedroom apartment includes a 7,000 square feet of living space and wrap around terraces with views of both Central Park and the Hudson River. The couple decorated the mansion in the skies in a Southwestern mission motif, complete with cherry wood detailing and a ceramic tile fireplace. New windows have been installed in every room, the bathrooms remolded and state-of-the-art equipment like a sub-zero refrigerator and viking range installed in the kitchen. Split: The couple, pictured left in 1997, purchased the Upper West Side home in 1990. They split up in 2000, and Moore says she doesn't spend much time there anymore.

In the living room, the focal point are the windows which look out onto the boat pond in Central Park. The San Remo was designed in 1929 by American architect Emery Roth, and it was turned into a co-op in 1972. Over the years, Moore has counted Dustin Hoffman, Diane Keaton, Steven Spielberg as neighbors - not to mention U2 frontman Bono who occupies the north tower penthouse. Moore says she is selling the apartment and maisonette since she doesn't spend much time at the residence anymore. Adam D Modlin, president of the Modlin Group, is in charge of the listing and says there is no other apartment in the neighborhood to rival Moore's. 'Compared with the other iconic private perches on the perimeter of Central Park, there just isn’t anything quite like this penthouse,' he said. 'It is the grandest residence in the south tower, the one that sits above all the others, a mansion in the clouds, and it is the largest intact park-facing residence at the San Remo with private outdoor space.' Moore and Willis were married from 1987 until 2000 and share three daughters. The combined monthly maintenance fees for both residences is more than $20,000.","Demi Moore and Bruce Willis purchased the south tower penthouse at the San Remo in 1990, in addition to a maisonette on the lobby floor .

"Posters telling Muslims not to vote in the election were plastered across an area of Cardiff . Posters telling Muslims not to vote in the election were plastered across an area of Cardiff yesterday. They read: 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah.' Posters were stuck on lampposts and bus stops across the Grangetown suburb telling the Muslim electorate: 'Islam is the only real workable solution for the UK'. Cardiff Council have begun removing the posters, dubbed 'chilling' and 'threatening' by locals. The full message on the poster reads: 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah and decides what is permissible or impermissible for mankind, based solely on their whims and desires. 'This leads to a decayed and degraded society where crime and immorality becomes widespread and injustice becomes the norm. 'Islam is the only real, working solution for the UK. 'It is a comprehensive system of governance where the laws of Allah are implemented and justice is observed.' Local parent Greg Pycroft, 36, was with his two-year-old son when he came across 20 posters plastered on his walk to nursery yesterday. The Welsh Government worker  said: 'It was quite chilling and threatening to see these posters.' Cardiff Council says any religiously motivated or offensive stickers will be removed as a priority. Grangetown councillor Ashley Govier said: 'People have a right to vote and that needs to be respected. Grangetown is a very tolerant area but it's got to go both ways. 'If they do choose not to exercise their right to vote, that's their business but we're trying to encourage people to do so and this is unhelpful and not very nice.'

Bosses at Cardiff Council (pictured) say workers have begun removing the posters, dubbed 'chilling' and 'threatening' by locals . Sahar al-Faifi, of the Muslim Council of Wales, said the anti-voting posters were put up in response to the voter registration campaign in Cardiff for the last three months. Miss al-Faifi added: 'The reason behind these posters is we have had such a successful voter registration campaign across mosques in Cardiff. 'We have been doing it every Friday for three months to encourage worshippers in an unpartisan way to participate in their civic duties. 'Most mosques were on board and the hateful people behind these posters do not represent us. 'The mosques believe they can be part of the political process of this country.'

"The baby boom generation is set to leave one last burden to its children and grandchildren – a wave of funeral debt. The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.’ It added: ‘This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.’ A 'simple' funeral with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker now costs £3, 590 . Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: ‘More than half of UK households have less than £3,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. ‘We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.’ The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost £2,000 more. An average ‘full works’ funeral now costs £5,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from £102 to £160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.","Number of deaths in Britain will increase by 20% over the next 20 years .

"Teller Lake has become a giant fish bowl. The lake in Boulder, Colorado, has been invaded by thousands of gold fish, which wildlife officials say started as someone dumping 'four or five' of their pets in the water two or three years ago. The animals have now multiplied to over 3,000 or 4,000, it's believed, and are threatening to over-run the natural species in the lake, by eating up all their resources and spreading unnatural diseases. 'Dumping your pets into a lake could bring diseases to native animals and plants as well as out-compete them for resources,'Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Invasion: Lake Teller in Boulder has been invaded by 3,000 to 4,000 goldfish, which wildlife officials say started as someone dumping 'four or five' of their pets in the water two or three years ago . Overrun: Goldfish are not a native species in Colorado and are very harmful to the local aquatic ecosystem . Threat: Fish that are native to the lake that are now being threatened by the invasive goldfish include channel catfish, blue gill fish and sun fish . In danger: Local officials are now considering two options - electroshocking the fish or draining the lake . Worried: Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill has warned people against dumping their pets into local environments, saying it can be incredibly dangerous . 'Everything can be affected. Non-native species can potentially wipe out the fishery as we've put it together.' Crews now face the arduous tasking of attempting to get rid of all the gold fish, but there are only two options. One is to drain the 12-acre lake completely, or use electrofishing, where the fish are stunned by an electrical current and removed while they are paralyzed. The latter is the most likely option. Problem: The consequences of introducing a foreign species is far-reaching, officials say . Scene: Teller Lake stretches about 12 acres in Boulder, Colorado . An electrical current is put in the water in sections and the stunning brings the fish to the surface. It was a successful method used in November 2012 at Thunderbird Lake, also in Boulder, to remove koi goldfish from the water that had been improperly introduced. Some 2,275 fish were removed in the process. 'Most people don't realize the far-reaching effects of introducing exotic species to the environment,' Ken Kehmeier, senior aquatic biologist for CPW, told The Denver Chanel. 'Nonnative species can be devastating to native populations by causing disease outbreaks and creating competition unbalance. Removal: In November 2012, over 2,000 koi goldfish were removed from the nearby Thunderbird Lake by 'electrofishing', where the fish are shocked with an electric current and paralyzed, causing them to float . Effective: With electroshocking, crews go out in a boat and stun the fish to paralyze and then collect them . 'It's an issue that anyone concerned with our environment should know about.' Despite the amount of fish in the lake, officials have warned locals against retrieving some of the fish and taking them home as pets. The gold fish will likely end up at a local raptor rehabilitation program as food. 'We don't have a timeline yet for when we're going to do that,' Churchill said.","Teller Lake in Boulder, Colorado, is overrun with 3,000-4,000 goldfish .

"A Romanian woman being deported from New Zealand after leaving her partner, has been told she must leave her two-year-old son behind. 34-year-old Nicole Mihai was told by the immigration agency that she will now have to return to Romania as she is not a New Zealand resident. However, the Family Court have ruled that her young son, Chris, is not able to reside further than 50 kilometres from his New Zealand father. She now faces a distressing battle with the immigration agency who insist Chris's future living arrangements 'are not their problem.' A Romanian woman being deported from New Zealand after relationship broke down, has been told she must leave her 2-year-old son, Chris behind . Nicole Mihai was told by New Zealand Immigration that once her Visa expires, she must return to Romania . 'I go to sleep at night and and wake up in the morning and think today may be the last day with my son,' Ms. Mihai told Daily Mail Australia. 'I go to sleep at night and and wake up in the morning and think today may be the last day with my son,' Ms Mihai said . Ms. Mihai separated from her New Zealand born partner after a two-year relationship. She was awarded full custody of their son, with her ex partner having little contact with Chris. Once they separated, immigration had Ms Mihai's Visa cancelled. 'I had to apply for a temporary Visa and residency,' she said. 'That was almost a year ago, and I've been fighting with them ever since.' According to Ms Mihai, the Immigration Agency have informed her that her application has nothing to do with Chris and therefore he is none of their concern. 'Immigration doesn't take all of the facts into consideration,' she said. In order for Chris to move to Romania to be with his mother, his father would need to sign a contract allowing him to go, which Ms Mihai strongly doubts. 'Even if he signed and Chris were to come with me, we would have to live in a two bedroom home with my mother, my sister and her child,' she said. 'It would be very hard for me to get a job and my mother cannot support all of us.' Ms Mihai moved to New Zealand seven years ago and worked as a waitress on minimum wage. She admits that she does struggle just like all other single mothers, but she has a new job as a branch manager and her and her son are happy in New Zealand. 'My son was born here... He doesn't know anything else,' Ms Mihai said. A ruling from the Family Court said Ms Mihai's son Chris must remain within 50 kilometres of his Kiwi father . The 34-year-old vows to fight this battle until the end and will not give up her life with her son . 'From Monday to Friday, eight til six, he's in daycare with his friends and for me to take him to a strange place where he doesn't know anybody would be very difficult for him.' Ms Mihai does not know when the end point to this battle will be, but she has had her temporary Visa extended until June 26 which is when she is expecting to receive a final decision. However she said she will fight this battle until the end and will not give up her life with Chris. 'I'd rather die than live one day without my son,' she said. 'I'm just hoping that everything will get sorted and I can just move on with my life and my son's life.'","A Romanian woman being deported from New Zealand after relationship broke down, has been told she must leave her 2-year-old son behind .

"Items on sale in Poundland are sometimes up to 50 per cent more expensive than those sold in supermarkets, new research has shown. The budget retailer last week announced that sales exceed £1billion for the first time last year becoming Europe's largest single-price discount retailer. The company's success has been put down to shoppers hunting bargains and taking sales away from Britain's four big supermarkets, Asda, Tesco, Sainsburys and Morrisons. Scroll down for video . New research has found that certain items on sale at Poundland, pictured, are up to 50 per cent more expensive than those sold in supermarkets . But according to research in the Sunday Times, shoppers in Poundland are being charged more per unit of certain products compared with bigger retailers. The research points out that at Poundland shoppers can buy a 250g box of Kellogs Cornflakes for £1, while at Tesco they can buy a 750g box of the cereal for the same price. A bag of Galaxy Minstrels with a weight of 105g also costs £1 in the shop but a bigger bag at at 153g can be purchased in Asda for 98p. Equally two pints of mile cost £1 in Poundland, but shoppers can get four pints in Asda for 89p. Also a pack of six Tunnocks Tea Cakes is 81p in Tesco, compared to £1 in the budget brand. Originally founded by entrepreneur Steve Smith in 1990, the company snowballed from a small private enterprise into a High Street revolution, which involves buying up unwanted stock and end-of-lines, then swiftly getting them into the shops to sell cheaply. However, the research does point out that there are still many products cheaper at Poundland compared to other supermarkets. These include a Fray Bentos steak and kidney pie, which is £2.20 in Sainsbury's and a 24 pack of Jaffa Cakes, which are £2.29 in Tesco. However, a spokesman for Poundland told the newspaper: 'We conduct price surveys every two weeks against the supermarkets and we believe we are 40% cheaper or more against 1,000 branded products. Comparing either supermarket promotions or larger pack sizes with our prices is not a meaningful comparison. Poundland has snowballed from a small private enterprise into a High Street revolution, which involves buying up unwanted stock and end-of-lines (file picture) 'Promotions are temporary and with larger pack sizes you have to spend much more to get any better value. On a like-for-like comparison Poundland’s value, across our whole range, is compelling.' The company's discounting strategy has since been adopted by bargain chains such as Aldi and Lidl, all of which have eaten into a market once dominated by the supermarket chains such as Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury's. Back then, shoppers were beginning to desert the High Street for superstores, but Mr Smith and his Poundland chain - which he sold in 2000 for £50million - were a lifeline that helped keep it afloat. Poundland said it had opened 60 new stores in the UK and Ireland and had a strong pipeline of openings for the new year. Meanwhile the retailer warned on Friday it may walk away from its planned £55 million acquisition of rival 99p Stores rather than be subject to a lengthy probe by the UK competition watchdog. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last week the agreed deal could result in a substantial lessening of competition and would be subject to a further investigation in the absense of undertakings, such as selling some stores. The company said in a statement: 'Poundland has decided not to offer remedies to the CMA', adding it had written to the regulator to request a Phase II review be suspended for three weeks. Such a review could take as long as six months.","Certain products at retailer are more expensive per unit than supermarkets .

"An Indian salesman is facing seven years in prison and a fine of up to one million dirham - around £186,000 - for allegedly cursing Islam and the Prophet Mohammad on Facebook. The 41-year-old man - identified only by his initials S.G. - is said to have posted a 'blasphemous' status on his Facebook page after watching a news bulletin about the war in Iraq on television last July. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to seven years in jail, a fine of between Dh250,000 to Dh1 million, or both. The Indian salesman faces imprisonment after he allegedly shared a 'blasphemous' status on his Facebook page. He told police he was sent the image over Whatsapp, but allegedly then admitted to posting the status . The 41-year-old is accused by the prosecution of posting the derogatory statements about Islam and the Prophet Mohammad after watching a news item about the Iraq war, pictured, in July last year . Lawyers for the prosecution said the man abused the social media network - namely Facebook - and the telephone communication system by cursing the Prophet and Islam, according to Gulf News. They are now looking for the toughest punishment possible under the country's cyber-crime laws. Islam is the official religion of the United Arab Emirates, and committing blasphemy is considered deeply offensive. Authorities in the country routinely censor newspapers and books that they consider contain blasphemous statements or anything critical of Islam. In the latest case, the accused salesman claimed he received the offending image over Whatsapp while he was at home . He then complained to police that he had receiving the image - but is reported to have later admitted to prosecutors that he was the one who posted the status on Facebook. The Indian employee, known only by his initials S.G., failed to attend the hearing at the Dubai Court of First Instance on Monday. The United Arab Emirates treats blasphemy as a serious criminal offence . The defendant apparently told prosecutors that he wrote the 'blasphemous' curses after watching video footage about the way in Iraq. His IPhone was seized and sent to a laboratory for forensic examination, and lawyers said the mobile was registered to the indian man's name. The accused failed to attend the Dubat Court of First Instance on Monday, and presiding judge Abdul Lat adjourned the case until the next hearing on April 27. In 2011 British tourist Andrew Graham ended up in court in Dubai after he called the Islamic prophet Mohammad a 'terrorist' during an argument in a shopping centre.","Indian man, 41, accused of posting insulting status about Islamic Prophet .

"People flocked to Apple's stores around the world to get a . close-up look at the Apple Watch, the tech company's first foray . into the personal luxury goods market. The device was available for preorder online and to try out . in stores by appointment, but not to take home. Tim Cook, . interviewed on cable television channel CNBC, said initial . orders were 'great.' Scroll down for video . A throng of Apple lovers gathers at its store in Tokyo's upscale Omotesando neighborhood for their first look at the Apple Watch. Apple CEO Tim Cook showed off his personal Apple Watch to customers at an Apple Store in Palo Alto. Apple predicted on Thursday that demand would exceed supply . at product launch. Without knowing how many watches consumers have ordered, . Wall Street analysts said it was too early to adjust their . estimates for sales of the gadget. Another key factor in the . watch's success will be demand once an initial wave of interest . from Apple enthusiasts subsides. The watch goes on sale officially on April 24, online and . through appointments in shops, including trendy fashion . boutiques in Paris, London and Tokyo, part of Apple's strategy . of positioning the wearable computer as a must-have accessory. But soon after online preorders opened on Friday, Apple's . website listed shipping times in June for some models of the . watch and four to six weeks for others. There was immediately brisk bidding on eBay for confirmed . orders for watches, with hundreds of sellers looking to make a . few hundred or even thousand dollars by passing on their . watches, once received. Customers look at Apple Watches at an Apple store in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province. An assortment of Apple's new watch lies on display during a preview day at the Apple Store in Covent Garden in London. 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' Mark Prigg in New York . The lowest-priced Sport model on eBay was $470, a markup of . more than $100. A top-of-the-line gold Apple Watch Edition was . listed for $20,000 on Ebay, $3,000 more than its official price. Testing Apple's mastery of consumer trends, the watch is an . untried concept for the Cupertino, California-based company. It . straddles a technology market accustomed to rapid obsolescence . and luxury goods whose appeal lies in their enduring value. At an Apple store in Paris, staff cheered the first . customers, most of them men under 30 years old. 'I have everything from Apple, so now I need to get the . watch,' 19-year-old Jeremy Dugue, wearing an Armani leather . jacket, said after ordering the stainless steel model at 1,149 . euros ($1,218). The Apple Watch sport starts at $349 while the standard . version comes in at $549 in the United States. High-end . 'Edition' watches with 18-karat gold alloys are priced from . $10,000 and go as high as $17,000. The Watch also went on display in Apple stores across these regions, as well as in Galeries Lafayette in Paris (pictured), Isetan in Tokyo, Selfridges in London, and select Apple resellers in Japan and China. At Apple's flagship store in New York, Jack Weber, who was . visiting from Charlottesville, Virginia, said he would give his . wife a top-of-the-line 'Edition' as a 50th-anniversary gift. 'What more perfect wedding present could there be than this . watch,' he said. Long wait times will likely stimulate more demand for the . watch - which allows users to check email, listen to music and . make phone calls when paired with an iPhone - with little risk . of losing impatient customers, said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. 'You would want to catch up by the holiday season,' Gauna . said. 'But based on what's out there in Android land, I don't . think there's an extreme risk in near term of losing customers . who must have a smartwatch and will go to some alternative.' Android is Google's mobile operating system used on many . smartwatches. Reviewers this week praised the watch, which also helps . users monitor their health and exercise, as 'beautiful' and .

"Council bosses spent more than £7,000 on a lavish three-course Christmas banquet and disco for staff as a last blow-out before the local authority shut up shop. Ards Borough Council in Northern Ireland, which will merge with its neighbouring authority next week, put on the taxpayer-funded dinner to ‘maintain morale’ and to encourage workers to do a good job. Staff feasted on roast turkey and potatoes cooked in duck fat before moving to the dance floor at the party, which was adorned with almost £500 worth of balloons and Christmas crackers. Ards Borough Council (offices pictured) spent more than £7,000 on a lavish three-course Christmas banquet and disco for staff . The Christmas party (file picture) is the first the council has hosted in recent years, and will be their last as the authority no longer exists after a merger with its neighbour . Council chiefs paid £5,225 for caterers for the dinner in December last year at the Queens Hall in Newtonards, County Down, with hire of the venue costing £265.80. A further £950 was spent on a photo booth, disco and security for the 190 staff at the Christmas do, with nearly £500 spent on festive decorations. The council recouped £1,920 of the £7,280.85 costs from deposits from workers who attended the party. The three-course menu, revealed to MailOnline under Freedom of Information laws, started with carrot and coriander soup, served with freshly baked bread and herb butters. Staff had a choice of roast turkey with baked ham and sage and onion stuffing, or Irish salmon with tarragon and white wine sauce for their main course. Both were served with duck fat roast potatoes and root vegetables. There was no vegetarian option. For dessert, workers could have either sticky toffee pudding and vanilla ice cream or keep with tradition and have Christmas pudding with brandy custard. Tea and coffees were also served. Starter .

The Christmas party is the first the council has hosted in recent years, and will be their last as the local authority merged with North Down Borough Council on April 1. The council said the dinner was ‘a one-off initiative supported by the council to thank staff for their dedication and hard work over many years and to acknowledge that this was the last year of Ards Borough Council’. The local authority added that funding was approved as ‘the event would maintain morale’ and ‘encourage continued high quality service delivery’. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Christmas is expensive enough for hard-pressed taxpayers without picking up the bill for somebody else's party. 'When we're trying to make big savings right across local and central government, wasteful spending like this is totally unacceptable. Those who signed off the spending must be held accountable.' Meanwhile Newry and Mourne Council, also in Northern Ireland, has spent £10,700 on staff Christmas parties over the last three years, which included subsidising drinks so workers paid just £1 a pint. The £1 drinks ‘happy hour’ ran from 7pm to 11pm each year at the parties, which cost the taxpayer £3,500 in 2012 and 2013, and £3,700 in 2014.

"This is the emotional moment Walter Scott's family met with the man who filmed his death - and threw the case wide open. Feidin Santana, 23, visited the family's Charleston, South Carolina home on Thursday to meet with the man's heartbroken parents, son and other relatives - in a moving moment witnessed by NBC. Santana has been hailed a hero for keeping his cellphone camera trained on Officer Michael Slager as he fired eight shots at Scott, 50, in North Charleston on Saturday and later releasing the video. 'Oh, thank you God!' Judy Scott, the mother of Walter Scott said, as she embraced Santana tightly. 'Thank you Lord! Blessed God! Thank you, thank you God. Thank you, thank you!' Scroll down for video . Hero: Feidin Santana, 23, is seen entering the Scott family home in Charleston on Thursday to meet the slain man's family, days after he recorded their son being shot dead by a white police officer . Thankful: Scott's mother, Judy Scott, looks at Santana before they embraced at the emotional meeting . Emotional: Scott's father looks on, right, as his wife thanks the man who captured the video on Saturday . Mr Scott's father, Walter Scott, Sr., also hugged the man and said: 'Thank you for another son, God, thank you. You've got a family in Charleston right now... anytime.' 'You did a good thing, Brother,' Walter Scott's son, Walter Jr., 20, added as he embraced Santana. 'I don't know how this would've turned out without the video, I just want to thank you. I don't know how much I could thank you more.' Santana, a barber who is originally from the Dominican Republic, said he shared the footage because he wanted the family to know precisely how their son had died. 'Just amazing that they know the truth, you know,' he told NBC News as he met with the family. 'And they know that Mr Scott won't, like I say, this didn't just happen and stay that way. 'God put me there for a reason, I'm a very believer of God.' Scott's mother added: 'He was supposed to be there.' Scott was pulled over for a broken tail light on Saturday, but when officers approached his car, he fled - perhaps because he had previously been arrested for failing to pay child support. As he ran, Santana saw him and pulled out his cell phone camera to record the moment Officer Slager shot Scott, who was unarmed, multiple times as he ran away. Santana said he is glad the video could show the true story of what happened to the Scotts' son . Grateful: Mr Scott's son, 20-year-old Walter Jr., said he wasn't sure how he could thank Santana enough . New friends: Mr Scott's father, also called Walter, told Santana he now has family in Charleston . The officer, who is white, slowly approached the man's body, calmly checked for a pulse and failed to perform CPR. Santana got closer and continued recording the man's body on the ground. 'I know what I saw and I expressed myself to [the police],' Santana told Morning Joe on Thursday. 'It was an abuse and I saw with my own eyes. I said I had a video tape.' One of the police officers told him to wait but 'I realized that would not be good in that moment,' he said - and he ran to his workplace. Santana then contacted a friend who came to his barber shop and watched the video. 'When I showed him [the video], he said this was not good,' Santana said. Following the shooting, Officer Slager, 33, filed a police report defending his actions, saying he feared for his life and that Scott had wrestled his Taser gun from him during a scuffle. But four days later, Santana's explosive video emerged, throwing doubt on the officer's story. Killer: Officer Michael Slager (left) was arrested on Tuesday for the killing of U.S. Army veteran Scott . Caught on camera: Officer Michael Slager, right, fired eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled from the officer in North Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday. The cop has been charged with Mr Scott's murder . Santana told the Today show on Thursday that Scott, a U.S. Coast Guard veteran and father-of-four, 'was trying to get away from the Taser... He never grabbed the Taser from the police'. Slager was charged with Scott's murder on Tuesday and could face the death penalty. He was terminated from the North Charleston police department the following day, with Chief Eddie Riggers telling a press conference that he had watched the video and found it 'sickening'. Slager has not entered a plea to the murder charge nor commented publicly on the killing. He has retained an attorney. Walter Scott will be laid to rest on Saturday and his family has said they will be filing a civil lawsuit against the North Charleston Police Department.

"She's been on the social media site for less than six months but new figures released by Twitter reveal the Queen is already the world's most popular online royal. Her Majesty's account @BritishMonarchy has amassed 970,000 followers during its time online and more than double the 446,000 picked up by the Prince of Wales and his @ClarenceHouse account. Spain's glamorous young royal couple, King Felipe and Queen Letizia, come next and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge take fourth spot. The real Queen of Twitter: Her Majesty's @BritishMonarchy is the most followed royal Twitter account . The Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima are also popular figures on Twitter and their @koninklijkhuis account has an impressive 151,000 followers. With 82,400 followers, the Duchess of York is the next most followed and narrowly beats her ex husband Prince Andrew whose @DukeofYork account boasts 72,900 followers. Nevertheless, despite their best efforts, when it comes to making a social media splash, none come close to the Queen who amassed 78,000 followers within minutes of sending her first Tweet. The missive, which was posted on the 23rd October, read: 'It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.' Despite its rather bland content, the message was re-tweeted 42,921 times and made a favourite by 47,130 people. Next in line: Charles and Camilla take second spot, while King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain are third . Liked: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who share an account with Prince Harry, are fourth . The Queen's first foray into photo-bombing, which came during last summer's Commonwealth Games, also proved popular on Twitter. Meeting athletes in Glasgow, Her Majesty accidentally wandered into the background of a selfie being taken by the Australian women's hockey team. Posted on Twitter by 'Hockeyroos' player Jayde Taylor, it swiftly went viral and racked up 14,535 re-tweets and 12,960 favourites. Prince Charles has also made waves on Twitter and memorably announced news of Prince William's engagement to the then Kate Middleton via the social networking site. The tweet, which read: 'The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince William to Miss Catherine Middleton' was re-tweeted 1,209 times and was a favourite with 184 people.

Several descendants of those of who fought in battle and current service personnel also attended the reception at Canada House, which is the home of the Canadian High Commission. The event was held in honour of the three Canadian regiments which the royal members individually lead as Colonels-in-Chief. The Queen wore a special diamond-encrusted white gold sweetheart brooch for the occasion, fashioned in the shape of the cap badge of The Calgary Highlanders for whom she is Colonel-in-Chief. The brooch was a token created especially for her by the regiment who are among a trio of Canadian military units who are on a European pilgrimage to mark the centenary of the 2nd Battle of Ypres, specifically the Battle of Saint Julien and Kitcheners Wood. Today's reception formed one of the highlights of events marking the centenary of First World War battles which are being commemorated by the trio of regiments, according to Canada's High Commissioner Gordon Campbell.

The Duke of Edinburgh smiles as he is saluted during his exit from Canada House following today's reception . Mr Campbell said: 'It is always exceptional when Her Majesty comes and joins us at Canada House, particularly now as this is the 100 year anniversary of the bestowing of the first military honours to Canadians. 'You can just feel, in the room, how important it is to everyone that she is here. 'It is really an honour and it is the sort of commemorative activity that is important to the soldiers and the service people who are involved.' Honorary Colonel Richard Talbot, of the Canadian Scottish Regiment, added: 'To have the three royal Colonels-in-Chief here in one room is unique. I do not think it has happened before. We are proud to be a part of this day.' Her Majesty's visit to Canada House comes just two months after she visited the central London establishment to reopen it following extensive renovations.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh appeared in good spirits as they arrived to a red carpet at the event . Her Majesty was welcomed into the venue, which she reopened herself in February following renovations . Of particular interest to Her Majesty was the atrium, which was renamed in her honour and features Canadian hemlock cladding and a swathe of red oak flooring. The atrium, although the newest addition to the list, is by no means the only place named after the monarch. In Canada alone, no fewer than 62 schools, roads, hospitals and parks are named after Her Majesty, among them an observatory, an island chain and two different mountain ranges. Elsewhere, the list of places named after the Queen includes a city in South Australia, British and Australian Antarctica and Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is famous for its beauty and tree-climbing lions, in Uganda. Earlier this week, the Queen appeared unusually nervous and was spotted crossing her fingers as she cheered on her horse in the Royal Box at Newbury. Unfortunately for Her Majesty, her horse Ring of Truth was narrowly pipped to the post - prompting a brief look of horror and a rueful smile from her owner.

She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn.

"The funeral for tragic NSW teacher Stephanie Scott will be held next Wednesday in her home town of Canowindra, and the parish priest officiating at the ceremony is bracing himself for a hugely emotional occasion. Reverend Jonno Williams is the parish priest of the Anglican-Uniting Church at Canowindra and will be conducting Wednesday’s funeral service. He knows the family well and is expecting it to be a tough day for everyone. ‘The funeral will take place next Wednesday, but everything else has yet to be confirmed. I’ll be speaking with the family this afternoon to finalise the details,’ Reverend Williams told Daily Mail Australia. Stephanie Scott went missing on Easter Sunday. Her burned body was found last Friday around five metres from a road in Cocoparra National Park . A picture of Stephanie as a little girl with her father Robert was posted on Facebook by her sister Kim . Last Saturday Ms Scott's father Robert (left), mother Merrilyn (centre) and sister Robyn (right) were among those gathered at a memorial service for her at Mountford Park, Leeton . Ms Scott's distraught fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley attends the memorial service in Mountford Park . ‘I know Stephanie’s father relatively well through the time that he taught at the local Canowindra High School. 'It’s going to be a very difficult time for everyone, especially for the young people in town who knew her well.’ Reverend Williams was also yet another person who sang the praises of the young teacher whose heart-breaking tale has gripped Australia in recent weeks. ‘She was vice-captain of Canowindra High School and worked at the local swimming pool when she was younger,' Reverend Williams told Daily Mail Australia. Another Facebook picture shows Stephanie having a good time with her friends . Mr Leeson-Woolley and Ms Scott were due to be married last Saturday . Ms Scott was a popular teacher at Leeton High School where students paid homage to her . 'She also worked at the local supermarket, so she was well known by everyone here from a young age. ‘Throughout this time Stephanie was always known for her friendly disposition and she was always friendly with anyone that she met. ‘I met her a few times myself and she showed herself to be a very friendly and cheerful girl. The community both here in Canowindra and in Leeton will be out in force to say their goodbyes on Wednesday.’ Ms Scott's father, Robert Scott (centre), is comforted by family members at the Mountford Park service . Mr Leeson-Woolley (right) was a forlorn figure at the Mountford Park memorial last Saturday in Leeton . Less than a week before her wedding the Leeton high school teacher went missing on Easter Sunday.

"His neighbors wouldn't let him build a film studio. So George Lucas is retaliating in a way that only the cream of Hollywood could - by building the largest affordable housing development in the area. The complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the Star Wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families. And there's very little his fellow Bay Area residents can do about it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making waves: George Lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on the plot of land in Lucas Valley, Bay Area, which his neighbors are determined to leave untouched . Lucas dropped plans for a Lucasfilm Ltd studio complex on Lucas Valley Road in 2012. Citing opposition from neighbors, a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an 'evil empire'. But it seems the award-winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his Grady Ranch estate in Marin County, California. The project, submitted for planning on Wednesday, would span 52 acres and cost around $200m. Just a few meters from his own Skywalker Ranch, the community would consist of two complexes. One would contain 120 two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes for low-income families. The other would be for pensioners: a four-story building with 104 one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments. Because Lucas proposes to fund the project himself, his lawyers say he has the right to select who lives there. However, his representatives insist the project is not a form of retaliation. 'He said ""we've got enough millionaires here. What we need is some houses for regular working people"",' his lawyer Gary Giacomini told CBS. Scrapped: This was a rendering of the film studio that Lucas planned to build on the estate but was overruled . Idyllic: The 224-home community would be built in this idyllic spot of California for low-income families . Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey told the station: 'George Lucas said, ""if I’m not going to do what I wanted to do there, what can I do that would be really beneficial to this community?""' It is not the first time Lucas has courted controversy. In November 2014, residents of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Lucas' plans to build a museum along the shore of Lake Michigan. The case was a major blow to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, a shrine his collection of art and movie memorabilia, after negotiations over a waterfront site fell through with San Francisco.","Neighbors blocked Lucas' plans to build a film studio in 2012 .

"Drinking two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning, a study found. A cancer-killing cocktail of the hormone drug tamoxifen and two coffees every day was found to reduce the risk of tumours returning by 50 per cent in women recovering from the disease, researchers said. Tamoxifen kills off cancer cells or stunts their growth by blocking the cancer-causing hormone oestrogen from reaching diseased cells. Women who have suffered from breast cancer can slash the chances of the cancer returning by half - if they enjoy two cups of coffee a day, as well as taking hormone drug tamoxifen (picture posed by model) It is the main drug given to women who have not been through the menopause, and is usually taken for five years or longer after breast cancer treatment. And when combined with two cups coffee, it can be even more effective, according to a study of 1,090 breast cancer patients by British and Swedish researchers at Lund University, Sweden. Their findings found that women who had been treated with tamoxifen - and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day - had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee, or none at all. Ann Rosendahl, a researcher from Lund University who carried out the study, said: ‘The study also shows that those who drank at least two cups of coffee a day had smaller tumours and a lower proportion of hormone-dependent tumours. ‘We saw that this was already the case at the time of diagnosis.’ The study also found that breast cancer cells react with caffeine and caffeic acid, which are both found in the hot drink. Caffeine caused the cells to divide less frequency - and die more often - especially when it was drunk in combination with tamoxifen. Mrs Rosendahl said: ‘This shows that these substances have an effect on the breast cancer cells and turn off signalling pathways that the cancer cells require to grow.’ Researches found caffeine causes breast cancer cells to divide less frequently and divide more often . Taking prescribed medicine is still vitally important to treating cancer, clinicians have stressed . Despite their findings, the study’s researchers were keen to stress the importance of prescribed medication in treating cancer . ‘They are incredibly important, but if you like coffee and are also taking tamoxifen, there is no reason to stop drinking it. Just two cups a day is sufficient to make a difference,’ Mrs Rosendahl said. Previous studies have found that drinking coffee could reduce the risk of cancer in heavy drinkers. And the World Cancer Research Fund believe the hot drink can protect against liver cancer, which is often associated with alcohol abuse. Experts from the Harvard Medical School have also found that women who drink three or more cups of coffee a day have a 20 per cent lower risk of developing skin cancer, compared with those who had less than one a month . Responding to the study, Jackie Harris, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘Though this is an interesting study much more research is needed before we can fully understand the effects coffee and caffeine can have on tumour growth or risk of recurrence. ‘Making small changes, like maintaining a healthy weight and taking regular exercise, can help reduce the risk of breast cancer returning.'","Researchers tested effects of caffeine on patients taking Tamoxifen .

'He got into the red Chevy pickup truck parked at the residence to pull it forward so he could move the garbage cans and unfortunately the child managed to get under, in front of car and he ran over the child,' Unified Police Department Lt. Justin Hoyal told Fox 13. 'Very tragic situation here today.' Kendra suffered severe head trauma and was unconscious when medical workers arrived, and was pronounced dead shortly after at a nearby hospital. This is now the fourth time since August that a child was accidentally run over and killed in their own driveway by a family member in Utah. The grandfather is not facing any charges at this time, but the case remains under investigation. 'No family member ever wants to go through something like this, and so it’s always important that when you are pulling out, you’re backing out of your driveway: Just take that extra second to check and make sure there is nobody, none of the children have followed you out, or nobody is around your vehicle,' said Hoyal.","Kendra Moad of Kearns, Utah followed her grandfather out of the house Friday morning and into the driveway .

"Tragic: An inquest heard Shaun Worthington died instantly after his car veered into oncoming traffic . A night-shift worker was killed instantly in a horror crash seconds after sending a text whilst driving home from a speed awareness course, an inquest has heard. Driver Shaun Worthington's car was filmed on a truck's dashcam veering into the path of oncoming traffic at 1.04pm - the same time the fatal text was sent. The 29-year-old died when his silver Audi A4 collided with a truck on the A614 between Burton Agnes and Haisthorpe, near Bridlington, East Yorkshire, on November 19 last year. His mother Jane Allen said: 'No mother should have to go through what I have and the devastation of losing a son. 'Shaun was such a bright man and very popular with a lot of people. 'If someone somewhere reads this and it makes them stop using their phone while driving, then at least that is something.' An inquest at Hull Coroner's Court held into Mr Worthington's death heard how he had completed a 12-hour night shift at Cranswick Pet Products in Driffield, before driving to York to complete a speed awareness course on the morning of November 19. He was on his way home to the house he shared with his sister Andrea Ward and her family in Bridlington when the crash happened. Mr Worthington's mobile phone records showed he had sent a text message at 1.04pm that afternoon, the same time the crash happened. Collision investigator officer Alfred Place said a forward-facing camera on the truck captured Mr Worthington's car drifting into the centre of the road before veering into the westbound carriageway into the path of the oncoming vehicle. The camera also captured the time of the crash as 1.04pm. Truck driver Mark Harness told police at the scene he had tried to swerve to avoid Mr Worthington but nothing could be done. Mr Worthington's family told the inquest how Mr Worthington had recently bought a new phone which did not fit into his previous mobile phone holder and that normally he would use his hands free device. Plea: Mr Worthington's mother, Jean Allen (pictured), appealed to other motorists not to use their mobile phones when driving after it was found her son had sent a text message seconds before his car crashed . The stretch of the A614 where Mr Worthington was killed between Burton Agnes and Haisthorpe, East Yorkshire, on November 19 last year. He had been driving home from a speed awareness course . Mrs Allen said: 'If people know that someone is driving they should not ring or text them, just wait until they have got to where they need to be safely' Mrs Allen said: 'Shaun paid the ultimate price. He was not a reckless driver, he wasn't on drugs or drinking. 'If people know that someone is driving they should not ring or text them, just wait until they have got to where they need to be safely.' Returning a verdict of accidental death, coroner Paul Marks reiterated Mrs Allen's call for people not to use their phones while driving. He said: 'I would like to make a point to the public. 'All vehicle drivers should use hands-free communication accessories. 'When driving, motorists should not read or compose texts. They need to pull up if they want to send a text.' Mr Worthington was born in Hull and attended Lambwath Junior High School and Malet Lambert School, in east Hull, before moving to Bridlington with his family when he was 13. He went on to study at East Riding College, where he qualified as a chef. When he was 18, he moved to Spain with Mrs Allen and his stepfather John to help run the family business, a bar called Goodfellas in Magaluf. He spent about a year in the Spanish resort before returning to Bridlington. His family said they would like to thank everyone for their messages of support following his death. They also thanked police and family liaison officers for their support. Mrs Allen said: 'I could not have asked for a better son. 'I am going to miss him so much, but he will be forever with me in my heart. 'We are devastated by what has happened. It has blown our world apart.'","Shaun Worthington's car veered into truck moments after text was sent .

"This is the dramatic moment a golden retriever had to be rescued from the water after being swept half a mile out to sea while playing on the shoreline. Ten-year-old Martha had been with her owner on the beach in Leasowe in Merseyside and was paddling in the water when she was caught out by a strong current. And with the strength of the outgoing tide, the dog was rapidly swept out to sea with her owner launching their own rescue attempt. New Brighton RNLI crew spot golden retriever Martha in the water after she was swept out to sea by the tide . The crew members lean over the side of the lifeboat as they attempt to pluck Martha from the freezing water . But as they were unable to save their pet, New Brighton's RNLI crew were called and managed to find Martha who was cold and shivering. They then pulled the dog on to the lifeboat after managing to grab her by the collar. The lifeboat's senior helmsman Dave Lowe said: 'Although sea conditions were calm it was still very difficult to spot the dog. Martha was successfully pulled on to the lifeboat after being found cold and shivering  half a mile out to sea . The pet is brought to shore by the RNLI, who have warned about the importance of owners not attempting to rescue their pets, who get into difficulty at sea . 'When we eventually reached her we just managed to get hold of her collar then got her into the lifeboat. 'Although she had been swimming well she was cold and shivering and we wrapped her up in survival bag and calmed her down then took her to the lifeboat station where we were met by her very relieved owner.' But despite the crew successfully rescuing Martha, they have warned about the importance of owners not attempting to rescue their pets, who get into difficulty at sea. Martha with the RNLI crew who rescued her from the sea by grabbing her collar and pulling her into the lifeboat . Ian Thornton, deputy launch authority at New Brighton who oversaw the RNLI operation from shore added: 'This is the second dog rescue in recent weeks with the strong potential of the owners going in to the sea to attempt a rescue, fortunately this time it did not end in tragedy. 'It also follows on from a series of call outs to assist dog walkers who have been cut off by the tide in recent months. 'We cannot stress once again the importance of knowing the local tide times. In this area the tides come in fast via gullies so people end up cut off from shore several hours before high tide. ' When high tide is passed then the tide retreats equally quickly with many strong and dangerous currents ready to sweep humans and animals away.'","Martha, aged 10, had been paddling in the water when she was swept out .

"Nasa has finalised an ambitious mission to send a spacecraft closer to the sun than ever before. The Solar Probe Plus will carry four experiments into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star . During the closest passes around the sun, temperatures outside the spacecraft will reach nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Scroll down for video . Solar Probe Plus will carry four instrument suites into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star. The launch window opens for 20 days starting on July 31, 2018. Over 24 orbits, the mission will use seven flybys of Venus to reduce its distance from the sun. The closest three will be just 3.8 million miles from the surface of the star. Solar Probe Plus is scheduled to launch aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta 4-Heavy rocket with an upper stage from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The launch window opens for 20 days starting on July 31, 2018. Over 24 orbits, the mission will use seven flybys of Venus to reduce its distance from the sun. The closest three will be just 3.8 million miles from the surface of the star. Scientists have long wanted to send a probe through the sun’s outer atmosphere, or corona, to better understand the solar wind and the material it carries into our solar system. The primary science goals for the Solar Probe Plus mission are to trace the flow of energy and understand the heating of the solar corona and to explore the physical mechanisms that accelerate the solar wind and energetic particles. To meet those objectives, Solar Probe Plus will carry four instrument suites into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star. These instruments will study magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles, and will image the solar wind. The spacecraft and instruments will be protected from the sun’s heat by a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite shield. During the closest passes around the sun, temperatures outside the spacecraft will reach nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. How it will get there: Over 24 orbits, the mission will use seven flybys of Venus to reduce its distance from the sun. The small car-sized spacecraft will plunge directly into the sun's atmosphere approximately four million miles from our star's surface. It will explore a region no other spacecraft ever has encountered. The mission - which will fly closer to the sun than any spacecraft has before - reached a major milestone last month when it successfully completed its Critical Design Review, or CDR. An independent NASA review board met at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, or APL, in Laurel, Maryland, March 16-20, 2015, to review all aspects of the mission plan. APL has designed and will build and operate the spacecraft for NASA. The CDR certifies that the Solar Probe Plus mission design is at an advanced stage and that fabrication, assembly, integration and testing of the many elements of the mission may proceed. Solar Probe Plus will carry four instrument suites into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star. These instruments will study magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles, and will image the solar wind. Wide-field Imager: principal investigator, Russell Howard, Naval Research Laboratory in Washington. This telescope will make 3-D images of the sun's corona, or atmosphere. The experiment will also provide 3-D images of the solar wind and shocks as they approach and pass the spacecraft. This investigation complements instruments on the spacecraft providing direct measurements by imaging the plasma the other instruments sample. Fields Experiment: principal investigator, Stuart Bale, University of California Space Sciences Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif. This investigation will make direct measurements of electric and magnetic fields, radio emissions, and shock waves that course through the sun's atmospheric plasma. The experiment also serves as a giant dust detector, registering voltage signatures when specks of space dust hit the spacecraft's antenna. Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun: principal investigator, David McComas of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. This investigation consists of two instruments that will monitor electrons, protons and ions that are accelerated to high energies in the sun's atmosphere.

And the differentiation between the shades becomes more subtle over time. Players get a point for every correct square identified, but if they click or tap the wrong square they lose a point.

'This puzzle is designed to evaluate the quality of your colour vision,' said the developers, but isn't intended to replace a full or partial eye examination . 'This puzzle is designed to evaluate the quality of your colour vision,' said the developers. 'You should identify the difference, if possible, and share your result with your friends.' But they stressed: 'Even though this test can be very accurate, it should never be used to replace a doctor's visit. '[It] provides basic information and guideline for your eyesight and colour test, and is not intended to replace a full or partial eye examination.' Eyesight and colour was recently linked to how we perceive the world by Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Facebook-owned virtual reality (VR) experts Oculus. He explained that humans only have three colour sensors, we can’t see infrared or ultraviolet and we have a blind spot in each eye. ‘Our visual data is actually astonishingly sparse and even if we were able to accurately record and process every photon that reaches our eyes, we’d still have too little data to be able to reconstruct the world accurately,' he said. He used the recent black and blue/white and gold dress as an example. ‘Our visual system takes its best guess and sends that to the conscious mind,’ he continued. The blue and black (or gold and white) dress that sweeped the internet last month revealed just how differently two people can see the world. But it's not just about lighting conditions or optical illusions - evidence is mounting that until we have a way to describe something, we may not see its there. Ancient languages, for instance, didn't have a word for blue and scientists believe as a result our ancestors didn't notice the colour even existed. In 1858 William Gladstone, who later became the British prime minister, counted the colour references in the Homer's Odyssey and found blue wasn't mentioned at all. Black is mentioned nearly 200 times and white about 100. Red, meanwhile, is mentioned fewer than 15 times, and yellow and green fewer than 10. And blue doesn't appear in Greek texts, the Koran, ancient Chinese stories, and an ancient Hebrew version of the Bible, according to a German philologist named Lazarus Geiger. Egyptians, who were the only culture that could produce blue dyes, were the first ancient civilisation to have a word for the colour blue and there remain tribes today who don't have a word for blue, such as the Himba people in Namibia. Several years ago, researchers showed some of the Himba tribe a circle with 11 green squares and one blue. The study found they could not pick out which one was different from the others, or took much longer to make sense of it. However, the same tribe has many different words for green. When they were shown squares with one green a different shade, they could pick it out immediately. Researchers showed the Himba tribe in Namibia  11 green squares with one blue. The study found they couldn't pick out which was different from the others, but the same tribe has many words for green. When they were shown squares with one green a different shade, they  picked it out immediately (second top left) 'The way that the brain compensates for the limited data it receives is by maintaining a model of the real world that it constantly updates as new data comes in. 'And it is that model, not the real world, that you experience and trust implicitly. We are inference machines, not objective observers. He then showed a red and blue pill on hands that were shown on a yellow background to give an example of how this inference model breaks down. Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Oculus recently used this image to show how vision is simply our perception of the world, but isn't realty. The pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them . The colours of the pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them. And even when a person knows that the pills are grey, they still see them as red or blue. ‘Your visual system isn’t interested in whether the photons coming from a tile on a random image are red or blue or grey,' Mr Abrash continued. 'Knowing that didn’t keep anyone from being eaten by lions on the Savannah. What it is interested in is identifying potentially relevant features, in the real world, under a variety of conditions. 'Your visual system constantly corrects for the colours in the scene. It is reverse engineering reality rather than just recording it. The colours seen are your brain’s “best guess.”’","Free app is available on Facebook, Android, iOS and on desktop browsers .

"Listeners say the  last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions on the iPlayer service . It seems that the BBC has lost the plot with its radio dramas. Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. They branded the problem ‘irritating’, ‘annoying’ and ‘frustrating’ and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system. But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. It was raised by the BBC’s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: ‘Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? 'All because you can’t be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?’ Another added: ‘I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.’ Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes . According to the BBC’s own figures, in February this year, 57million ‘requests’ were made for radio programmes on BBC iPlayer. Each request means a person chose to listen to a show. Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC’s Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem. He told the programme: ‘There are a lot of shows every week that are made available on demand and we simply can’t humanly check every single one of those, so what we are trying to do is make sure we have the very best fail safe systems in place.’","iPlayer listeners say the vital last minutes have been left off  radio dramas .

'It's a combination of her love to dance and my interest in German history,' said Bruce Schwab. One, two, step!

Fiddlers perform at Twin Sisters Dance Hall in December.  A preservation group says old Texas dance halls that for years served as important social centers in rural areas of the state are decaying and closing, with comparatively few still operating . Competition: Patrons are seen listening during a fiddle festival at Twin Sisters Dance Hall . Kendalia Halle was built more than 100 years ago by German immigrants, who through the latter half of the 19th century comprised more than 5 percent of the state's population, according to the Texas State Historical Commission. It's one of an estimated 1,000 dance halls that sprung up around Texas in the 1800s, knitting together German, Czech, Polish and other immigrant communities. About 400 such halls still stand — many unused and decaying — but only two traditional Texas dance halls continue to operate on nearly a daily basis: Luckenbach hall in Fredericksburg and Gruene Hall in New Braunfels. 'The culture has shifted away from rural areas where most of the halls are, but what we see is that these cultures are foundational to what Texans are and what Texas is,' said Patrick Sparks, board president of Texas Dance Hall Preservation. Sparks' group and others are working to preserve the state's remaining dance halls, in part by creating an inventory so that the most distinctive ones become candidates for the National Register of Historic Places. Such designation would enable the halls to apply for grant assistance and protections against encroaching development. More practically, it would raise their profile among tourists and other travelers. 'You can still go out on a Saturday night and experience an authentic dance hall like you could 100 years ago and that's something that really defines our culture here in Texas,' Sparks said. Some dance halls also are architecturally unique, according to Sparks. The Cat Spring Agricultural Society Pavilion west of Houston is a 12-sided hall built in 1902 by German immigrants that features an elaborate wooden truss rising up to a cupola. At one time there were about 40 such 'round halls' in the state, Sparks said, but now just half that number exist. Cool refreshments: The Twin Sisters Dance Hall offers a number of beers, including Bud Light, Coors Light, and Texas-based Lone Star . Swing your partner round and round: A pair of dancers are seen at Twin Sisters Dance Hall in Blanco, Texas . Corner entertainment: Musicians Tibby Armke, center, and Cory Blair, second from right, play outside of the dance hall in December . Carolyn Vogel is president of a nonprofit association that operates the Twin Sisters Dance Hall. It's believed Twin Sisters, not far from Kendalia Halle, has hosted at least a monthly dance since the 1880s. It costs about $16,000 a year for volunteers to maintain the building. 'On a good year we break even,' Vogel said. The association is seeking an IRS designation as a charitable organization that would allow it to apply for state grants and other money, which would prove valuable in addressing expensive repairs like the nearly $20,000 needed to replace the roof, she said. Twin Sisters, founded by German immigrants, for years served as a vital community center, Vogel said, and it's important 'to reacquaint and refamiliarize people with this heritage.' 'We're really working to bring people back,' she said. 'I think it's a unique type of entertainment, also.' From about 1870 into the 1920s, European immigrants in Texas built hundreds of these halls. They largely served as meeting places for agricultural groups, rifle clubs and mutual benefit societies. Over time, Sparks said, they also became important social centers that on many evenings hosted popular dances. The popularity of the halls waned as Texas' population shifted to the cities. In 1900, 83 percent of the Texas population lived in rural areas; 50 years later that percentage had fallen to 37 percent, and continues to decline. Nowadays, a couple hundred remaining halls may host an event or two each year, but only a few dozen are used at least on a monthly basis, Sparks said. When Lee Temple bought Kendalia Halle with his wife Judi in 1995, business didn't look so promising. One weekend he laid out $700 for a band only to have one couple show. While still not a money-maker, Kendalia's monthly dances, along with wedding receptions and birthday parties, help the Temples break even. 'Texas dance halls are becoming a very good investment because there are fewer and fewer of them,' Lee Temple said.

"David Miscavige, the controversial leader of the Church of Scientology, allegedly had his apostate father followed for 18 months for fear he might reveal damaging information about the inner workings of the secretive organization. According to police records obtained by the Los Angeles Times, the church paid a father-son team of detectives $10,000 a week to track Ron Miscavige's every move, review his electronic correspondence and eavesdrop on his conversations. The claims, which the Church of Scientology has categorically denied through its attorneys, come just weeks after the premiere of the explosive HBO documentary Going Clear, where former members of the church accused David Miscavige and his associates of systemic harassment, abuse and blackmail. Scroll down for video . Explosive claims: Private investigator Dwayne Powell reportedly told Wisconsin police in 2013 that he was hired by David Miscavige (left), the head of the Church of Scientology, to spy on his elderly father, Ronald (right) after he'd left the church . Secretive: The elder Miscavige was allegedly followed by a father-son pair of detectives for 18 months for fear he might reveal damaging information about the inner workings of the church . Ronald Miscavige, 79, had recently left the Church of Scientology, which has been under the leadership of his 54-year-old son since 1986. The allegations of surveillance targeting the renegade scientologist originally came to light two years ago following the arrest of Florida-based private investigator Dwayne Powell. Powell was stopped in a Milwaukee suburb in July 2013 carrying two rifles, four handguns, a makeshift silencer, a knife and a cache of ammunition. Adding fuel to the fire: The claims come just weeks after the premiere of the explosive HBO documentary Going Clear . According to arrest documents, the private eye’s rented Ford Edge also contained binoculars, a GPS device and a stun gun. During questioning, the sleuth reportedly told police that he was hired by the Church of Scientology through a Florida firm to follow Ronald Miscavige on a full-time basis. Powell reportedly recounted to police how one time he was tailing Mr Miscavige when he witnessed the elderly man clasp his chest and slump over while placing groceries in his car. Thinking that Miscavige was having a heart attack, the private investigator called his supervisor and asked for further instructions. Minutes later, he got a call from David Miscavige himself, according to the records, who told Powell that 'if it was Ron's time to die, to let him die and not intervene in any way.' The elder Miscavige eventually came to and drove off. Last year, Dwayne Powell was charged with a single count of possession of an illegal silencer, but the indictment against him was later dismissed . In a statement to the Times, David Miscavige's personal attorney, Michael Lee Hertzberg, vehemently denied any connection between Powell and his client. ‘Please be advised that Mr. Miscavige does not know Mr. Powell, has never heard of Mr. Powell, has never met Mr. Powell, has never spoken to Mr. Powell, never hired Mr. Powell and never directed any investigations by Mr. Powell,’ the lawyer told the paper. An attorney for the church also commented on the allegations, calling them 'blatantly false.' During an interview with police in West Allis, Wisconsin, Dwayne Powell reportedly said that his job was to keep tabs on Ronald Miscavige and his wife, Becky, to make sure they do not divulge any details about Church of Scientology activities. Powell reported directly to a Florida firm specializing in private investigations and worked the case with his 21-year-old son. Miscavige, chairman of the board of Religious Technology Center (pictured left and right with Tom Cruise), allegedly prohibited the private investigator from helping his  father during a medical emergency . The duo's surveillance activities allegedly included sifting though Ronald Miscavige's garbage, photographing him, tailing him using a tracking device they had planted on his car and listening to his conversations in public places. Police records indicate that when Miscavige would go to a local library to check his email, Powell or his son would stand behind his back and photograph the computer screen. According to a police report, as recently as last September Ron Miscavige and his wife said they believed they were being watched by his son’s henchmen. Daniel Powell reportedly has corroborated many of his father's statements in interviews with police.","Wisconsin police arrested private investigator Dwayne Powell in 2013 who claimed he was hired by Church of Scientology to spy on Ron Miscavige .

"A woman has spoken of her regrets about going under the knife after a Turkish surgeon botched her facelift and left her with her ears sewn awkwardly to the side of her face. Belinda, 56, from Essex, had hoped the operation would deal with her jowls and says she was looking 'worn out' ahead of the procedure. But the 'horrendous' scars produced by the bungling surgeon have left her bereft of confidence and feeling worse than ever before. Scroll down for video . Belinda, 56, from Essex, admits she wishes she'd never had a facelift because of the 'horrendous' scars it left her around her ears - the result of a botched procedure she underwent in Turkey (pictured) Budget job: Belinda, who appears on tonight's episode of TLC's Extreme Beauty Disasters (pictured), travelled to Turkey to have the facelift because it was cheaper . Now Belinda is to appear on TLC's Extreme Beauty Disasters to warn of the dangers of travelling abroad for cut-price surgery - and to see if anything can be done about her botched facelift. Plastic surgeon consultant Vik Vijh commented: 'Her scars are really very poor. They're stretched and they are dragging down her earlobes.' Belinda's problems began when she noticed she was looking more tired than usual and set about finding a cosmetic solution. In the UK, the average facelift costs £7,900, so Belinda was thrilled when she found a Turkish surgeon offering cut-price operations that cost a fraction of the UK equivalent. Having already had successful cosmetic procedures in the past, among them breast implants and a tummy tuck, she says she felt positive about the prospect of facelift. Her husband agreed at the time, hoping it might 'freshen her up', but says, with hindsight, that 'it was one of the worst ideas I've ever had in my life.' Expert opinion: 'Her scars are really very poor,' admits plastic surgeon consultant Vik Vijh, who set out to correct the damage by re-doing her facelift. 'They're stretched and they are dragging down her earlobes' Mr Vijh (left) recommends another full face and neck lift to correct the damage, but warns Belinda (right) she could be risking nerve damage and further scarring . An excited Belinda then travelled to Turkey for the procedure, where such 'bargains' are common, checked into an Istanbul clinic and went under the knife. Initially thrilled with her 'fresh, plumped-out skin', doubts began to set in during the healing process. Expecting a dramatic change, the healed facelift, says Belinda, 'hadn't done anything' - except, much to her horror, leave her with earlobes that had been 'sewn' to the sides of her face. According to Mr Vijh, this was due to the surgeon stitching up Belinda's face in the wrong position, resulting in bad scarring that should have been concealed behind her ears, not around them . Still, Belinda is determined to go ahead, and after a gruelling session on the operating table at the hands of Mr Vijh (pictured), she comes out smiling . 'We've lifted her neck, we've pulled up her face, and got rid of all those scars,' Mr Vijh states. Pictured, Belinda's ear before (left) and after (right) the corrective surgery . As a result, another full face and neck lift was required, as well as extra surgery to hide the scarring. Belinda, who had been left miserable by her experience, says the new face lift has restored her confidence and left her happier. 'Finally I am happy,' she says. 'My scars have drastically reduced and now I can stop worrying about going out, or  about people looking at me from the side.' Extreme Beauty Disasters starts next Tuesday at 8pm on TLC . No more hiding: Belinda, pictured before (left) and after (right), makes a reappearance on the show once she has healed and looks refreshed and happy with her new and improved appearance .

"Finding a place where you can experience some all-important family time, outdoor fun and a helping of luxury at the same time might sound like a tall order... But if you're partial to a weekend under canvas, family-oriented festival Elderflower Fields might be one of the best tickets you can buy this year. As its founders explain, Elderflower Fields, held in the idyllic setting of Pippingford Park in the Ashdown Forest, is about giving children and families the chance to take part in a huge range of activities. Elderflower Fields Festival will be held in the idyllic setting of Pippingford Park for the second year running . The independent festival was created in 2012 by a small team of friends to provide the perfect environment for kids and grown-ups to fully escape for a weekend. Now entering its fourth year, Elderflower Fields builds upon the winning formula of a festival designed especially for families with children. It’s an exciting experience that opens children and their parents’ minds to new opportunities in sport, music, the arts, the environment and food, all set in the great outdoors. So says Nigel Greenwood, cofounder of So Sussex, the organisation responsible for creating the festival. ""We’ve been overwhelmed by the positive comments and feedback received from festival goers over the last three years. Their words sum up the ethos of the festival far better than we ever could and inspire us to improve and make Elderflower Fields 2015 the best yet,"" he says. The Kalakuta Millionaires were a popular draw on the main stage last year . The view from the back: The Tones played in 2012 to an appreciative crowd . ""What's really exciting for us is that the festival is becoming a moment of inspiration for children, their families and festival goers to try out new things."" So what can festival goers expect in 2015? ""Elderflower Fields prides itself on booking the best up and coming new bands and performers and providing opportunities for young people to engage in and be inspired by music,"" says Greenwood. The diverse range of artists already confirmed for Elderflower Fields 2015 includes Danny and the Champions Of The World, Patch and The Giant, The Kings Parade, and Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer. Spa in the woods anyone? The chance to sip champagne in a hot tub proved rather popular in 2014... thanks to Bathing Under the Sky . Children go free! The idyllic surrounds of the Ashdown Forest made for one giant playground . Other performance experiences include a storytelling area in the woods, theatre and dance classes, magic and movement workshops, plus a good old fashioned family rave from the brilliant Big Fish Little Fish party people. This year will see the festival partner with East Sussex Music Services for the first time to provide a range of introductory music opportunities for children. This includes instrument try outs, composing workshops, songwriting workshops and a BBC Ten Pieces performance developed with schools before the festival which will then see kids learning the piece during the festival itself. Richard Navarro and other musicians will be taking time from performing to run masterclasses in the Youth Music area. Sea of green: Campers walk down through the fields to the nearby festival areas, with more activities for children going on in the woods than you can shake a stick at . Everybody say hey! The Sports camps run by Premier Sports were a huge hit with children (and parents...) Premier Sport will be running this years sports camp giving children the chance to try diverse sports such as dodgeball, lacrosse and tri-golf. Organisers say they will also be running an orienteering course and a Disc Golf course with Sussex Disc Golf. ""We also have SKiL coming to provide drop in activity sessions including stickball and adventure runs, and in this the year of the Rugby World Cup we have the coaches of Lewes Rugby Club running two beach rugby sessions,"" says Greenwood. Meanwhile the Urban Woods welcomes back climbing, parkour, slacklining and our skateboard half pipe, plus Adventure Unlimited have been called in to provide kayaking, raft building and high ropes. Anything else? Well yes. The So Sussex Sunday picnic has become something of a trademark and is one of the highlights of the weekend. The perfect way to spend an afternoon with friends and family (or even strangers) - it's all included in the ticket. Could Elderflower Fields be the only festival in the world to supply every guest with a free shared picnic filled with delicious tasters of local produce? Yes. And don't mention the legendary chocolate cake... Elderflower Fields has more free activities on offer per child that any other festival, the organisers claim. All sessions are run by a dedicated team of professional organisations providing kids with the opportunity to discover new skills and have fun. Rafting, mud hut building, music masterclasses, parkour, science, disc golf, night walks, slack-lining, bush craft skills, art workshops, sports camp, kayaking, orienteering, pond dipping, drama workshops, climbing wall and more are all included in the price of the ticket. The Green People Woodland Spa is already taking bookings for luxurious festival pampering. It's possible to prebook supervised sports or arts camp sessions via the website so that the kids are taken care of while parents relax. The Double Decker Hot Tub Bus is back as well. As for the music lineup, think Gypsy, folk, blues, rock, cajun, swing, dance and classical. ""We're super excited about the line up this year and think we have something for everyone. We also welcome a unique performance being curated on site by East Sussex Music Service as part of the BBC Ten Pieces, as well as the winners of our Youth Music Competition,"" says Greenwood. 5: Food and Drink: We have some of the finest local food providers at Elderflower Fields this year. Some regular favourites and a few new surprises to enjoy. All supplying affordable high quality meals. We've worked hard with suppliers to ensure all diets are catered for - especially the kids. The cocktail bar will be back with a new stage and late music for the night owls and two further bars will be serving up craft beers, local ales, ciders and more... As the organisers are parents themselves they must know the value of having time to relax and unwind... Happy families from the last three years can vouch for that. Some of the reviews of Elderflower Fields include these rather positive vibes: . ""The festival was populated by happy families replete with festival cheer and zillions of small children enjoying their free-range festie-freedom. Pippingford Park is an amazing venue surrounded by some of the most beautiful nature in the south of England, well away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.""

"Fit or quit? Smartphone health apps have been accused of  ‘fuelling anxiety’ They’re designed to make it easier for you to get healthy. But in fact mobile health apps are ‘fuelling anxiety’ and ‘eroding people’s sense of wellbeing’, warns a senior GP. The ‘untested and unscientific’ apps cause stress by making us worry that we are abnormal or unhealthy, says Dr Des Spence. Popular apps include MyFitnessPal and Apple’s health app, which is automatically installed on the latest Apple smartphones. But Dr Spence warned that newer apps that monitor your heart rate, blood pressure and blood oxygen levels could be causing unnecessary worry without providing any benefit. ‘The truth is that these apps and devices are untested and unscientific, and they will open the door of uncertainty’, the Glasgow GP wrote in the British Medical Journal. He added: ‘We should be sceptical of embracing more medical technology. One of the problems we face as doctors is that although people are much healthier, there is a lot more anxiety. ‘People’s sense of wellbeing has been eroded and a lot of that is by technology, use of the internet, that type of stuff. ‘My concern with the health apps is they have the potential to fuel anxiety without any benefit.’ Dr Spence said that manufacturers were more concerned about making a profit than their customers’ wellbeing, with apps purposely designed to make people worry about their health so they would spend more money on health technology, diet pills and slimming firms. ‘The people who write these apps will clearly have a commercial agenda. The underlying ethos of the app will be about profit and not about health’, he said. Apple’s health app comes pre-downloaded on its new phones and automatically tells you how many steps you have walked each day. It can also work out the number of calories you have eaten and burned off, as well as your blood pressure, blood sugar levels and heart rate. Warning: Apps that monitor your heart rate, blood pressure and blood oxygen levels could be causing unnecessary worry, says senior GP . And last month the computer giant launched the Apple Watch, with prices starting from £300, which can also monitor users’ health and fitness. Dr Spence said the majority of apps which just monitor your calorie intake or step count were ‘harmless’, but are unlikely to offer many health benefits. And he warned there was a risk that patients relying on them would feel ‘cheated’ if they developed cancer or heart disease despite trying to follow a healthy lifestyle. However, Dr Iltifat Husain, editor of the iMedicalApps.com website, said there was no evidence health apps caused harm. Also writing in the BMJ, he said they had ‘great potential’ to reduce death risk by ‘encouraging healthy behaviour’.","Health apps such as MyFitnessPal ‘fuel anxiety’ says senior GP .

"A former jewelry store worker has been arrested for his alleged role in the abduction and torture of a female employee at the business. Khayree Gay, 31, was captured on Friday at the Security Inn and Suites hotel in Lake City, South Carolina, according to a report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Gay, who is originally from Feltonville, Pennsylvania, is facing federal charges for allegedly kidnapping a Jewelers Row employee on April 4 in Philadelphia. Scroll down for video . Khayree Gay, 31, was captured last Friday at the Security Inn and Suites hotel in Lake City, South Carolina for his alleged role in the botched jewelry store heist . The 53-year-old female victim was seen walking through the parking garage on April 4 shortly before she was grabbed and thrown into a van . The Ford van was seen on surveillance tape making its way to the roof of the garage where the woman was told she was going to die by men in ski masks unless she handed over the code for the jewelry store safe . The 53-year-old female employee of the National Watch and Diamond Exchange in downtown Philadelphia was leaving work earlier this month shortly before 4pm when she was pulled into a Ford van in a parking garage. She was driven to the building's roof, beaten and shot with a Taser seven times. She was told she was going to die by the three men in ski masks,Philly.com reported. According to authorities, the woman was told to hand over codes to the safe which she did not know. She handed over her ATM card, which the suspects used to fill the van with gas, and was taken to a cemetery where she was zip-tied and dumped from the van. She freed her hands and tied to flee but the suspects returned and put her in shackles and handcuffs. The suspects again demanded information from the woman who was unable to tell them anything and they abandoned her in the cemetery. The woman was treated at a local hospital for broken ribs and a concussion. The victim, whose identity has not been released, was traumatized by what had happened, police reported. Gay's two suspected accomplices were not with him when he was arrested. The 31-year-old has been arrested six times on aggravated-assault, drug and firearm charges, according to reports.

"A woman who weighs 400lbs has told how men are paying her around $1,500 (£1,000) a month to let them watch her devour fast food and sugary treats on camera. New Yorker Sarah Reign, 26, describes herself as a 'feedee', who gorges on junk food in various states of undress to titillate paying male viewers. After working shifts as a security guard at a factory, Miss Reign disrobes down to her underwear and switches on her webcam. Happy to be a 'feedee': Sarah Reign, from New York, supplements her day job as a security guard by gorging on camera for men who like to watch her eat . Miss Reign, who weighs 26 stone, says she enjoyed eating so much, she decided to turn it into a job . She says fans love to watch her enjoying food; she might gorge on a whole chocolate cake or cover her stomach with butter, acts that can earn her around $1,500 (£1,000) a month in addition to her regular pay. After realising that her weight could become a lucrative sideline for her, she set about gaining more and is now six stone heavier than before she started. She says: 'I really enjoy eating. No one at work knows my secret. It felt awkward eating on camera at first as fans love to watch you chewing every mouthful. 'But I eat so much anyway I thought it'd be fun to do it on cam. I just keep eating until I'm full.' Her new career has also led her to the world of 'squashing', where men pay her to sit on them when she meets them in person. She says of her first squashing experience: 'It was awkward but I got really into it.' Miss Reign says that she won't sit on anyone naked though, always keeping her underwear on. Sarah Reign says her fans love to watch her enjoying food . The men who watch Miss Reign's videos love to see the plus-size entertainer chowing down on junk food . 'I won't do nude squashing,' she vowed. 'I just wear a vest top and tiny shorts.' The security guard adds that she has always been large and that her weight has never been an issue for her. In fact, in 2008, aged 20 and weighing 20 stone, she celebrated her figure by posting glamour shots of herself online in skimpy clothing. How did this sideline come to pass? Miss Reign joined a site for bigger women who like to flaunt their shape, she soon had plenty of male attention. 'It's such an ego boost,' she admitted. 'So many of them wanted to see me eat on camera, I thought, 'Why not?' After a period of using web cams for feeders, she then set up her own video channel. 'It's sexy to be big,' she said. 'I really enjoy eating on camera so I started gaining weight on purpose. 'I've put on six stone since I started. 'Lots of men want to feed me so much I can't move anymore, but that's not my thing. I still want to be active and do my day job.' The security guard admits she's a 'clean freak' and puts underwear covered in food straight into the washing machine when the camera is turned off . Squashing: Miss Reign now offers a service for men who enjoy being smothered by a larger lady . Her lingerie drawer is overflowing with different outfits  but the most common request is for Miss Reign to dress up as a pig. 'I have a piggy nose and ears that I wear and eat really messily in, covering my face with chocolate. 'But when the camera's off, I'm a clean freak and put my bra and the towels I use to cover the floor straight in the washing machine. 'Sometimes I take the camera into the shower and film myself getting clean, that's really sexy.' Although she had plenty of requests for squashing sessions, she did not take the plunge until three years ago. 'I had so many men ask, but there was a guy who lived nearby who wanted to try it,' Miss Reign said. 'The first time, I watched some videos the night before to prepare but nothing phases me. 'When I got to the hotel it was weird at first and it's hard not to laugh. 'He lay down on the bed and I climbed on top of him. But I got into it really quickly. 'For the hour session, I was crushing him the whole time.' Cashing in: With a lowly paid job in New York as a security guard, Miss Reign can boost her income by $1,500 (£1,000) a month . Miss Reign has had eight squashing clients and some of them will not admit they love big women. 'A lot of them are in the fat closet,' she joked. 'They say how thin their girlfriends are and they're obviously worried they'll be the butt of their friends' jokes if they admit they love fat girls. 'But there's also men who want women to do stuff like this but most girls won't believe them that they think fat is sexy. 'They're self-conscious and want to look slimmer, not embrace their shape.' One of her other sidelines is posting out her lacy pants after they've been worn. She has had long-term boyfriends since she started being a part-time squasher. 'It's not been an issue for them. Some of them have watched the videos, some of them haven't,' she said. 'Most of them have really supported me and didn't care. 'I'm single right now, but I wouldn't rule out going on a date with an online fan. 'I have men ask all the time, it's more that it's not practical and they're in other countries. I have lots of fans in the UK and Germany.' 'But if they were from the US, I would never say never.'","New Yorker Sarah Reign, 26, is a security guard by day but earns extra money by eating fast food and sugary treats while men watch .

"The 43-year-old is the first presenter of the BBC dance contest to be nominated for the awards . When Claudia Winkleman replaced Sir Bruce Forsyth as co-host of Strictly Come Dancing, sceptics thought she would struggle to fill his shoes. Now, she has proved them wrong with a Bafta nomination for her first season on the show. The 43-year-old is the first presenter of the BBC dance contest to be nominated for the awards, something both Sir Bruce and co-host Tess Daly failed to achieve. It comes even though she was absent for almost a month while daughter Matilda, eight, recovered after her Halloween costume accidentally caught fire. The mother-of-three will compete in the entertainment performance category at next month’s awards with Ant and Dec, Graham Norton and Celebrity Juice host Leigh Francis. Meanwhile, Sir Bruce, 87, has said he does not miss his time hosting Strictly, admitting: ‘It was never the show I thought it would be.’ The veteran entertainer said he wished he had been allowed to interact more with the celebrities. Other Bafta hopefuls include Broadchurch star Olivia Colman, 41, who is nominated in the female performance in a comedy category for her role in BBC2 comedy Rev. Miss Winkleman’s nomination has led the programme into its most successful ever year at the Baftas, after it won a total of three nominations, including for Entertainment Show and Audience Choice. The nominations have been voted for by 4,000 Bafta members. It has again come out on top against ITV rivals X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent, both of which have again been snubbed. The shortlists mark the continuation of a disappointing run for Simon Cowell’s duo of talent shows. Both Sir Bruce (centre) and co-host Tess Daly (right) have failed to receive a nomination from the show . X Factor’s six-year run of nominations ended in 2011 and Britain’s Got Talent has failed to make the cut since 2010. BBC bosses were recently reported to be considering dropping Miss Winkleman before Strictly’s return later this year, describing her first run as a ‘trial shift’. However, with the nomination now in her corner, her case for staying is compelling. She has won the recognition despite being absent from the show for almost a month while her daughter, Mathilda, eight, recovered from a horrific Halloween accident in which her costume caught fire. In the interim, her post was covered by Zoe Ball, 44, who fronts Strictly spin-off show It Takes Two. The nominees for this year's Baftas: Hopefuls include Broadchurch star Olivia Colman, 41, who is nominated in the female performance in a comedy category for her role in BBC2 comedy Rev . Before taking on the role she spoke of her nerves at filling such a primetime slot. She said: ‘I am going to be Tess and she is going to be Bruce. I just want to be useful. If I am useful... it will be fine.’ This is the fifth time Strictly has been nominated in the Entertainment Programme category but it has so far never won the award. This year it is competing with The Voice, Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway and Dynamo: Magician Impossible. Its third nomination is for the Audience Choice Award, which is decided by a public vote. The other contenders are The Great British Bake Off, The Missing, Game of Thrones, Eastenders, Sherlock and Cilla.

"Arrest: Rachel Lehnardt, 35, allegedly threw a drunken party for her 16-year-old daughter . A mother-of-five threw her teenage daughter a party, played naked Twister with her friends and then had sex with an 18-year-old in the bathroom, authorities have said. Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, from Evans, Georgia, was arrested on Saturday night and has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The details of the drunken party emerged when Lehnardt met with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor last Friday and told her about the wild party. The sponsor then contacted authorities. She told the woman that her children, who are aged between four and 16, were with their father when her oldest daughter texted her to ask if she could bring over some friends. Lehnardt allegedly responded: 'Come on, let's party', WJBF reported. When the teenagers arrived, she allegedly allowed them to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her home, before she played naked Twister with them in the living room. While the youngsters continued playing, she allegedly went into a bathroom and had sex with an 18-year-old man, the sponsor told authorities. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, she told her sponsor, Augusta Crime reported. Party: The mother-of-five allegedly played naked Twister with her daughter and her friends before having sex with an 18-year-old male in the bathroom. She later had sex with her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend . She later went to bed alone and around 3.30am, she awoke to find someone having sex with her, she told her sponsor. 'She stated at first she thought it was the 18-year-old from earlier, but then realized it was the 16-year-old who was in fact her daughter's boyfriend,' Lehnardt's sponsor told deputies. The daughter told her mother she felt guilty because the boyfriend's 10-inch penis was so large she could not have sex with him, and he needed to have sex with her mother instead. While the incident sounds as if the 16-year-old raped the mother, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her boyfriend. The sponsor said that the mother has also previously spoken about being a porn addict. Scene: She allegedly threw the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, and lost custody of her children after the incident. She has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor . Following the incident, an emergency custody hearing was held and she lost custody of her five children, who are aged four, six, eight, 10 and 16, WJBF reported. At their meeting last week, the sponsor asked Lehnardt how long she had been sober and her future plans for sobriety, and the mother told her about losing custody of the children days before. After their meeting, the woman, who was only recently assigned to sponsor Lehnardt, contacted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office and the mother was arrested on Saturday. She has been released from the Columbia County Detention Center after posting a $3,200 bond, according to the Columbia County News-Times. According to online profiles, Lehnardt crafts and paints dolls. The children's father is in the military. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors. But there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court. In 2001, a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer's confession to fellow AA members was constitutionally protected and shouldn't have been used against him. The decision was reached after the judge deemed the 12 Step program had religious undertones, meaning that the members engaged in  religious activity, which is constitutionally protected.","Rachel Lehnardt, 35, 'allowed her 16-year-old daughter and her friends drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her Georgia home'

"The story was written by Queen Victoria when she was just 10. Pictured: The monarch's illustrations to go with the book which is to be published in June . A children's story written by Queen Victoria when she was just 10 years old is to be published for the first time. The short story was penned by the future monarch and tells the story of a 12-year-old girl, Alice Laselles, who was sent away to boarding school after her mother died and her father remarried. Alice befriends a host of characters, including a 'poor little French orphan' who has been half-blinded by small pox, and is falsely accused of smuggling a cat into the school but clears her name and eventually triumphs as 'one of the best learners in the school'. Princess Victoria's story was written in her 'Composition' notebook as part of her studies with her governess, Baroness Louise Lehzen, and kept in the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle. It bore the inscription: 'To my dear Mamma, this my first attempt at composition is affectionately and dutifully inscribed by her affectionate daughter, Victoria.' In one passage, where Alice is told she is to be sent to boarding school, Victoria wrote: '""Oh do not send me away dear Pappa"", exclaimed Alice Laselles, as she threw her arms around her Pappa's neck; ""don't send me away, O let me stay with you."" And she sobbed bitterly.' The tale will be published in June as 'The Adventures of Alice Laselles by Alexandrina Victoria, Aged 10 and ¾'. Alexandrina was the young princess' first name but she became known as Victoria, her second name, when she was still a child.

"A bitter war of words has erupted between a young woman and a butcher in Sydney's eastern suburbs over exactly what happened when Belinda Bartholomew, the girlfriend of Roosters star Aidan Guerra, tried to buy a chicken to cook up for a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast. According to Ms Bartholomew, she was called names and told to go to 'an Aussie butcher' when she tried to change her chicken selection. However the butcher who was working at the shop on Monday has hit back saying Ms Bartholomew is 'lying' and trying to ruin the business. Scroll down for video . Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher on Monday night when she was buying a chicken for her and her Roosters star boyfriend Aidan Guerra to have for dinner . The war of words started, Ms Bartholomew claims, when the man working at Sam the Butcher in Bondi called her a 'f***ing c***' when she asked for a different chicken to the one he had picked up. There were apparently more problems when she went to use her card to pay for the choice bird. 'His eftpos machine wasn't connecting so it was taking a while to process, and I felt really uncomfortable as he was clearly agitated, huffing and throwing things around,' she said. Ms Bartholomew claims the man working at Sam The Butcher in Bondi swore at her and told her to leave, but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude . The chicken (pictured in front of Aidan Guerra) was cooked by Ms Bartholomew as part of a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast . 'Another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash, and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own.' However, the butcher vehemently denies he called Ms Bartholomew names and said she was the one being rude on a day when he had been having issues with his eftpos machine. 'She's just a troublemaker,' the butcher told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was very slow and she started having a go at me.' Ms Bartholomew (pictured with Mr Guerra) said the butcher told her to 'go to a f***ing Aussie butcher' But the man working vehemently denied any claims he swore at or abused the young woman (pictured) He told Daily Mail Australia that he's trying to fit into Australian life but sometimes finds it hard to cope with attitudes in Bondi. Ms Bartholomew claims the butcher then asked her 'Why don't you just go to a f***ing Aussie butcher'. 'She said I'm half Italian don't speak to me like that,' the butcher said. 'I said if you're going to be rude to me just take the chicken and go.' 'It's a free country there's about eight butcher shops in Bondi,' he added. Ms Bartholomew (left) and the butcher both said she didn't end up paying for the chicken she and Mr Guerra (right) later ate . Ms Bartholomew said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her. 'I said not to worry about it and proceeded to leave while my purchase was still pending so he swiped the 1.5kg chicken at me and told me to ""take it and f*** off"",' she claims. 'I think I was just the victim of racial abuse,' the young Bondi woman wrote in a heated Facebook post shortly afterwards. However the butcher said he simply wanted her out of the shop and did not swear at or abuse her at any stage. 'She didn't even end up paying for the chicken, she got a free chicken,' he said. Ms Bartholomew told Daily Mail Australia 'I have never been to this particular butcher before.' 'I'm going to assume it wasn't me who he was really angry at, however I just happened to be in there at the time.'","Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher .

"An amateur cyclist is planning to ride the entire Tour de France - considered the most gruelling race in professional cycling - on a Raleigh Chopper. Dave Sim has put in months of training aboard his bright yellow Mark Three Chopper in preparation to ride all 2077 miles of the 2015 Tour de France route this summer. The 36-year-old personal trainer from Southport, Merseyside, is hoping his stunt will inspire people to get out and ride themselves. Scroll down for video . Dave Sim, 36, rides his Raleigh Chopper on the L'Etape du Tour last year. He now hopes to cycle the entire Tour de France . The tour involves many hill climbs which are grueling even for professionals using high-performance road bikes . Mr Sim and two others, who are using proper road bikes, attempt a hill climb in France last year . Mr Sim said his Chopper is as close to standard as possible, but required a better seat and tweaked brakes . Mr Sim said his Chopper - the 2004 revival of the iconic 1970's children's bike - is as close to standard as possible. He said: 'I've tried to make as few changes as possible so it's got the original tyres. 'The main thing I've changed is the seat post and the pedal arms as it was originally designed for kids. 'And the wheels - on the first part of the race through Northern France, there are a lot of sections of really terrible cobbles, so a guy made me some really strong wheels as I kept breaking spokes. 'I've also had to put slightly better brakes on as well. 'Up the biggest climbs it gets a bit grim, it was just two degrees at the top of one, the Col de Tourmalet - it took me forever to get down, I was almost hypothermic at the bottom.' While it's by far the longest ride he's attempted, Mr Sim has completed long rides on the Chopper before. Mr Sim attempted the L'Etape du Tour on the Raleigh Chopper last year and finished in the top 20 per cent . Mr Sim hopes his audacious attempt to ride the Tour de France will inspire others to take up cycling . Pictured left, Mr Sim stands with others riding the L'Etape du Tour. Right, he is pictured with his Chopper in the Lake District . He said: 'I did the L'Etape du Tour last year it's a mass start event where thousands do a stage of the Tour de France on closed roads. 'Lots of people didn't think I could do it, but I thought, why not have a go? 'I did really well, got a really good time, I was in the top 20 per cent, so the next morning, I thought about doing the full tour. 'I thought, if I could do one day, is it possible to do the whole tour? 'After the Etape I shouldn't have wanted to even see a Chopper again, but it was a bit of a Eureka moment, that's where it came from. 'I come from a cycling family, my mum and dad would take me to see the Tour, riding up mountains is in my blood. 'It's always been a bit of a dream to ride the Tour de France, I won't do it again, my dad said he never would have thought I'd do it on a chopper!' He said: 'Part of the motivation was to show people you don't need a £10,000 bike to do amazing things on - my bike cost me £100, and I'm doing the Tour on it. With a bike, it's mostly to do with the engine. 'In the last five years the cost of road cycling has sky rocketed but you don't need all that, you just need to get out and ride. 'The other side of the challenge is to raise as much money for Help for Heroes as possible.'

"The Australian family of a 21-year-old backpacker who disappeared from a Croatian night club in 2008 are hoping to finally find out the truth about how she died. Britt Lapthorne, from Melbourne, was last seen at the Latin Club Fuego in the coastal, tourist town of Dubrovnik where she was partying with about 10 other backpackers. Croatian police never solved the mystery of how the student's body came to be in nearby Boninovo Bay, where it was found almost three weeks after she disappeared on September 18. Her family believes Ms Lapthorne was murdered, her body weighted down and dumped at sea. It has now emerged a Victorian inquest into her death will be closed. Britt Lapthorne, from Melbourne, disappeared in the Croatian coastal, tourist town of Dubrovnik . State Coroner Ian Gray will officially close it at a hearing in Melbourne on Thursday. He will hear a summary of previously unreleased reports prepared by both the Australian Federal Police and Croatian authorities. Then the coroner will prepare his findings, to be released at a later date. In 2009, Ms Lapthorne’s father, Dale Lapthorne, said the only information he would release from one of the reports was that Britt's body was in the water the whole time she was missing. He was confident she had been weighted down before being dumped into the Adriatic Sea because there was no other explanation for her body not coming to the surface. Her parents (pictured) believe Ms Lapthorne was murdered, her body weighted down and dumped at sea . Ms Lapthorne's body was found in nearby Boninovo Bay, where it was found almost three weeks after she disappeared on September 18 . In 2009, Ms Lapthorne’s father, Dale Lapthorne, said Britt's body was in the water the whole time she was missing . 'It's the reason for the rapid decomposition of her body, and the fact it was only found 18 days later in a high visibility area, virtually out the front of a hotel and only a kilometre from the club,' Mr Lapthorne told AAP in 2009. At the time, the coroner confirmed Ms Lapthorne's body should have surfaced within two or three days. The criminal investigation remains open in Croatia, but the Lapthorne family does not have confidence in police there. Croatian authorities suspect Ms Lapthorne died due to 'misadventure', though in 2013 they conceded it was unlikely her death was a suicide. The Lapthorne family, including her mother Elke, father Dale and brother Darren, were not told their daughter was missing for six days after she disappeared, despite Australian officials being aware she had vanished. Britt Lapthorne was last seen at the Latin Club Fuego, in  Dubrovnik, where she was partying with about 10 other backpackers . A media boat pictured where Ms Lapthorne's body was found in a small inlet near Dubrovnik, Croatia . They also suffered the terrible news of being told  a body had been found, only for police to say just hours later that it couldn’t be Ms Lapthorne’s because it was so badly decomposed. Police then confirmed after DNA analysis that it was indeed Ms Lapthorne’s body. Dubrovnik Deputy Chief of Police, Ivan Kukrika, said at the time: 'DNA analysis has been completed in capital Zagreb. According to the analysis, the body found in the sea on October 6th belongs to the missing Australian, Britt Lapthorne. ‘I have to admit that I had, based on the state the body was in, really thought that it was not Britt and that this case would result in a happy ending.’ Dubrovnik Deputy Chief of Police, Ivan Kukrika, said he didn't believe it was Britt's body at first 'based on the state the body was in' Mr Lapthorne said his daughter was 'always smiling, always happy, just having fun, an intelligent, smart girl' The Victorian coroner will prepare his finding over Ms Lapthorne's death to be released at a later date . Speaking hours after the family was told Ms Lapthorne’s body had been found, her father Mr Lapthorne told the Sydney Morning Herald: ‘Assuming it is a crime, and everything is pointing to a crime, it is an absolutely heinous crime of the worst order. 'It is just beyond conception for such a beautiful girl, I don't mean beautiful in appearance, she was beautiful in her ways, always smiling, always happy, just having fun, an intelligent, smart girl … why would somebody do this to such a beautiful girl? ‘For me, Elke and Darren, it's just devastating. We think all the things we planned to do together … all the things we planned have no meaning any more, absolutely no meaning.’","Student Britt Lapthorne, from Melbourne, disappeared in 2008 .

"Our almost constant use of mobile phones and the decline of working class jobs are contributing to the erosion of the age-old whistle according to new research. Once heard constantly on the streets, in songs, on the stage and in the workplace it has nearly disappeared. Whistling aficionados are in agreement, no one is whistling while they work – or anywhere else for that matter. All children used to be told to whistle while they work by the classic Disney animation Snow White. However the rise of the mobile phone and music on the ipod means young people are less likely to whistle now. Cultural historian at Syracuse University, London, Chris Cook, told the Sunday Times that whistling has all but disappeared over the last few decades. A YouGov poll commissioned by the newspaper confirmed the trend illustrating that 70 percent of people were in agreement that they hear fewer people whistling compared with 20 or 30 years ago. Half of those asked said they believed the decline was a result of  the demise of working class culture, while a third said they were listening to ipods and personal music players instead of whistling. Co-Author of 'A Brief History of Whistling' John Lucas said the sound of miners on their way to the pits or workers to and from the factories used to be common. He explained there were even whistling choirs on the buses on the way to work. In the 70s and 80s whistling was still popular in many pop songs, John Lennon's Jealous Guy, later covered by Bryan Ferry's Roxy Music in 1981 were well-liked whistling tunes . Paul Simon'a 1972 hit Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard is also well-known for its use of whistling . Monty Python's Always Look On the Bright Side of Life from the 1979 film the Life of Brian is one of the few tunes you might hear whistled . Lucas said other jobs also normally associated with whistling were gone. These included errand delivery boys, and the coalman. Where the jobs do exist, whistling does not appear to be appreciated. Kevin Gifford, a milkman from Leicestershire was handed a warning in 2013 after residents on his route complained that his whistling disturbed them. The slow fizzle of whistling's popularity has also been linked to the decline of variety shows. In the past whistlers could be incredibly popular. Ronnie Rondale from Islington, London was so successful that he became a best-selling artist with Columbia records and toured the world. However, the era of master whistlers is still not completely dead and Britain can still boast at least one. Seventy-year-old Sheila Harrod from Loughborough won the 1995 international whistling championship in Berlin and still performs 1940s-style variety shows at home and abroad. Mrs. Harrod explained that she began honing her whistling skills at the age of 13 but complained that now young people don't seem much interested in it. All of her audiences are at least over 40. In the 70s and 80s whistling was still popular in many pop songs, as Paul Simon's 1972 hit Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard and John Lennon's Jealous Guy, later covered by Bryan Ferry's Roxy Music in 1981 show. Monty Python's Always Look On the Bright Side of Life from the 1979 film the Life of Brian is one of the few tunes you might hear whistled. It is popular at football matches and often performed at funerals. Whistling used to be considered inappropriate for women, mainly because traditionally prostitutes attracted punters by whistling at them. The whistle also got a bad name in the 1980s, when wolf-whistling was discredited and later banned by some companies. However, while for some it was the sign of someone with an empty head it is now slightly more celebral. Soprano and Classic FM broadcaster, Catherine Bott, who presented a recent BBC Radio 4 documentary on whistling, said it can be 'relaxing for people who've got a lot going on in their brain'. The decline of working class jobs: Miners used to have whistling choirs when they travelled to and from work . The milkman was also a profession associated with whistling but now residents are likely to be disturbed by the sound instead of enjoying it .","Once heard on stage, in the street and at work, whistling is on the decline .

"A part-time worker had the shock of her life after she was ordered to pay more three quadrillion pounds in pension contributions. The blunder at the pensions office in Essen, in the North Rhine-Westphalia area of Germany saw a letter sent out the woman asking for £3,351,978,728,190,661. The bill is more than a thousands times than the whole of Germany's annual gross domestic product. How much is one quadrillion? This graphic shows what one quadrillion pennies would look like stacked on top of each other. The block would dwarf the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the Empire State Building and London's Shard . The £3.35 billion is also enough to pay the UK government debt nearly 2,000 times over. In fact, the customer's real contributions should only have been around a few hundred pounds. A quadrillion, is a thousand times one trillion, (a million times a million) in the American system. So a quadrillion is ten to the power of 15 or 1,000,000,000,000,000. In the British system, one quadrillion is ten to the power of 24 or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. However, in most English speaking countries, including the UK, the American system is the accepted. A spokesman for the office said the mistake was made when a pensions office worker accidentally copied a customer number into the form, rather than the amount outstanding. 'Yes, the letter did in fact go out like that,' pensions office spokesman Wolfgang Buschfort confirmed to The Local on Wednesday. 'As far as I know, this is the only time anyone has been called on to make such a large incorrect payment. The error was spotted before the office attempted to debit the massive sum from the bank account of the woman, from the Schwarzwald in Baden-Württemberg. Mr Buschfort added that with 26,000 employees working at the pensions office, mistakes were inevitable. The only evidence of the blunder that remained was the eye watering 16 figure demand letter.

"Shopping with friends is bad for your bank balance – because it encourages people to spend far more than they would if making purchases by themselves. In a survey of 1,000 people from across the country, conducted by personal budgeting software company YouNeedaBudget.com, 64 per cent of adults confessed that they end up spending more money when they shop with friends. The main reasons for this were said to be 'showing off in front of friends' and 'succumbing to peer pressure and buying things we wouldn't ordinary buy'. Peer pressure: 64 per cent of adults think they spend more money when they go shopping with friends, many blaming the urge to 'show off' Nearly half of the participants (45 per cent) blamed the fact that they get carried away by excitement when they shop with friends. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Americans admit they would actually prefer to shop by themselves than with pals. But the site that conducted the study says there's no need to hit the mall alone to avoid buyer's remorse. 'It's all about priorities,' said Lindsey Burgess, a spokesperson for You Need a Budget. 'You need to decide what is most important to you and set your budget accordingly. 'When you know you will get to spend money on the things that matter most, it is easier to say no to impulse purchases and feel good about what you do buy, because it fits your long-term goals.' Food: 58 per cent . Clothing: 54 per cent . Household items: 28 per cent . Shoes: 21 per cent . Entertainment: 20 per cent . But while 85 per cent of participants in the study said they do give themselves a budget when they shop, 95 per cent admitted that they usually spend more than originally planned. Top items on which people overspend on include food (58 per cent), clothing (54 per cent), household items (28 per cent), shoes (21 per cent), and entertainment (20 per cent). Meanwhile, 53 per cent justify their overspending because an item happened to be on sale, while 34 per cent call their pricey purchases a 'special treat'. An impulsive 22 per cent said they just had to do it because it was 'absolutely necessary' at the time. A further 19 per cent of respondents also said their spouse or partner gives them a hard time for overspending, though five per cent  don't even tell their significant others about their big purchases.","A new YouNeedaBudget.com study found that 64 per cent of adults spend more money with friends due to peer pressure or the desire to show off .

"A 73-year-old grandmother was found guilty  of first-degree murder on Wednesday after gunning down her third husband while he was sleeping. It took the El Dorado Superior Court jury in less than two hours to convict Colleen Harris of murdering Robert Edward 'Bob' Harris in their Placerville, California home in 2013. Decades before, in 1985, Colleen Harris, a Placerville Land surveyor, shot dead her second husband and the father of her three children, 46-year-old James Batten, after claiming he had been abusive towards her. Colleen Harris (right), 73, pictured with defense attorney David Weiner, was found guilty of first-degree murder on Wednesday after shooting her husband while he was sleeping in 2013 . Colleen Harris wept in court after the El Dorado Superior Court jury announced their decision. It took them less than two hours to convict her of murder . Colleen Harris will be sentenced for the killing of her third husband on June 5. She stands to receive 50 years to life for first-degree murder with a firearm . Both killings were carried out in the same home with the same type of gun, and in both cases, after pulling the trigger, she claimed she had temporary amnesia and could not remember doing it. Colleen Harris will be sentenced on June 5, standing to receive 50 years to life for first-degree murder with a firearm, according to the Sacramento Bee. She cried and put her hand over her face as she was found guilty. Her initial trial testimony was that Bob Harris may have committed suicide, and later Colleen Harris claimed that the shooting was an accident wherein the couple had wrestled over the gun on their bed. Bob Harris, a U.S. forest supervisor, baseball umpire and sheriff's volunteer, was having an extramarital affair with a 34-year-old doctoral student and teacher he met in Mongolia, the court heard. Colleen Harris (left) first testified that Bob Harris (right) may have committed suicide. But she later said that Bob Harris's death was an accident that happened when the couple were wrestling over a shotgun on their bed . Bob and Colleen were married in 1990. They had two sons and a daughter together before divorcing in 2004. They married again a year later . In 1990, Bob and Colleen Harris married and had two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 2004 but then married again a year later. Then in 2012, as Harris took a trip to Mongolia, where he taught environmental conservation to students, he met another woman and began a relationship with her, the Bee reported. When he returned to California, he and his wife separated and he moved out. But when Colleen Harris was house-bound following hip-replacement surgery, he returned to the Placerville home to help her. And on January 5, 2013, she overheard her husband making a call to his love interest overseas and later that night or the following morning, she shot him as he slept, prosecutors said. She then allegedly drove to San Francisco and stashed her husband's cellphone, a handgun - not the same one used in the murder - and his coin collection, in her son's garage. After returning home, she called the lawyer who won her previous case and told him that she had shot her husband, prosecutors say. The lawyer then contacted the Sheriff's Office. El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander said that Harris claimed she had been in a 'gray fog' but insisted she would never shoot her husband. She said she was in the same fog in 1985. She was acquitted in her 1986 trial after claiming she had acted in self defense when her husband, whom she was divorcing, held a pistol to her head, threatened to kill her and sexually abused her. Bob Harris's son Scott Harris weeps in relief and has to wipe his eyes when the guilty verdict was announced on Wednesday . Harris's other two children, Pam Stirling (left) and Andy Harris (right), are comforted by relatives after the guilty verdict was announced in court . Bob Harris's sister Nancy Glaiberman, wiped tears from her eyes as the guilty verdict is announced at El Dorado Superior Court on Wednesday . She said she couldn't remember killing him and a psychiatrist testified during the trial that she suffered from limited amnesia. The prosecution claimed, however, that she had shot her husband as he read a newspaper in bed and then killed him with another shot at close range, before putting a pistol in the bed to make it look like self-defense. She waited an hour before calling the Sheriff's Office. Two of Bob Harris's children, Andy Harris and Pam Stirling said that Wednesday's verdict brought needed relief. 'I wish the jury could have heard how wonderful he was,' Stirling told the Sacramento Bee. 'I think justice served will be a good start for our family to recover from this tragedy.' In the  case, prosecutor Joe Alexander said that Colleen Harris shot Bob Harris in a premeditated act because she knew he had called the woman he was having an affair with. Bob Harris worked in the Forest Service and as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department. He was also an umpire for little league and minor league baseball . But the defense said that Bob Harris was upset at sending Stirling a text message that said, 'Between you and me, as I sit here wondering who I am married to, your dad just called his Mongolia love about 10 minutes ago'. Colleen Harris testified that she went into the couple's bedroom to comfort her husband when she saw the shotgun on the bed. She said she wrestled for the gun and then it gets grey. When she came to and turned on the light, she 'saw the most horrible thing', which was Bob Harris's dead body. After the killing, she made a trip to San Francisco and returned to try to wipe Bob Harris's blood off the ceiling before calling the police. Sterling said that her father was 'very unhappy in the marriage' and she was glad the jury acknowledged that Colleen Harris's actions were cruel. 'When someone wants to break away from another person, it seems that the other person can make a decision other than to kill him,' she said. In 1985, Colleen Harris shot her second husband dead in the same house that Bob Harris was murdered at in 2013 .","Colleen Ann Harris was found guilty of first-degree murder for shooting dead her third husband, Bob Harris, in their bedroom in 2013 .
In 1985, she shot her second husband, James Batten, 46, but was acquitted after claiming she acted in self defense and couldn't remember killing him .

Prosecutors say she shot dead Harris, from whom she was separated, after hearing him making a call to a love interest ."
"A dangerous 'death ring' has been spotted around the San Francisco Bay Area. Scientists say the lethal ring is leaving tens of thousands of creatures with severe, and often fatal injuries. Now researchers have released an interactive roadkill map to show the trail of destruction being caused by California's state highways. To view the interactive map, click here . Pictured are the South San Franscisco bay Area regional highway roadkill hotspots. The ring of death refers to an area made up of made up of I-80 (labelled as 9) and Route 101 (labelled as 13 and 8) The map uses data from the California Roadkill Observation System, a volunteer-submitted database of instances where wildlife and vehicles collided over the past five years. It assigns different coloured markers for various sizes of species. Clicking on the dots reveals the species - striped skunk, mountain lion, black bear, gopher snake, desert iguana - and where and when they were hit. Animals can also be mapped individually. Major hotspots include the Sacramento area where I-80 and I-5 run across bypasses along the Pacific Flyway. In the region, marshy areas attract birds during migration resulting in high rates of roadkill. Where I-80 and I-5 run across bypasses along the Pacific Flyway, marshy areas attract birds during migration and result in high rates of roadkill . Sacramento area: Where I-80 and I-5 run across bypasses along the Pacific Flyway, marshy areas attract birds during migration and result in high rates of roadkill. Bay Area: 'It's sort of a ring of death around the Bay Area,' Shilling said. Interstate 80 and State Route 101 run alongside the bay, where high rates of wading birds and water birds are killed. Large animals are more likely to be hit on I-280 and State Route 17, particularly near areas of parks and open spaces. Southern California: Many areas along State Route 94 in San Diego County have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat. Shilling said Caltrans is planning to build five new wildlife-crossing structures in this area because the data demonstrate both an immediate need and locations where structures would be useful. Sierra: Highway 70 in Plumas County and near Portola has high rates of roadkill, particularly deer. North Coast: Both State Routes 101 and 20 show high rates of collision between Willits and Lake Mendocino. 'It's sort of a ring of death around the Bay Area,' said Fraser Shilling at the University of California, Davis, who led the study. Interstate 80 and State Route 101 run alongside the bay, where high rates of wading birds and water birds are killed. Large animals are more likely to be hit on I-280 and State Route 17, particularly near areas of parks and open spaces. Meanwhile, many areas along State Route 94 in San Diego County have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat. Highway 70 in Plumas County and near Portola also has high rates of roadkill, particularly deer. And on the North Coast, both State Routes 101 and 20 show high rates of collision between Willits and Lake Mendocino. Fraser Shilling, co-director of the Road Ecology Center at University of California, Davis, says it is the largest wildlife monitoring system in the state. It features more than 29,000 sightings of more than 390 of California's 680 native vertebrate species. The report's findings cover about 40 per cent of the total state highway system. Meanwhile, the public are being encouraged to submit entries, including photographs, to add to the map. 'These data help identify places where immediate action is warranted,' says Shilling, who is also a research scientist with the UC Davis department of environmental science and policy. According to Caltrans and California Highway Patrol statistics, there are about 1,000 reported accidents each year on state highways involving deer, livestock, and other wildlife. There is one long hotspot in the circled area, representing 20 miles of SR190. The 419 roadkill observations of 36 species within the hotspot were collected  between April 2011 and October, 2014 . Many areas along State Route 94 in San Diego County have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat . The drought may be increasing the number of roadkill, as animals seem to be putting themselves at greater risk to find food and water sources, crossing roads they may not have in the past. While deer tend to use landscape 'corridors' when migrating, most other species do not appear to be using them. Landscape corridors, also known as wildlife corridors, are strips of land intended to connect parks and other wildlife reserves. But the roadkill data suggest that most animals tend to cross where they can, regardless of the location of these corridors. Birds are among the most common wildlife group types killed by road collisions. For instance, there is a high rate of barn owl roadkill where I-5 runs through agricultural lands of the Central Valley. Without trees or other elevated structures by the highways, the owls swoop down for prey without considering the trucks and other vehicles coming toward them. In what has not always been a popular suggestion, Shilling recommends for these areas planting vegetation such as oleander and ice plant, non-native species that repel rather than attract wildlife to the roadsides. 'You have a sterile, dangerous place - the roadway,' Shilling says. 'You don't want to attract animals there.' The drought may be increasing the number of roadkill, as animals seem to be putting themselves at greater risk to find food and water sources, crossing roads they may not have in the past . The long continuous hotspot represents 681 roadkill observations of 57 animal species. This isout of a total for the highway of 899 observations of 66 total species collected by 7 roadkillobservers, between October 2010 and October 2014 .","Death ring is made up of I-80 and Route 101 which run beside the bay .

"Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T. Despite his newest models being nearly 90 years old, the businessman, from Buckinghamshire, is selling one every week, including to the TV and film industry who have used then in shows such as Downton Abbey. Mr Tuckett says his customers love the Model T - the first affordable mass-produced car - because they don't require need road tax or an MOT and are cheaper to maintain than a modern car, with each one selling for  around £10,000. Scroll down for video . Toot: Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett (pictured) has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T . Top of the range: This 1914 model is £24,750 and is one of around one a week sold by the Buckinghamshire dealer . Yours for £13,500: this 1917 Model T is on the market and like all the classic cars they don't require road tax or a MOT . Back to basics: Some of the vehicles need to have their headlamps lit by match, left, and right are the rudimentary pedals for braking, accelerating and changing gear . But with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast and some of his pre-1915 model have gas headlights still lit by a match. Mr Tuckett, 58, has customers who use them as wedding cars and even one that is used as a hearse. He discovered his passion for the model when he got a call from his great uncle, John Brazil, asking him to accompany him on the London to Brighton commercial run - an event for historic commercial vehicles. He had a Model T van, previously used for transporting sausages and pies to London, and Neil had driven it once in a field before he got behind the wheel in Hyde Park for the event. He continued maintaining the vehicle afterwards and his great uncle left the van to him when he died. The agricultural engineer started his own business in 1984 but when the work dried up a few years later, his team turned their attention to Model Ts.. Now they struggle to keep up with the demand at his garage in North Marston, Buckinghamshire, and sell the cars for around £10,000 each. Neil has about six himself and goes touring in them with other fans of the car. MODEL T . Made . 1908-1927 . Price (from) £125 .

Neil said: 'We're a niche market specialist and I've got about 100 years of man experience of Model Ts with my team. 'We do about one a week, 50 a year. They're coming in here as fast as I can fix them. There's about 3,000 in the UK and we look after a good proportion of those. 'It was a very popular car. At one point, half the cars in the world were Model Ts. They're affordable, usable and repairable, even though they are 100 years old. 'It's more leisurely than a modern car. Its cruising speed is 30mph, at 40mph you're starting to rattle and to hit 45mph you'd have to be going downhill with the wind behind you. 'But it's cheaper to maintain than a modern car. The insurance costs about £50 a year, you don't need road tax or an MOT and there are no major expenses. Alternative forecourt: Business is booming at Neil Tuckett's time warp garage in the heart of rural Buckinghamshire . Meticulous: Mr Tuckett sources his Ford spares from all over the globe and carefully puts the machines back together again. Behind the wheel: The second-hand car dealer says that beauty of the Model is how simple and enjoyable it is to drive . Sales pitch: Mr Tuckett says: 'They're like a giant meccano set really, and so beautifully simple and reliable they just won't let you down. You also don't require road tax or and MOT' 'There's probably 20 companies in the world making new parts for the Model T and about 80 per cent of Model Ts are new parts now, but they don't make new chassis. 'The main source of original parts is America, 14million were built there. The parts are all affordable and there's no electrics so little to go wrong. 'And everyone seems to remember them, they know what a Model T is. That's quite surprising after 100 years, it's an iconic car. 'They're lots of fun. I'm about to go to Scotland with a Model T4 group - there's ten of us touring for a week in the Outer Hebrides. 'I've seen a lot of the UK that I would never have seen if I wasn't driving an old car.' Thing of beauty: The Model T is an icon, but with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast . Germans may have invented the petrol engine, but it was Henry Ford, a Michigan-Irish farmer used his genius to realise its social potential. Ford said he had to invent his ‘gasoline buggy’ to escape the crushing boredom of his own life on the farm in the United States. The Model T was made from 1908 to 1927 and is generally regarded as the first affordable car. In total more than 15million were made. The first Model Ts were fairly expensive, about £500. But by the early 1920s, when millions were being produced, the price had dropped to about £125, which was roughly equivalent to the average annual wage. Ford was obsessed with efficiency: his production lines were inspired by the meat-packing yards of Chicago and it became the first mass produced car in the United states . His famous decree that customers could choose ‘any colour so long as it is black’ was not to limit consumer choice, but to reduce costs. In Ford’s day, freshly painted cars were left in the sun to dry. Black dried more quickly and was thus cheaper. By 1914, a Model T could be manufactured in 93 minutes and spare parts were all available through the Sears Roebuck mail-order catalogue for drivers to install themselves.","Neil Tuckett's  newest model on his forecourt is  90 years old - but he is still selling one Model T every week .

"Britain's leading pensions and savings expert will today be announced as a new Conservative peer, who will appointed as Minister for Consumer Protection if the party wins the election. Dr Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser who went on to head over-50s group Saga, would take responsibility for protecting people from rip-off pension and mortgage charges. She would also be in charge of financial education and Government policy to reward and encourage saving. Dr Ros Altmann, pictured with David Cameron at Melbicks, a Wyevale Garden Centre in Birmingham, will today be announced as a new Conservative peer . Dr Altmann will oversee the Government’s pension reforms, which have allowed people to cash in retirement funds rather than being forced into buying often poor-value annuities. She will also steer through reforms designed to make it easier for customers to move to another bank, by allowing customers to take their account number with them. ‘For too many years, consumer rights have played second fiddle to the interests of large financial firms, but the new pension freedoms show that the Conservatives have put the interests of British savers first,’ Dr Altmann said. ‘I passionately believe the new pension reforms, trusting people with their own money, are an essential step to helping everyone make the most of their hard-earned savings. 'David Cameron and George Osborne have proved to me that they want to help the many, not just the few at the top, by giving the same freedoms to everyone as were already enjoyed by the wealthiest. ‘In doing so, they took on the large companies who had too often taken advantage of their customers and have paved the way for a new environment for long-term savings. The Conservatives have created the opportunity for working families to save more if and when they can, knowing they will be allowed to use the money as best suits their circumstances. Dr Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser who went on to head over-50s group Saga, would take responsibility for protecting people from rip-off pension and mortgage charges . ‘That is right, but of course it will also require a change of mindset from providers and potentially further action from Government to protect consumers. It will be my job to try to ensure customers get a better deal and I am delighted to be offered the chance to do so. ‘Charge caps, impartial financial guidance, help with financial planning, financial education at all ages, and more competition for savers’ money will all help and it will be great to have the opportunity to play a direct role in looking after the public.’ The Prime Minister said: ‘What we’re doing is taking the country’s leading expert on pensions, on savings, on financial education, Ros Altmann, and saying that if we’re re-elected, she’ll be at the heart of government, making sure we complete this great revolution where we’re giving people much more power to save, to access their pension, to pass their pension on to their children, because we want to create a real savings culture in our country for everybody. 'Not for the rich at the top, but for everybody who saves or has a pension.' ‘This will be good for everybody. We’ve got millions more people saving for a pension because of auto-enrolment - having an automatic pension in your workplace - so there are many more people saving. 'There are also great new products like the flexible ISA, a real encouragement for savings with the single tier pension, and now at the heart of government, if we’re elected, Ros Altmann - the country’s leading pensions, savings, and financial education expert to make sure that we make the most of this great revolution in favour of savings and financial security for many in our country.’","Dr Ros Altmann will be announced as a new Conservative peer today .

"An Arkansas family who believe their daughter is being brainwashed by a controversial Texas church have again lost the woman, after she came home for a few days only to return to the 'religious cult'. Then, within hours of returning to the Church of Wells - a small evangelical commune of about 70 'born of discontent with mainstream Christianity' - Catherine Grove, 28, announced she is set to marry one of its elders. Grove initially vanished in July 2013, abandoning her car and belongings in Fayetteville, Arkansas, only to show up weeks later under heavy guard at the Church of Wells in Wells, Texas. Over the years the church has been accused of sexual abuse, kidnapping and human trafficking, however they have strongly denied any wrongdoing. Grove, a former nursing student, said she was 'seeking the Lord' and was not being held against her will, despite protestations from her parents. Scroll down for video . 'Brainwashed': The parents of Catherine Grove, 28, believe she was been brainwashed by the Church of Wells, after escaping the so-called cult in Texas only to return six days later. She has now announced in a video (right) that she will marry a church elder . Torn apart: Catherine Grove (second right) is seen with her parents Andy (far right) and Patty Grove (second left), along with her brother, sister and grandfather (center) 'Cult': The main building of the controversial Church of Wells is pictured here in Wells, Texas. The church has long denied accusations over the years that it is a cult . Family: Women belonging to the Church of Wells are seen here at the property in a September 2013 profile piece done by local network KNWA following the initial disappearance of Catherine Grove . Elders: Members of the church are seen here carrying books in the town of Wells, Texas, in September 2013 . At the time, her parents, Andy and Patty Grove, told reporters they believed their daughter had been brainwashed, amid mounting accusations over the years the Church of Wells is run as a cult, KNWA reported. Then, earlier this month, Grove left the church under mysterious circumstances. She called 911 on April 2 sounding disoriented, asking if someone could pick her up. A sheriff was sent to get her, and Grove told police she left the church after having a fight with another member. According to a report in the Lufkin Daily News, Grove stayed with her family for six days after that. But she then returned to the Church of Wells. Jake Gardner, one of three pastors that lead the church, released a statement to 5 News, lambasting the behavior of Grove's parents. 'May God open your eyes to behold the truth of what is really going on in this controversy,' Gardner said. Tight-knit: The Church of Wells - pictured here is their website homepage - has only about 70 members, all of which live in Wells, Texas. Their beliefs are 'born of discontent with mainstream Christianity' 'Seeking the Lord': Catherine Grove speaks with press after vanishing, only to emerge as a member of the Church of Wells. She denied claims by her parents that she was brainwashed into converting . Gardner added: 'We are amazed at the atrocious behavior of the Groves towards their daughter, and pray they would be held accountable by those with a hand in this matter (as we have sought to do), to the end that their lives and behavior would agree with their confession of Christ.' Grove then appeared herself in a YouTube video, explaining that her parents told her they visiting family in Little Rock but took her instead to a hospital. 'On April 7, I was still in the psych ward and the doctor came in and said after testing me all this time very carefully I had no mental illness so they cannot keep me in the hospital,' Grove said in the video. Speaking out: Church of Wells leader Sean Morris (right) speaks out in a YouTube video this week following the return of Catherine Grove, denying reports she had 'escaped' Pleading: Grove's parents have been desperate to get her back since she went missing in 2013. She returned on her own earlier this month, only to go back to the church six days later . Grove said after this, church members would come and pick her up from the hospital. 'Here I am,' Grove said, smiling. '(Now I'm) going to be married. Not sure the date. Even though my parents can be so difficult. 'It is my desire to preach to them.' Grove is set to marry Church of Wells member, Ronnie Saltsman. Grove insisted the reason she left the church was to find peace with her parents. 'I just wanted to remove this pressure upon me,' she said in the video. 'I wasn't trying to leave the church.' Andy and Patty Grove are yet to comment publicly about their daughter returning to the church. The Church of Wells denies members all forms of entertainment and leisure in favor of prayer. They believe in deep self-loathing for their sin and that this is the only way to be saved. Before Grove disappeared, the church hit headlines after a baby died at the compound. An investigation following the incident in May 2012 showed the three-day-old infant died without receiving any medical attention. Members of the church then carried the child around to different houses, where they prayed for the baby to be resurrected. It would not be until 15 hours later that 911 was called, according to reports at the time.","Catherine Grove disappeared from Fayetteville, Arkansas, in July 2013 .

"When TV star Karren Brady agreed to help David Cameron announce 16,000 new apprenticeships today she might have been hoping to steal a little of the limelight from the Prime Minister. However, the businesswoman and Apprentice judge was instead relegated to coat duty, helping Mr Cameron with his jacket as he stood to speak, before sitting politely with it on the sidelines. Baroness Brady, who is also the government’s small business ambassador, was appearing alongside Mr Cameronat a National Grid training centre in Newark, Nottinghamshire, to announce the creation of more trainee jobs for young people. Scroll down for video . Helping hand: Baroness Brady steps forward to help David Cameron with his jacket at an event today to promote new apprenticeships . Sidelined: TV star Ms Brady might have been hoping for a slightly more galmorous role when she agreed to the appearance with Mr Cameron, but instead sat politely holding his jacket . Campaign trail: She attended the speech along with Mr Cameron to announce the creation of 16,000 new apprenticeships at Costa, Morrisons, and the National Grid . Mr Cameron has pledged to create three million more apprenticeships over the next five years, if the Tories win the election. Costa Coffee and supermarket chain Morrisons have signed agreements to train thousands of apprentices each. Ministers will visited firms across the country to welcome fresh commitments from companies including Morrisons, who will train 9,000 apprentices; Crest Nicholson, who will take on 200 and announce a new training academy; and the National Grid, who will take on 500 new apprentices. Ahead of their campaign visit today, Baroness Brady said: ‘David Cameron’s commitment to delivering more apprenticeships is a fantastic boost for the long-term prospects of our young people.' She added: ‘With 2.2million starting since 2010 and another 3million more to start over the next five years, each apprenticeship is a chance for young people to master a trade, learn on the job and take home money in your pocket each week. ‘They’ve become more rigorous and respected too: we’ve got young people building engines for jet planes, working on massive engineering projects, innovating in science labs.’ The star of the BBC show The Apprentice said: ‘I remember that feeling of being 18, 19, 20 years old, hungry to get on and desperate for someone to give me an opportunity so I could prove myself. As soon as someone gives you a chance and believes in you – it’s a moment that can transform your life. ‘I’ve met many apprentices (apart from the Lord Sugar hopefuls) and you can see the pride written across their faces.’ TV star Karren Brady, pictured in Newark today, announced a series of deals with big businesses to create 16,000 new apprenticeships . David Cameron - on the campaign trail in Newark today- said the announcement shows the Conservatives continuing commitment to apprenticeships, which he wants to be 'level pegging' with university degress . Mr Cameron added: ‘There really has never been a better time to start an apprenticeship and it’s a huge leap forward to have even more of Britain’s most prestigious employers hiring apprentices. ‘We want apprenticeships to be level-pegging with a university degree, giving millions more people the dignity of work and a regular pay packet. ‘We’ve already created 2.2million apprenticeships since 2010, but a future Conservative government is committed to opening up 3million more high quality apprenticeships – to help strengthen our economy and communities and give millions more people financial security.’ Mr Cameron has pledged to create three million more apprenticeships over the next five years, if the Tories win the election .

"She's the bearded diva who won over the globe after winning Europe's biggest entertainment contest last year. And now, Eurovision Song Contest legend Conchita Wurst has been given a dazzling high art makeover. The star has been transformed into Gustav Klimt's Golden Adele for the Life Ball 2015 poster. Scroll down for video . Conchita Wurst has been transformed into Gustav Klimt's Golden Adele for the Life Ball 2015 poster shot by Ellen von Unwerth . Conchita posed before industry heavyweight Ellen von Unwerth's lens for the poster, which will be on display on the streets of Vienna and cast in gold on a medallion by Austrian Mint. The poster promotes the dazzling Life Ball event, where Conchita will perform, as well as walk in a fashion show staged by Jean Paul Gaultier. Naturally, the 26-year-old wears a lavish gown in the imagery. The gold dress, which is embroidered with over 12,000 Swarovski crystals and 0.5kg of pearls and painted with 2.5kg of gold color, took over 1,000 hours to handcraft. Conchita posed before industry heavyweight Ellen von Unwerth's lens for the poster . Life Ball founder, Gery Keszler, Conchita, legendary snapper Ellen and Jean Paul Gaultier pose on set . 'Being able to wear this art piece of a dress felt sensational,' gushed Conchita. 'I love Ellen! I knew a few of her works and was incredibly excited to meet her. What a great women.' Speaking about her work, Ellen Von Unworth said: 'I tried to imitate Klimt's painting - it almost felt flagrant. I love Klimt, his paintings with all those colors, all this glamor and and all the poetry. I felt very inspired by creating an homage to this extraordinary painting.' The Life Ball posters, which are created by world famous artists and convey the event's message, have become legendary since their launch in 2013. The poster will be auctioned off on the day of the Ball during the AIDS Solidarity Gala in the Hofburg palace for the benefit of Austrian and international HIV/AIDS projects. In 2014, the auction of the original photo by David La Chapelle sold for £130,000. Conchita, seen behind the scenes on set, won over the globe after winning Europe's biggest entertainment contest in 2014 . The Life Ball, which takes place in May, is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV/AIDS and is being dubbed Europe's answer to the MET Ball thanks to it's dazzling guestlist. Speaking about the origins of the glittering event, Keszler told FEMAIL: 'Life Ball was born out of the energy and environment prevalent across the world in the late 80’s and early 90’s - particularly in the fashion industry - that saw AIDS as a daily issue profoundly effecting our friends and colleagues who were dying, but that no one understood or was willing to talk about. 'There was this undercurrent of urgency to do something: to help, to get involved and make some noise. 'My main goal with the first Life Ball was to bring a spotlight to the disease, the fundraising aspect was a secondary consideration.' The Life Ball, pictured, is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV or AIDS and is being dubbed Europe's answer to the MET Ball . Gery Keszler set up the event in 1992 with the goal of the show being to be provocative and have HIV/AIDS and the taboo that it represented acknowledged. Right: Conchita as the star of this year's poster . Gery Keszler, left, pictured with Sir Elton John, centre, set up The Life Ball in 1992 to raise vital funds . The event, which has attracted the likes of Bill Clinton, left, and Dame Vivienne Westwood, aims to get people talking about AIDS, which Keszler says was a daily issue profoundly effecting his friends and colleagues who were dying but that no one understood or was willing to talk about . Keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific Ball tradition that they have in Vienna, and combine the splendour of the Viennese Waltz with modern, liberal ideals to celebrate life. 'At that time, the goal of the show was to be provocative as we were aiming to cause a stir and have HIV/AIDS and the taboo that it represented acknowledged,' he explained. 'When in 1993 one of my clients, Thierry Mugler’s main stylist, died of the disease, he agreed to do the fashion show and so Life Ball as a standalone event was born. 'I had no conceivable idea what I was taking on, it was me and a fax machine in six square meters of office space in my client's kitchen. I funded it entirely from my own pocket and didn’t really know if anyone was going to attend but knew that we had to do something.' Keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific Ball tradition that they have in Vienna with more liberal ideas (Conchita Wurst pictured at the event) Prince Harry, who set up Sentebale, a charity that provides healthcare and education to vulnerable children in Lesotho, Southern Africa, will be honoured with an award for his services . As part of his Sentebale charity, Harry built the Mamohato Children's Centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education and the initiative is being awarded . Keszler says this year's Life Ball, which takes place in Vienna, will 'undoubtedly be better than ever' Keszler 'strongly believes' that a cure for HIV is on the horizon and hopes to make as much noise about it as possible via his glittering event . From there, a huge event was born and the likes of Debbie Harry, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen were among the first guests. The event is now listed as one of the top 50 HIV/AIDS fundraisers in the world and has partnered with Elton John’s AIDS Foundation, Bill Clinton’s AIDS Initiative and AmFAR. Keszler says this year’s Life Ball will 'undoubtedly be better than ever'. The event will be continuing its work with Elton John’s foundation, supporting the crucial work that they do, and Graham Norton will be attending as part of the foundation. Adding some high fashion glamour to the event, Jean Paul Gaultier is set to unveil an exclusive retrospective of work twenty years after he first showed there. With gold as this year’s Life Ball theme, taking inspiration from the exquisite baroque Vienna Secessionists, the couture show will follow the vibrant and ostentatious theme with a bevy of internationally acclaimed supermodels set to walk for well-connected Jean Paul. 'It is really perfect timing to have JPG back this year,' said Keszler. 'It has been twenty years since he was part of the Life Ball and we are at such an exciting time in our medical fight against HIV that his presence is a wonderful reminder of how far we have come.' The event is now listed as one of the top 50 HIV AIDS fundraisers in the world and has attracted guests such as Maria Cross, left, and Antonio Banderas and Naomi Campbell, right . Ricky Martin has performed at the event in previous years and 2015 will welcome Jean Paul Gaultier and Charlize Theron . Jean Paul's show will be watched from the front row by actress Charlize Theron, who will attend on behalf of her foundation Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project. Theron will join a bevy of A-list celebrities and performers, who pour into Vienna annually to help fight against HIV at the world’s largest AIDS event. The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, based in her home country of South Africa, is dedicated to addressing HIV/AIDS in adolescents across sub-Saharan Africa through education, grant giving, networking and community outreach. Theron will give a keynote speech at the First Ladies Luncheon at the Belvedere Castle in Vienna ahead of attending the Life Ball, where she will present the work of her organisation and her vision for and AIDS-free generation. Prince Harry, who works tirelessly to help vulnerable children living in extreme poverty at risk of AIDS, will also be recognised. As part of his Sentebale charity, which he set up with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, the 30-year-old royal built the Mamohato Children’s Centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education. And  Harry's programme will be receiving the 2015 Swarovski Crystal Of Hope Award at the glittering Life Ball event in May. Keszler won't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change . Keszler 'strongly believes' that a cure for HIV is on the horizon and that the leap forward that was affordable generic medication was crucial to the fight for survival for the 34 million people in the world living with HIV. 'Ironically we have further to go in the fight against social AIDS than we do the medical disease now and thus it is this fight that we must be equally concerned with,' he said. But that's where the Life Ball comes in - and he won't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change. He concludes: 'Life Ball is symbolic, it is a unique weekend in the year in which the world’s most significant AIDS organisations come together, stand together, fight together and continue to fight for those who are not able to fight for themselves. 'It is my constant desire for Life Ball weekend to expand, to obtain more friends, have better connections, help more programmes and become internationally known for fighting social AIDS as well as the disease itself.'","Conchita is star of Life Ball 2015 poster .

"An Armenian expat who shows Australians how to cook a 'real barbecue' has become an internet sensation after his daughter posted his hilarious video online. Yervand Garginian, a 60-year-old bus driver from South Croydon in Melbourne, filmed himself cooking chicken on an open charcoal barbecue using a traditional 'khorovats' recipe at a recent family gathering. In the video Mr Garginian, who moved to Australia from Armenia in 1977, dismisses the Australian-style barbecue of cooking 'oily' sausages. His daughter Elizabeth Garginian, 24, posted the video to Reddit and it has since been viewed more than five million times after it was shared across Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. Scroll down for video . An Armenian expat who shows Australians how to cook a 'real barbecue' has become an internet sensation . Yervand Garginian (left), a 60-year-old bus driver from South Croydon in Melbourne, filmed the video at his nephew Albert's (right) house during a recent family gathering . In the video Mr Garginian says: 'Hi guys, I want to tell you what, this is the real barbecue OK? 'Not your barbecue with the sausage, it's all oily thing you eating, this is the real barbecue which is called Armenian barbecue. 'Once you eat you're going to eat your fingers together too, and then you're going feel sorry you eat your fingers.' Ms Garginian said she never anticipated the video would be so popular when she first posted it from her clothing business Casual Dress Day's YouTube account. 'My boyfriend posted it on Reddit and within one hour it was on the top page of videos, and within the next hour it was on the front page of Reddit and it went to number two,' she told Daily Mail Australia. In the video Mr Garginian, who moved to Australia from Armenia in 1977, dismisses the Australian-style barbecue of cooking 'oily' sausages. He is pictured here with his wife Hasmik . 'We were awake all night staring at it - it was crazy. 'I think it's just because it's funny, the way my dad explains it is funny.' Ms Garginian said her father was enjoying his newfound internet fame. 'He's pretty excited, he's happy that the whole world's seen his barbecue.' The video was filmed at her cousin Albert's house to celebrate a new veranda Mr Garginian had just helped to build. Ms Garginian said the chicken was marinated in spices overnight according to a secret family recipe. She said her family often gathers together so her father and uncles can cook the traditional barbecue for everyone. His daughter Elizabeth (right) and her boyfriend Denis Arbatov (left) posted the video to Reddit . 'All the uncles will gather around early and stand around the barbecue and drink vodka,' Ms Garginian said. 'Whenever my dad and uncles have been out at parks doing Armenian barbecue they always receive attention from the public, and they always let people come over and try some to share our culture. 'Whenever they're doing it the smell takes over the whole street.' Ms Garginian added that unlike her father, she also enjoys Australian-style barbecues. 'I like sausages on the barbecue, I like a sausage sizzle, but it's so different to the type of barbecue we do.'","Yervand Garginian, a 60-year-old Melbourne bus driver, has gone viral .

"Bitter: Tracey Taylor went on a violent rampage following the breakdown of her 20 year relationship . A jilted florist used her car to ram her ex-fiance's Porsche as well as his new girlfriend's BMW while her two terrified daughters sat in the back. Furious Tracey Taylor, 34, caused more than £13,000 worth of damage to the luxury cars including scratching the paintwork with a key and smashing the BMW's windscreen with a rock. Earlier that day she had attacked her former lover and his girlfriend, punching him on the ear and pulling her hair after barging her way into her home in Ratby, Leics. Then two days later she returned to the property and broke in through the front door, pushing her way past her love rival's 19-year-old student daughter before tearing a flatscreen TV off the wall and hurling a vase of roses across the room. When arrested she told the police she'd attacked the cars on February 18 this year because she saw they had a Porsche and a BMW between them when he'd left her 'penniless.' Leicester Crown Court heard how Taylor had been struggling to come to terms with the breakdown of the 20 year relationship with the father of her two daughters, aged 12 and four, and a 15-year-old son. Recorder Mark Hill QC, sentencing, told Taylor, of Desford, Leics: 'You were unable to control your temper and your appalling behaviour brings discredit upon you. 'You displayed a high level of anger and violence, carried out in the presence of two young children, causing extensive and serious damage.' Lynsey Knott, defending, said: 'It was a life-long relationship since she was 15. 'She's a devoted mother, has no previous convictions, and is ashamed two of her children were present. 'She'd assisted her partner with the running of the businesses and after the breakdown was left without a home, whilst waiting for a housing association property. Taylor received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement . 'She was at rock-bottom and is truly sorry. Her doctor has increased her anti-depressant medication.' The court heard £9,800 pounds' worth of damage was caused to the Porsche and £3,800 to the BMW - including key scratch marks. Florist Taylor admitted burglary, criminal damage and two counts of common assault. She received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement. She was also handed a five-year restraining order was made, banning her from contacting her ex-lover's new partner or her teenage daughter. Taylor's ex-partner, aged 40, who runs a car business, asked not to be named, but said after the case: 'It's been the most stressful year of my life, since we broke up. 'It's been a complete nightmare with all the damage, threats, outbursts and driving at me before crashing into the cars in front of our daughters. 'I can't forgive what she's done and I've split up with my girlfriend, because she couldn't cope with what's happened. 'I hope this case brings an end to the problems and we can move on and work at remaining amicable for the children.'","Tracey Taylor was distraught following breakdown of 20 year relationship .

"Left his post: Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl walked away from the army and was captured by the Taliban in June of 2009 . The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Mike Mullen knew that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdhal deserted his post in 2009, claim three of the controversial soldier's comrades. The men say that Mullen, who served President Obama and then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates six years ago, was certain that Bergdahl had fled the army and was guilty of desertion. The claims mean that Mullen was in a position to tell the president his soldier had run away five years before National Security Adviser Susan Rice told the world that Bergdahl served honorably. It also casts a huge shadow over the deal to swap five Taliban commanders for Bergdahl that culminated in a Rose Garden ceremony hosted by Obama to celebrate his release and attended by his parents. 'I asked him (Mullen) if he knew about Bergdahl and that he deserted and he (Mullen) told me that he knew of the circumstances surrounding his walking off,' said former Sgt. Matt Vierkant told Fox, 'and that they were developing leads and following leads, trying to do everything they could to get him back.' This development comes one week after officials scheduled a July hearing for the Army sergeant who left his post in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years. Bergdahl says he walked away because of PTSD and is not a deserter. Vierkrant claims he and two other collegagues, Evan Buetow and Cody Full, were providing security for Mullen while he was on a trip to Afghanistan in December 2009 - six months after Bergdahl was captured. Vierkrant claims that during an unguarded question and answer session, Mullen said they could ask him anything. 'So Matt asked him, you know Bergdahl deserted, what's going on with that? And Admiral Mullen said, 'Yes, we know all the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl walking away from the OP (outpost,)and we're still working on getting him back, figuring out where he is and kind of figuring out that whole situation.' Scroll Down for Video . Admiral Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, allegedly told three comrades of Bergdahl that the soldier was a deserter . Specialist Cody Full confirmed that this is what Mullen said as did Buetow. 'I don't remember him being taken aback by it at all, you know, he knew what was going on, he answered not confidently but he didn't have to think about it, he didn't want to give us some political answer,' Buetow explained to Fox. 'He just gave us an answer.' According to former White House aides this means it is inconceivable that Mullen would not have told President Obama and raises questions as to the prisoner swap for a known deserter. 'If Mullen knew, and now it's alleged that he did know, it would be, it would be unthinkable that he didn't pump this up the chain of command, his chain of command, or, tell the president directly,' said Brad Blakeman, a former Bush White House staffer to Fox News. 'At a minimum, this would have been included in the president's daily brief, and at a maximum, it would've been told directly to the President by Mullen.' Days after his rescue (right), Bergdahl (pictured left in a video released by the Taliban in 2010) was in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in Germany . U.S. President Barack Obama stands with Bob Bergdahl (R) and Jami Bergdahl (L) as he delivers a statement about the release of their son, prisoner of war U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, in the Rose Garden at the White House in  May, 2014 . Mullen spoke to Fox News and defended his decisions. 'From the moment Sgt. Bergdahl went missing, the U.S. Military was focused on finding him--as it does with any serviceman or woman who goes missing. The exact circumstances were not known then, nor did they drive our decisions. We do not leave our people behind.' Vierkant said that he wants to know what his superior officers knew and when they knew it. 'I want to ask him (Mullen) did they brief the White House? Who knew about it and why would you still do this trade knowing all the information that you knew?' said Vierkant. 'We don't leave anyone behind. The thing is, we never left him (Bergdahl) behind. He left us behind. He chose to walk off and do whatever and get captured, that was his fault. Those were his choices.' Bergdahl is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Army officials announced Thursday that his Article 32 hearing will be held July 8 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. That proceeding is similar to a civilian grand jury. From there, it could be referred to a court-martial and go to trial. Officials say Bergdahl walked away from his post in Afghanistan and was captured by the Taliban. He was then released from Taliban control in a prisoner exchange last May for five Taliban commanders. He faces up to life in prison if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy.","Former Sgt.

"A young special needs girl from Texas got the prom proposal of a lifetime. Sophomore Tiffany Gay thought she was being led outside for a routine fire drill but instead she found her biggest crush, junior Luis Velasquez, holding a bouquet of flowers. Gay's classmates cheered as she held back tears of joy. Some of them held signs that read, 'Will you go to prom with me?' Overjoyed: Tiffany Gay was overcome with emotion this week when her biggest crush Luis Velasquez asked her to be his date to the prom .

'Since then, Tiffany has had the biggest crush on my son. And since the beginning of this school year, Luis said he’s taking Tiffany to prom,' she added. Gay is a special needs student who struggles with a genetic disorder called Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) that causes sufferers to have an insatiable appetite. According to the Genetic Disease Foundation, 'PWS typically causes low muscle tone, short stature if not treated with growth hormone, incomplete sexual development, and a chronic feeling of hunger that, coupled with a metabolism that utilizes drastically fewer calories than normal, can lead to excessive eating and life-threatening obesity.'

"She costs taxpayers more than £39,000 a year in benefits. And now Cheryl Prudham, a pregnant mother of 11, is blowing some of that cash on a £10,000 trip to Las Vegas, it was reported yesterday. The 33-year-old is said to be planning to renew her wedding vows with her husband Robert, 30, during the ‘no expense spared’ jaunt. Shameless: Cheryl Prudham, 33, who receives £39,000 in benefits, and her partner Robert are spending £10,000 on a lavish ceremony in Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows . Browsing: The couple, who hit headlines last year after demanding a bigger council house for their huge brood, visited her local Thomson travel agents in Kent to book the luxury family break . The pair, who have only just got back together after a short split because they want to have more children, were photographed this week visiting their local Thomson travel agent and taking away brochures for the American casino city. Mrs Prudham – who was also recently spotted flaunting an £895 Mulberry handbag as she strolled near their home in Gravesend, Kent – plans to wear a £1,000 designer gown for the ceremony. The couple will stay at the Circus Circus hotel and intend to renew their vows at the infamous Chapel of Love, before being whisked away in a chauffeur-driven limousine. They have also booked to see some shows and go on a helicopter tour across Nevada, a Sunday newspaper reported. It is not their first taxpayer-funded jaunt. Last year they took a £7,000 trip to Menorca, Spain. Mrs Prudham told Closer magazine at the time: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday.’ The Prudhams claim £39,192 in benefits a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – bringing their total annual income up to almost £60,000. Planning: The duo are planning to fly to the U.S. in March for the two-week 'no-expense spared' break . Lavish: Last month, Mr and Mrs Prudham and some of their children were spotted leaving a designer shop in London . They managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year cap on state handouts because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit. The pair separated for a short time after Mr Prudham, who is the father of Mrs Prudham’s five youngest children, struck up a relationship with another woman online. But Mrs Prudham took him back in February because she wanted to have more children with him. She said: ‘We’re good at making babies ... and I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family.’ Her 12th child is due in July and the family, who live in a five-bedroom council house, are waiting to be upgraded to a seven-bedroom home because their current one is ‘too cramped’. Last month, the family attracted attention over their lifestyle when they were photographed leaving a Mulberry store at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London. The brand’s handbags are seen as the height of luxury thanks to the fine leather used and the eye-watering prices to match. Mrs Prudham left the store with a shopping bag – thought to contain the much-coveted £895 Bayswater handbag she was recently spotted with. Happy families: The couple have been together six years, and Mr Prudham is the father of his wife’s five youngest children . Huge brood: The family get £39,192 in handouts a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000 .","Cheryl Prudham, 33, from Kent, planning to renew vows with husband Rob .

"A man took his own life shortly after he was convicted of killing his wife in court on Friday. Mark Ward Faville, of Christiansburg, Virginia, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of his wife Anne, who died in 2000 after being suffocated in a homicidal manner. Faville had reported at the time she had choked on a piece of chicken, something that was supported by an initial autopsy. After the verdict was, read, Faville was taken away, and it was then he took his own life in the courthouse. Scroll down for video . Mark Faville (above), of Christiansburg, Virginia, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of his wife Anne, who died in 2000, on Friday . Faville (above with his lawyer) then took his own life as he was being led away, though it is not known how he did this and an investigation is underway . The Roanoke Times reports that a sheriff's deputy who was taking the man to a holding room could be heard screaming 'drop it, drop it,' and that the court was soon put on lockdown until 5pm. Anne (above) died in 2000 . Faville was later found dead of a self-inflicted wound, though it is not known what kind of weapon he may have used to kill himself. Deputies do not carry guns when transporting individuals in the courthouse so that they cannot try to grab them. What's more, everyone must pass through security and an x-ray machine to get into the courthouse. Police are investigating the incident. The jury of 10 men and two women took just a few hours to come back with a conviction in the case after hearing closing arguments Friday morning. The couple's two daughters both testified for the prosecution. His wife was a local teacher, and in the months after her death both daughters noted odd behaviors from their father. They also claim he had grown suspicious of his wife, and had even begun following her when she went out on errands. Immediate family members and friends cried as the verdict was read, almost all of whom believe Faville was guilty. Writings found at the couple's home seemed to imply that Anne was preparing to leave her husband for her high school sweetheart Chris Crowley, something he himself confirmed when he took the stand earlier this week. Then, on March 7, Crowley grew concerned when he had not heard from Anne all day and called police. A little after his concerned call, at around 1am on March 8, Faville ran to his neighbor's home to say his wife had stopped breathing and he needed help. Robert and Melissa Frederick ran over and said they found Anne dead and cold to the touch, and both they and paramedics reported seeing Faville sitting on his dead wife's chest and slapping her face in their testimony this week. What's more, Mr. Frederick, a respiratory therapist, repeatedly asked Faville to get off his wife so he could do something, but the man refused to move. 'There was nothing else I could do,' testified Frederick.","Mark Faville, of Christiansburg, Virginia, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of his wife Anne, who died in 2000, on Friday .

"The mass brawl which broke out at a bar opening inside a Queens casino Friday night was allegedly caused by an argument in an enormous line for drinks. Hundreds of patrons hoping for an iced daiquiri at the debut of a Fat Tuesdays bar inside the Resort World Casino ended up at each other's throats when the party went sour. According to a casino worker, the fighting goes back to two women who clashed during the long wait for alcohol, dragging their group of friends into the conflict. Scroll down for video .

Bystanders uploaded cell phone footage of the ugly brawl, which broke out around 10.30pm, to social media. Running gangs of fighters can be seen storming through the halls of the casino, shouting profanities at one another. A witness, Elize Brown, told CBS2 New York: 'It was chairs flying everywhere — it was chaotic. 'It was nerve-wracking. It was like you don't know what the next thing that was going to happen was.' According to the New York Post, three men were arrested in the aftermath of the brawl, which injured four security guards and a police officer.

"Jodi Arias has reported to prison to begin serving her life sentence for murder, and she has a new mugshot. The image shows a stone-faced Arias dressed in an orange prison uniform. It's a sharp contrast from her original booking photo in which displayed a smirk. She later said she flashed the grin because that's what her victim would have done if he were in the same situation. She also figured the mugshot would be all over the Internet, 'so why not?' Arias was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison - with no change of parole - on Monday. She plans to appeal the conviction. Scroll down for video . Life in prison is no laughing matter: Jodi Arias looks serious in a new mugshot (left) taken  this week, as she starts her life in prison sentence for murdering ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander. In her first mugshot, taken in 2008 (right), Arias smiled on purpose because she knew the picture would be widely published . She killed ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in what prosecutors said was a jealous rage because he wanted to break off their relationship. Arias killed her ex-boyfriend in 2008 after a stormy relationship. Prosecutors say she murdered him in a jealous rage because he wanted to break off the relationship. She shot Alexander and stabbed him nearly 30 times in his suburban Phoenix home before fleeing and driving to Utah to meet up with another romantic interest. She was arrested weeks later and initially denied any involvement. International media attention soon followed after she did two television interviews in which she told a bizarre story of masked intruders breaking into the home and killing Alexander while she cowered in fear. She subsequently changed her story and said it was self-defense after Alexander attacked her on the day he died. The rest of her life: On Monday, a judge sentenced Arias to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Arias pictured above in Maricopa County Superior Court the day the sentence was handed down . Victorious for some: Chris Hughes, friend of victim Travis Alexander, claps his hands as he leaves the Maricopa Count courthouse following sentencing on Monday . Victim: Prosecutors said Arias heartlessly killed Alexander (pictured together above) because he wanted to break up with her . Her 2013 trial became a media circus as details of their kinky relationship and the violent crime scene emerged in court and were broadcast live. Spectators traveled to Phoenix and lined up in the middle of the night to get a seat in the courtroom to catch a glimpse of what had become to many a real-life soap opera. Interest in the case intensified after Arias did a jailhouse interview minutes after she was convicted of murder, telling a local TV reporter that she preferred the death penalty over life in prison. 'I would much rather die sooner than later. Longevity runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural life in one place,' she said. The original jury was deadlocked on whether to sentence her to death, setting up another penalty phase trial that began last year. After months of testimony and efforts by Arias' lawyers to portray Alexander as a sexual deviant who physically and emotionally abused her, the second jury also failed to reach a unanimous decision — this time 11-1 in favor of death. The 11 jurors who wanted the death penalty said the holdout juror had an agenda and was sympathetic to Arias.","The 34-year-old convicted murderer posed for a new mugshot this week after she was sentenced to life in prison for killing her ex-boyfriend .

"A tunnel could be built under Mount Everest as part of a new railway between China and Nepal, it has been revealed. Chinese state media has reported that the government is planning to expand the Qinghai to Tibet railway 'at Nepal's request' - which could include a tunnel under the world's tallest mountain - by 2020. The step is important politically as it shows Beijing building links with Nepal, a country India regards as firmly within its sphere of influence. A tunnel could be built under Mount Everest in the Himalayas as part of grand new plans announced by China . Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi visited Kathmandu in December and, according to Nepalese reports, said the line could eventually be extended to the Nepalese capital and further - creating a crucial link between China and the huge markets of India. 'The line will probably have to go through Qomolangma so that workers may have to dig some very long tunnels,' expert Wang Mengshu told the Chinese Daily newspaper, referring to Everest by its Tibetan name. He said that, due to the challenging Himalayan terrain with its 'remarkable' changes in elevation, trains on any line to Kathmandu would probably have a maximum speed of 120 kilometres per hour. The new plans underline China's increasing influence in Nepal, after years of improving the infrastructure of the nation. A map shows where the extension of the Qinghai-Tibet railway could be built - under Mount Everest . As well as building roads, it has invested billions of dollars in hydropower and telecommunications. Chinese tourism to Nepal, which is home to eight of the world's 14 peaks over 8,000 metres, is also climbing. Beijing's increasing role has raised alarms in New Delhi that China, already closely allied to Pakistan, is forging closer economic ties with Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Nepal in a deliberate strategy to encircle India. In an apparent counter-move, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged late last year that South Asia's largest economy would fund a series of regional investments and free up its markets to its neighbours' exporters. A train run along the existing Qinghai-Tibet railway towards Lhasa, capital of China's Tibet Autonomous Region . But India has struggled to compete with China's financial strength. Human rights groups have criticised China's plans to expand the rail network in Tibet. The International Campaign for Tibet has warned of the project's 'dangerous implications for regional security and the fragile ecosystem of the world's highest and largest plateau'. 'The Chinese government's claim that rail expansion on the plateau simply benefits tourism and lifts Tibetans out of poverty does not hold up to scrutiny and cannot be taken at face value,' ICT president Matteo Mecacci said in a statement last year.","Expansion of Qinghai-Tibet line would go under world's highest mountain .

"Acetaminophen is the main ingredient in the over-the-counter pain reliever Tylenol . Painkillers not only dull physical pain, but they can also dull your emotions. This is according to a new study that claims acetaminophen (paracetamol) - the main ingredient in the over-the-counter pain reliever Tylenol and paracetamol - has the ability to weaken feelings of happiness and sadness. Acetaminophen has been in use for more than 70 years, but this is the first time that this side effect has been discovered. Previous research had shown that acetaminophen works not only on physical pain, but also on psychological pain. This study takes those results one step further by showing that it also reduces how much users actually feel positive emotions, said Geoffrey Durso, lead author at the Ohio State University. 'This means that using Tylenol or similar products might have broader consequences than previously thought,' Durso said. 'Rather than just being a pain reliever, acetaminophen can be seen as an all-purpose emotion reliever.' Baldwin Way, an assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University said people in the study who took the pain reliever didn't appear to know they were reacting differently. 'Most people probably aren't aware of how their emotions may be impacted when they take acetaminophen,' he said. There were two studies of college students. The first involved 82 participants, half of whom took an acute dose of 1000 milligrams of acetaminophen and half who took an identical-looking placebo. They then waited 60 minutes for the drug to take effect. Participants then viewed 40 photographs selected from a database used by researchers around the world to elicit emotional responses. The photographs ranged from the extremely unpleasant, to the neutral and the very pleasant. After viewing each photo, participants were asked to rate how positive or negative the photo was on a scale of -5 (extremely negative) to +5 (extremely positive). Results showed that participants who took acetaminophen rated all the photographs less extremely than did those who took the placebo. The researchers don't know if other pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin have the same effect, although they plan on finding out in future research . They then viewed the same photos again and were asked to rate how much the photo made them feel an emotional reaction. Researchers are not exactly sure how Ty . The researchers don't know if other pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin have the same effect, although they plan on studying that question. Acetaminophen, unlike many other pain relievers, is not a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID. That means it not thought to control inflammation in the body. Whether that fact has any relevance to possible emotional effects of the drugs is still an open question, the researchers added. In this study, acetaminophen may have tapped into the sensitivity that makes some people react differently to both positive and negative life events. 'There is accumulating evidence that some people are more sensitive to big life events of all kinds, rather than just vulnerable to bad events,' Durso said. Results showed that participants who took acetaminophen rated all the photographs less extremely than did those who took the placebo. 'People who took acetaminophen didn't feel the same highs or lows as did the people who took placebos,' Way said. One possibility is that acetaminophen changes how people judge magnitude. Scientists claim acetaminophen may blunt individuals' broader judgments of everything, not just things having emotional content. The researchers did a second study in which they had 85 people view the same photos and make the same judgments of evaluation and emotional reactions as in the prior study. Participants in this second study also reported how much blue they saw in each photo. Once again, individuals who took acetaminophen had emotional reactions to both negative and positive photographs that were significantly blunted. But judgments of blue colour content were similar regardless of whether the participants took acetaminophen or not. At this point, the researchers don't know if other pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin have the same effect, although they plan on studying that question. Acetaminophen, unlike many other pain relievers, is not a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID. That means it not thought to control inflammation in the body. Whether that fact has any relevance to possible emotional effects of the drugs is still an open question, the researchers added. In this study, acetaminophen may have tapped into the sensitivity that makes some people react differently to both positive and negative life events. 'There is accumulating evidence that some people are more sensitive to big life events of all kinds, rather than just vulnerable to bad events,' Durso said.","It looked at acetaminophen (paracetamol), the main ingredient in Tylenol .

"An Iowa politician is on trial this week accused of sexually abusing his wife after doctors said she was no longer mentally capable of legally consenting to have sex. When Henry and Donna Lou Rayhons married seven years ago in their northern Iowa hometown, it was a second chance at love for the devoted couple, both previously widowed. But their domestic routine of church activities and political functions unraveled as Donna's health began to fail. Last year, the 78-year-old woman was moved into a nursing home, suffering from dementia and Alzheimers. According to Henry Rayhon's family, this was decided by her daughters from a previous marriage. Republican lawmaker Henry Rayhons, 78, is preparing to stand trial in Iowa for sexually assaulting his wife, who died last August, days before he was formally charged . Conflict developed over how to care for Donna Lou Rayhons, culminating in a meeting in which staff told Henry Rayhons that his wife was no longer mentally capable of legally consenting to have sex. State prosecutors say Henry Rayhons — a long-serving Republican state lawmaker — ignored that message. On Wednesday, he will stand trial for sexually assaulting his wife, who died last August. The charges were filed days after she died. Many couples experience the hardships of illness, mental decline and living apart, but what happened with the Rayhons has little precedent. Experts could not think of another rape case that happened because a previously consenting spouse could no longer legally acquiesce. 'This is the first one I've seen,' said Mark Kosieradzki, a Minneapolis-based attorney who has tried numerous cases of sexual abuse in nursing homes. 'It's a case that's going to be focusing on the rights of the vulnerable. Just because you're married, it doesn't mean you need to check your consent rights at the door.' Through an attorney, Donna Lou Rayhons' daughters declined to discuss the case. The state Attorney General's office also declined. And Henry Rayhons, who has said that he is innocent, refused an interview through a son. Henry and Donna Lou Rayhons married seven years ago in their northern Iowa hometown, but their domestic routine of church activities and political functions unraveled as Donna's health began to fail . Last summer, when the charges were first filed, Henry Rayhons' family released a statement. 'Donna's location did not change Dad's love for Donna nor her love for him. It did not change their marriage relationship. And so he continued to have contact with his spouse in the nursing home; who among us would not,' read the statement, which went on to call the charges 'illogical and unnatural.' The crux of the case is the question of Donna Lou Rayhons' ability to consent. Iowa law defines an act as sexual abuse in the third degree if the two parties are not living together as husband and wife and if one person 'is suffering from a mental defect or incapacity which precludes giving consent.' Elizabeth Edgerly, a clinical psychologist who serves as chief program officer for the nonprofit Alzheimer's Association, said determining capacity is challenging. 'Is the person capable of saying no if they don't want to do something? That's one of the biggest pieces,' said Edgerly, who frequently lectures on sexuality and Alzheimer's. Rayhons is charged with sexual abuse in the third degree and could serve up to ten years in prison if convicted . But Edgerly also noted that patients can vary day to day and said that physical closeness can be reassuring to many, noting: 'For most people with dementia, even long into the disease, they take comfort in being with people who love them.' Rayhons is charged with sexual abuse in the third degree and could serve up to ten years in prison if convicted. Shortly before the charges were filed, Rayhons withdrew from a race to serve a tenth term in the Iowa House of Representatives. The Iowa attorney general's office sought to move the trial out of Hancock County, where Rayhons lives, arguing that they would not be able to find an impartial jury after the extensive news coverage. But a judge denied the request. Court documents provide a window into the bitter case, which has left a blended family divided. In late March of last year, Donna Lou Rayhons moved to a nursing home in Garner. The clashes over her care built until a meeting in May during which Henry Rayhons was informed of his wife's inability to consent. Suffering from dementia and Alzheimers, Donna Lou Rayhons was moved into a nursing home by her daughters from a previous marriage last year and she died in August . According to court documents, Henry Rayhons entered his wife's room about a week later, pulled the curtains around her bed and a roommate heard noises that suggested sexual activity. As Rayhons left, he dropped undergarments in a laundry basket. Not long after that incident, one of Donna Rayhons' adult daughters went to court and won temporary guardianship. A state crime lab found semen stains on Donna Lou Rayhons' quilt and a sheet that matched Henry Rayhons' genetic profile. The charging document says he confessed to sexual activity that night, but in an interview last year on the Dr. Drew On Call show on the HLN network, his son Dale Rayhons said the police interview was taken out of context. Dale Rayhons said in a recent statement to The Associated Press that he supports his father, adding that: 'to have found love and companionship this late in their lives was an extraordinary and special thing for both Dad and Donna.'","Henry Rayhons, 78, is preparing to stand trial in Iowa for sexually assaulting his wife Donna Lou Rayhons .

"Dramatic footage has emerged of two separate houses being swept away by floodwater as wild weather wreaks havoc along the coast of New South Wales. One house was filmed as it was carried along a street in Dungog, in the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney. A Dungog resident filmed the half-submerged property drifting down the main drag as floodwater laps at its sides on his smartphone. Scroll down for video . A house in Dungog in NSW's Hunter Valley is seen washing away and was captured on a smartphone . Similar scenes were evident in Lake Macquarie with this house floating along the waterway . Footage shows the house floating dangerously close to street power lines and almost taking them down with it. Large pieces of debris are also seen bobbing up and down in the torrential waters. Local resident Jade Marie identified the house as her aunt's, according to Higgins Storm Chasers. She said that she had been helping her neighbours escape rising floodwaters but turned around to see water rising around the house. The mother said that she raced back inside to evacuate her partner and children just moments before the house dislodged and started floating away. Another recording of a house filmed far away from its usual address was taken by Tianna Brien, who spotted a houseboat being swept away in Toronto, near Lake Macquarie, west of Newcastle. She told the Newcastle Herald that at first she thought the home was a boat but then realised it was a houseboat. Ms Brien didn't recognise the houseboat and said that it had likely floated quite some distance. Jade Marie said it was her aunty's house that had been swept away, and she got back just in time to save her partner and her children before it was afloat . Ms Brien said at first she thought the house was a boat, but upon closer inspection realised it was someone's home . The houseboat was later anchored at at Fennell Bay, having passed under the bridge in the town's Main Road. Ms Brien said that she had to describe the incident to police several times and added: 'It was going pretty fast.' Three people have already died during the storms that continue to lash the Central Hunter region. Two men and one woman were trapped in the flood water that inundated the streets of Dungog, Fairfax Media reported. The intense weather conditions started on Monday, lashing the region with heavy rain and high winds. Numerous calls were received by emergency services for assistance, particularly in the Stroud and Dungog areas. A street in Rose Bay - in Sydney's east - was flooded after torrential rain fall throughout Monday . A fallen tree crashes through a white sedan in a Redfern street in Sydney's inner city while firefighters work to clean up . More than 20 people have been rescued from the flooding, and 215,000 homes and businesses are without power. State Emergency Service personnel and firefighters in Stroud, just north of Newcastle, have rescued 10 people from rooftops during the state's wildest weather in five years. There has been significant flooding and flash-flooding in Sydney, Newcastle and mid-north coast area, as a low-pressure system moved north from Sydney, affecting major roads and rail routes. Multiple persons trapped in vehicles, being trapped in buildings and being trapped on top of buildings while trying to take refuge from floodwaters,' SES deputy commissioner Steve Pearce said. 'There have been a whole range of calls.' The rescue missions are being shared between the SES, NSW Fire & Rescue and rural firefighters. Thousands of trees have fallen and hundreds of power lines are down. Ausgrid said 215,000 customers in Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter were without power as crews carry out emergency repairs to make fallen poles and wires safe. Amid the wild weather, firefighters have also dealt with 75 fires. While in Mortdale, in Sydney's south-west, trees have been uprooted from sidewalks . A ferry terminal at Parramatta has been completely inundated by water on Tuesday morning . At Gosford waterfront winds were so strong that boats were being pushing towards the shore . The SES is anticipating a lot more calls. 'This weather system isn't abating - we still have cyclonic winds in that area,' Mr Pearce said. 'We're still seeing massive amounts of rainfall and so it's going to be a challenging and busy afternoon.' The Bureau of Meteorology has recorded wind speeds up to 100km/h with gusts up to 130km/h. More rain and strong winds will continue into Tuesday evening as another low pressure system builds off the NSW coast. A NSW Fire & Rescue spokesman told AAP that Monday night was one of its busiest on record. Rescuers received more than 3,000 calls and responded to 1,000 storm-related incidents. A firefighter at Port Stephens who was hospitalised with head, neck and shoulder injuries after a tree fell on his truck is in a stable condition. Off-duty firefighters are being recalled to duty in Greenacre in Sydney's west before heading north to Newcastle and Lake Macquarie to help the SES.","A house in Dungog, in NSW's Hunter Valley, is filmed being swept away by floodwater .

"The inquiry into the Iraq war, lead by Sir John Chilcot, began in 2009, stopped taking evidence in 2011, but will not report until 2016, a source said . The findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the Iraq war are unlikely to be unveiled this year. Further delays to Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry into the war were reported by BBC’s Newsnight and will fuel claims those criticised over the war are trying to bury bad news. It was initially thought it would be delayed until after the general election amid claims it could be damning for Labour. But it has now been suggested the findings of the inquiry, which began in 2009, will not be published until 2016. Newsnight’s Diplomatic Editor, Mark Urban said he had been told the inquiry will be delayed until at least 2016. Tony Blair is expected to be come under intense scrutiny for sanctioning the ill-fated invasion. The former PM has denied that he was trying to obstruct the inquiry. Earlier this year, he apeared rattled when journalists put to him David Cameron’s claim, that Labour had got the publication delayed. He pointed to a statement released by his office which said: ‘It is not true to say that Tony Blair has caused the delay in the report’s publication’. Mr Blair is one of dozens who is believed to be criticised. Every one fingered has the right to respond to the dossier of evidence against them, often running to hundreds of pages. The inquiry - which stopped taking evidence in 2011 - was also set back by the death of one of its members and staff losses. The publication of the report was expected to be delayed until after the election as it is thought to be highly critical of senior political figures, including Tony Blair, but will likely not report until even later .","Sir John Chilcot's inquiry began in 2009, stopped taking evidence in 2011 .

"A nine-year-old boy was whipped with skipping ropes by his adoptive mother – for not knowing the story of Pinocchio. Photographs of the child, who was also beaten with metal rods and water pipes, have sparked outrage across China after they were shared online. His adoptive mother Li has been arrested on suspicion of child abuse after teachers at his school in Nanjing raised the alarm, says The People’s Daily. The nine-year-old boy was whipped with a skipping rope by his adoptive mother, leaving scars over his body . The 50-year-old had adopted the boy after when he was six after was given up by her cousin, who thought she was sending her child to a better life away from the deprived rural area in which they lived. Instead, shocking images show the child was covered in injuries – including cuts to his ear where he was hit with a metal rod and bruising on his legs and hands when he was smacked with a water pipe and scars all over his back. The abuse was first discovered by the boy’s school six months ago, but teachers assumed it was a one-off case and did nothing more about it. Photographs of the boy's horrific injuries were shared online as his adoptive mother was arrested for abuse . The 50-year-old woman told the boy's school she was 'strict' with him and was trying to correct his bad habits . When his form teacher noticed his injuries were getting worse and the boy was becoming withdrawn and afraid of people, authorities at the school questioned him more. He told them his adoptive mother had carried out the beatings when he didn't know the answers to questions about the children’s book Pinocchio, which she had asked him to study as extra-curriculum homework. The school contacted the woman, who admitted she was ‘strict’ with him and said she was only trying to correct his bad habits, and they contacted the Nanjing Public Security Bureau. The boy was away with his adoptive father during the Chinese Qing Ming festival when the revelations came to light, and they were brought back to Nanjing to protect the child. A statement on bureau’s website confirmed the mother had been arrested and they were investigating the case. The nine-year-old is now temporarily back with his biological parents, and a number of professional psychologists in Nanjing have been enlisted to offer the child support.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A couple who took their 14-year-old son out of school without permission for a five-day holiday to Spain were forced to pay a £1,230 fine after bailiffs were called in. They were originally fined £120 for the unauthorised absence from Sweyne Park School in Rayleigh, Essex, after being convicted in November 2014 of failing to ensure their child regularly attended school. After the unnamed family, of Hullbridge, Essex, appealed unsuccessfully against the fine and, after they did not pay, court bailiffs visited on March 6 demanding £1,230. A couple who took their 14-year-old son out of Sweyne Park School in Essex without permission for a five-day holiday to Spain were forced to pay a £1,230 fine after bailiffs were called in . The boy’s grandmother, from Benfleet, Essex, paid up to stop the bailiffs taking property to cover the amount owed. The grandmother, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The bailiff informed me that if the eye-watering fine of £1,230 wasn’t paid immediately they would force entry.’ They told her goods would be sold to cover £3,500 for the fine and charges and the parents would be jailed for three months. She added:  'He's a bright boy, my grandson, and he could easily hack five days off. 'He had never been in an aeroplane and my daughter wanted him to have the experience. 'Part of the problem is the tourism industry, which deliberately hikes up prices during the summer holidays. The grandmother, who asked not to be named, said: 'Part of the problem is the tourism industry, which deliberately hikes up prices during the summer holidays. It's quite a sober warning to other parents' 'It's quite a sober warning to other parents.' I know it was wrong to take him out of school, but the punishment was completely out of proportion. It was a bit Stasi.’ An Essex County Council spokesman said parents legally had to ensure attendance. They added: 'Where there is concern for a child's attendance, schools will work with the family to address the cause of the absence. 'The amendment in legislation in September 2013 made it clear that head teachers should not grant any leave of absence during term time unless there are exceptional circumstances.'","Originally fined £120 for the absence from Sweyne Park School in Essex .

"The parents of a five-year-old transgender boy are sharing their son’s story with the world in a bid to prove that there is no such thing as being ‘too young’ to identify as transgender. Massachusetts couple Mimi and Joe Lemay's son Jacob wasn't always a boy. The five-year-old was born Mia, the second of three sisters. But from a very early age, Jacob began rejecting his gender. And after years of questioning how to handle his preferences, before finally coming to terms with what their son wanted, the Lemays explained to NBC News that they decided to let their child assume the identity of a boy. Scroll down for video. Boys will be boys: Mimi and Joe Lemay's five-year-old son Jacob was born a girl named Mia, but the couple has now accepted that their child is a boy . Mimi and Joe began to notice that Jacob was having difficulties when he was a toddler. Then named Mia, he would insist on changing his clothes 10 to 12 times a day, in an attempt to find something he felt comfortable in, before his parents bought him a blue 'doggy sweater' that he wore for six months straight - often over girlier dresses and tutus. The couple assumed they were just raising a tomboy. 'She would take on ""boy"" personas, and just always want to play with boy things,' said Joe. 'Her need to play boy roles, and her need to be seen or spoken to as a boy at home became very persistent,' added Mimi. Then, shortly before he turned three, Jacob declared himself a boy. Happy family: Jacob was born the second of three daughters in the Massachusetts-based Lemay family . Finding the right wardrobe: From a young age, Jacob (R) preferred to wear boy clothes; when his parents still dressed him as a girl, the frustrated toddler would change outfits up to 12 times a day . Mimi said that she  was worried that Jacob's behavior would make it harder for him to build relationships - already, he had trouble relating to his peers - and she hoped her child's desire to be a boy would go away. In the meantime, she and Joe made allowances while Jacob wasn't in public. Home became a 'battleground over gender', Mimi wrote in a letter to Jacob on his fifth birthday, which was published by The Synapse, continuing that they decided to let Jacob cut his hair, wear boy clothes, and assume aspects of his male identity at home. While this made things easier when just family was around - his older sister eventually stopped teasing him about not being a 'real boy' - things were still hard at school, where Jacob didn't engage with his classmates. Jacob's parents explained that their son's behavior wasn't just that of a typical tomboy. Not content to just 'pretend' to be a boy, Jacob, then still called Mia, hated her body and would say things like: 'Why did god make me this way? Why did god make me wrong?' Trying to fit in: While he was still perceived as a girl, Jacob would only open up around his family and had trouble getting along with his peers . Accepting his identity: The Lemays eased into Jacob's transition, slowly allowing him to wear boy clothes, cut his hair short, and refer to himself as a boy at home . Mimi and Joe saw a glimpse of their future on an April 2014 trip to Disney World. They let Jacob wear a Prince Charming costume, and when strangers called him handsome he 'just glowed'. His mother said persistence, consistence, and insistence are the hallmarks of a possibly transgender child - and Jacob was demonstrating all three. In June 2014, the Lemays sat Jacob down and showed him a video about another transgender boy, Ryland Whittington. Tears in her eyes, Mimi told him: 'All we want is for you to be happy, but we need help to understand what will make you happy.' Joe asked Jacob if he wanted to be like Ryland and have everyone know he's a boy. 'I can't,' Jacob told them. 'I have to be Mia at school.' His parents told him that if he wanted to, he could start attending a new school in the fall. Jacob was elated, telling them, 'I want to be a boy always.' The Lemays began to let Jacob transition. Playing the prince: On a trip to Disney World last year, Jacob (pictured right with his sister Ella) was thrilled when strangers mistook him for a boy in his Prince Charming Costume . Happy kid: Since transitioning, Jacob has come into his own; he socializes and shows affection more since he has started to feel more like himself . Mimi says she and her husband didn't expect the 'seismic shift' in Jacob's behavior and personality that they experienced, but the boy completely came out of his shell. He immediately became more social, more affectionate, and more interested in picking up hobbies. 'He's just a different person. He's becoming himself,' said Joe. Watching how the change has affected Jacob has allowed his parents to see Jacob as he sees himself. 'I realized he had never really been Mia,' Mimi said. 'That had been a figment of my imagination.' The Lemays hope that coming forward to talk about their experience will help Jacob grow up in a society where there's a better perception of transgender people.","Mimi and Joe Lemay of Massachusetts say their son Jacob was never happy as a girl, adding that he has called himself a boy since he was two .
It took years and many emotional ups and downs before the couple finally decided to let him transition .
Now attending a school where everyone knows him as a boy, Jacob is the happiest and most outgoing he has ever been ."
"Apple founder Steve Jobs' widow Laurene has told of her admiration for Democratic White House front-runner Hillary Clinton. Ms Jobs, 51, called former First Lady Hillary a 'revolutionary' woman, and added that it's not just because she's a woman - but 'the type of woman she is'. Speaking to Time 100, Ms Jobs said: 'Hillary Clinton is not familiar. She is revolutionary. Not radical, but revolutionary: The distinction is crucial. She is one of America’s greatest modern creations. Laurene Jobs, pictured, widow of Apple's Steve, has strongly backed Hillary Clinton for president . Laurene Jobs said that Hillary Clinton, right, has 'judgment and wisdom' based on her public service . 'Her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities. Indeed, those same decades have conferred upon her what newness usually lacks: judgment, and even wisdom. 'It matters, of course, that Hillary is a woman. But what matters more is what kind of woman she is.' Mrs Clinton announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination on Sunday - and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet 'ordinary' voters in Iowa. But she was blasted for her 'staged' visit on Tuesday morning to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa. Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs Clinton, claimed the whole event was orchestrated 'from beginning to end'. STAGED: Clinton sat to talk with three young Iowans at a coffee shop on Tuesday – all of whom were driven to the event by her Iowa campaign's political director . NOT SO ORDINARY: Austin Bird is a Democratic Party insider who chauffeured Vice President Joe Biden around Davenport, Iowa in October during a pre-election campaign trip . Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour. The three got the lion's share of Mrs. Clinton's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a 'roundtable'– the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama's 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. 'What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,' Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. 'We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn.' The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. 'It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,' Bird recalled, 'to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says, ""Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her?""' 'And then we got in a car – Troy's car – and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us.' Bird said 'we all were called.' 'I mean, Troy asked us all to do – to go to a meeting with him. And we didn't really know what it was about. I mean, he did. He knew.' It's unclear how many Iowans featured in photographs with Clinton that rocketed around the country on Tuesday were planted. 'The mayor of LeClaire was there, and his wife was there,' Bird said, recalling the scene at the coffee shop. Price was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until a month ago. Clinton's team tapped him last week to be its political director in Iowa. He did not respond to a request for comment. Bird is a government and community relations coordinator at Genesis Health System in Davenport, Iowa, according to his LinkedIn profile. A coworker at Genesis said Wednesday that Bird is 'basically a lobbyist in training. That's what he wants to do.' Bird disagreed, saying his role was 'more public relations.' He's also an outspoken progressive whose Facebook wall shows he ordered a 'Hillary For President' bumper sticker 22 months ago. 'Is it 2016 yet?' he wrote in May 2013. Clinton's nascent campaign has carefully coordinated her image as a spontaneous, handshaking populist in her first days as a candidate, posing with Pennsylvanians at a gas station and venturing into an Ohio Chipotle restaurant for lunch. When no one recognized the former first lady – she was wearing sunglasses – the campaign leaked information to The New York Times so its reporters could get security-camera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voters. Scripting supposedly off-the-cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt Clinton especially hard since her gonzo road-trip journey to America's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold, calculating and politically venomous. And planting party insiders in place of typical Iowans won't go over well in the Hawkeye State, where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus votes is a quadrennial full-contact sport. ASTROTURF: Setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics, but Iowans take presidential contests seriously and could punish Clinton for the deception . THE FIXER: Bird said Troy Prince (left, pictured with VP Joe Biden), who was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until he left last month to help Clinton's statewide political effort, recruited him and others to attend the 'spontaneous' coffee meeting . Clinton's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as 'everyday' Americans who were actually partisans with political connections. One was even a former campaign manager for Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who mounted a failed bid for Texas governor last year. In LeClaire on Tuesday, Bloomberg and other outlets referred to Bird as a 'student' at St. Ambrose University, not as a hospital government-affairs staffer with Democratic party street-cred. He does study at St. Ambrose – part-time. But Bird's ties to the party are deep enough that his Facebook wall includes a photo of him standing in front of Joe Biden's limousine in Davenport. 'I was driving the Vice President when he was in town in October,' Bird noted in a Facebook comment. Biden was not there on official government business, but for a campaign stop in support of Democrat Bruce Braley. 'The Vice President will attend a grassroots event for Braley for Iowa with Representative David Loebsack,' according to White House press guidance for his October 27, 2014 schedule.","Laurene Jobs praised former First Lady Hillary Clinton .

"A mentally disabled Colorado man was sentenced to 100 years in prison Friday for the murder of a Montana teacher whose death highlighted the downsides of an oil boom that's sweeping across the remote Northern Plains, bringing thousands of newcomers to the area. Michael Keith Spell, 25, of Parachute, Colorado, was sentenced following a hearing before state District Judge Richard Simonton in Sidney. Spell pleaded guilty in October to killing Sherry Arnold, 43, after attempting to abduct the popular math teacher as she was jogging near her home in 2012. Arnold's body was found months later buried in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. Co-defendant Lester Van Waters Jr. was sentenced in December to 80 years in prison on a charge of deliberate homicide by accountability. Sentenced to die behind bars: Michael Keith Spell, 25, sits in state District Court in Sidney, Mont, Friday April 17, 2015, before being sentenced to 100 years prison for the 2012 murder of a 43-year-old teacher in the booming Bakken oil patch of Montana . Murdered at random: Sherry Arnold, a popular maths teacher from the small town of Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7 when she disappeared. She was pulled into a car by Spell and his friend, strangled to death, and then buried 50 miles away in North Dakota . Defense attorneys had asked that Spell be placed into custody of state health officials for placement in an institution for the mentally disabled. They claimed he was 'easily confused and displays the intelligence of an 11-year-old'. They said Spell's mental problems made him unable to conform to the law, making him eligible for commitment to the Montana Department of Health and Human Services. In the days before Arnold's killing, Spell and Waters traveled to Sidney from Colorado, using crack cocaine throughout their journey, according to authorities and the men's previous testimony. The defendants came to the region looking for work in the booming Bakken oil patch. During their trip, Waters allegedly told Spell that using crack ""brought the devil out in him"" and began talking about kidnapping and killing a woman, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors. Spell's attorneys alleged Waters threatened to kill Spell with a utility razor unless he went along with the kidnapping plan. After the pair spotted Arnold along a Sidney street, Spell tried to grab her, leading to a struggle in which Arnold was choked or otherwise asphyxiated, authorities said. Co-accused: Lester Van Waters (left) was sentenced to 80 years in December.  He and Spell (right-in 2012) were under the influence of crack cocaine when they kidnapped and murder Mrs Arnold . Killed: Michael Spell told investigators he pulled Sherry Arnold into a car and Waters choked her to death by before they buried her in a shallow grave on a farmstead near Williston . Spell said during an October change-of-plea hearing that he was unsure if he or Waters had killed Arnold. Arnold's body was found months after her disappearance in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. For Sidney residents, Arnold's death offered a horrifying illustration of the social upheaval caused by an energy boom that has turned the once-sleepy town into an oil patch hub. Crime has spiked in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota over the past several years as traffickers of methamphetamine and other drugs seek to profit off oil workers flush with cash, according to law enforcement officials. Spell was spared a potential death sentence after state health officials agreed with the defense that he was mentally disabled. Guilty: In this February 2012 photo, Michael Keith Spell, appears at a hearing in the Williams County Courthouse in Williston. Defense attorneys wanted Spell sentenced to an institution for the mentally disabled . Dearly missed: Rhonda Whited-Rupp holds a picture of her sister, Sherry Arnold, seen in a cowboy hat, and Arnold's family. Michael Keith Spell was sentenced to 100 years prison Friday for the murder of Mrs Arnold . But Simonton in May rejected arguments from the defense that Spell's history of low IQ scores, his difficulty reading and other mental problems rendered him incompetent to stand trial. Prosecutors recommended 100 years in prison and thus became Spell's sentence Friday. Defense attorneys Al Avignone and Lisa Banick said Friday's judgment will be appealed based on their continued belief that he was not fit for trial. If the state Supreme Court agrees, Spell would be committed to a state mental institution, Avignone said.","Sherry Arnold, a 44-year-old math teacher from Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7, 2012, when she was abducted .

"A married software executive who drugged a female employee in order to take naked pictures of her on a business trip has been jailed. Sexual predator Henri Morris was told he would serve 10 years behind bars for his 'calculated and choreographed' crime. The 67-year-old was caught in an FBI sting after investigators were approached by one of his victims in 2012. Henri Morris, 67, was jailed for 10 years after admitting drugging a female employee during a business trip in order to take naked photos of her . She told them that her drink was spiked by the married businessman after they traveled together from Houston, Texas, to New Jersey for work. The woman said when she woke up she was naked and her boss was standing over her and taking pictures on his mobile phone. The FBI arrested Morris at Bush County Airport after the woman, who has not been named, covertly worked with them. When his bags were search they found his 'kit,' which included strong sedatives and Viagra. A task force was set up to probe Morris and in total they found eight female employees who claimed to have been abused by him. His defense team initially tried to argue that the women all willingly drank to excess with clients and that no abuse had ever occurred. Ahead of his trial Morris pleaded guilty to a single charge of drugging and abusing a female employee, in exchange for prosecutors dropping other abuse charges. MarriedMorris of Houston, Texas, was the president of Edible Software Solutions . 'There is no way to adequately express my remorse and my abject humiliation,' Morris said during a 10 minute address at his sentencing hearing, according to the Houston Chronicle. 'I apologize to anyone who I have hurt and beg for their forgiveness.' US District Judge Melinda Harmon sentenced him to 10 years in federal prison without the possibility of parole. She also reportedly ordered that he spend the rest of his life under the supervision of the US Bureau of Prisons, according to the newspaper.","Henri Morris, 67, was the president of Edible Software Solutions .

"A 10 tonne 'fatberg' made up of congealed waste has been removed from a sewer underneath one of London's most exclusive streets. The enormous lump, which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes, was so heavy that it caused the 1940s sewer in Chelsea to break. Utility companies, including Thames Water, discovered the fatberg when local residents and businesses on Draycott Avenue and Walton Street started to complain about the rancid smell coming from the sewer. Scroll down for video . The 10 tonne fatberg, which was discovered beneath one of Chelsea's most exclusive streets after residents complained of a rancid smell . So far the waste removed from the sewer is the equivalent weight of about five Porsche 911s, which weigh 1.9 tonnes each. Now a £400,000 repair is being carried out to repair the broken sewer and already 22 metres of new piping has been replaced with another 17 metres left to go. Stephen Hunt, project manager for Thames Water said: 'The amount of fat we've had to remove has been staggering. 'Cheslea has done itself proud here - we see blockages all the time on household sewer pipes, which are about big enough for a cricket ball to pass through - but to have this much damage on a sewer almost a metre in diameter is mind-boggling. Thames Water, have now been forced to repair the old brick sewer, left, at a cost of £400,000 after it became damaged due to the fatberg . 'The original sewer has been so badly abused by fat being chucked down the plughole we've had to opt for the time consuming and disruptive option of replacing many metres of pipe. 'I'd urge the residents of Chelsea to consider what lurks beneath their feet - and when it comes to getting rid of fat - bin it, don't block it. Fatbergs – congealed fat which clumps together with other waste products to form concrete-style blocks – are becoming increasingly problematic for the capital's sewers. The enormous lump, which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes, was found beneath Draycott Avenue and Walton Street in West London, pictured . London's largest ever recorded fatberg, weighing in at 15 tonnes, was found in Kingston in August 2013. And last year workers spent four days removing a fatberg the length of a jumbo jet from a sewer in Shepherd's Bush. Among the most common causes of drain blockages are make-up and nappy wipes, fat and grease, chewing gum, dental floss, plasters and building debris. Staff from Thames Water usually use powerful suction equipment to break down the blockages and then high-powered water jets to clear the tunnels.","Residents in two exclusive Chelsea streets complained of a rancid smell .

"A British tourist has drowned in a pool in a luxury villa in Spain, just hours after arriving on holiday. Brian Nicol, 32, dived into a swimming pool at a luxury holiday villa in the Costa del Sol, where he was staying with friends, but failed to resurface. His desperate friends dragged Mr Nicol, who was born in Glasgow, out of the water and tried to save him. Brian Nicol, 32 from Glasgow, Scotland, died while staying in a villa in Nueva Andalucia like the one pictured . Police and paramedics arrived shortly after the incident took place around 8.30am on Easter Sunday morning, but Mr Nicol had died. Officers said early evidence suggests his death was a tragic accident, but they will try to establish whether he suffered a blow to the head or a digestion problems which meant he couldn't swim. The group had been on a night out in Marbella after jetting to Spain on Saturday, before returning to the rented villa in Nueva Andalucia to carry on partying around the pool. A post-mortem was due to take place on Monday morning at Malaga's Forensic Medicine Institute. A police spokesman said: 'The incident is still being investigated but all the evidence at this stage is pointing towards the death being the result of a tragic accident.' Mr Nicol is believed to have travelled to Spain with a group of a dozen friends, who rented a villa in the exclusive residential neighbourhood Nueva Andalucia. Mr Nicol is understood to have gone on a night out in Marbella, pictured, in the hours before he died . Sources close to the investigation said they had been told the group had gone out for the evening before returning to the villa to carry on partying around the pool. One said: 'Our understanding is the victim had dived into the pool and swum underwater two or three times during the night without any problem but failed to surface the last time he jumped in. 'Although he appears to have drowned, it's too early at this stage to say why it happened.' Forensic experts are expected to examine whether the dead man suffered a blow to the head or digestion problems which caused stomach cramps and may have led to him drowning. An investigating judge has been put in charge of a routine judicial probe into the incident. A spokesman for paramedics involved in trying to revive Mr Nicol said: 'We received a call at 8.40am on Sunday and found a foreign man lying by the pool when we arrived. Paramedics tried to revive him but could do nothing to save him. 'An investigation into the death is now underway.' The group has only arrived in the Costa del Sol, an area popular with British tourists, for a holiday on Saturday . Nueva Andalucia, the area where the tragedy happened, is a favourite of well-heeled British expats and holidaymakers. It is a short drive from the millionaire playground paradise of Puerto Banus and boasts several high-quality golf courses. Max Clifford owns a luxury apartment near to one of the courses Sean Connery was once a regular at. Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan also owns a holiday home in the upmarket residential area sandwiched between the Mediterranean and Marbella's famous La Concha mountain.","Brian Nicol, 32 from Glasgow, dived into a pool but failed to resurface .

"The man accused of murdering bride-to-be Stephanie Scott is like an invisible man in the small rural town he moved to just 13 months ago. Leeton has a close-knit community of only 6,700 people, but little is known of the casual school cleaner who has swept the halls of Leeton High School since October. The 24-year-old man charged with the murder of local English and drama teacher Ms Scott on Easter Sunday was born in Tasmania and lived in Holland with his family before returning to Australia as an adult. Vincent Stanford moved into a single-storey home with his mother and elder brother in Leeton, in the Riverina region of New South Wales, which is 550 kilometres south-west of Sydney and 450km north of Melbourne, with just a small bag of belongings each. His neighbours in Maiden Avenue say the family were welcomed by the community but Vincent Stanford made few connections. Scroll down for video . High school teacher Stephanie Scott (left) was at Leeton High School on Easter Sunday finishing off some lesson plans in preparation for going on her honeymoon to Tahiti . Vincent Stanford, the cleaner at Leeton High School, moved into this single-storey home with his mother and elder brother 13 months ago . Bill Scanlan, who lived next door to Stanford, told the Sydney Morning Herald: ‘He was a nice enough sort of bloke, clearly a loner.’ His wife Gail Scanlan told Daily Mail Australia Stanford was a ‘big strong fellow with dark, black eyes’ who she and her husband would chat to over the fence. She described him as a beautifully mannered and polite young man who wanted to get ahead in life. Mrs Scanlan said the accused and his family mostly kept to themselves but were friendly and 'would come over for a cup of coffee'. His mother Anika, a qualified nurse, worked at a local nursing home and Stanford, along with his brother Luke, worked shift work so Mr Scanlan said they did not see the family often. Meanwhile, as Stanford adjusted to life in Leeton, his identical twin brother – who moved from Holland back to Australia in June 2013 - settled in South Australia. Mr Scanlan, the retired pensioner living next door to  Stanford, confirmed on Friday that photographs of Stanford's twin that had circulated in the media were correct. ‘That’s definitely him. They really look identical. Vincent is a little broader and fatter in the face but you can’t mistake who it is,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘They look exactly the same in the face – the image of each other. He also has the same receding hairline. Looking at him is like looking at Vincent.’ Vincent Stanford's identical twin brother (pictured) returned from Holland and now lives in South Australia . Hinting at a possible family rift, the alleged killer’s twin wrote on Facebook on January 4: ‘One good thing about not being able to go home, been back to Swan Reach and Gawler for the first time in 4 years.’ Before moving back to Australia, Stanford - who speaks with a Dutch accent - previously worked as a cleaner for a dental company in Holland. In Leeton, he landed a casual job with cleaning company Colin Joss & Co, who have a contract with the Department of Education in NSW. Senior manager at the company Fleur Dooley told Daily Mail Australia that Stanford had worked for them since October last year.

"The Conservative and Labour parties will get a nearly identical number of votes in the general election, a new poll predicts.

"Ian Joll was missing presumed dead after he was forced to crash land his plane on a Dutch beach, but survived the incident to make it home to Gravesend . When Mabel Joll opened the front door to see her son Ian she fainted, believing she must have seen a ghost. Ten minutes earlier Mrs Joll had received a telegram telling her that her son, Squadron Leader Joll, was 'missing believed killed' after he crash-landed his plane on a Dutch beach during a strafing attack on a German aircraft in 1940. However Sq Ldr Joll had survived the crash and after trekking miles along a beach and persuading a ship to take him back to England, he had dropped in on his parents to say hello. His incredible story came to light as his medals - including the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) - were put up for auction and his background was revealed. Sq Ldr Joll  had been involved in a strafing attack on German aircraft on May 10, 1940, when his plane was hit by ground fire and he was forced to crash land his Bristol Blenheim light bomber. At an earlier briefing all crew had been told that under no circumstances should they allow the plane's secret interception radar to fall into enemy hands. After several unsuccessful attempts to set his Blenheim on fire, Sq Ldr Joll decided the only thing to do was to shoot into the plane's fuel tank. Sq Ldr Joll and his gunner then trekked for miles where they met a Dutch fisherman, who they persuaded to take them to England. Their journey to England took place just 16 days before the start of the evacuation of 300,000 Allied troops a few miles down the coast at Dunkirk. The vessel docked in Harwich, Essex, and Sq Ldr Joll travelled to his parents' house in Gravesend in Kent. Oliver Pepys, of Spinks auctioneers which is now selling Sq Ldr Joll's medals, said: 'His mother answered the door and promptly fainted. 'Not ten minutes before she had received a telegram from the Air Ministry stating that they regretted to have to inform her Pilot Officer Joll was missing believed killed. 'She must have thought she had opened the door to a ghost of her son. 'The authorities usually issued those telegrams fairly soon after a serviceman had gone missing and the tone of them was very much to fear the worst. 'Quite often news would eventually filter back that the missing person was in a prisoner of war camp somewhere. 'But for a relative to receive that dreaded telegram and then literally 10 minutes later that person show up alive is quite remarkable.' Sq Ldr Joll later rejoined his squadron at Manston. He served with 604 Squadron throughout the Battle of Britain, flying under the command of newly appointed Flight Commander, John 'Cat's Eyes' Cunningham. Sq Ldr Joll's medals (left to right) the Distinguished Flying Cross, 1939-1945 Star, with Battle of Britain Bar, Air Crew Europe Star, Defence and War medals and an Air Efficiency medal will be sold at auction . Just a few months later in November 1940  he had his second near death experience. His Blenheim aircraft iced up at 4,000ft and went into a spin. Two crewmen bailed out leaving Sq Ldr Joll to pull the plane out of the spin and land it safely. The squadron later upgraded to Beaufighter planes and just a year later in May 1941 he survived a third close shave, when his aircraft was attacked by a German Heinkel, seriously injuring his radar operator. Sq Ldr Joll nursed his comrade and took the stricken Beaufighter plane back to base. Sq Ldr Joll  went on to five 'kills', and was awarded the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross for service. In April 1942 Joll was posted to 153 Squadron, based at Ballyhalbert where he helped the unit convert to use Beaufighters. He later returned to his squad, 604, and was promoted to Flight Commander. Sq Ldr Joll went on to fly a Beaufighter night fighter (file pic) and shot down several Nazi planes . In November 1943 Joll worked alongside Lord Louis Mountbatten on planning the parachute landings for D-Day and also helped develop the giant panjandrum - a huge cable-laying drum powered by rockets intended to destroy German mines on the Normandy beaches. However this too almost ended in tragedy. Sq Ldr Joll helped organise a demonstration of the pajandrum for top military officials only for the weapon to veer out of control and head straight towards the assembled generals, admirals and air marshals, prompting them to flee. An article in the London Gazette, published in 1943, said: 'He is an exceptionally keen and skilful leader, whose personal example has been reflected in the high morale of the flight he commands. In spite of trying experiences, his enthusiasm remains unabated.' Joll's final posting was to New Delhi, working for the Directorate of Combined Operations. This time he was involved in the planning for the invasion of Burma. After the war he married wife Eileen who served as an ambulance driver during the Second World War and was no stranger to dangerous situations herself. In 1941 she helped transport a new false leg that was dropped by arrangement over a Luftwaffe base in France so it could be given to disabled flying legend Douglas Bader, who was being held prisoner. Sq Ldr Joll died aged 57 in 1977. His widow passed away last year aged and now his medals are being auctioned by Spinks in London for an estimated £9,000 on April 23.","Ian Joll was a Squadron Leader who flew a Bristol Blenheim light bomber .

"It is a conversation that will be familiar to couples across the country. What one spouse thinks is a 'discussion', the other understands they are being over-ruled. In a joint interview with his high flying lawyer wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, Nick Clegg revealed the balance of power lies where many long suspected: with her. After the last election, Mr Clegg was given the option of moving his family into a grace-and-favour government mansion - but the move was vetoed by his wife. After controversies over David Cameron's large country kitchen and Ed Miliband's small second kitchen, the couple invited the cameras into the kitchen of their £1.5million family home in Putney, south west London for ITV's Tonight programme. Scroll down for video . Home: In a revealing joint interview, Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg (pictured) admitted his wife Miriam (right) makes the big decisions in their household . Mr Clegg is seen in the documentary drinking wine as his wife explains why she chose not to move her family into a government property . They revealed why they decided to remain with their three sons Antonio, Alberto, and Miguel, in the family home instead of making the move to Whitehall. Miriam, who uses her maiden name Gonzalez Durantez, told ITV News Political Editor Tom Bradby: 'We had a lot of pressure at the time to go to one of the houses of the government. 'We discussed and thought the best thing would be for the children to stay here. Revealingly, Mr Clegg quipped: 'Discussion's a rather grand word for Miriam basically saying no.' But he quickly added: 'You were so right, you were so right.' However, the couple believe that choosing to remain in their family home has stopped them from becoming cut off from the rest of the world. Mrs Clegg said: 'If you look at it with perspective it has been the best decision for all of us and if I may, also for Nick as well because you can see how politicians sometimes can get in a bubble and be completely distant from normal society and I think if you’re in your house in your neighbourhood, it’s much easier really.'

The couple believe that choosing to remain in their family home has stopped them from becoming cut off from the rest of the world . Asked how they coped with the 'terrific kicking' given to her husband she said she didn't take it 'too seriously'. 'Just like any other marriage, we just stand together and it's not any more of a difficulty than what many others have to go through and you know. You should never take it too seriously.' And if he wanted five more years Mr Clegg said: 'Ten, 15, 20 why not! In for a penny, in for a pound.' He also insisted he felt more full of 'vim and vigour' than he did in the start of the coalition. Focus groups conducted by the programme found Mr Clegg was characterised as the 'chihuahua in a handbag' of the government. When asked what kind of drink he was the participants settled on Babycham.

Mr Clegg sought to explain why his relations with the Prime Minister always seemed to be so cordial. He said: 'If you know you disagree with someone, there's no tension. I suspect meetings between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were so fractious because they kind of should have agreed but they didn't. 'When David Cameron and I sit in a meeting, as we do week in week out, we kind of know that our starting point is that we come from different vantage points...' He claimed not to read all newspapers, and had learned how to ignore attacks form his opponents. 'It sounds glib but I actually think you can't take it too seriously otherwise you spend all your time reacting to stuff and you just have to laugh at it because some of it is faintly silly.' Mrs Clegg added that their close bond as a family has protected from the political brickbats. 'From my point of view if I spend my time thinking about whatever a specific person may has said, I don't have any time to do what I want to do. I think that helps most is that we are very together and that we have a very close environment of family and friends and I feel very protected.'

"The son of a Syrian imam who was shot dead on a London street may have met his father’s killer just days before the murder. Sources close to the investigation, which is being led by the counter-terrorism unit, told the Sunday Times that Abdul Hadi Arwani, an opponent of Syrian President Bahsar Al-Assad, had visited the area where he was killed with his son days before his death. Arwani, 48, was shot and killed in his car on a quiet street in North West London after being called there last Tuesday, apparently to provide a quote for building work. Scroll down for video . imam, Abdul Hadi Arwani (pictured), was called to a job in the area he was killed days before his death . When the imam, who had links to the Muslim Brotherhood in the UK and abroad, arrived to the house with his son and not on his own, the supposed potential client asked Arwani to come back another day. The man was identified as black and speaking with an African accent. He pretended to have lost his keys which is why he asked Arwani, a part-time builder, to return later. The Sunday Telegraph reported that the man, who has not been otherwise been identified, also told the imam that there was no need for his son to accompany him again when he did come back. Arwani's children are in little doubt their father was killed by the man asking for the building quote. Scotland Yard is looking into whether the man was a hired killer who postponed the hit because because Arwani was not alone. The counter-terrorism unit has special expertise relating to politically motivated assassinations but they are also keeping other lines of inquiry open. Aspects of Arwani’s personal life as well as his financial standing are being considered. The Syrian-born activist and imam died of multiple gunshot wounds to the chest sustained near to the junction of the Paddocks and Greenhill, Wembley. His car was parked on what has been described as a blind bend, just out of sight of CCTV. Home: Mr Arwani, originally from Syria, lived in this home in White City, west London . Arwani’s VW Passat was parked neatly on the side of the road with its engine still running and one window wound down when his body was found . Neighbours, nearby at the time of the murder, have said they did not hear any shots fired, indicating, perhaps, that the killer used a silencer. Arwani’s VW Passat was parked neatly on the side of the road with its engine still running and one window wound down when his body was found. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political group to which Arwani had long-standing links, is outlawed in many Middle Eastern countries. One Syrian opposition activist has said despite Arwami’s standing and his participation in protests against the Assad regime in London in 2012 (pictured) the imam was an unlikely target for assassination . One of the imam’s friends was quoted as saying that Arwani left the group in an official capacity ‘seven or eight years ago’ but had kept ties with some of the group’s senior figures. One Muslim Brotherhood leader, Ali Sadraddine Al-Bayanouni attended a gathering in remembrance of Arwani in the capital last week. Described as ‘non-violent Islamist’ by his family Arwani had links to a number of controversial preachers. Among them was Abu Qatada, deported to Jordan and dubbed Osama Bin Laden’s man in Europe. Arwani also campaigned against the extradition of the hook-welding preacher Abu Hamzr for offences related to terrorism. Despite the connections there is nothing to suggest Arwani was anything more than a peaceful moderate. Leaving Syria in 1982 during the last, failed uprising against the Assad regime, Arwami moved to Britain in the mid 1990s. He studied Islamic Sharia in Jordan where he claimed to have been sentenced to death in his absence by Syrian authorities. One Syrian opposition activist has said despite Arwani’s standing and his participation in protests against the Assad regime in London in 2012 the imam was an unlikely target for assassination. Imam: Mr Arwani was a preacher at the An-Noor Mosque (pictured) in Acton, West London, which has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers . Hassan Anywabwile (pictured) from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Arwani at the An-Noor Mosque . Bassam Tablieh, a solicitor and opponent of the Syrian government, said there were many more obvious, high priority targets for Syrian authorities to go after in London. Police are also looking into a row over finances and transparency which led to Arwani being ousted from the An-Noor mosque in Acton where he was imam up until 2011. He was replaced at his mosque by a Caribbean preacher involved in an attempted coup d'état 25 years ago. Hassan Anywabwile from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Arwani at the An-Noor Mosque. Anywabwile's name appears in the Caribbean nation's parliamentary documents surrounding a violent coup attempt in 1990 by Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeen It is understood that Arwani wanted to register the mosque as a charity with trustees, moving it away from its current status whereby the Acton mosque operates as a company. While the building for the mosque was bought for £1 million, raised in contributions from a number of members of the community, land registry records state the sole owner to be Khalid Rashad, one of the mosque’s founders, through a firm called ‘Brickridge’. The murdered imam had reportedly begun legal proceedings in the high court over the dispute. Rashad, 61, a Muslim convert from Wembley refused to comment on the row or Arwani’s decision to leave the mosque. He referred to a statement that expressed ‘great sadness’ at the imam’s death. It has not been suggested that any members of the mosque were involved in the murder.","Imam Abdul Hadi Arwani called to a building job in the area he was killed .

"A man who killed his friend, stuffed the body into a suitcase and threw it into a canal has been jailed for 19 years. Lorenzo Simon, 34, of Smethwick, West Midlands, and his girlfriend Michelle Bird used their friend Michael Spalding for slave labour before Simon killed him and dismembered his body. The 39-year-old's remains were stuffed into two suitcases before Simon and Bird threw them into Birmingham Canal, a court heard. Scroll down for video . Lorenzo Simon, (left) who killed Michael Spalding (right) before stuffing the body in a suitcase and throwing it into a canal, has been jailed for a minimum of 19 years . Police have now released CCTV video footage showing the pair dragging the cases along a pavement. Simon was found guilty of murder at Birmingham Crown Court today and Bird, while being acquitted of the same charge, was convicted of assisting an offender and sentenced to two and a half years. At a sentencing hearing, Mrs Justice Thirlwall told Simon: 'You had no thought for him at all. Your focus, as so often in your life, was on what was best for you.' Simon initially denied knowledge of Mr Spalding's death, claiming he threw him out following a row over a car crash, but later admitted assaulting him during a fight after police found tiny blood droplets on the flat's lounge wall. Neighbours reported seeing a bonfire in the rear garden following Mr Spalding's disappearance - a heat so intense it melted UPVC guttering fascias - and forensic examination of debris from an oil drum showed it to be part of the victim's humerus bone. Michelle Bird (pictured) was convicted of assisting an offender and sentenced to two and a half years . Police divers recovered the second case - containing the victim's head, limbs and tools - below Pope Bridge, Smethwick, on May 16 and further searches of the canal bed uncovered a hacksaw. Using futuristic 3D scanning technology - developed through a pioneering project with Warwick University - experts were able to show a perfect fit between the charred bone and a severed limb found in the suitcase. And the same scanning proved a link between the hacksaw and lacerations found on other bones. Drag marks were also found on the towpath near where the pair dumped the suitcases into the canal. Detective Inspector Harry Harrison from West Midlands Police said: 'Michael was exploited in life by Lorenzo Simon and Michelle Bird and they afforded him no dignity in death. On the contrary, they treated him in the most despicable manner in order to conceal their crime. 'Simon accepted Michael as a tenant on the agreement he used his considerable handyman skills to do up the flat. But he treated him like a slave, working him past midnight and then waking him early in the morning to continue working. 'They were only allowed out with his say-so and given just one meal a day - usually pizza and chips. 'Michael finally broke and complained at their treatment - we believe that, combined with a car accident where Simon accused him of being responsible for damaging his VW Passat, led to the fatal attack. 'Simon said he hit Michael in the back and that he fell to the floor dead within seconds and claimed to have disposed of the body in panic. 'Bird said she was on an errand to buy alcohol at the time of the killing but later admitted helping her boyfriend in the aftermath. The 39-year-old's remains were stuffed into two suitcases before Simon and Bird threw them into Birmingham Canal. Police have now released CCTV video footage showing them dragging the cases (circled in red) 'However, we were able to provide compelling evidence to the jury that this was a vicious murder and that Simon went to considerable lengths to try and cover his tracks.' Mr Spalding had been living at the Oxford Road address for almost three weeks and was under the impression a good renovation job would help him land his own tenancy with the landlord. However, Simon blamed the father-of-three for a collision in mid-April that left his VW Passat with front end damage - and told him the crash ended his hopes of securing his own place and jeopardised their own tenancy arrangement. Mr Spalding last spoke to his partner, who moved out to be with family in Tamworth, at 10pm on April 25 and police suspect he was murdered later that night or the following day. Mr Spalding's body parts were found inside this suitcase, which was dumped in the Birmingham Canal . A second suitcase (pictured) containing Mr Spalding's remains was discovered 11 days later . The black suitcase containing the victim's torso was first spotted on May 5 floating in the water near Pope Bridge by a narrow boat owner. It was seen on several subsequent occasions by canal users before a contractor, suspecting the case contained a dead animal, towed it to Icknield Port yard on May 12. Unemployed Simon - who has convictions for robbery, burglary, theft and drug supply - moved to Derby in a bid to evade police when news of the body find broke - but was arrested with Bird on May 19 and charged two days later. Detectives later heard accounts from neighbours in Oxford Road who told of 'aggressive, nasty' arguments coming from the flat. When police raided the home, parts of a humerus bone were discovered inside this charred drum . 3D scanning technology was able to prove a link between this hacksaw and lacerations found on Mr Spalding's bones . The remains of Michael Spalding were found in a canal in Ladywood, Birmingham on May 12 last year . One recalled Simon saying: 'I want this place finished - I've got to live here, you are taking the p**s' to which Mr Spalding replied 'I'm tired, I'm hungry, I want to go home. I've been at it all day'. A pathologist deemed a number of weapons were used to dismember the body, including knives, a saw and possibly a heavy bladed weapon like an axe. The post mortem examination was unable to confirm the precise cause of death but it is suspected Mr Spalding died from a stab wound to the neck, evidence of which was subsequently destroyed.","Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced tenant Michael Spalding to decorate his flat .

"Pupils applying to Cambridge University may have to take an entrance test next year for the first time in almost 30 years. Tutors are deciding whether to bring back the exams, which would be designed to select the exceptional applicants. The university said recent changes to the exams system made it more difficult to decide which students to admit. Pupils applying to Cambridge University may have to take an entrance test next year for the first time in almost 30 years . According to trade magazine Schools Week, documents presented to senior tutors say the university is ‘being forced’ into changing its system of using AS-levels to assess applicants. The paper says that GCSEs ‘will not give us a reliable measure’ due to their ongoing reform and that ‘schools’ predictions of grades will be next to useless’. At present, the university uses unified mark scheme (UMS) scores calculated from students’ performance in their AS-levels - which are known when they apply to university - to decide which applicants are invited to interview. But under coalition reforms planned to ‘toughen up’ the qualifications, AS exams will be optional for cohorts starting this September and scores will no longer contribute to the overall A-level. The Labour party has pledged to halt the changes and retain AS-levels. University departments have now been asked for their views on a ‘main proposal’ to reintroduce the tests from the 2016-17 admissions round. Under coalition reforms planned to ‘toughen up’ the qualifications, AS exams will be optional for cohorts starting this September . Mike Sewell, director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, said: ‘In the light of the recent A-level reforms, the university is in the process of considering all options available so that we may continue meeting our goal of admitting the best and brightest students from all backgrounds.’ Oxford University already uses subject-specific aptitude tests. Most of its admission tests are organised by the Admissions Testing Service. The disclosure has been met with concern by school leaders, who said institutions with fewer resources may not be able to properly equip pupils for the tests. Eddie Playfair, principal of Newham Sixth Form College, London, said: ‘There’s a danger students in smaller sixth forms don’t have the same resources and might lose out. 'It could be one more barrier in the way.'","Pupils applying to Cambridge University may have to take an entrance test .

"Two property developers branded 'arrogant and greedy' by a judge have been jailed after a three-storey building collapsed trapping three people in the rubble. A doctor's wife and a student plunged from the living rooms of their flats into the basement below  and a workman was buried after a digger struck a load-bearing column. The accident left three victims hospitalised with minor injuries, while 20 students were left homeless and one of Sheffield's main arterial roads was closed for a day. Most of the students who lived in flats above the development in the Brook Hill area of the South Yorkshire city were luckily out at the time and missed the accident. Jailing brothers Naveed and Rizwan Hussain for 12 months each today, Judge Michael Murphy told them: 'It was only by the grace of God or good fortune that people were not seriously injured or killed. 'If a member of the public had been passing by they would have said ""How on earth was no-one killed in that?"" There was potential for a complete disaster. It was caused by your arrogance and greed.' Before: Students and a doctor and his wife lived above the retail premises in Sheffield until the 2013 incident. Three people were injured and the building's collapse caused the main road to be closed off . After: But the building was left looking like it had been hit by a bomb after botched work by landlords Naveed and Rizwan Hussain, who were jailed for health and safety offences today . Officers from the Health and Safety Executive spent two years and £150,000 investigating the collapse and bringing the defendants to justice for what was called a 'flagrant disregard' of Health and Safety regulations. Sheffield Crown Court heard that neither city landlord Naveed, 33, or Rizwan, 39, had any building experience, qualifications or planning permission for the structural works they were carrying out. Rizwan, who managed the shop in the building, and Naveed, the landlord of the flats above, were hoping to extend and reopen a former Indian restaurant on the site. Nigel Lawrence, prosecuting, said the flats above the retail premises were occupied by Sheffield University students as well as a doctor and his wife. A builder and a structural engineer were consulted over plans to lower the floor level and make the restaurant open-plan but the brothers then dispensed with their services. Although a planning application was submitted, permission had not been grantedwhen construction work on the restaurant started about four weeks before the collapse in March 2013. The student tenants complained about cracks in their walls and noise from drilling and machinery but Rizwan told them the restaurant would be open within four months and he would offer them jobs there. Naveed brought in an excavator and began removing rubble with the help of an odd-job man while Rizwan instructed other workmen. Pillars and internal walls were removed. Firemen had to make the building safe after the wall and upper floors caved in in March 2103 . The work meant a main road in Sheffield was closed off. The section of the building was later demolished . As the work progressed, the doctor confronted Naveed in the basement and was shocked to see the underside of the laminate floor in his flat above supported only by steel beams with large areas of wall removed. 'He asked Naveed if he and his wife should vacate the flat but Naveed assured him this was not necessary,' said Mr Lawrence. A week later student Kishore Chandrasekaran was in his flat when the wall and the floor collapsed, dropping him down onto a pile of rubble in the basement. He was trapped by his right leg but a table which fell on top of him protected him from falling debris. It was half an hour before he managed to struggle free. Doctor's wife Khushboo Shah was sat on the sofa in her lounge. 'She heard a noise like hailstones and the floor beneath her fell away and she fell to the basement together with a section of the building', said Mr Lawrence. She fell on the rubble and was covered in dust as well as being struck by falling pieces of wood. Both the first and second floors of the buildings collapsed and Naveed himself freed the handyman, known only as Mr Raja, from the rubble. The students lost their passports and laptops and their deposits on the flats were not returned. The part-ruined buildings were demolished by Sheffield City Council on safety grounds - with the taxpayer picking up the bill. Before the incident, two storeys of flats sat above the premises the brothers were trying to convert . An independent structural engineer called in to examine the mess said the work was 'inherently dangerous and a serious accident was foreseeable.' Mr Lawrence said: 'It was a miracle that nobody was either killed or seriously injured. It was pure good luck that most of the tenants were out of their homes and no member of the public was nearby.' David Webster for Naveed, a father-of-four who was convicted last year of unlawfully evicting a tenant, said the work was not 'wholly cavalier' from the outset but a measure of cost-cutting overtook prudence. 'The work was done with a highly reckless disregard not only for the safety of others but to my client himself,' he said. 'If there was anybody at the greatest risk it was the one who was in the basement. 'This was hamfisted, clueless, directionless and haphazard rather than calculated maliciousness in bringing down a building. His folly was to think he could turn his hand to this major project without any relevant training or experience.' James Horne, for Rizwan, said his involvement was confined to running the shop in the buildings owned by his father Sabir Hussain. The court heard had no financial interest in the flats and the intention was for the work to be done properly. Now builders are trying to completely re-build the premises after huge disruption caused by the accident . The court heard the father-of-seven had taken out a £488,000 bridging loan on the restaurant project guaranteed by properties belonging to his brother and was currently working as a chef. Naveed and Rizwan both admitted two offences contravening HSE regulations in failing to ensure themselves and their employees were not exposed to risk and failing to take steps to prevent danger to another person. Rizwan also admitted breaching a prohibition notice. As well as being jailed, Naveed was fined £40,000 and Rizwan was given a £42,000 fine. Naveed was ordered to pay £60,000 costs and Rizwan £40,000 costs. Judge Murphy told the brothers that their breaches of the regulations were 'blatant and financially motivated'. He said: 'People were terrified and there was inconvenience to untold numbers of people in Sheffield. The potential for disaster was staring everyone in the face apart from you.'","Completely unqualified brothers were trying to create an Indian restaurant .

"Former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne this morning announced he would back Labour at the next election – just a week after backing the Tories. The millionaire businessman said Ed Miliband’s plan to scrap the controversial ‘non-dom’ status had won him over. He tweeted: 'Ed Milliband says he will abolish non-dom status in UK. This gets my vote I never thought any party would have courage to do this.' Scroll down for video . Duncan Bannatyne said Ed Miliband’s plan to scrap the controversial ‘non-dom’ status had won him over . It comes after the hotelier signed a letter from more than 100 business leaders backing the Tories’ economic record. The letter claimed that the 'Conservative-led Government has been good for business' and backed the cut in corporation tax to 20 per cent. Mr Bannatyne’s inclusion on the list was deeply damaging for Labour – having previously been one of the party’s most high profile backers. The TV star helped unveil a 'seaside manifesto' with Gordon Brown before the 2010 general election. But he announced this morning that Mr Miliband’s planned raid on the super-rich – announced this morning – has convinced him to return. Speaking in Coventry this morning, the Labour leader promised that the 200-year-old rule for non-doms, which applies to around 116,000 people, makes Britain an 'offshore tax haven for a few' and can 'no longer be justified'. Former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne this morning announced he would back Labour at the next election – just a week after backing the Tories . Speaking in Coventry this morning, Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed the 200-year-old 'non dom' rule makes Britain an 'offshore tax haven for a few' and can 'no longer be justified' The Tories warned the plan could cost Britain 'hundreds of millions of pounds' and stopped short of scrapping the rules, despite Labour's claims. Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas. They must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home. But Mr Miliband said that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. Mr Miliband said everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. He will pledge to abolish the non-dom status from April 2016. The status, which is unique to the UK having been introduced by William Pitt the Younger in the late 18th century, is used by more than 110,000 wealthy people. Mr Bannatyne was one of the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's most prominent backers - and was wheeled out ahead of the 2010 election (above) to boost the party's business credentials . Mr Miliband said non-dom status results from a discredited belief that 'anything goes for those at the top and that what is good for the rich is always good for Britain'. He said: 'There are people who live here in Britain like you and me, work here in Britain, are permanently settled here in Britain like you and me, but aren't required to pay taxes like you and me because they take advantage of what has become an increasingly arcane 200-year-old loophole. 'There are now 116,000 non-doms, costing hundreds of millions of pounds to our country – it can no longer be justified, and it makes Britain an offshore tax haven for a few.' Non-dom status is often inherited through the father so can apply to people who were born in Britain. David Cameron - in Cornwall with his wife Samantha last night - has been accused of defending special rules for the rich . They must pay an annual fee, of up to £90,000, to take advantage of the rules, which means it is only of us to the very wealthy. Newspaper reports overnight suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But today it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the General Election on May 7. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it should be around two or three years - not the five suggested in some reports. But it emerged that when he was a Treasury minister in the last Labour government, Mr Balls insisted that 'the majority of non-domiciled individuals who had already left the UK spent no more than five years here'. Chancellor George Osborne said Labour's proposals amounted to 'tinkering around the edges' not an outright ban. 'Either they are going to abolish non-dom status altogether which would cost our country hundreds of millions of pounds in lost tax revenues and lost investment - the reason they did nothing on this during 13 years in office,' Mr Osborne said. 'Or they are just tinkering around the edges and making small adjustments to the rules on how long people can be non-dom. 'This confusion is another reminder of why they can't be trusted with our economy.' The Lib Dems said the number non-dom numbers 'exploded' under the last Labour government and more than doubled while Mr Miliband was an adviser in the Treasury. Mr Balls told BBC Radio 4's Today that circumstances had changed and there was now a large budget deficit to cut. 'People were saying in the middle of the last decade this will lead to people leaving the country. It's not actually turned out to be the case,' he said. 'The abuse is bigger than we thought. These rules are ridiculous, they are unfair, they are being abused, and I think it's time to act. 'These were introduced in the period of the Napoleonic wars to allow people who were earning money in the colonies not to pay tax in the UK. 'That's fine, it's a different world now, a different time, different choices.'","Millionaire businessman backs Labour's plan to scrap 'non-dom' status .

"A woman who may be a 'possible DUI driver' led the California Highway Patrol on a slow-speed chase, and even stopped at traffic lights, through Los Angeles for almost an hour, officers said. The CHP became aware of the woman after someone called 911 to report there was an erratic driver in a black SUV on a freeway in Orange County around 12:30pm Wednesday.

The chase finally came to an end in Pasadena  when one patrol officer tapped the rear bumper of the woman's SUV and sent the car into a slow spin. The woman then exited her vehicle and raised her hands up . Unlike typical police chases, the woman wasn't speeding and was driving at 35 and 40mph, CHP officer Juan Galvan told KTLA. The woman stopped for red lights, but Galvan said she was weaving in and out of traffic lanes and failed to yield when authorities tried to stop her. Patrol officers left their vehicles twice after she halted at two stoplights, but continued their pursuit when she kept on driving, according to NBC Southern California. The chase finally came to an end around 1:15pm when one patrol officer tapped the rear bumper of the woman's SUV - known as a pursuit intervention technique. This sent the car into a slow spin. The woman then exited her vehicle and raised her hands up. She was taken into custody without incident. The woman was 'possibly a DUI driver' and authorities are currently determining whether alcohol or drugs were a factor in her behavior, according to CHP Officer Edgar Figueroa.

"Relatives of Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are refusing to accept that he was behind the marathon terrorist attack and want his defense lawyers fired. The convicted bomber's aunt, Maret Tsarnaeva, and two other relatives told Time in an interview this week in Chechen capital, Grozny, that they believed he was wrongly convicted as part of a conspiracy by the U.S. The bomber's uncle, Said-Hussein Tsarnaev, told the magazine that 'American special services' orchestrated the 2013 terrorist attack which left three dead and hundreds more wounded. Scroll down for video . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's aunt, Maret Tsarnaeva, claimed in an interview this week that her nephew Dzhokhar (right) had been wrongfully convicted in the Boston bombing as part of a U.S. conspiracy . Martin Richard, who was killed in the bombings, is seen (front circle) just meters away from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (back circle) on April 15, 2013.Seconds later, one of two bombs exploded, piercing his body with shrapnel . The family members could offer no evidence to back up their allegations. Tsarnaev was found guilty by a Boston jury on April 8 of all 30 counts - 17 of them carrying the death penalty - in connection to the deadly April 2013 attacks. The relatives have also attempted to get messages to Tsarnaev, urging him to fire his defense lawyers. However it appears that this request was now at odds with Tsarnaev's mother, who ranted in the wake of his guilty conviction on April 8 that her mass-murderer son is 'the best of the best'. The family is at war over whether to keep the defense team, including attorney Judy Clarke, who were attempting to prevent Tsarnaev being sentenced to the death penalty. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva 'would not listen to reason', the relatives told Time. The mother has continued to insist that Dzhokhar and his late brother Tamerlan were innocent, a position she has upheld since the brothers were pinpointed as the perpetrators of the atrocity two years ago. Zealot: Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat (pictured left in April 2013) sent a text message (right) of support in response to her surviving son's guilty verdict saying America was the real terrorist . A sketch shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (second left) and his defense team as the guilty verdicts on all charges against him were read on April 8. The jury will now decide if he gets the death penalty . In a text message to her son's supporter, Timur Rudaev, Mrs Tsarneava called the convicted killer 'my precious boy' before going on a rant against the US. 'America is the real terrorist and everyone knows that,' she wrote in the text, which was later shared on the Russian social media site VKontakte and sent to the news site Vocativ. 'My boys are the best of the best,' Mrs Tsarnaev added. She effusively thanked everyone who have been helping her family over the past two years and vowed to keep them in her thoughts. 'May God reward them for supporting my precious boy,' the mother wrote. Rudaev, a resident of Grozny, Chechnya, uploaded Mrs Tsrarnaev's text onto a VKontakte group called Help Dzhokhar Tsrarnaev, which he reportedly launched back in 2013. Zubeidat Tsranaev's statement was accompanied by Rudaev’s rambling rant about Dzhokhar’s guilty verdict in Boston. 'Today, foolish Americans completely shattered the life of a great guy!' Rudaev wrote in Russian. 'But no trial, no jury could trample our opinions, only the Almighty has power over us! Only the Almighty knows the outcome of this trial... we hope the merciful Allah will give Dzhokar a second chance!' Rudaev went on saying that he hopes that in the near future, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, will gather everyone at her home to celebrate Dzhokar's release. 'Everyone will be ruffling his hair and telling him, ''Brother, you persevered, you put the Americans in their place!''' Zubeidat Tsarnaev has been unwavering in her support for Tamerlan, 26, who was killed in a gun battle with police after the bombings, and his younger brother, who was arrested after being cornered inside a boat in a Boston suburb. In the days after the attack, Zubeidat accused law enforcement in Boston of framing her sons and described the scene of carnage at the marathon finish line as a 'really big play’ with 'paint instead of blood.' During a press conference held 10 days after the bombings, the mother was on the verge of hysteria proclaiming she did not accept that her children were responsible for the massacre. ‘America took my kids away from me. I’m sure my kids were not involved in anything,’ she raved. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appeared unmoved as the guilty verdict was announced in court last Wednesday. The same jury panel that found him guilty after 12 hours of deliberations will now have to decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or give him life in prison without the possibility of parole. The sentencing phase of the trial begins on April 21. COUNT 1: GUILTY . Conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, resulting in death (Death penalty charge) COUNT 2: GUILTY .

"Prince William is due at the Cenotaph on the same day the Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth . Prince William is due to accompany the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on an official engagement next Saturday – the same day his wife is reportedly expected to give birth. Despite the clash, the Duke of Cambridge plans to do ‘everything he can’ to be at the official commemorations to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli and Anzac campaigns at the Cenotaph on April 25, Kensington Palace said yesterday. A spokesman for William said: ‘The Duke’s intention is to be at the commemorations. Being the 100th anniversary, it is very important to him.’ Although her due date has not officially been confirmed, the Duchess of Cambridge told wellwishers at a charity event last month: ‘I’m due mid-April, to the end of April.’ Palace sources later said the actual date was April 25. The Duke committed to being present at the commemorations in February and, according to aides, plans to play things by ear. ‘We will have to see what happens,’ said a senior aide. ‘The Duchess has said the baby is due the second half of the month but we don’t know exactly when the baby will arrive.’ Should Kate, 33, go into labour while the Duke is at work, he faces a dash across the country to get to St Mary’s Hospital in West London in time. He is currently training for his new job as an Air Ambulance pilot at three airbases in Cambridge, Norwich or Gloucestershire. Despite reports that there is a helicopter on stand-by, the Duke, 32, will make the journey by car instead. The Mail on Sunday has also learned there will be a new line-up in the delivery room at St Mary’s Lindo Wing for the couple’s second child. Leading obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston will be in charge of the birth, a spokesman for the couple confirmed, assisted by the Queen’s Surgeon-Gynaecologist Alan Farthing, who had been tipped to take the lead role. Mr Farthing was second-in-command to the now retired Sir Marcus Setchell at the birth of the Royal couple’s first child, George. William is currently training for his new job as an Air Ambulance pilot at three airbases in Cambridge, Norwich or Gloucestershire . ‘Both names will be on the notice of birth posted outside Buckingham Palace, but it will be Guy Thorpe-Beeston who will take charge,’ the spokesman added. ‘He’s an obstetrics specialist and that’s why he’s in the lead.’ Mr Thorpe-Beeston, a specialist in high-risk pregnancies, works at London’s private Portland Hospital and on Harley Street, where he has 18 years’ experience. He was made Surgeon-Gynaecologist to the Royal Household last year following his role in the delivery of George on July 22, 2013, also at the Lindo Wing. The consultant – who is believed to have looked after Kate when she was sick with hyperemesis gravidarum during her first trimester – will be the first person the Duchess calls when she goes into labour. He has cleared his diary so he can be solely on call. Mr Farthing, 51, who was engaged to TV presenter Jill Dando at the time of her murder, is a specialist in gynaecological cancer care. He has a private Harley Street practice. Mulberry double breasted pink coat . Sold out! Click to check out the current collection! Visit site .

"Fleas in Arizona have tested positive for the plague and could spread the deadly disease to humans, according to officials. The plague, which famously killed millions of Europeans during the Black Death, is most commonly carried by fleas and rodents. Prairie dog deaths at Picture Canyon in Arizona alerted officials to the possibility of an outbreak. Parasitic insects from the preserve near a water treatment plant in Flagstaff were found to carry the illness. Scroll down for video . Authorities near Flagstaff, Arizona, have found fleas infected with plague after prairie dogs in Picture Canyon began dying (file photos) The plague, which killed millions of Europeans in the 1300s, causes pustules on the skin and is still contracted by 2,000 people a year (file photo) Human cases have developed from close contact with cats who have preyed on infected vermin and  residents in the Southwest have been warned about dangers of the disease while camping. The Southwestern US is similar to the plains of Central Asia where plague began, Professor David Wagner of Northern Arizona University told the Arizona Daily Sun. Plague is still contracted by as many as 2,000 people a year, according to the World Health Organization, though the vast majority of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Prairie dogs are particularly susceptible to illness because they live in social burrows, and 90 per cent of the furry creatures' colony can eventually be wiped out if plague infects one member. The disease's rodent host dies, when fleas will look for more blood to drink, including from people. The vast majority of human plague cases reported in the US are in the arid climate of the Southwest, which scientists say is similar to the disease's homeland of Central Asia . The discovery of the disease at Picture Canyon (pictured) has prompted a warning from authorities about the dangers posed by dead rodents . Insecticide has been sprayed in prairie dog burrows in Picture Canyon to halt the plague's spread. Symptoms of pain in humans include fever, chills and muscle pain. At later stages it causes gangrene and a large amount of pustules, or buboes, on the skin. The incubation period could be up to seven days. Modern medications are effective in fighting the plague, also known by its bacterial name Yersinia pestis,  though it can be deadly if left untreated. The last plague epidemic in the United States was in Los Angeles between 1924 and 1925, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Plague originally came to North America via rodents on steamships from Asia.

"Two young Muslims have put a 14-year-old Pakistani boy in hospital with burns to 55 percent of his body after they set him on fire because he is a Christian. The teenager from Lahore in Punjab province Pakistan, who has been identified only as Nuaman, had just left a local shop when he was beaten and burnt with Kerosene. The boy, who is now being treated at Mayo Hospital in Lahore, described how he was approached by the two Muslim youths as they left Friday prayers at their local mosque. Scroll down for video . The teenager from Lahore in Punjab province Pakistan, who has been identified only as Nuaman, is recovering in hospital from burns to 55 percent of his body . They asked him what his religion was and then, when he replied he was a Christian, they started beating him. Nuaman tired to escaped but as he fled the two other boys poured Kerosene on him and set him on fire. He said he ran – still on fire – until he reached a mound of sand which he rolled around in. Nuaman said some members of his local community helped him put out his burning clothes by pouring more sand on top of him, Breitbart news network reported. The 14-year-old, who lives with his uncle, has said he did not know who had attacked him but said he would be able to identify the assailants if he saw them again. Three weeks ago in Pakistan, in the country’s Sheikhupura District, a 17-year-old Christian narrowly escaped with his life following a similar religiously motivated attack. Sunny Masih was seized by a Muslim mob, beaten and thrown in a flaming kiln. He also suffered severe and extensive burns in the incident. Nuaman is now receiving treatment for his injuries in Lahore's Mayo Hospital, one of the largest in the region . There are fears that both assaults were acts of retaliation motivated by a Christian attack on two members of the Pakistani Taliban, believed to be behind bomb attacks on two churches in Lahore in March. The militant grop detonated two bombs outside churches in the city, killing 17 and wounding a further 80. In the aftermath of the attacks Christians in Lahore took to the streets demanding government protection. Christian vigilantes lynch church bombing suspects after the attack in Lahore killed 15 worshippers and leaves almost 80 wounded . Muslim hostilities appear to be on the upswing in Pakistan in the wake of the recent disturbances. Chritians make up only 2 percent of Pakistan’s 182 million people. They have been targets of increasing violence in recent years. In 2013, 80 people were killed and more than 100 others wounded after twin suicide attacks were carried out at the All Saint's Church in Peshawar, in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on the country's Christians. Lahore's Christians took to the streets in the wake of the attacks but their actions were met by an upswing of religious violence in the area .","Teenager has burns to 55% of his body after religiously motivated attack .

"The body of Kyle Knox has been found near the foot of Ben Nevis three weeks after he disappeared . The body of a missing hiker has been found three weeks after he vanished trying to climb Britain's highest mountain. Kyle Knox, from London, was last seen alive at the foot of Ben Nevis on March 31. The 23-year-old was reported missing the following day when he failed to return to his hotel in Fort William. When he vanished people were being urged not to go to Scotland's mountains unless they had the proper equipment and experience due to the severe weather conditions. The mercury had plunged to minus seven and winds of up to 70mph were recorded in the region. There was also snow on the mountain's peak. It was believed Kyle, who was not an experienced walker, had attempted to climb the Ben Nevis alone. When he set off on the climb Kyle was wearing dark waterproof trousers, walking boots and a jacket with red flashes on it. Searches of Ben Nevis and the Glen Nevis area of Lochaber were launched after the alarm was raised, with Lochaber Mountain Rescue and a RAF search and rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth being scrambled to the scene. Search and rescue dogs also joined in the hunt for missing Kyle. Rescuers were forced to call off the hunt due to band weather in the Scottish Highlands. Today, a body was recovered by a Royal Navy Helicopter in the Surgeon's Gully area, to the south east of Ben Nevis. It has been identified as that of Mr Knox and his family have been informed. It was believed that Mr Knox, 23, of London, was attempting to scale the 4409-ft high peak alone .","Kyle Knox, 23, disappeared as he tried to climb 4409-ft high Ben Nevis .

"A woman who works as a professional ‘humiliatrix’ has revealed how she earns more than one dollar per minute indulging the subservient fantasies of men around the world. Ceara Lynch, from Portland, Oregon, takes the more traditional dominatrix idea a step further, not just dominating her customers but demeaning, shaming and generally humiliating them. And the 28-year-old entrepreneur says that making money this way — which she has been doing since she was 17 — has been a dream. Risqué business: Ceara Lynch, 28, says her career began when she realized how much money she could make from selling her used underwear online; her first pair sold for $70 . In a recent interview with Salon, Ceara explains that she got started in the industry by accident. When she was 17, Ceara was on a dating website when one particular suitor intrigued her; the meaner she was to him, the more interested in her he became. She went on to seek out similar men, eventually finding a website called Ebanned where she could sell her used underwear. Her first pair sold for $70. A tame entrance into the world of humiliating men for money soon escalated to selling more personal items online, taking provocative phone calls, and performing live webcam shows. Taking control: 'Guys really like the idea of me ruining them in this way,' Ceara says . Real-life dating: Ceara says she's up-front about her job when she's dating, and she's had three serious relationships over the course of her career . 'I make most of my money from videos,' she says, adding that custom videos cost $1 per minute and subscribers pay a monthly fee of $39.99 for access to her site. 'They are [point of view]-style videos, which means it’s just me and the camera, and I am looking at the camera and talking to the camera so that the viewer feels like I’m talking to them.' 'I just tap into various fetishes and they’re all just under the umbrella of [female dominance]. I always play a dominant role, and I tap into things like cuckolding, small penis humiliation, foot fetish, toilet slavery, giantess — which is this fetish where guys imagine this giant woman that’s going to come and crush them with her feet or swallow them whole — different stuff like that.' Besides paying for subscriptions and purchasing the personal items that Ceara sells online, customers can also mail Ceara cash, buy her gift cards to Amazon, Southwest Airlines, or a massage parlor, or purchase items off her Amazon wishlist, which includes a $399.99 GoPro, $1,295 Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and a $23 Pikachu adult cosplay costume. No secret: Friends and family know what Ceara does for a living, and her dad thought she was a 'genius' when he learned how she was making money . While such interests might scare off some people, Ceara likes the fact that she is privy to intimate knowledge that her customers don't necessarily reveal in their personal lives. 'I think it’s fascinating and I think it’s also flattering, in a way, that guys are telling me things that they don’t tell anyone else,' she says. Ceara also isn't quite as excited about humiliating her customers as they are about being humiliated, which she says makes it easy for her to compartmentalize and separate her job from her personal life. 'I do enjoy my work, I think it’s really fun and I get a kick out of it ... But I definitely don’t like it in the same way that my clients like it.'","Ceara Lynch, 28, is paid to indulge men’s fetish fantasies, which often include elements of humiliation .

In turn, British Airways ranked in eighth place as the only UK airline to make the list. America fared even worse, with one airline making it into 17th place - SouthWest Airlines. WanderBat, has looked at several different factors in order to form a Smart Rating and rank the top international airlines. Looking at on-time performance, checked baggage cost (the number of bags you get to check for free, as well as the cost of checking additional bags) and the average age of the fleet. If any two airlines tied, they were then ranked according to their percentage of on-time flights. Emirates scored an impressive 97 points thanks to its impressive on-time performance and luxurious planes . China Eastern tied with Emirates with a score of 97, but its on-time record was slightly lower . While British Airways only took eighth place, it still boasted a score of 91, coming behind Singapore Airlines, China Southern, Ethiopian and Air China. The top 10 was rounded out with Saudia, Cathay Pacific and Latin American airline Lan. BA was the only European airline to make it into the list, except for Air Berlin, which took 22nd place.

"When it launched eight years ago, cruise company Azamara decided to make a name for itself, literally. The founders took 'aza' for 'blue' - think azure; and added 'mara', which has a hint of the maritime about it. And then, for good measure, they bolted on 'Club Cruises'. The thinking behind 'Club' was that it suggested exclusivity. The line - part of the Royal Caribbean group - has two ships in its fleet, Journey and Quest, which each carry about 680 passengers. The smaller size of the vessels means not only a more intimate on-board experience - as in TV's Cheers bar, it can become a place where everybody who serves you soon knows your name - it also means the ships can access ports off-limits to the bigger vessels. I boarded our seven-night Azamara Quest cruise from Monaco to Rome with a sense of great expectations: I anticipated a friendly ambience, great service and some interesting ports. I wasn't to be disappointed. The Azamara Club Cruises' Quest vessel carries about 680 passengers, making it a more intimate voyage . The size of the ship means it is able to access ports that are off-limits to the bigger vessels . Boarding the ship in somewhere as glitzy as Monaco immediately imbued the journey with a luxury feel. In the harbour we were surrounded on all sides by billionaires' mega-yachts. But while they and their guests were probably having to fork out vast amounts for their onboard food and drink, on the Azamara Quest we were living in the lap of complimentary luxury. You can enjoy 'standard spirits, international beers and wines at all ship bars during regular bar hours' for no extra charge - and 'gratuities' on Azamara are included in the basic cost. There is also an unfeasibly wide selection of on-board eating places - there is a Tardis-like feel to the way that something that looks small from the outside can accommodate so much on the inside. Our first stop was St Tropez, which seemed to boast even more stunning luxury yachts than Monaco. In the evening we joined a small party for a special excursion - Azamara prides itself on offering a variety of experiences throughout its cruises - to an 'elegant evening under the stars' at a favourite celeb hangout, the five-star Chateau de La Messardiere. We gathered around the handsome swimming pool to sip fine champagne and scoff sumptuous mini-pastries as we watched the sun sink into the Mediterranean. Frank boarded a seven-night Azamara Quest cruise from Monaco to Rome with high expectations . The first stop was St Tropez , which seemed to boast even more stunning luxury yachts than Monaco . It was a good time to get early impressions on the cruise from fellow passengers. Everyone was impressed at the high quality of service and facilities - especially those whose previous cruise experiences had been on 'big' ships. There were high marks for dining, service, decor, the interesting choice of excursions and the excellent value for money. 'We were worried Azamara might be too small,' said one couple. 'In fact we should have been worried by the fact that our previous trips had been on ships which were too large. We're sticking with ships this size from now on.' The days flew by. There were two ports in Corsica: Ajaccio and Porto Vecchio. Famous for its salt pans, Porto Vecchio offered another treat - the AzaMazing evening (there is one on every cruise), a large, free-of-charge party with masses of food, wine and entertainment laid on at a nearby beach that we reached in a fleet of coaches. It felt as if we were gatecrashing an exclusive private party. Famous for its salt pans, Porto Vecchio offered another treat - a large free-of-charge private party . The cruises attracted a wide spread of age groups, from people in their 30s up to their 80s. The accent was on keeping busy, whether by taking interesting excursions or attending well-thought-out lectures on board. But if you didn't want to do anything, there were always spare sunloungers and plenty of space to stretch out next to the pool. After a fine stop at Sardinia, it was on to Italy for Capri and our final stop at Amalfi. I woke early to be up on deck as the ship followed the coast road past Positano. It was so quiet that as we sailed past the small villages, you could hear bells calling people to morning Mass. Frank woke early to be up on deck as the ship followed the coast road past quiet Positano . In Amalfi we caught the local bus up to Ravello - once a favourite place with the Hollywood elite - to enjoy the stunning views along the coast, and then sauntered back down the footpath through lemon trees and sweet-smelling shade until we were back in Amalfi. Our final excursion was one that promised 'Insider Access' - a drive along the spectacular Amalfi Coast to a buffalo farm in Pontecagnano to discover how mozzarella cheese is made. A bus up to former Hollywood elite favourite Ravello is rewarded with coastal views such as this . One of the happy Asian water buffalo that provide the milk for creamy and delicious mozzarella . Azamara Club Cruises (0844 493 4016) offers an eight-night Mediterranean cruise aboard the Quest from £2,285pp including return flights from Heathrow, transfers, club balcony cabin and full board. Departing October 15, it calls at Florence and Pisa, Rome, Sorrento, Sicily, Crete, Santorini and Athens. I'm not sure what sort of picture I had in my head of the buffaloes from which the milk is taken in order to make the famous Italian cheese, but the big-horned Asian water buffaloes we met came as something of a surprise. The farm we visited was a showpiece with a big herd of cheerful animals, and after watching the manufacturing process we were whisked off to the owners' farmhouse where we were able to sample the goods in rural splendour. On our return to the ship there was time to reflect on a pleasurable week at sea. The company's name may mean 'blue sea' - for me I will always remember it as 'my blue heaven'.","Writer took Azamara Club Cruises' Quest vessel from Monaco to Rome .

"A Ferrari-driving fantasist dubbed 'Teflon Don' who murdered his wealthy heiress lover in order to steal £816,000 from her bank accounts has been ordered to pay back just £1. Donald Graham, 62, from Sparty Lea, Northumberland, killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, so he could fund his lavish taste in supercars and buy his second mistress a home. Ms Brown vanished in 2005 and her body has never been found. Scroll down for video . Donald Graham, 62, (pictured) killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, his lover, for her money . He stole £300,000 of her savings, her Land Rover and Porsche, took her horses and tried to siphon off thousands of pounds from her estate and that of her family. Graham, who dubbed himself Teflon Don, was last year jailed for life with a minimum of 32 years for killing Ms Brown for her money nine years after her death. Prosecutors wanted to reclaim his ill-gotten gains, which they said totalled £816,127.86p, under the Proceeds of Crime Act. But Newcastle Crown Court heard Graham, previously referred to in court as the Prince of Darkness, now has no available assets and so must pay back just back £1. Janet Brown (pictured left) and Graham (right) were lovers for eight years despite Graham being married . Graham, who drove a Ferrari, a Porsche, a Range Rover and a Alfa Romeo Spider, despite allegedly being short of cash, denied murdering Ms Brown between June 14 and 18, 2005 but admitted stealing her money. But jurors, who had been deliberating over the case for a week, found him guilty of murder and perverting the course of justice during a trial last year. The court heard the Hexham heiress 'disappeared from the face of the earth' in June 2005 and no trace of her has ever been found. Graham spun a cruel web of lies that left Ms Brown’s parents believing she was still alive but living abroad. Graham, described as ‘flash’ and always ‘dripping in gold’, lived with his wife Denise, 66, but had two mistresses, including Ms Brown. Graham and Ms Brown,who had saved ‘substantial assets’ of over £400,000, had been together for eight years. He told her that his wife had cancer and when she died they would marry. The Hexham heiress 'disappeared from the face of the earth' in June 2005 and no trace of her has been found . The pair arranged to go on holiday to France in 2005 but at the last minute he pulled out, claiming his wife was unwell, so Miss Brown decided to go alone. The court heard that after booking the holiday, Graham had found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, 51, with whom he had become infatuated. It was around the day of her intended departure on June 17 that Ms Brown was murdered. Graham had persuaded her to transfer £300,000 into his account and the money dropped just a day before she disappeared. Jurors were told that Graham wanted Miss Brown’s money so he could ‘live a lifestyle that involved owning and driving powerful motor cars’ and buy a property for Todd to live in. During his murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court, the jury heard Ms Brown had been besotted with 'greedy liar' Graham. During his murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court the jury heard Ms Brown had been besotted with 'greedy liar' Graham (pictured in long leather jacket) The trial judge said Ms Brown, whose body has never been found, may have been dumped in a deep pit or mine shaft by former JCB digger driver Graham. Her killer was badly in debt and was struggling to fund the finance agreements on his beloved sports cars. He plundered Ms Brown's bank account to fund his flashy lifestyle, making her elderly parents, Eric and Olive Brown, believe their daughter was still alive by sending them letters and cards in her name from Europe. Graham also ingratiated himself with her parents after her death and started systematically stripping their estate and assets. He used his visits to gain access to Ms Brown's security codes and also sold her Porsche and other cars. When her parents died, he plundered their bank accounts - defrauding a total of more than £500,000 from them. The couple died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was working in a bank in Switzerland. After they died building society staff eventually became suspicious that withdrawals were still being made in 2010 and police were called. They believed they were just investigating a fraud but it soon became apparent Ms Brown was missing and a murder inquiry was launched. He hadn't worked since an accident in 1997 when a JCB bucket hit him on the back and he was awarded £40,000 compensation. Graham was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for killing Ms Brown. Northumbria Police subsequently launched an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act into his finances. Graham stole more than £800,000 from Ms Brown to fund his love of supercars and a lavish lifestyle . The court heard with his fleet of flash sports cars and his large imposing house on a hill, pony-tailed and goatee-bearded Graham thought of himself as a charmer and cut a distinctive figure in his long leather coat. He liked to play the big man, pretending to be related to murdered Viv Graham who was shot and killed in an unsolved apparent gangland hit in 1993, in an effort to enhance his reputation as a force to be reckoned with. In fact he was a failed former policeman in the Met, having quit after a week in the 1970s, apparently homesick for his native North East. The court heard Graham's main motivation in life was always money and he had a penchant for women over whom he could exert power and control. Graham was jailed for life  for killing Ms Brown.

"Around one in 10 Americans suffer from explosive anger management issues and has easy access to guns, a study has found. Some 3.7 million of the short-fused gun owners also confessed to carrying their weapons outside of the home. The research carried out by Harvard, Columbia and Duke University found that the majority of angry gun owners were young or middle aged men. Around one in 10 American suffering from explosive anger management issues has easy access to guns, a study has found . They were said to be more likely to live in suburban areas and be married, according to the study. They also discovered that despite some struggling with 'impulsive' and 'destructive' behavior, this was not picked up on background checks that could restrict their ownership, according to CBS News. The findings were described as 'something of a wake-up call,' by the report's author Jefferey Swanson. 'To have gun violence you need two things: a gun and a dangerous person,' he said. 'We can't broadly limit legal access to guns, so we have to focus on the dangerous people.' The study, that saw more than 5,500 men and women quizzed, came in the wake of a number of high-profile gun tragedies in the US.

"Egypt's former president Mohammed Morsi has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012. But a court in the country's capital Cairo acquitted the 63-year-old leader of charges that would have seen him face the death penalty. Fourteen others were convicted on the same charges, with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Egypt's former president Mohamed Morsi (pictured at an court appearance in December) has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012 . But the court cleared the defendants on charges of inciting murder over the deaths of a journalist and two protesters during the December 5, 2012 clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo. Defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions. Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, came to power following the 2011 ouster of  Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising. But after just a year in power, Morsi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass street protests. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail. Other Brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and Tuesday's decision to acquit Morsi on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected. 'This is a surprise... We were expecting them to be convicted of murder,' Ramy Ghanem, a lawyer for an anti-Morsi protester who was wounded in the clashes, told AFP. Buses were set ablaze during 2012 clashes between opponents and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . 'But the sentences are not bad. We were expecting life in prison, but then 20 years is not very different,' he said. A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years. Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called 'unprecedented in recent history'. Earlier this month, a Cairo court  confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and 13 others over protest violence. The Brotherhood had called for protests in support of Morsi on Tuesday. 'The coup commander is exploiting the judiciary,' it said in a statement ahead of the verdict, referring to Sisi. It said the president was using the courts 'as a weapon in the battle against the popular will and the democratic and revolutionary legitimacy represented by President Mohamed Morsi.' Morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty, including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers. Verdicts in those two cases are due on May 16. Sisi has vowed to 'eradicate' the Brotherhood, an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between Mubarak's fall and Morsi's presidential election victory in May 2012. Supporters and opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood clashed during 2012 street battles in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . The authorities designated it a 'terrorist group' in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms. The crackdown sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups, who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces. Officials say more than 500 police and soldiers have been killed in attacks since Morsi was overthrown. Sisi was elected president in May last year, but he faced no serious challengers and - in a country where the army has been in power for decades - his victory dashed hopes raised by Mubarak's ouster of a civilian democracy. Sisi's regime is popular among many Egyptians tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth. But Sisi has been accused of repression and his crackdown has also targeted secular and liberal activists who spearheaded the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. In November, a court dropped murder charges against Mubarak in his own trial over the deaths of hundreds of protesters in 2011.","A court in Cairo has sentenced the former leader over abuses of protesters .

"Just days after the former Australian swimming champion's unexpected comeback, Grant Hackett's father has revealed that the sleeping pill addiction which ruined his son's personal life and tarnished his career, was triggered by a death threat. Former police inspector Neville Hackett said that his son had 'his life threatened by a well-known associate of criminals' two years ago, leading the swimmer to immediately hop on a plane to his parent's home in the Gold Coast. 'I know he used Stilnox while he was swimming but he wasn't hooked on it. It was when his life was threatened and he couldn't sleep at night from all the worry,' Hackett senior told The Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Grant Hackett's father has revealed the swimmer's sleeping pill addiction was triggered by a death threat . The revelation comes after the 34-year-old made a come back last Sunday when he earned a 2015 world titles relay team berth by cruising to fourth place in one minute and 46.84 seconds . 'That's what really caused the Stilnox abuse and the addiction.' Hackett senior admitted that while the threat was never reported to police, it was taken very seriously by the swimmer's family. The dual Olympic champion appears to have recovered from his tumultuous year, which ended with  a five-week stint in an Arizona rehab clinic. Following his swimming comeback on Sunday night, in which he earned a 2015 world titles relay team berth by cruising to fourth place in one minute and 46.84 seconds, Hackett reflected on how much he had turned his life around in the past 12 months. Former police inspector Neville Hackett (centre) said that his son had 'his life threatened by a well-known associate of criminals' two years ago . The addiction to Stilnox which ensued, led Hackett's personal life to fall apart last year. It also began around the time he divorced Australian singer Candice Alley in August 2013 . 'If you had asked me 10 years ago if the only thing that got me on the team was on the relay it would be bitter disappointment,' Hackett said. 'But right now, it is one of the biggest achievements of my life.' The 34-year-old made the team after only six months of training following a six-year layoff, with his training schedule involving 55-60km of swimming a week and three gym sessions, according to coach Denis Cotterell. While Hackett's personal life fell apart last year due to his sleeping pill addiction, his professional demons went back as far as his last major meet, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, where he was denied a record third straight 1500m gold medal. The dual Olympic champion said, following his Sunday night achievement: 'If you had asked me 10 years ago if the only thing that got me on the team was on the relay it would be bitter disappointment, but right now, it is one of the biggest achievements of my life' He made the team after only six months of training following a six-year layoff, with his training schedule now involving 55-60km of swimming a week and three gym sessions, according to coach Denis Cotterell (pictured) 'I will be honest. I hated the sport for a long time,' Hackett said. 'I got scared getting into a bathtub. 'To discover a love for something that has been such a big part of my life is really pleasing now because I don't walk away with that taste of Olympic silver in my mouth by a few hundredths of a second. 'I can really enjoy the sport for what it is now.' Hackett had been adamant he had not even launched a comeback after entering the 2015 national titles. 'It was a challenging few years and I had to live it pretty publicly,' Hackett said . But, he allowed himself a moment to reflect on how far he had come in the past year while savouring the remarkable 200m result in which he shaved three seconds off his best time since his return. 'It was a challenging few years and I had to live it pretty publicly,' Hackett said. 'One thing I am good at is listening to people around me. 'I never sit there and feel too sorry for myself for too long. I take accountability for my actions - right or wrong. 'I tried to make the best steps forward - that is all I have ever tried to do.'","Hackett's father said son's life was threatened by 'associate of criminals'

"A British mother is among nearly 100 women who have had babies by a Danish sperm donor who has triggered an international scare over the spread of an incurable genetic disease. The man, known only as Donor 7042, carries a defective gene known as neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) that can pass on a severe, life-limiting condition to his offspring. With demand for Danish sperm soaring, the donor is understood to have fathered 99 ‘Viking babies’ – as they are widely dubbed – across the world through the clinic Nordic Cryobank. Scroll down for video . Ten of his offspring have already been diagnosed with NF1 – a condition which can increase the risk of cancer, cause learning difficulties and reduce a sufferer’s lifespan by up to 15 years. A child born from a parent with the defective gene has up to a 50 per cent chance of developing the disease. Now four families are suing the sperm bank and the case has raised questions among fertility experts about Denmark’s booming, and unregulated, sperm export trade. Laura Witjens, from the National Gamete Donation Trust (NGDT), said: ‘The distribution and use of Danish and American sperm donors is not regulated or monitored, but patients are not told this. ‘NF1 is a rare disease, but the terrible spread of the gene via this prolific Danish donor highlights the worrying dangers of the widespread use of a single donor.’ The British mother was one of 20 women treated at an IVF clinic in Belgium who conceived using the rogue sperm, the Belgian federal health authority revealed. But reports from a variety of countries show the donor has fathered many more children – 99 in total, including the ones on Belgium, along with 44 across Scandinavia, 34 in America and one in Iceland. Danish mother Lone Sogaard-Kristensen, whose daughter inherited Donor 7042’s illness, claims she was contacted by as many as 17 women with his children who had the condition. Ms Witjens said last night that it was possible more British women could have bought his donations with the defective gene online. Donor 7042’s sperm was also exported to a closely associated centre in America – the California Cryobank. But in 2009 it was discovered he carried the NF1 gene – despite undergoing tests and stating in a questionnaire for Nordic Cryobank that there were no genetic disorders in his family. The shock discovery was made when a baby conceived with his sperm in Belgium was diagnosed with the condition. Ms Sogaard-Kristensen was ‘stunned’ to be informed of his medical status by the Danish health authorities. And when her daughter Andrea subsequently developed the illness, she became one of the families – three from Denmark and one from the US – who are taking legal action against Nordic Cryobank. The donor has fathered many more children – 99 in total, including the ones on Belgium, along with 44 across Scandinavia, 34 in America and one in Iceland. A class action lawsuit claims it failed to properly screen for the disorder before using his specimens. ‘The case is not about money or revenge, it is about the fact we have not been able to get any information and the only way we can do this is through a court,’ Ms Sogaard-Kristensen said. ‘There are no rules that say you must be told how many children these donors make and the sperm banks will not tell you.’ A limit should be set on the number of children who can be fathered by sperm donors, to combat fears that siblings or cousins could unwittingly meet and start families, experts say. Clinics are currently allowed to sell sperm from a donor to thousands of women around the world, raising fears of an ‘incest timebomb’. One man could theoretically ‘sire’ an ‘unlimited number’ of children, say the researchers, writing in the journal Reproductive BioMedicine. The panel suggests no donor should sire more than 100 offspring. The case comes as leading fertility scientists from Birmingham University and the Netherlands are calling for new international rules limiting the number of children one donor can produce to 100. They say if a donor exceeds this there is a risk of siblings inter-breeding and suffering psychological damage on finding out they are related to hundreds of other children. Dr Jackson Kirkman-Brown, the fertility expert who led the research at Birmingham University, said: ‘What is clear when buying sperm from abroad is that although the number of families a donor is allowed to father in the UK is capped, it could be hundreds elsewhere. ‘If you can imagine finding out that you have 500 siblings across the globe — that could have a real risk to the mental health of a child.’ It is understood that The Nordic Cryobank will claim that the legal claims against them are unfounded. Managing director Peter Bower has previously stated that Donor 7042 could not be ‘clinically classified as having NF1, as it only occurs in some of his cells’. The company’s website states that it carries out genetic testing for a range of diseases including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anaemia. But it adds the disclaimer: ‘It is impossible to rule out genetic disease with 100 per cent certainty since it is not possible to test for all inheritable diseases.’","Donor 7042 carries defective gene known as neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)

"A family claim they were forced to sit in vomit aboard a United Airlines flight after staff refused to clean an affected area of floor before take-off. Scott Shirley, his wife Mayo and seven-year-old son Phoenix, were travelling back to Washington DC after a birthday trip to Disney World, Orlando, when they discovered the vomit and complained to cabin crew. After boarding the plane, the Shirleys were storing their bags under their seats when they noticed their luggage was wet. Scroll down for video . Mayo Shirley, son Phoenix, and husband Scott were forced to sit in seats surrounded by vomit on a United Airlines flight . After putting their luggage on the floor of the cabin, the family discovered the bags to be wet with vomit . Mr Shirley told MailOnline Travel: 'My wife decided to transfer her backpack with all our snacks in it to the spot where my son was sitting. It was then, that she noticed her bag was wet. 'She then rubbed the carpet area on the floor of our seats and discovered the whole area was wet. When she raised her had towards her face to smell the liquid, that's when she made the horrible discovery that the liquid was vomit. 'Given my wife suffers from Mysophobia (phobia of germs), she immediately had a look of panic on her face and loudly pronounced it to be vomit. 'I immediately had a feeling of being grossed out that I too had had my hands all over this vomit. My wife got up and ran towards the bathroom area of the plane with me following behind. 'I told the flight attendant what had happened and she directed us both to the available bathrooms.' The Shirley's luggage remains in the plastic rubbish sacks while they decide how to clean items . Mr Shirley says the family were told by cabin staff that a passenger on an earlier flight had been sick in the seating area, and that staff had cleaned the area. 'It was clear that no one had cleaned the area where we were sitting, because there was no evidence of any chemical smell what so ever,' he added. 'This was purely that distinct smell of vomit on our hands and backpacks.' Mr Shirley described how his wife was so upset she began crying and shaking, and they were given two options by United staff; fly out next day or remain in their seats. Because Mrs Shirley had to go to work next day at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the family say they had no choice but to remain in the seats. The family were flying back on a United Airlines flight from Orlando to Washington (file photo) However, staff allegedly refused to clean and scrub down the affected area, and the passengers were given blankets, which they say did nothing to remove the pungent smell. Mr Shirley said: 'The pilot came out and asked if a resolution had been made. He told us we had to make a decision because he can't delay the other passengers. 'It was at this point I felt as if they couldn't care less about the disgusting situation they had put us in and only cared about moving the flight along. I told my wife that we should just take the next day flight. 'She said it isn't an option for her due to her position with the FDA and the nine days she had already been on holiday. Since we really had no choice in the matter, under duress of the situation, we agreed to the blanket option.' The family were given trash bags by the airline to put their luggage in. 'It was completely humiliating walking through the airport with our belongings in trash bags as if we were some sort of homeless family,' added Mr Shirley. 'I felt that we had to explain what happened to every person who stared awkwardly at us. This was the final straw for me. 'We went straight to United customer service who told us they can't do anything because it involves bags and we would have to go to baggage claim to speak with a supervisor there. This was on the other side of the airport which meant we had to now lug all this stuff there. No assistance was offered.' With their luggage still bagged up, Mr Shirley says United Airlines have offered them a $150 flight voucher each and some 'mileage points' A spokesperson for United Airlines told MailOnline Travel: The situation Mr Shirley described is certainly one that we wish no customer experiences, as our cleaners did not fully clean the seat area prior to departure. 'We offered them an alternate flight, but they decided to remain onboard. Our agents did the best they could in the short time they had to accommodate Mr Shirley and keep the flight on time. 'We’re reaching out to apologise for his experience.' The family were offered a $150 flight voucher, or the option to file a claim for the baggage, which they chose to do. Upon returning home, United has offered the each member of the family a $150 voucher as well as additional mileage points for Mrs Shirley. However, Mr Shirley said: 'I personally feel it is a slap in the face considering all we had to endure on this two hour flight from hell. 'I don't know what the lasting effects are going to be of this experience. We have to fly at least two more times later this year for weddings and I'm beginning to think the train might be an option. 'I felt so uncomfortable the whole time we were flying. All I could think about is what this vomit might have in it and if there was anything we would contact from it.'","Scott Shirley, his wife and son were returning from trip to Disneyland .

"Jon Stewart will host his last show on August 6 after he revealed that he decided to quit because he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news . Departing host Jon Stewart has revealed he will present his final The Daily Show on August 6. He kept things lighthearted by talking about how sentimental it will be and joked that he would dress well for his swan song. He said: 'I mentioned to you that I would keep you up to date on any new information we had about the transition of the programme and all those other things. 'We do have some specific information. My last Daily Show program will August 6. 'I will be wearing a suit, I will more than likely be showered.' He told viewers he hoped they would join him and announced a competition to get tickets to the final show. It comes after he revealed that he decided to call time on his 17 year reign because he was becoming increasing depressed by American politics and watching cable news. Stewart will be replaced by Trevor Noah, 31, who instantly became the center of a debate over his questionable jokes on social media. Noah has been accused of antisemitism for comments made about Jews in tweets dating back to 2009. But Stewart urged viewers to give the South African comedian a chance, saying he was 'an incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart individual' who would earn viewers' respect. Speaking after making his shock decision, Stewart said he was looking forward to not having to watch the 'relentless' 24-hour news networks anymore. 'Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,' Stewart told The Guardian. 'I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don't get turd lung disease.' Stewart has now set an official exit date, with Comedy Central announcing last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, left, would be taking over . Asked if he'd ever voluntarily watch Fox News, Stewart said, 'Let's say that it's a nuclear winter, and I have been wandering, and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and I think that light might be a food source that could help my family. 'I might glance at it for a moment until I realize, that's Fox News, and then I shut it off.' Stewart also confessed that his 'moments of dissatisfaction' with the show had started to become more frequent. 'It's not like I thought [The Daily Show] wasn't working any more, or that I didn't know how to do it. It was more, ""Yup, it's working. But I'm not getting the same satisfaction,'"" he said. 'These things are cyclical. You have moments of dissatisfaction, and then you come out of it and it's OK. But the cycles become longer and maybe more entrenched, and that's when you realize, ""OK, I'm on the back side of it now.'"" Stewart said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance in 2011 . Even the upcoming 2016 Presidential election campaign couldn't reignite Stewart's passion the way it once did. 'I'd covered an election four times, and it didn't appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,' said Stewart. 'Honestly, it was a combination of the limitations of my brain and a format that is geared towards following an increasingly redundant process, which is our political process. 'I was just thinking, ""Are there other ways to skin this cat?' And, beyond that, it would be nice to be home when my little elves get home from school, occasionally."" Stewart also said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance. The former secretary of defense appeared on The Daily Show in 2011 for an interview, which the comedian says he messed up. 'He just went into the general gobbledegook,' said Stewart. ""Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah."" I should have pushed, but he's very adept at deflecting.' Rumsfeld, who was on the show to promote his memoir, Known And Unknown, dodged Stewart's questions about faulty U.S. intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. The exiting host told The Guardian that one reason for  stepping down early in the presidential election cycle was to give Noah a big story to tackle. Stewart said he felt 'that, for the show, you don't want to leave when the cupboard's bare. So I think it's a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign.'","Jon Stewart announced the date of his final show live on air, joking he would 'wear a suit and shower'

"Bikini-clad models needed a head for heights as they took to this catwalk in China -  2,000 metres high on a mountainside. The girls put aside their fear of heights as they paraded along the narrow footpath in red bikinis and black high heels in a 'test of their composure' as part of a Chinese beauty pageant. The challenge was part of the central China stage of the annual Miss Bikini of the Universe contest, which has been running since 2005, according to the People's Daily Online. Don't look down: Models at a beauty pageant look a little unsure as they stand on a glass walkway, 2,000 metres up in Luoyang . Holding on: Many of the models held onto the safety railings as they made their way up the cliff pathway to take part in the competition . 'First of all, it allowed us to become more courageous, and second it allowed us to practice our most fundamental skills,' said contestant, Yang Ningqing. 'This catwalk, even though it was a very crude catwalk, allowed us to show off our most beautiful posture.' Another contestant, Wang Linwei, said: 'I have never done training on a cliff, I'm not going to lie, it is a little scary.' The uneven footpath along the side of the Luanchuan Laojun mountain in Henan Province, central China, is only one-metre wide, which did little to ease nerves.

Strike a pose: Judges at the contest said they wanted to make sure the contestants could keep their cool under pressure . Some models decided to kick off their heels and walk bare-footed to negotiate the potholes. While the girls seemed to enjoy themselves, some Chinese social media users criticised organisers for making them strut along the side of a mountain. One user wrote: 'Who is it that came up with such a bad idea to torture the beauties? It is so windy on the mountains. Try getting your daughter up on the cliff with bikinis on.' The girls were competing to get to the national final in Beijing. It is not the first the time that organisers have pushed their contestants to their limit.

"Arizona's  only Hispanic governor, Raul Castro, has died at age 98. Castro passed away on Friday morning while in his sleep in San Diego where he was in hospice care, family spokesman James Garcia said. He was a self-made man, the embodiment of the American dream overcoming poverty and discrimination to graduate from college, and launch a successful career in politics and diplomacy. During his career, Castro also served as an American ambassador to three countries including El Salvador, Bolivia and Argentina. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said Castro 'lived a full life of exemplary service to Arizona and its people.' Raul Hector Castro (above pictured in 2006), former governor of Arizona died on Friday morning . 'He was an honorable public servant, a history-maker, a beloved family man and a strong friend and fighter for Arizona,' Ducey said in a statement. Castro is survived by his wife, Pat  and his two daughters, Mary Pat James and Beth Castro, according to AZ Central. Growing up on the US-Mexico border near Douglas, Arizona, Castro saw discrimination around him. Former Arizona Governor and U.S. Ambassador Raul Hector Castro and his wife Pat, pictured in their Nogales, Arizona home in 2008 . 'America is the land of opportunity,' he told The Associated Press in 2010. 'Here, one can accomplish whatever they want to be. But you've got to work for it.' He said he wondered why the Hispanics were laborers and none delivered the mail or worked in offices. It did not seem right that the Hispanic children had to walk miles to school every day while the white kids would wave from a passing school bus, he said. Castro set out to beat the odds. When he could not get a job as a teacher — schools did not hire educators of Mexican descent back then — he became a drifter for a while, working as a farm hand and boxing here and there. He landed a job with the U.S. Consulate in the border city of Agua Prieta, Mexico. After five years, a senior official told him he was doing a great job but had no future in the foreign service — he had a Hispanic name and no Ivy League education. Castro then quit and moved to Tucson. A law school dean at the University of Arizona told Castro he would not be accepted because he could not afford to quit a job teaching Spanish. Besides, the dean said, Hispanic students did not do well in law school. Undeterred, Castro went to the university president, who convinced the dean to give Castro an opportunity to prove himself. Castro died in his sleep in San Diego where he was in hospice care, a family spokesman said (above Castro pictured far right in 1976 with governors at the time including Dick Lamm for Colorado, Jerry Apodaca for New Mexico . He excelled and went on to be elected the first Hispanic county attorney and later the first Hispanic judge in Pima County Superior Court. 'One of the finest men I ever knew,' former Gov. Rose Mofford, a fellow Democrat, said of Castro during a 2010 interview with the AP. Born in Cananea, Mexico, in 1916, some 50 miles south of Arizona, Castro grew up in Arizona and graduated from Douglas High School. He was the second youngest in a family with 12 children — 11 boys and one girl. His father was a union leader forced out of Mexico for organizing a strike at the mine in Cananea. His father died when Castro was 12, and his mother became a midwife to feed the family. She delivered babies for the Mexican families around Douglas in exchange for flower, corn, beans and other staples. Castro serve as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, Argentina and Bolivia . Education was the best way out, Castro was determined. He went on to serve as U.S. ambassador to three Latin American countries under three U.S. presidents. Lyndon Johnson sent him to El Salvador, where Castro became known as 'Yankee Castro' to differentiate him from the other Raul Castro — the brother of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. Johnson later sent him to Bolivia and he stayed for a short time under Richard Nixon before returning to Arizona and making the first of two bids for governor. His statewide races were two of the closest gubernatorial elections in state history. He lost to Republican Jack Williams in 1970 by 1.5 percentage points. He fared better four years later as the Republican Party was embroiled in the Watergate corruption scandal. Castro defeated Republican Russ Williams by less than one percentage point three months after Nixon resigned in controversy. As an ambassador and judge, Castro was used to having unquestioned authority. However, he struggled to adjust to the checks and balances imposed on a governor, said Alfredo Gutierrez, a Democrat and legislative leader while Castro was governor. 'It was a very difficult beginning for him,' Gutierrez said. 'It was quite an adjustment.' Castro was governor for two and a half years before resigning when President Jimmy Carter appointed him ambassador to Argentina. He told the AP he was proud of his work motivating Hispanics to vote, many of them for the first time despite deep nerves. 'The thing that bothered me the most when I resigned as governor, the Hispanic community felt that I had betrayed them, because they worked so hard to get me elected,' he said decades later. 'I had to convince them and persuade them that being an American ambassador was just as important as being a governor. I had more authority.' Castro spent his waning years living in Nogales and talking to students around the state, motivating them to work hard and chase lofty dreams.","Raul Hector Castro passed away on Friday morning while in his sleep in San Diego where he was in hospice care .

"A full-scale terror alert was sparked this week after a dummy wearing a balaclava was spotted on a boat sailing down the Thames with a fake missile launcher on its roof. Thames Valley Police called an Army bomb disposal team after a startled passer-by reported the 4ft long guided missile in a rocket launcher on top of the barge in Reading.

"A New York City cop checking in on his elderly parents on Friday was horrified to discover them dead along with two other guests in their home. Robert Hugel, who is assigned to the Technical Assistance Response Unit, found the victims, all in their 70s and 80s, just after 3 p.m. at the house in Bellerose in Floral Park, Queens. The New York Post reports that Jerry Hugel, 83, his wife Marianne Hugel, 80, died along with 70-year-old neighbor Gloria Greco, and friend Walter Vondthadden, 76, in an apparent carbon monoxide poisoning, possibly caused by a car left running in a garage. Scroll down for video . Married 60 years: Neighbors say that Jerry and Marrianne Hugel were a happily married couple for 60 years who loved to dance, garden, and observe their German heritage . Cleaning up: Police Department personnel remove one of the bodies from a home where four people were found dead on Friday . It appeared the car was accidentally left running in the garage, but it was unclear for how long, investigators said. Neighbors lined the streets and sidewalks in the suburban neighborhood next to Long Island's Nassau County. Some cried as police officers and firefighters walked around the Cape Cod-style, two-story home. Before police officially identified the victims, neighbor Helga Harter told The Associated Press that the couple was named Jerry Hugel and Marie Hugel, who were in their 80s and had known her for 40 years. 'They were wonderful people,' Harter said through tears as she stood on a street corner, looking at the home. 'They were married for 60 years.' Heartbroken son: Robert Hugel was checking in on his elderly parents on Friday when he found them dead due to apparent carbon monoxide poisoning along with two of their friends . Medical aid: Emergency personnel gather near a home where police say four people were poisoned to death . The Hugels had five children, including son Robert Hugel, a New York Police Department officer who was said to have found his parents lifeless bodies. She described them as a 'great family' very active in the local German community. She last saw them on Wednesday at a Bavarian dancing class they attended together. 'I'm in shock,' Harter said. 'It's the greatest shock of my life.' The Hugels had lived in the home for 40 years, and an elderly woman lived upstairs as their tenant, Harter said. No visible trauma was observed on the victims' bodies, police said. Carbon monoxide, an odorless and colorless gas, is created when some fuels are burned. Hugel was found in the seat of his car in the garage and his wife was found in the room directly next to the garage, reports The New York Post. The scene:  Police stand outside the floral park home where four elderly people were found dead and where to windows are now wide open in an attempt to ventilate the apparent fume filled house . The couple’s friend, age 73, had been seated in the living room and the tenant, who sources said was older than 60, was found on the second floor at the top of the stairs. Neighbors were heartbroken after hearing about the deaths. 'It looks like it was accident, someone just forgot to turn the car off,' a source told The New York Daily News. 'The windows were air-tight, so there was nowhere for the gas to go.' 'It is very surreal,' said Barbara Stoja. 'We knew them for over 35 years. They were very fun people, they were dancers.' 'This is something you see on TV. It is so sad we all know each other to know he is not going to be there anymore.' Stoja said that Jerry Hugel was an avid gardener. 'He was just talking to my husband about planting tomatoes,' she said. Open windows: The four elderly people who died are thought to have been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning and police opened the windows of their home in an attempt to ventilate it . Stunned: Bystanders surround the Floral Park, Queens home where four elderly people died . 'He and my husband compare gardens all the time.' Neighbor Melissa O'Reilly said that the Hugels were avid dancers who loved their German heritage. 'They were such nice people, it’s really sad,' said Melissa O'Reilly, whose parents have lived on the block for three decades. 'They are a really nice family, everyone loves them, just good people, their kids are very nice.' O'Reilly said she knew the family for about 30 years. 'I grew up here, we always called them Mr. and Mrs. Hugel,' O’Reilly said. 'They have lived in that house before my parents moved here, and that was 30 years ago.' The deaths come on the heels of other deadly carbon monoxide incidents that killed at least 10 people on the Eastern Seaboard in recent weeks. A man and his seven children were found dead Monday in a home in Princess Anne, Maryland, where they apparently were poisoned in their sleep while running a generator after a utility cut power to their home on the state's Eastern Shore. The utility, Delmarva Power, said it cut off electricity for safety reasons on March 25, although relatives said the family was behind on its power bills. The family was last seen alive March 28. Saddened: Bystanders gather at the scene where four people were found dead on  Friday, April 10 . On Wednesday, a woman and her 7-year-old daughter were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in their home in East Orange, New Jersey. Prosecutors said a utility company had shut off power at the home on Tuesday and a gas generator was being used there without proper ventilation. There was an inoperable carbon monoxide detector in that home, they said. City Councilman Mark Weprin, who represents the area including Floral Park, said he hoped the tragedy would shed light on the importance of having and maintaining carbon monoxide detectors in all homes and apartments. 'My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and families of the victims,'  he said in an emailed statement.

"When he was just three weeks old, Kibulu the African lion cub met Donna Wilson. Kibulu’s mother had rejected him in favour of his siblings and zoo keepers quickly decided it wasn’t safe for him to stay. So they called Donna from Zambi Wildlife Retreat in Western Sydney. ‘We named him Kibulu, which is Swahili for blue, because he had these unusual electric blue eyes when he arrived,’ Ms Wilson told Daily Mail Australia. Nine months later, and weighing close to 80 kilograms, Kibulu still shares Donna’s bed most nights. He still carries his teddy bear around with him and he loves to suck on people’s thumbs. ‘This morning he just wouldn’t get out of bed, he’s a total sook,’ she said. Scroll down for video . Zambi Wildlife Retreat fostered Kibulu as a three-week-old cub after his mother rejected him at the NSW Zoo where he was born . Kibulu greets one of the Zambi Wildlife Retreat directors, Traci Griffiths, at the centre in Western Sydney . Since he arrived at the retreat as a 3-week-old cub, Kibulu has slept most nights in director Donna's bed with 'Teddy' Zambi Wildlife Retreat's Donna Wilson with Kibulu, the orphaned nine-month-old African lion who has shared her bed since he arrived as a three-week-old cub . Kibulu is one of 23 lions in Donna’s care at Zambi Wildlife retreat, a sanctuary for retired, old, injured and homeless animals set on a 50 acre property south of Penrith in western Sydney. The retreat – which is not yet open to the public – is home to lions, tigers, monkeys, dingoes, parrots, rescued farm and domestic animals from all over Australia. 'Many of the animals already lived on the property and I've cared for them for  years’, says Wilson, who has worked in animal rescue and as a zoo keeper  in Australia and overseas for more than 20 years, as well as training big cats for film and television. She says zoos will often have surplus animals from their breeding programs or they might have too many males for an enclosure, who then start to fight like they would in the wild. Some of the animals at Zambi also starred in the movie industry in the days before  computer imaging and special effects. There are only two circuses in Australia – the Lennon Brothers and Stardust - that still use monkeys and lions in their tents. Donna says the laws around circus animals in Australia are especially tough. 'They're very well loved and cared-for animals and when we talk to them, they just want the best for their animals, for them to be spoilt when they  retire,' she says. ‘We’ll be given a lot of older animals, which is good because we can give them a good life here - it's literally like a retirement home for exotic animals. ‘We’re the first and only exotic animal retreat in Australia.' Just one of the pride: Kibulu and director Traci share a moment at the retreat . Australian supermodel Jennifer Hawkins celebrated her 31st birthday this year with one of the pride at Zambi Wildlife Retreat . Australian model Cheyenne Tozzi also took time out from her international modelling career recently to hang out with the cubs at Zambi . Zambi Wildlife Retreat (ZWR) is an entirely volunteer run non-profit organisation, set up by Donna and fellow directors Silke Bader and Traci Giffiths when they took over management of the property in 2012. Though not yet open to the public, over 20 students are currently completing work placements at Zambi as part of their Certificate III in Captive Animal Management at Tafe and universities. The organisation is in the process of applying for an exhibition license so that they can open the retreat  for public visits and offer Master classes in large carnivores for students in the future. ‘There are some things I can’t teach,’ says Wilson, who has been hospitalized more than a few times working with the big cats in the early years of her career. ‘It’s a feeling you get from the animals, you have to be able to read their signs –but that’s something you can only learn from experience,' she says. ‘What I can teach is how to look after these kind of animals the way they need to be looked after; I can offer practical placements where students can get the real experience, get close to the animals, observe them and really learn from them.’ One of Kibulu's favourite things to do is suck on people's thumbs. People can now support Zambi Wildlife Retreat by 'adopting' an animal like Kibulu or his best friend Mali, another adopted cub . Zambi Wildlife Retreat's Donna Wilson with Kibulu, the orphaned nine-month-old African lion . Donna Wilson hopes to eventually be able to open the retreat  for public visits and  to offer master classes in large carnivores for students .

Zambi Volunteer and Executive Assistant, Jack Bevin, with some of the dingoes rescued by the Sydney retreat . Special bond: Jack helped raise Zambi, a 'friendly' lioness who was born at the Sydney wildlife retreat . Zambi Wildlife Retreat is also home to exotic birds like peacocks and native Australian wildlife . The retreat also provides a rescue service for abused or neglected farm animals like horses, goats, donkeys and pigs . The retreat is expecting its electricity bills to go through the roof as it provides extra heating for some of its more delicate residents coming into winter . The centre is also looking to expand its facilities to include a native wildlife rehabilitation centre which it hopes will support the work of WIRES (Australia's Wildlife Information and Rescue Service) and attract international students for practical animal care placements in the future. ‘But all of this costs big bucks,’ Wilson says ‘All the money we receive is from donations and it all goes into the care of the animals. Ideally I want to rebuild all the animal enclosures but one new lion enclosure will cost us $70,000.’ For now, the public can support the retreat by adopting one of the animals in the Zambi pride like Kibulu or by becoming a paid member of the retreat. Kibulu and his best friend Mali, another  nine-month-old lion, will soon join  older sisters Zambi and Sukari in one of the facility's larger enclosures. But for now, while he's still happy to share a bed with his human mum, Donna says he’ll be allowed to continue sleeping in the big house.

"In lederhosen and knee-high socks, Adolf Hitler lounges against a tree in a pose more twit than tyrant. It is little surprise the Fuhrer later banned the absurdly camp woodland snap, calling it ‘beneath one’s dignity’. But the rare archive photo, and several other portraits as comical as they are chilling, have been discovered in a Hitler ‘fan magazine’ from the Thirties. In lederhosen and knee-high socks, Adolf Hitler lounges against a tree. The Fuhrer later banned the absurdly camp woodland snap, calling it ‘beneath one’s dignity’ Hitler seems ill at ease with his hands, squeezing them into his tight lederhosen pockets in one photo, and perching them awkwardly on his hips in another. In one ridiculous picture, he tilts his head and tries a mean and moody stare to camera, topped off by a military cap. It must have felt better than it looked, for after seeing the portrait, he never wore the cap again. In another photo, Hitler tries to strike a casual-yet-serious pose as he balances on the edge of a log cabin veranda showing off his knobbly knees. A snap of him relaxing in a deckchair in a meadow is proof, were it needed, that in those days leaders did not have expert public relations advisers close at hand. The theatrical wartime leader’s personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann took many of the black and white photos for Hitler’s own use. But they ended up in the Hitler fanzine - Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awaken) - full of hero worship and pin-up pictures of the Fuhrer, published by his fervent henchman Baldur von Shirach. A tattered copy of the magazine was found by a British soldier in a bombed German house after the war. Souvenir-hunting Pioneer Corps private Alf Roberts, from Barnsley, Yorkshire, brought it home along with a German medal and bayonet. Now, 70 years later, military historians have had it translated and are about to publish it in Britain. Von Shirach gushes: ‘We who have had the privilege of being able to work with him have come to worship and love him.’ He describes the mass-murdering monster as ‘honest, steadfast and modest’ displaying ‘strength and kindness’ and whose ‘soul brushed against the stars’. The theatrical wartime leader’s personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann took many of the black and white photos for Hitler’s own use, but they ended up in the Hitler fanzine - Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awaken) His poetic fawning continues page after page, but the magazine is nonetheless a compelling read thanks to the ludicrous vanity of the Fuhrer photos. Von Shirach was only 18 when he met Hitler in Munich in 1925. He quickly moved up the National Socialist ranks through his leadership of the Nazi students association. In 1945 he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in Berlin-Spandau prison. He died in 1974. Photographer Hoffmann died in 1957. He had also introduced Hitler to his assistant, Eva Braun, who became his lover and died with him in 1945. Translation of the ‘fanzine’ was made difficult by it having been buried in the rubble of a bombed house and having suffered water damage. But with salvaged illustrations and some replacement photos, it is to be published this month by military experts Pen & Sword Books under the title The Rise of Hitler. Translator Trevor Salisbury said: ‘The book is typical of the propaganda of the time, with the obvious non-critical acceptance of everything Hitler was and what he stood for. ‘It attempted to present him as a peace-loving man who dearly loved children and was kind to all. As we all know, the truth was completely different.’","Hitler 'fan magazine'   has been discovered and will be published in Britain .

"Kristen Bell, the voice of Frozen's Anna and the spunky star of House of Lies, believes that parents take the anti-vaccination debate too far and endanger other kids while they are at it. 'Your child is 100 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to have a severe reaction to a vaccine; that's a fact,' Kristen said in an interview for the May issue of Good Housekeeping. The mother of two daughters, Lincoln, two, and Delta, just four months, with actor Dax Sheppard shares how her views on vaccinations actually changed after the birth of her girls, as well as her own self-acceptance of her changing body and the hustle of her acting career. Scroll down for video . Cover girl: Frozen's Kristen Bell features on the front cover of Good Housekeeping's May issue (pictured) Kristen takes a hard stance on vaccinating her kids and urges other parents to do so as well. Citing scientific research, she shares her intimate belief that it's her duty to not only protect her children, but other children, too - especially those who may suffer from autoimmune diseases or cancer. 'If your kid can't get vaccinations; if he goes to school with my kid and I choose not to give my kid vaccinations, I'm putting your kid at risk,' she said. 'To me, that's unacceptable.' 'As moms, our responsibility is not just to our kids - it's to all the other kids, too,' she added. Kristen adds that being a mother 'right-sized' her life and has changed her views on more than needles and preventative medicine. Kristen didn't have her first child until her thirties because she didn't actually think she wanted children at all. Now, however, she considers the parent life 'unmissable.' 'Having kids feels like that first seventh-grade crush that overwhelms every molecule in your body, but it’s permanent,' Kristen said. Peas in a pod: Kristen and husband Dax Sheppard credit couples therapy to the success of their marriage . On the town: Kristen and Dax may come from different backgrounds, but they sure don't look it while coordinating their pose on the arrivals carpet of The Judge premier in October 2014 . Always a self-proclaimed happy person, Kristen, like many women, was not always comfortable with her weight. But after kids, she really is not worried about the last 17 pregnancy pounds from Delta. ""Body image is what you make of it,' Kristen explained. 'I don’t like comparison hangovers. It didn't make me feel good.' Nor does she rush for leads in the same way she did before. Pointing out that her kids are the source of her self-esteem now, Kristen still wants to do creative work, but isn't constantly running on the treadmill for it. Her positive attitude is admired by husband, Dax, who makes a cameo in the piece to talk about the secret to their relationship's success: couple's therapy. Often given a bad rep or the signal of the demise of the marriage, Dax and Kristen highlight all the pros of their experience, including how it helped them overcome their different backgrounds. 'You do better in the gym with a trainer, you don’t figure out how to cook without reading a recipe,' Kristen added. 'Therapy is not something to be embarrassed about.' In fact, her life looks quite different than it did just a few years ago. “It’s weird to me that all of a sudden I have a family of four,' Kristen exclaimed. 'I own two people! Our life has taken a turn, but not in a bad way.'","The Frozen star features on the cover of Good Housekeeping's May issue, in which she also discusses her relationship with husband Dax Sheppard .

"The casket of promising basketball player Lauren Hill has been moved into the 10,000-seater arena where she made her first basket in a college game just five months ago. The 19-year-old defied doctors' expectations after she was diagnosed with a rare form of inoperable brain cancer just after her 18th birthday. She was told she would not live past December but died four months later this month after playing with her college team at Mount St Joseph University in Cincinnati to raise $1.5million for research into childhood cancer. Scroll down for video . The casket of  basketball player Lauren Hill was placed at the site where she made her first basket five months ago, before she died of an inoperable brain tumour this month. Her high school team mates gathered to remember her at a memorial today in the arena where she scored her first basket for her college team . Today mourners at the arena celebrated her life and determination in the face of the obstacles she overcame in her short life. Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma after she became dizzy following a basketball game with her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The tumour is found on the brain stem and can cause double vision and difficulty controlling facial expressions. Due to its position at the back of the brain treatment can be particularly difficult and it is impossible to operate on, making prognosis poor. After doctors found the tumour just after the teenager's 18th birthday she was told she had just two years left. But in September, as her condition worsened, she was told she would not last until December. The Mount St Joseph freshman devoted her final year to playing basketball, raising money for cancer research, and inspiring others. She played four games, raising $1.5million for pediatric cancer and leaving a legacy of fundraising that will be continued after her death. When her condition began to worsen and she became too ill to play, Hill helped out the team as a coach. Lauren Hill was a keen basketball player but she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was inoperable and significantly changed her appearance as she resolved to carry on playing in the final months of her life (right) The treatment she had significantly altered her appearance but she was determined to keep playing and raising funds for as along as she could. Before the season started, the US Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. This was noted again at the women's Final Four a week ago. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. Basketball star LeBron James posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. Hill is seen shooting a lay up during the November 2 game - her first for the Mount St Joseph's team . During her first NCAA college basketball game on November Hill gave a thumbs-up as she holds the ball . 'She made you think:"" What am I doing with my life?"" said Lexy Saraswate, 19, a Xavier student who volunteered to work at the memorial service. ""How can I be a better person?"" 'Just her courage. I felt that was the thing: What do you do when you're staring death in the face? She set a goal for herself and accomplished it, even surpassed it. She's an inspiration.' Hill's casket was brought by a hearse to Xavier's Cintas Center - the site where she made a left-handed layup to open a Division III game on November 2. The match was moved forward to this date with permission of the NCAA because of her declining condition. Hill parents, Brent (left, front) and LIsa (right) entered the Cintas Center for their daughter's memorial . Hill's high school basketball team, the Lawrenceburg Tigers, carried her jersey and a net into the memorial . Memorabilia from Hill's basketball career including a ball, net and her jersey, were placed by the casket . The public memorial was held at Xavier University in Cincinnati, with Hill's casket decorated with flowers . Mr and Mrs Hill (right) followed the casket at the conclusion of the hour-long memorial service in Cincinnati . The arena was packed for the game, which started with a set play to get her a left-handed layup. She also made a right-handed layup late in the game, sealing the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. The backboard and basket were off to the side, with the attached game clock and shot clock set to 22 — her number. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . Coach Dan Benjamin gently kissed her gray No. 22 jersey before stretching it over the casket. Former teammates dabbed their eyes with tissues as they sat in folding chairs on the floor. A few thousand people stood silently in the stands. 'She has revealed to us that one person can make a difference,' said Dr. Mariko DeWire, one of her physicians. 'She truly is our victorious hero.' A video of the layup she made only 17 seconds into Mount St. Joseph's 66-55 win over Hiram College in the season-opening game was also played. In a highly personal one hour ceremony songs from the basketball player's iPod were played. The second song on her playlist was James Taylor's 'You've Got A Friend.' One of her favorite songs — Katy Perry's 'Roar' — was played as her casket was wheeled out to a standing ovation. Hill will be buried in a private service on Wednesday. Family photos flanked the casket, along with a photo of her in a cape and a quote from actor Christopher Reeve: 'A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere in spite of overwhelming obstacles.' Hill tried to make the last months of her life about helping and inspiring other people. Through a nonprofit foundation, she helped to raise roughly $1.5 million for research into pediatric cancer. Shortly before she died, she set a goal of raising $2.2 million — matching her uniform number. Hill's team mates at Mount St Joseph University gathered to remember the teenager and her efforts . Mourners were played a video which showed her achievements during her successful basketball career . People gathered to attend the one hour long memorial service at Xavier University in Cincinnati .

"A racegoer has been questioned by police after he was seen on video deliberately knocking an elderly man to the floor, who then needed to be taken to hospital. The man, who is seen unsteady on his feet and swaying after the day at the races in Aintree, barges into the 63-year-old who then stumbles backwards and falls to the floor in the middle of the road. The 34-year-old man, dressed in a suit, then walks off as people gasp and try to help the victim who was left lying on the floor. Scroll down for video . An Aintree racegoer is seen staggering towards an elderly man, before he barges into him and knocks him onto the floor into a road, leaving the man injured and lying on the floor as he walks off . He was later taken to hospital and treated for bruising on his face. Merseyside Police said the 34-year-old from Formby in Sefton came forward to police late last night and he was interviewed under caution about the alleged assault. He was released this morning pending further inquiries. The man was named on social media as a manager called Terry. Philip Dears, who took the video, posted on Facebook today: 'I have a 2 minute long video of my mate Terry drunk walking home from the races on Thursday, during which he staggers and accidentally bumps into an old man. The man falls and I'm filming the whole situation trying not to laugh. 'When I realise the seriousness of the situation the phone goes off, the laughing stops and I check on the old man, he is hurt on the floor but is being seen to by stewards awaiting medical attention. I turned my attention to Terry and wanted to make sure he gets home safety.' In the post Mr Dears said he and his wife phoned the hospital to check on the elderly man's condition. He also claims the video, which appears on YouTube, has been edited to make it appear the old man was deliberately targeted when this was not the case. The man stumbles backwards and falls, as the video is filmed by a sniggering friend of the alleged perpetrator . He added: 'When you see the video you will see this is a total accidental collision, it's important people get this truth because a lot of people are very upset and I can see why because it looks like a malicious, cowardly attack but this is far from the reality of the situation. ' The footage was brought to the attention of officers by members of the public who had shared it online. Police established the mobile phone footage, shot by a friend of the 34-year-old, was taken outside the racecourse on Thursday evening at about 7pm. He shouts to him 'text bomb' and 'is there any need?' moments before the incident happens as he sniggers uncontrollably from behind his phone. In the video, onlookers can be heard gasping in shock and seen rushing to the man's aid before calling for an ambulance. Officers said the man who was knocked to the floor is from Skelmersdale in West Lancashire. People have expressed their shock at the video. The 63-year-old man is seen standing on the pavement before the other man barges into him and knocks him . He becomes unsteady on his feet from the impact and begins to stumble, before he tumbles backwards . Gasps can be heard on the mobile phone footage as members of the public rush to help the injured man . Paul Hardman wrote: 'That video of the old man at Aintree makes me sick to the stomach. Some absolute scum in this world.' Others labelled his behaviour 'disgusting' and 'vile.' Hayley Wills added: 'Hope that horrible man that knocked over the old chap at Aintree gets what he deserves, as well as the sick person that filmed it.' Merseyside Police earlier thanked visitors for making the annual race 'such a safe and enjoyable occasion' and said no arrests were made inside the ground over the three days. An online crowdfunding page has been set up to help the injured man.Concerned wellwishers have already raised £345 to help the pensioner with his recovery after Joanne Dickson saw Gary's response and launched the fundraising campaign. Page owner Joanne said: 'Most of us tonight have watched the horrible video of the gentleman being knocked to the ground. 'I'm hoping we can raise enough to maybe help him replace his teeth and his phone. 'I don't know the gentleman, I would just like him to know that most decent people are disgusted that, even if the knock was an accident, that no remorse was shown.'","Man is seen swaying and then barging into a 63-year-old outside Aintree .

"When Jade Walters loaned out her beloved horse Magic to help a young girl learn to ride, she didn't realise she would never see him again. Miss Walters, 21, was horrified to discover that the family looking after Magic had sold him at auction for just £200. Magic's fate has sparked fury in the equestrian community, and an appeal for his whereabouts has been shared 58,000 times on social media sites. Jade Walters, 21, was shocked to discover the family she loaned her beloved pet horse Magic to had sold the animal (pictured right and left being ridden by Miss Walters) for £200 . Selling a horse at auction is notoriously risky – bidders are not vetted and some horses are bought for slaughter. Miss Walters said: 'We would never in a million years have considered sending Magic to auction – they're horrible places. The thought makes me cry.' It was two months before she discovered the horse had been sold – making it all the more difficult to trace Magic, who could have been taken out of the country or sold to an abattoir. Miss Walters, who had owned the 17-year-old chestnut pony for seven years, said: 'I consider him like a child, he thinks of me as his mum and he's been taken from me. My heart is broken. 'He could be anywhere by now, I don't know how to find him and even if we do, what state will he be in?' The care assistant from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, advertised for a temporary owner last year after the cost of his upkeep went over £4,000 a year. A woman in the West Country responded and took Magic to help her daughter improve her riding. Miss Walters pictured with her new horse Lad after her previous pet was sold at auction without her knowledge . Miss Walters said: 'He was getting very expensive. Loaning a horse is common for people who can't afford the expense of the purchase but can afford the upkeep. So while they don't have ownership, they have a duty of care. 'I was naive. The woman I loaned to seemed very respectable and said she wanted her 12-year-old daughter to get more experience riding.' But after six months, Magic's temporary owner said keeping the pony was too expensive and he was proving too difficult for her daughter to ride. They agreed that she would help Miss Walters look for an experienced rider to buy him for £500. But just 12 days later, on February 10, Magic was auctioned. However, Miss Walters did not find out until last week when she decided to bring Magic home. 'He has always been treated like a prince, so being fought over at an auction by a crowd looking for a quick deal makes me sick.' Her mother Julia, 53, said the woman had no right to auction Magic, adding: 'The arrangement was that if she had any interested parties, she would pass them to me. 'In no way was Magic to be sold without our knowledge.' Last night, the seller insisted there was 'another side to the story', but declined to comment further.","Jade Walters, 21, loaned her horse Magic to help a young girl learn to ride .

'And he goes, wait a minute, you have so many. Did you know the guy?' Madonna said as the punchline and then explained why it was funny. 'So I decided to move up the food chain and started dating a 28-year-old,' she said. Closet comedienne: The pop icon decided to give stand-up a shot for the first time on The Tonight Show . After admiring her Picasso her boy-toy asked if he also painted the Mona Lisa. 'We broke up,' Madonna said. 'I just wanted to say there is an upside to dating younger guys, that is they're really good with phones,' Madonna joked. 'I crack myself up,' she said at one point. At another point, which was perhaps the most excruciating, she said of one of her jokes: 'It's funny, isn't it?' However some commentators said Madge was fantastic. They pointed out she was just having some fun. HitFix called it 'adorable', while Perez Hilton found it 'hilarious'. Breaking it down: Madge also tried to show Fallon some of her dance moves . Madonna joined Jimmy Fallon and The Roots on Thursday night for a rendition of Holiday with classroom instruments . Madonna had recently revealed to Jonathan Ross on his chat show that she wanted to try her hand at stand-up comedy. She added to Fallon that her concert tours are so elaborate and cost 'a billion dollars' to make and transport, so 'no one makes any money'. She said she was drawn to the simplicity of just walking out on stage and talking. In taking over The Tonight Show, she first joined Fallon and The Roots for an acoustic version of her 1983 hit Holiday using nothing but classroom instruments. During her interview with Jimmy told him how she 'was not cool enough' for her kids. 'They remind me everyday how uncool I am. They tell me everyday that I can't be basic. ''Mom, that's so basic.''' she said. She reminisced fondly of her early days in the music business when there were no expectations. The singer contrasted her early years trying to make it New York City to today's artists with social media at their fingertips. 'You had to take cassette tapes to clubs. You had to do shows and perform live,' she said . After the sit-down interview, she closed by performing Bitch I'm Madonna, a song from her new album., Rebel Heart. The performance featured DJ Diplo and a posse of back-up dancings snaking through the halls of 30 Rock.","Stand-up routine on The Tonight Show on Thursday branded 'a bomb'

"Zoe Gregory (pictured) pleaded guilty to sending an email hoax to blow up the school where she worked . A schoolgirl was branded ‘Holly bin Laden’ by other pupils after a teaching assistant framed her for a bomb hoax, a court heard yesterday. Holly Littlefield, 16, was arrested and held in a police cell for 14 hours after Zoe Gregory, 26, hijacked her email account to issue the threat to blow up the school. She was too scared to return to school for two days and when she did she was taunted by classmates. The teenager told the court how after she was arrested she was ‘crying and distressed’ and struggled to sleep in the cell surrounded by ‘people on drugs or drunk’. Even after she was released on bail, she remained under suspicion for nearly three weeks until checks revealed Gregory was responsible. Another pupil, Vicky Francis, 15, was also arrested after police were told she had access to Holly’s email account. Gregory, a married mother-of-two who said she was suffering from depression at the time of the offence and could not face work, is now likely to receive a lengthy jail term after admitting to communicating false information. Magistrate Jeanne Heal said the case was being referred to the Crown court for sentencing, telling the defendant: ‘What makes this a worse offence than you might imagine is that two young girls were in custody for more than ten hours and were interviewed by police. ‘They were also on bail and during that time they must have been under stress. You deserve a greater punishment than we can give.’ Speaking afterwards, Holly’s mother Lesley, 43, said: ‘We are pleased she has admitted it. ‘The girls have been through a horrible time at school and hopefully now their classmates will realise the truth.’ Vicky added: ‘I feel sorry for her children because they didn’t know what was going on but I think she should go to jail.’ Pupils Vicky Francis (pictured left) and Holly Littlefield (right) outside Norwich Magistrates' Court. The pair were arrested and held by police following the bomb threat sent from Miss Littlefield's account . Bomb threat: Ormiston Victory Academy in Costessey near Norwich (pictured) where the scare took place . The girls’ ordeal began on February 9, when police officers arrived at Ormiston Victory Academy in Costessey, near Norwich, to arrest them. Both were fingerprinted, had DNA samples taken and had to pose for mugshots before they interviewed. They denied any knowledge of the bomb scare and were released on police bail early the following day. Holly’s home was also searched and police seized the family’s computer and three iPhones. Prosecutor Lisa Britton told Norwich magistrates: ‘Holly was asked lots of questions about the email. She said in a statement she didn’t know what was going on.’ Vicky had also been left ‘scared and crying’ by the experience and suffered taunts at school, she added. Officers had acted after Gregory told the vice principal she had found an email in her inbox which warned: ‘There will be a bomb in school on Monday.’ Gregory (pictured second from left) arriving at Norwich Magistrates' Court. Chris Brown, mitigating, said she had been suffering from post-natal depression and acted out of 'sheer desperation' when she sent the email . Facing jail: Gregory has been warned she could face up to seven years in prison due to the seriousness of the offence. An Ormiston Academies Trust spokesman said the 29-year-old had been dismissed from her job . In fact, she had overheard Holly’s email password and used it to access the schoolgirl’s account. It was only later that police discovered the IP address of the hoax email originated from a computer at the home of Gregory’s father. Holly said outside court: ‘I was treated like a criminal. One officer asked me, “Do you regret what you have done?” and I said “I haven’t done anything"". ‘During my interview they told me that if it had been a joke I should just tell them. I even thought about admitting it just so I could leave, but I could not do that as I had not done anything. ‘It quickly got right round the school that I had been arrested. When they found out it was because of a bomb hoax, people were running up to me and saying “Have you got a bomb?” ‘I was even being called “Holly bin Laden”. It was so upsetting because I have never been in trouble with the police before.’ Holly Littlefield with her mum Lesley. Pupils dubbed Miss Littlefield 'Holly Bin Laden' following the incident . Chris Brown, defending, said his client came up with the ‘ill-conceived and unsophisticated’ hoax while suffering postnatal depression after the birth of her second child. He asked the magistrates to show her mercy and give her a suspended sentence for the ‘dreadful error of judgment’. But they decided to send the case to Norwich Crown Court where the maximum sentence she could receive is seven years. A school spokesman said: ‘The staff member involved has been dismissed and we are doing everything we can to support the students involved. We will not tolerate any action which disrupts the education of students at our school.’ Gregory declined to comment after the hearing.","Zoe Gregory, 26, hijacked pupil's email and threatened to blow up school .

"It was due to be a routine mission to examine the depths of the Gulf of Mexico. However, researchers were stunned when their underwater robosub had an unexpected encounter almost 2,000 feet under the ocean. Rather than the deep sea squid and corals they expected to see, a giant sperm whale swam to inspect their sub - causing gasps and shouts of 'holy cow' from the sub's operators. Scroll down for video . The robot sub was examining the depths of the Gulf of Mexico when the sperm whale suddenly appeared . The sperm whale is the largest toothed whale. Adult males reach 16-20 meters (50-65 feet) in length, although most are less than 18 meters (60 ft). Females are much smaller than males, reaching only 11 meters (36 feet) on average. The sperm whale's life is based on sound. It finds food and navigates using sound and it communicates and stays in touch with its family using sound. Sperm whales are listed as an endangered species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The global population size is estimated as somewhere between 100,000-300,000 animals. 'What the heck is that?' says one of the crew, when all of a sudden a massive object begins to appear on the screen.'Hello baby,' says another. 'At 598 meters (1,962 ft) below the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, ROV Hercules encountered a magnificent sperm whale,' 'The whale circled several times and gave our cameras the chance to capture some incredible footage of this beautiful creature. 'Encounters between sperm whales and ROV's are quite rare.' Footage shows the curious leviathan swimming in and out of the camera lights, at times spinning and looking directly into the camera.'You can see its eye,' one of the crew says. 'According to biologists we've consulted, the animal on the video is likely a juvenile, especially if it's a male,' they say. 'General consensus among the experts who have examined the video is that it is a male, though the video of the underside of the whale is grainy so it is difficult to know with 100% certainty.' It was difficult to tell the actual size of the whale, the team say, but the ROV is 6 feet wide in the front. Using this as a guide, and how close he was to the vehicle, it is estimated the whale was between 35-40 feet in length. The team also investigated the scarring visible on the whale. 'It could be a number of things, including squid tentacles and suckers, especially the scars around the efface and mouth; but likely not propeller scars like the comments made in the video. This neutrally buoyant yellow remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is the workhorse of the Nautilus Exploration Program, and it always used in tandem with Argus, it's mothership. Hercules is equipped with six thrusters that allow the pilots to 'fly' it in any direction. It has two manipulator arms designed for collecting samples and recovering artifacts. Video from Hercules' high-definition main camera is streamed up a fiber-optic cable to the control van on Nautilus, then out to the world. It is capable of operating down to 4,000 meters. 'It could also be from other sperm whales. 'They often jaw each other when playing or socializing. 'Sperm whales are identified with the scars on the trailing edge of their tails.' The whale can be seen inspecting the robosub in the video . The researchers were piloting the Hercules sub when the encounter occured.

"A Tory councillor with a history of odd behaviour was told to put down his knife and fork after being caught tucking into a roast duck dinner during a council meeting. Jonny Bucknell, 58, was enjoying his meal in the council chamber when a Labour rival, Theo Blackwell, spotted him and alerted other councillors. He was forced to put down his cutlery when the mayor, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, interrupted the proceedings to tell him off. Taking a stand: Jonny Bucknell is no stranger to odd behaviour. In 2013 he slept in his car at the Tory party conference. He now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings . The mayor, who was chairing the meeting of Camden Council in north London, reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber. But the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change. The rumpus comes a month after Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Elengorn was caught playing Scrabble during a Richmond Council budget meeting in south-west London. Telling off: Mayor of Camden Council, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, had to tell Mr Bucknell to stop eating . When he first noticed him eating, Mr Blackwell told his fellow councillors: 'It appears that one of our Tory colleagues is consuming a full Sunday roast dinner in the council chamber. 'Could I ask the borough solicitor to give us advice on eating a full roast dinner in the council chamber? It's a little bit more than a cheeky Snickers.' The diner was forced to curtail his meal. Mr Bucknell, who has been a councillor for more than ten years and represents Belsize, Hampstead, told the Evening Standard: 'I never knew there was a ban on eating in the chamber. 'They should definitely repeal it. There is nothing wrong with nibbling from a lunch box if you are being discreet. 'It is not as if a cold meal is going to waft around like a McDonald's. 'I will be campaigning for the repealing of the law that says you can't nibble from a lunch box in the council chamber.' The Conservative councillor said the meal, in a plastic box, had travelled home with him after a French snowboarding holiday. 'The chalet always brought out too much food and I can't stand wasting food,' he said. He previously found fame when he slept in his Volvo car to save on hotel bills during the Conservative party conference in September 2013. Mr Bucknell said at the time it was to make a stand against what he called 'ridiculous prices'. He said the economy would improve if more people were thrifty like him. After the council meeting mayor Lazzaro Pietragnoli said: 'I understand councillors do a difficult job and sometimes don't get time to eat dinner. 'I also tend to be quite flexible, but having a big meal in front of him - that was a bit too much.' A Camden Council spokesman said: 'It is as the mayor said, standing orders say that members should not eat in the chamber.'

"As secret agent James Bond, Daniel Craig has a license to kill, but on Tuesday the United Nations gave the British actor a 'license to save' by appointing him as the first global advocate for the elimination of mines and explosive hazards. Craig - who's often seen standing dangerously close to explosions as the dapper, martini-drinking agent 007 - will spend the next three years raising awareness for the U.N. Mine Action Service and political and financial support for the cause. 'You have been given a license to kill (as James Bond), I'm now giving you a license to save,' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told Craig at United Nations headquarters in New York. Scroll down for video . Anti-mine advocate: Daniel Craig, despite having a job where his job is often to pretend to blow things up, was named on Tuesday the first global advocate for the United Nations' Mine Action Service . Often around explosions: Craig - who's often seen standing dangerously close to explosions as the dapper, martini-drinking agent 007 - will spend the next three years raising awareness for the U.N. Mine Action Service and political and financial support for the cause . The United Nations said 162 States are parties to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. Last year, the United Nations said it destroyed more than 400,000 land mines and explosive remnants of war and more than 2,000 tons of obsolete ammunition. 'I am honored to accept this role, I'm humbled that I will get the chance to work next to people who are risking their lives every day to help ordinary people live ordinary lives,' said Craig. 'I will do my very best.' Craig continued: . 'The briefing from the Secretary-General, and from all of the United Nations staff I have met, demonstrated the enormity of the task. 'The use of improvised explosive devices in Iraq, Somalia and Mali; the widespread use of 'barrel bombs' in Syria, and the landmine contamination in Cambodia, Colombia and Afghanistan must all be addressed simultaneously. It is a big job. The United Nations needs political and financial support to succeed.' Long post: Craig will spend the next three years raising awareness for the U.N.

"As James Bond, he is licensed to kill. But it takes a great deal of artistic licence for Daniel Craig's character to survive his on-screen ordeals, medical experts say. For in real life 007 would have perished several times in his most recent movie, Skyfall. The incidents that ought to have been fatal include one before the opening credits rolled that would have 'turned his lungs out'. Craig is clearly a lot more vulnerable than his alter-ego – he has just had knee surgery after hurting himself in a stunt for the next Bond movie, Spectre. Only in the movies... Daniel Craig in fighting form as Bond despite a potentially fatal wound . But Bond is not the only one to defy medical science. Writing for Total Film magazine, the experts say many characters in other top films would also have struggled to escape alive from their injuries. They include John McClane – played by Bruce Willis – in Die Hard, the serial killer in Halloween and, perhaps more surprisingly, three of the cast of family comedy Home Alone. This is their verdict. Skyfall [2012] . The fifth Bond film may well have been called You Only Live Twice but in Daniel Craig's most recent outing as Bond he should have died at least three times, according to the medical experts. If 007 had been a mere mortal, the film would have ended after seven minutes – rather than lasting two hours and 23 minutes. Right at the beginning, Bond is hit in the chest by a shell laced with radioactive uranium, the type of weapon usually used to destroy tanks. 'The exit wound would have shattered his shoulder blade,' says Total Film's medical adviser Dr Bertie Garbutt. 'Bond would not have survived. A depleted uranium shell going at any kind of speed would've passed straight through him, turned his lungs inside out and killed him.' Yet Bond survives and only five minutes later plummets off a train, 260ft into the river below. According to Dr Garbutt, such a fall would probably have broken his neck or severed his spinal cord. If he survived that, he would almost certainly have drowned. Bond's own medical techniques aren't up to much, either. Thirty-one minutes in to Skyfall, he decides to remove that pesky bullet from his shoulder – not something Dr Garbutt would recommend. Daniel Craig as James Bond removes a bullet from his shoulder - a procedure experts say would have led to infection, unconsciousness, blood loss and severe muscle and nerve damage . Such a clumsy manoeuvre would have led to infection, unconsciousness, blood loss and severe muscle and nerve damage. Oh, and the bits of uranium from the shell floating around his system might well have given him cancer. Bond's retirement would not have been a blissful one. He would have been extremely hard of hearing, thanks to the grenades and gunfire that wrecked his Skyfall estate in Scotland an hour and 54 minutes into the film. His eardrums would almost certainly have been perforated. Only eight minutes later, a deafened Bond plunges into an icy loch and, while underwater, fights a pursuer to the death – not a prospect he was in the best shape for. 'Fighting means he would use oxygen quickly; so it's improbable he'd get out in time,' says Dr Garbutt, adding: 'Hypothermia would set in very quickly and he'd struggle to move.' Die Hard [1988] . John McClane, Bruce Willis's maverick New York cop in the Die Hard series, should by rights have done exactly that – die. In real life, Bruce Willis' John McClane would never have survived long enough to smash through a plate glass window in the first Die Hard movie . A posse of baddies have rounded up a group of hostages, including McClane's wife, in a Los Angeles skyscraper. In his bid to rescue them, McClane starts out as a bit of a softie. He's 35 minutes into the film, when the poor lamb hits his head against a plaster wall and tumbles down some stairs. 'The plasterboard is likely to have caused some bruising but, because he landed on top of another guy, he may have sprained something,' says Dr Ram Moorthy, a head and neck surgeon. Thirteen minutes later, McClane nearly falls to his death down a lift shaft, only to be saved by clinging on to a ledge with his fingertips... an unlikely prospect in someone who isn't a trained climber, says Dr Moorthy. It's highly possible he could have broken his fingers and dislocated his shoulder. McClane lives to fight on. An hour and 13 minutes in, he blows up a lift shaft. Dr Moorthy says he should have suffered shrapnel and burn wounds, and a ringing in his ears. McClane could just about have survived – and again, two minutes later, when he gashes his feet on glass fragments, if the blood loss wasn't too bad. He might even have got over being kicked in the head many times two minutes later, although he would have suffered jaw and cheekbone fractures. What he couldn't have survived, says Dr Moorthy, is being shot in the shoulder. 'More than likely, John would have lost consciousness from blood loss,' he says. 'And I'm not sure whether he'd have been able to defeat the bad guys. I think he would've died during his final battle when he was kicked in the head and shot.' Still, McClane miraculously makes it, and indeed goes on to leap off the exploding building, smashing through a plate glass window, with no permanent injury – as the next four films in the Die Hard franchise went on to prove. Home Alone [1990] . Surely this old Christmas favourite would leave all its leading players alive? Not according to London registrar Dr Keir Shiels. In his analysis, not only would poor little Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) have been a goner, so would his tormentors, burglars Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern). Macaulay Culkin's Home Alone character Kevin would have died from head injuries when he fell from some high shelves . When Kevin falls from some high shelves, he would almost certainly have suffered fatal head injuries. Later, both crooks slip down some icy stairs, with Harry potentially breaking vertebrae and being paralysed. Marv's fall is less serious but then he's struck by a crowbar and hit with an iron. 'With enough impact to the front of the head... potentially fatal,' says Dr Shiels. The pair slip on toy cars, are knocked off their feet by swinging paint tins and are smacked in the head with metal spades. No human could have survived such repeated trauma, says Dr Shiels. 'Marv and Harry would be very seriously disabled and would probably have died from their injuries. Kevin would have died from massive head injuries when he fell from climbing shelves.' Halloween [1978] . Experts say killer Michael Myers from the Halloween films (pictured) would not have survived being stabbed in the chest . Life expectancy doesn't look good for student Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) when she's stalked by Michael Myers (Nick Castle), who's just escaped from a nearby mental institution and put on a mask. In fact, though, it's Myers who gets it in the neck when, an hour and 16 minutes in, he is stabbed with a knitting needle. Dr Hannah Barnham-Brown, of St George's, University of London, says he could have survived as long as it didn't hit an artery. Four minutes later, Myers gets a coat-hanger in the eye. Again, not necessarily fatal. But, she says, his luck would finally run out when he is stabbed in the chest. 'His left lung has almost certainly collapsed and his heart has probably been damaged too,' says Dr Barnham-Brown. 'He could easily have dropped down dead.' For good measure, three minutes later Myers is shot six times before tumbling from a balcony. 'The gunshots would definitely have killed him and the idea of him getting up and escaping afterwards is laughable,' she says.","Medical experts reveal analysis of scenes likely to kill movie characters .

"Researchers have completed the first comprehensive study of the microbes living on and in and uncontacted tribe from the Amazon. They say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us -  and that the  bacteria they found could be potentially beneficial to modern society. Researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the Amazonian region of South America. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are hunter-gatherers. They gather wild bananas, seasonal fruits, palm hearts and cassava. They hunt birds, small mammals, crabs, frogs, small fish and the occasional peccary, monkey or tapir. The group doesn't grow food or domesticate livestock. The researchers found that Yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. 'That tells us that Western diets and lifestyles have a great impact on our microbiomes', experts at University of San Diego said. 'Studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics, sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors,' said study co-author Rob Knight. In the new study published April 17 by Science Advances, researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. This information revealed, for the first time, the species of bacteria that co-exist with people who have never been exposed to industrialized society, including Western food and antibiotics. 'Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body,' the researchers wrote. Many Yanomami now regularly interact with Western civilization through trade, but some villages have never had contact with non-Yanomami people. One such unmapped village was first spotted by an army helicopter passing overhead in 2008. In 2009, a medical mission landed there. As part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered. The samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study. Yanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests . Thousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international. The Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade. The Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected. Only 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died. Keen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent. The Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes – in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions. Without obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s. Yanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood. 'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.' Back in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples. From this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies. The researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles. Bacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics. This finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use. What happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria. The researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments. 'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home. 'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health — information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'","Researchers sequenced microbiomes of Yanomami people in Amazon .

"Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme. They're accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges Monday against William D. Allen, Susan Daub and their Capital Financial Partners investment firms. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. Accused: Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme (file photo) He was signed by the New England Patriots in March 2012 but was placed on injured reserve the following August, and he left football in March 2013. Daub, 54, is a financial professional who also lives in Florida, according to the SEC. The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes. To make up the gap they paid investors with other investors' money rather than actual profits on the investments, in a classic Ponzi scheme, the agency said. The SEC said Allen and Daub misled investors about the terms and even the existence of some of the loans, telling them they could receive interest on the loans of up to 18 percent from the athletes. The pair used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures, the agency alleged. The SEC's criminal complaint quoted the website for Capital Financial as saying 'In many cases, athletes' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car, pay the bills, or meet a financial demand. 'By pooling the resources of a network of investors, CFP gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid, short-term returns on investment.' The SEC said its lawsuit against Allen and Daub was filed under seal in federal court in Boston last week and unsealed on Sunday. The agency won an asset freeze against them from the court last week. Two of their firms are based in Boston. Scam: The SEC alleges that Allen and his business partner Susan Daub used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures (file photo) The SEC is seeking an injunction against Allen and Daub and the firms, as well as unspecified penalties and restitution of allegedly ill-gotten gains. Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's regional office in Boston, said in a statement: 'The defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes, but we allege that’s not where a large portion of the investors’ money went. 'As in any Ponzi scheme, the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies.' The telephone wasn't answered at a listing for Will D. Allen in Davie, Fla., where Allen is said to live. A person answering the phone at Daub's home said there was no comment. They are not represented in the case by attorneys, according to the SEC.","Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner Susan Daub are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators .

"Eight-month-old puppy Silver was banned from getting close to the Prime Minister today after he was bizarrely deemed a security risk. David Cameron greeted voters in the street as he left his speech in Cheltenham to outline Tory plans for inheritance tax. But aides ordered that the Jack Russell and poodle cross-breed be kept well away from the Conservative Party leader. Eight-month-old puppy Silver was banned from getting close to the Prime Minister today after he was bizarrely deemed a security risk .

Owner Sarah Styler was taking Silver for his morning walk when she spotted TV crews gathered outside the church hall close to her house where Mr Cameron was giving his speech. Along with a group of other passersby Mrs Styler, 49, waited to speak to Mr Cameron. But shortly before he emerged from the building she was told that she would only be allowed to speak to the Prime Minister without her dog present. A Tory aide took the dog from her and walked him over to the other side of the road to what was deemed a safe distance from the Prime Minister. Mr Cameron chatted briefly to the group and commented on how sunny it was before leaving in his car. As Silver was returned to Mrs Styler, the aide told her: 'The Prime Minister loves dogs, but it was just for security.' Mrs Styler, who is the head of polo at Cheltenham College, took the ban on her dog meeting Mr Cameron in good heart. She said: 'It's quite funny that they did not want Silver near the PM, but I guess as an eight-month-old Jack Terrier poodle he is quite a security threat. 'I'm surprised MI5 are not getting involved.' Mr Cameron had spoken to voters after a speech in Cheltenham to outline Tory plans for inheritance tax . Mr Cameron was memorably photographed with huskies during an Arctic visit in 2006 to show off his green credentials when he was opposition leader. In 2013 he faced embarrassment after he was unable to keep hold of a dog on a visit to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. Mr Cameron was passed Yorkshire terrier Bertie, but the dog wriggled out of his arms in seconds.

"Digital delivery of music . caught up with physical formats like CDs as a money stream for . the first time last year, the trade association IFPI said on . Tuesday.

Piracy and free Internet sites remain a huge problem for anindustry still reeling from the impact of turning music intodigital form, which encouraged copying, bootlegs and free musicsites, and led to a collapse in sales from $40 billion in 1999.

"A Spanish town on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route is warning pilgrims and other visitors to stop defecating along the famous path. Graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of Santiago de Compostela, in north-western Spain, have been erected in the municipality of Lastres. But no one knows who put up the signs, which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it. Someone in the municipality of Lastres has posted signs warning pilgrims not to defecate on the trail . The pilgrimage, known as the Way of St James, attracts thousands of pilgrims every year, but there can be very few places to go when nature calls. In Lastres, angry residents have complained about pilgrims defecating outside their homes. The signs are posted next to warnings that urge people not to litter. The pilgrimage begins at various points, with the longest route nearly 500 miles from the Spain-France border, which lead to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, where Saint James the Great is said to be buried. Antonio Fernandez, a resident of Lastres, told Spain’s EFE news agency that the signs are found to be so amusing they have become an attraction. Some pilgrims will walk nearly 500 miles (800 kilometres) to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela . Pilgrims and other visitors are now stopping to pose for photos with them, he added. Two other residents, Jose Ramon Fernandez and his wife, Maria Paz, said they were surprised the warning signs were posted, as the pilgrims ‘are very polite’ and ‘always friendly’. Lantres is a parish in Santos, and its mayor said ‘it makes no sense’ that there are no public facilities for pilgrims at regular points during their long journey on the historic route. Julio Gallego told the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia that it is a ‘huge failure’ that needs to be remedied.","No one knows who put up the signs in the municipality of Lastres .

"Those wondering what the future holds for former Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond need wonder no more. The BBC co-host appears to have already launched a new career - as a documentary maker of incredibly dull things. The 45-year-old, whose Top Gear future has been in doubt since Jeremy Clarkson's unceremonious sacking, has released his first home video on a new channel on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Bored: Richard Hammond has released a video documenting his 'bored' unemployed lifestyle - which has already been watched by 230,000 people . The film begins with a scene showing the 45-year-old lying on a wall shouting 'bored' to himself and his dog . It comes after James May, also in the Top Gear presenting trio, released a series of videos showcasing his jobless life. One included a cookery demonstration on how to make a shepherd's pie. But, if the title is anything to go by, it seems Hammond is still in need of a little bit of inspiration. Using the username 'Richard Hammond is bored', the presenter entitled the video 'Bored', before publishing an edited version  under the equally-inspired name of 'Bored 2'. Predictably, the description reads: 'This video is about bored'. The amusing but mind-numbing film - which lasts for ten minutes - begins with Hammond lying on top of a wall on his farm in Ross-on-Wye. He is seen shouting at the top of his voice - to no one except his dog - that he is 'Bored!' The slickly-edited video then follows Hammond as he drives along the M6 and country roads to Buttermere in the Lake District, Cumbria. The film follows Hammond as he takes his dog to Buttermere in the Lake District to learn how to herd sheep . Amid scenes of the National Park in all its springtime glory, the footage follows Hammond as he learns from local farmers about how to look after sheep. There are also scenes of Hammond feeding cows before having a pint with the farmers in the local pub, the Bridge Hotel. Hammond also takes time out of his farming duties to sit by a lake with his dog, pensively looking out across the water. But, unlike his Top Gear presenting style, Hammond rarely speaks during the film, sharing only a few key insights such as: 'It's raining' and 'What are we doing?' The film then ends with a cliff hanger which shows Hammond releasing some of the sheep back onto his farm in Wales - but realising that he has left his beloved dog behind. It follows the former Top Gear co-host as he drives along the M6 listening to radio, with his dog in the car . It also shows him having a few drinks in the pub. Unlike his Top Gear presenting style, Hammond rarely speaks during the film, sharing only a few key insights such as: 'It's raining' and 'What are we doing?' Two hours after promoting his film via Twitter, Hammond thanked his fans for their comments - but said it had not abated his boredom. 'Many comments on my little Bored film. Was briefly interested. Then bored again. Shall make a cutdown version next. When I can be bothered,' he wrote. He later added: 'Have made cutdown version of Bored. Called it Bored 2 and put it on YouTube on 'Richard Hammond is bored'. Not so bored now.' Yesterday, Jeremy Clarkson - who was sacked from Top Gear last month - revealed that Hammond was spending his days trying to train his dog. He wrote: 'One of my friends, who shall remain nameless - save to say that his name begins with R and ends in ichard Hammond - decided to fill his enforced leave by training his dog. The film ends with a cliff hanger which shows Hammond releasing some of the sheep back onto his farm - but realising his dog is missing . In an amusing end scene, the dog is scene sitting next to the lake, worryingly looking around for her owner . 'And now, after just a couple of weeks, he reports that the dog in question hates him and hides whenever he comes into the room.' Clarkson also reflected on the perils of being unemployed, saying he has to make everything 'last for hours' to fill the gaping chasm left by Top Gear. In his Sunday Times column, he wrote: 'We read often about people who live on benefits, and it fills us with rage that they are sitting about with a plasma television we bought, eating chocolate biscuits that aren't bloody well theirs. 'Yet after a couple of weeks in the same boat (well, all right, mine's more of a liner), I'm beginning to develop a bit of sympathy. Because what the hell do they do all day to stay sane?' Earlier this month, James May also took to YouTube to share his jobless life with friends. Richard Hammond shared his video with his followers on Twitter. It has already been watched more than 230,000 times . In a badly-lit video, the former BBC presenter gave a 'masterclass' in making a shepherd's pie. The cooking activity was originally selected by his Twitter followers, after he gave them a list of mundane scenarios which he should be filmed doing around the house. The cooking clip talked viewers through 'ingredients, prep and kit', 'cooking onions and chilli', 'browning meat, adding Indian spice' and 'not sure'. He had previously posted a video showing him tackling 'Greensleeves' on his recorder while struggling with a hangover – a popular piece that has thus far notched up over half-a-million views. Since Jeremy Clarkson was sacked over the infamous 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer, there has been mounting speculation over Hammond and May's positions at the BBC. Bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade the pair to continue with the show, in a bid to cling on to long-term fans. Since the unceremonious sacking of Jeremy Clarkson, there has been mounting speculation over Hammond and May's positions at the BBC . Although both hinted separately that they do not see a future with Top Gear, they have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks. Some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to sign up the group as a trio. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Richard is a TV presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he's been on the show a bit longer than James. That is a big opportunity to pass over.' They added: 'It would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one.' All three were on the cusp of signing new three-year deals when the Clarkson fracas unfolded. The day after Clarkson's sacking, May gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to Top Gear, suggesting he is to ‘go back to normal life.’ But BBC bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade Richard Hammond and James May to continue with the show, in a bid to cling onto long-term fans . The presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher. He said: 'I might want to do something completely different with my life, I'm quite old now. (I might do) something outside of cars, I always wanted to be a teacher.' He also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top-rating programme, saying: 'We always knew it wasn't going to last forever'. But the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob previously made it clear he wanted May and Hammond to continue presenting the show without Clarkson, despite acknowledging it would be 'perfectly natural' for them to have reservations about continuing. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' May fronts several other TV programmes, including the popular James May's Toy Stories, James May's Man Lab and Oz and James' Big Wine Adventure with wine expert Oz Clarke. Hammond has a successful career as a children’s television host, fronting the second series of National Geographic's Science of Stupid. He also hosted BBC1’s physical game show Total Wipeout and the CBBC series Blast Lab before they were axed. Clarkson, May and Hammond are scheduled to take part in the live Top Gear shows next month. But the shows have been renamed, without BBC branding.","45-year-old released ten-minute YouTube film showing him in Lake District .

"A giant supervoid 1.8 billion light-years across may be responsible for a mysterious ‘Cold Spot’ in the universe. The theory was proposed by astronomers seeking to understand what is causing this larger-than-expected cold area. If confirmed, the supervoid would be the largest single structure ever found by humanity. Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for an anomaly in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe, shown bottom right. In 2004 astronomers first found the 'Cold Spot' - a region 20 per cent less dense than elsewhere - and may now have an explanation for its formation . The research, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, was carried out by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Cold Spot was first discovered by astronomers in 2004 when they were examining a map of the radiation left over from the Big Bang - the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - made using Esa's Planck telescope. In the map, the universe is fairly evenly distributed, apart from in this one area. The huge unexpected region contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe and about 10,000 less galaxies. While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before. ‘Statistically, we are very confident that the supervoid is there,’ Dr András Kovács, who was involved in the study, told MailOnline. He said that the supervoid appears to be ‘roughly spherical’, and it may even contain a ‘significant substructure’ at its centre; a void within a void. A supervoid is not empty, but rather a region of space that has less matter than other parts of the universe. For this reason it can ‘sap’ the energy of light that is passing through it. To explain how that works, imagine the void to be a hill. As light enters the void and travels towards its middle, it can be said to be climbing the hill, using up energy. Once it passes the centre, it would begin ‘descending’ the hill and regain the energy it expended to get there. But as the universe is expanding, by the time the light gets to the centre, its route out has become ‘shallower’ - or less dense. This means it cannot regain as much energy as it lost initially and leaves the void with less energy, therefore a longer wavelength, which corresponds to a colder temperature. The different is marginal - typically about 70 nano-Kelvins - but it is enough to stand out when the entire cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe is measured. The supervoid is thought to be causing a 'less-dense' region of the universe (illustration of empty space shown). At 1.8 billion light-years across it would be the biggest object ever found. But some 'exotic physics' is also needed to explain what's happening . The huge unexpected Cold Spot region, shown, contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe, and about 10,000 less galaxies. While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before . The original theory was that the Cold Spot originated from the Big Bang, and was a rare sign of 'exotic physics' that our current models of the universe could not explain. This new theory, however, suggests otherwise. Previous attempts to find a void at the distance of the Cold Spot were unsuccessful, but this latest study suggests it is actually a foreground object, three billion light-years from Earth. According to lead researcher Dr Istvan Szapudi, the object - if confirmed - would be ‘the largest individual structure ever identified by humanity.’ The team gathered data using Hawaii’s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui, and Nasa’s Wide Field Survey Explorer (Wise) satellite. The findings by the researchers were made using Nasa’s orbiting Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) telescope (artist's illustration shown), which was launched on 14 December 2009, and Hawaii’s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui . However, the supervoid can only account for about half of the entire Cold Spot, suggesting there might still be some exotic physics at play. The researchers note, though, that it is ‘very unlikely’ that the supervoid and the Cold Spot being in the same location are a coincidence. They are continuing to study the void with improved data from PS1, and from the Dark Energy Survey being conducted with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.","Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for a cosmic anomaly .

"Nurses forced to work 12-hour shifts amid staff shortages are treated like 'slave labour', a union has claimed. With a growing demand for nurses to work long hours, Unison has called for more research into the effects of workers' health. At the union's healthcare conference in Liverpool this week, one member highlighted how staff at a hospital in Staffordshire are expected to work six long days a week, totalling up to 78 hours a week. Jane Smith told colleagues: 'The fact staff are so tired has a detrimental effect on patient care and (also) puts other staff at risk.' Nurses working 12-hour shifts amid staffing shortages in the NHS are treated like 'slave labour', one Unison member has warned, as she called for more research into how longer working hours affect staff health . She said she was aware of one nurse who had worked 11 consecutive long day shifts, the Nursing Times reported. In a stretched NHS, longer shifts are now more common, offering a cost-effective strategy. In the past the working day was divided into three, eight-hour shifts - the norm for nursing shifts for many years. But, as in many other industries, a move towards two longer shifts per day is now more common. The theory is the shift pattern offers greater cost effectiveness for the NHS, in the form of fewer handovers, deemed unproductive. And for staff the change offers a better work-life balance, in the form of more days off, it has been argued. But Ms Smith likened long shifts to 'slave labour', warning staff are falling sick due to exhaustion. 'The fact staff are so tired has a detrimental effect on patient care and not only compromises their own health but puts other staff at risk,' she said. 'There is a case for saying there is a better way [of organising shift work]' A motion calling for Unison to investigate the health impact of long shifts on nurses was passed at the conference. It comes as the Royal College of Nursing this week revealed, in their final report before next month's General Election, that despite a rise in the total number of nurses since 2010, 'the reality on the ground is that there are fewer nurses, providing more care'. Their Fragile Frontline report said the total number of posts in the last five years has risen by 6,434, but warned 'the true picture is less positive'. The increase in total nursing workforce, excluding midwives, health visitors and school nurses, is only 1,470. While the number of FTE posts has increased, the number of people filling those posts has fallen by 1,845, meaning that fewer nurses are providing more care. Dr Peter Carter, RCN chief executive and general secretary, said: 'We warned that cutting the workforce numbers to fund the NHS reorganisation and to find the efficiency savings was the wrong course to take. 'The cuts were so severe that we are only just catching up with where we were five years ago. 'Many areas, like district nursing and mental health, are even worse off. 'While the health service has spent the last five years running on the spot, demand has continued to increase. A recent study by a team at the University of Southampton found nurses who worked longer hours were more likely to suffer 'fatigue and decreased levels of alertness, potentially resulting in more adverse effects' 'Whoever forms the next Government must learn from this report and take immediate action to grow the nursing workforce, and ensure it can keep up with demand with a sustainable and long-term plan.' Ms Smith said the tendency towards longer shifts increases 'the potential for accidents to occur'. Her warnings reflect the findings of a study, published last November, that warned nurses working 12 hours or longer were more likely to report poor patient care. The study, carried out by a team at the University of Southampton, considered the views of 31,627 nurses in 488 hospitals across 12 European countries. Researchers found half of those questioned worked shifts less than or equal to eight hours, while 15 per cent worked 12 hours or longer. The authors said: 'Nurses working for 12 hours or longer were more likely to report poor or failing patient safety, poor or fair quality of care, and more care activities left undone. 'Working overtime was also associated with reports of poor or failing patient safety, poor or fair quality of care, and more care left undone.' In addition the research revealed that nurses who worked longer hours were more likely to suffer 'fatigue and decreased levels of alertness, potentially resulting in more adverse effects'. The authors added: 'The degree to which nurses are subsidising health services through unpaid overtime and the impact of long hours and overtime on burnout have implications for both the costs and the effectiveness of extended shifts.' At the Unison conference, research associate Chiara Dall'Ora, who took part in the research at Southampton, said recent figures showed 35 per cent of UK nurses reported working 12-hour shifts.","Unison member said tired staff have 'detrimental effect on patient care'

"They have become one of the most irritating accessories carried by tourists in recent years, but it appears the selfie stick has been a nuisance for three decades. Hiroshi Ueda, a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta, claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s. He said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in Europe. Scroll down for video . Hiroshi Ueda, holding his extender stick for taking 'selfies' which he patented in 1983 while working for Minolta . After having his camera stolen by a child he asked to take their picture in the Louvre Museum in Paris, he dreamed up a solution - an extendable stick with a tripod screw at the end. The 'extender stick', as he called it, was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time. Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion. Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there’s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone. The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their iPad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots. The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (£16), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. Despite being patented in 1983, the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured. But that did not stop Mr Ueda from compiling a family album of family 'selfies' using his device. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'The idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then. 'The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked.' Some 30 years later selfie sticks are now hugely popular - used by narcissists and celebrities everywhere to capture images of themselves in their surroundings. They have become such a menace that many tourist venues, museums, concert venues and stadiums have banned them. Perhaps ironically, Apple - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference. Mr Ueda used his 'extender stick' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in Europe (above) Modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video. Mr Ueda's patent ran out in 2003, however, so he has not benefited from the recent boom. Instead Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm developed a hand-held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s, which he called the Quik Pod. While his product has sold well, there are many others available. Mr Ueda said: 'My idea came too early, but that's just one of those things. 'I patented about 300 ideas, so that was just one of them. We call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early.' The idea of selfies, however, is not new. Remote timers and triggers have been available on cameras for decades. A recently unearthed photograph also showed that some early photographers adopted unusual methods to take their own photo - such as using a broom handle to hit the trigger on their camera. Michael Pritchard, Director-General of The Royal Photographic Society, said there is evidence of selfies going back as far as the 1840s. Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them. But a growing number of venues and attractions have deemed them such a nuisance that they are banning their use. Last month the National Gallery in London became the latest major museum to instruct visitors that the devices were not welcome. It follows bans in galleries in France and America – including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Organisers of two major US festivals have also made clear what they think of selfie sticks. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds. According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have also prohibited them, while Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.

"Second homeowners face being hit with double rates of council tax under Lib Dem plans to protect rural life. Nick Clegg said wealthy people with holiday homes would not mind having to 'chip in a bit' to protect services in areas where as many as one in 10 homes are vacant for much of the year. The well-off buying up homes in tourist hotspots has also driven up property values, leaving local people priced out of the areas where they grew up. Nick Clegg - steps off a fishing boat as he visits Newlyn Harbour, near Penzance, Cornwall today - said wealthy people with holiday homes would not mind having to 'chip in a bit' to protect services in areas where as many as one in 10 homes are vacant for much of the year . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg holds a cod at the Newlyn Fish Market in Cornwall this morning after unveiling his plan to save popular rural areas from the blight of second home owners . Under the Lib Dem plan, launched in Cornwall today, local authorities would have the power to charge 200 per cent council tax. The levy would be used in part to deter people from buying holiday homes in the first place, but the money generated could be used to support schools, post officers and other services which can become unviable without sufficient permanent residents. The double council tax would not be compulsory, but councils in areas like Cumbria, Cornwall and Devon have said they would be interested in the idea to 'discourage' second home ownership. On a campaign visit in St Austell, Cornwall, Mr Clegg said the move could help 'particularly in such a wonderful part of the country as this where there are so many people with second homes and where the prices because of that are way beyond the reach of many young people wanting to get their feet on the first rung of the property ladder'. The Lib Dem leader even claimed second home-owners would 'like to chip in a bit extra' to fund the communities in which they they spend their holidays. Mr Clegg, who visited Newlyn fish market and harbour with St Ives candidate Andrew George as he launched his countryside charter, told ITV News: 'It is giving councils the freedom to raise a bit of money from those who holiday in a community but don't live in a community all year round so that local public services can be properly supported for those people who do live in their community all year round. 'That seems to me to be fair and, I have to say to you, I suspect people who own second homes here - many of whom have significant means - would like to chip in a bit extra so that they know that, even though they are not living in a community all the time, they are nonetheless supporting the local services that local people do rely upon.' Under the Lib Dem plan, launched in Cornwall today, local authorities would have the power to charge 200 per cent council tax . The Deputy PM and Lib Dem MP Andrew George pose for a photograph at Newlyn Harbour  near Penzance . Mr Clegg, who has been warned his party faces near-wipeout in its Westcountry stronghold, said he wants to 'play on the conscience' of second homeowners. He said they needed to realise that local people were being priced out of the property market and it was not in their interest for the rural community to 'wither on the vine'. He told reporters that the levy was not aimed at stopping people buying a holiday property. Mr Clegg (right) holds a fish with Newlyn Fish Market manager Lionel Washer (left)  and Harbour Master Rob Parsons (centre) during a visit in Cornwall today . 'What would a fancy second home in Cornwall, what would they pay in council tax, maybe a thousand quid, £1,500? 'I think if that is increased to £2,000 or a bit more, is that going to stop them buying it in the first place? I doubt it. 'Of course I believe in and want to protect people's freedoms to buy holiday homes and second homes. What I want to do is make sure it's a fair deal for those communities where those second homes are located.' He added that many people who had second homes in Cornwall were 'acutely aware that there is this big, burning local issue about the availability of housing for local youngsters'. The measure forms part of a 'countryside charter' being launched by the Lib Dems, with Mr Clegg claiming his party will create 300,000 new jobs in rural areas if it is in government after the General Election on May 7. Mr Clegg promised to 'close the gap' between urban and rural areas in the provision of high speed broadband, ensuring 99.9% of households are covered. Other measures include help for farming, strengthening the powers of the Groceries Code Adjudicator to ensure farmers are paid fairly, publishing a national food strategy, and developing an animal disease strategy to lessen the risks and costs of animal disease. The party says it will also take action to protect rural post offices and other essential services from closure, prioritise rural housing and boost tourism by introducing a 'fuller' right to roam.","Lib Dems launch plan for 200% levy on holiday homes in tourist hot spots .

"Ed Miliband today rushed to Scotland to try to shore up his hope of becoming Prime Minister as a damning poll showed almost half of Scots are ready to back the SNP. The Labour leader used a speech in Edinburgh to claim the Tory election campaign has descended into 'desperation and panic', as some polls put Labour ahead across the UK. But Mr Miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in Scotland, 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour, robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority. Scroll down for video . A poll of Scotlans shows 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour . There has been a surge in support for the SNP in the months since the independence referendum in September . In September's referendum, 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the UK, but the SNP has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from Labour in the general election on May 7. The new YouGov poll for The Times shows Labour is down four points on last month to their lowest level since the survey began in 2007. The SNP is up three points to 49 per cent, a record high. Support for the Conservatives was up two points at 18 per cent and backing for the Liberal Democrats was up one point at 4 per cent. The results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted'. 'The polls are hugely encouraging and they show that that case that the SNP is putting forward for an end to austerity and support for the NHS and public services is winning support across Scotland.' Ms Sturgeon has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7. However, the SNP leader demanded full fiscal autonomy for Scotland in return, meaning all money raised in tax north of the border would be spent there. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the SNP's plan 'will mean a £7.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances' In a joint press conference, Mr Miliband was joined by his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy . The SNP has proposed 'a modest increase in public spending' to end austerity and allow Scotland's health budget to rise by £2 billion by 2020. 'Let us lift austerity and have spending increases in the next parliament that are fiscally responsible but allow us to spend more money on our vital public services like the health service,' she said. 'I am proposing an increase in spending in the health service across the UK that would see by the end of this decade an additional £2 billion being spent on the NHS in Scotland. 'That's the choice we have at this election - continued austerity being proposed by the Tories and Labour, or an alternative to austerity, which is what the SNP is proposing, and we need a strong Scottish voice in Westminster that can force that alternative to austerity.' But in a joint press conference, Mr Miliband, his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the SNP's plan 'will mean a £7.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances'. Mr Miliband said: 'Today I challenge Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to say how they will fill this GBP7.6 billion gap. Which services will be cut? Which taxes will be raised? And what cuts will it mean for pensioners in Scotland when they are taken out of the UK pensions system? 'The SNP claim in this campaign to be proposing no reductions in spending, but in fact they are planning dramatic reductions in spending. They must now come clean.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured in Sterling today, has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7 . Ms Sturgeon joined with local candidate Steven Paterson while on the campaign trail in Stirling . The latest poll results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted' Mr Miliband pledged: 'I will never sell Scotland short by signing up to the SNP's plans. And I will never sell Britain short by abandoning the pooling and sharing of resources. Because this is a pooling and sharing which benefits all parts of our country, because we look after each other and we know we can only tackle the problems our country faces across the whole of the United Kingdom.' Speaking ahead of Mr Miliband's speech, Ms Sturgeon claimed that Labour was 'wrong' in its analysis. 'This is desperation on the part of the Labour Party,' the SNP leader said during a campaign visit to Stirling. 'Instead of putting forward a positive case of their own, they are resorting to the same fears and smears that they resorted to during the referendum. 'The truth is, the only cuts on the horizon for Scotland are the ones that the Tories are proposing and Labour are backing.'","YouGov poll of Scots: 49% backing SNP, 25% Labour,  18% Conservatives .

"One problem with space travel is that humans aren’t very good at coping with reduced gravity - their bones and muscles deteriorate over time. But one company says they have an answer - a giant rotating space cylinder that can create artificial gravity. Scroll down for video . A Washington, DC-based company called United Space Structures wants to create a new space station. Their giant cylinder (shown, with the ISS and Space Shuttles illustrated) could apparently replace the ISS. It would rotate four times per minute to create artificial gravity, and would be 1,300ft (400 metres) long, cost £200 billion ($300 billion) and take 30 years to build . The ‘space mushroom’ was designed by Bill Kemp and Ted Maziejka from United Space Structures (USS), based in Washington, DC. The final design would be 330ft (100 metres) in diameter and 1,310ft (400 metres) long. • Orbiting Hotel/Casino/3D Sports Arena . • Orbiting space station - Planetary environmental monitoring/Research . • Solar system space vehicle . • Settlement cargo vehicle & construction platform . • Rescue vehicle . • Continuously looping space ferry system . • Mining vehicle/platform . • Manufacturing platform . • Bio-medical research/manufacturing . Artificial gravity is created by spinning the station 4.22 times per minute around its vertical axis, creating downward pressure via the centrifugal force to keep objects - including humans - on the floor. The force would be the same as the gravity experienced on Earth. Meanwhile on the ISS, the station is in constant freefall towards Earth as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in ‘zero-gravity’. While the main cylindrical body would spin in one direction, the top dome-shaped section would spin in the other direction. This would allow spacecraft to dock with the top of the station, which would appear stationary to them. The necessity for this dome gives the space station its mushroom-like appearance. The dome would house the command centre for the station, and also many of the supplies needed for the crew on board. ‘We believe artificial gravity is required to support long term living in space,’ Mr Kemp told MailOnline. To build the station, the team says they have ‘patents pending’ for six robotic systems that can manufacture and construct a variety of structures in space. While exact details aren’t known at the moment, another company - Tethers Unlimited -  has demonstrated how structures could be built in space with their SpiderFab proposal, a system of robo-spiders that would build parts of spacecraft in orbit, although Mr Kemp told MailOnline that the USS method would be 'different'. Mr Kemp added that, for this large structure, it would take about 30 years to build and cost close to £200 billion ($300 billion). For comparison, it took more than 10 years to build the ISS, at a cost of around £67 million ($100 billion) - although this new station has 2.89 million times more volume. And it would be ‘large enough to transport all the people and equipment required to set up a colony on Mars and would orbit Mars and provide a safe environment while the Mars base is being constructed.’ Artificial gravity has been considered many times before, most famously in the 'Stanford Torus' design (interior seen here). A rotating station would allow people to live as if they were walking on Earth, allowing them to stay in space for long periods of time . To build the station, something like SpiderFab (left) could be used, a proposed system of robo-spiders than can construct solar panels, trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit. On the right is an artificial gravity test Nasa performed in September 1966. The Gemini 11 spacecraft was attached to an Agena target vehicle and spun, with the astronauts reporting a small amount of artificial gravity in their spacecraft . On the ISS, the station is in constant freefall towards Earth as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in ‘zero-gravity’. However, they actually still experience about 90 per cent of Earth's gravity, but the constant falling makes them seem weightless . Inside, the structures would be spinning so anyone on the curved ‘floors’ around the edges would be pushed into the ground, simulating gravity on Earth. But Mr Kemp said they want to build a smaller structure first, to prove the design works. ‘Our first structure will be 30 metres [100ft] in diameter, it will create a 0.6 gravity environment and would house at least 30 people,’ he said. This smaller structure would cost between £3.5 and £7 billion ($5 and $10 billion), and could be built in the next 10 years. It would take just 12 to 18 months to build, according to Mr Kemp. ‘The International Space Station is estimated to be decommissioned around 2024,’ Mr Kemp noted. The team has yet to begin any serious construction or testing as of yet - so at the moment, the station remains somewhat of a pipe dream. Astronauts on the ISS (Terry Virts seen left, Scott Kelly on the right) live in a constant state of micro-gravity. Mr Kelly is spending a year on the ISS to see what effects such conditions have on the human body for a prolonged period of time . In the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, astronauts are shown running around a spacecraft that spins (shown) while on a mission to deep space, creating artificial gravity for them to operate in . Previous concepts for spacecraft include this 1969 station that would rotate on its central axis to produce artificial gravity. The majority of early space station concepts created artificial gravity one way or another in order to simulate a more natural or familiar environment for the health of the astronauts on board . However, space settlement expert Al Globus, who is also a contract scientist at Nasa's Ames research centre, told MailOnline that he thought the idea was somewhat sound - and artificial gravity was a necessity for prolonged stays in space. ‘Rotation to provide artificial gravity will counteract most, if not all, of the negative effects of micro-g,’ he said. And he says if we truly want to live in space, including raising children there, it will be necessary to create such a station. ‘There is no data on the effects of micro-g on kids, but it is safe to assume they will grow up very weak as muscles and bones develop in response to stress,’ he continued. ‘Thus, for settlement, there is simply no question that they must rotate and almost certainly need to provide 1g at least for the first few generations.’ But whether this station will be the answer remains to be seen. Several other proposals for a rotating space station have been drawn up - including a Nasa concept called Nautilus-X - but as of yet, there are no concrete plans by Nasa, Roscosmos (the Russian space agency) or any other nation on what to do after the ISS. Whether this station by United Space Structures or another concept will be built, remains to be seen. Nasa's Nautilus-X concept, shown, includes a doughtnut-shaped spinning section in the middle where astronauts can experience artificial gravity. The spacecraft is designed for long trips to the moon, Mars or beyond . While a spacecraft could be created with artificial gravity, astronauts will still have to contend with zero-gravity conditions if they ever venture outside into space. Shown are Nasa's Robert L. Curbeam, Jr. (left) and Esa's Christer Fuglesang above New Zealand in 2006 .","Washington, DC company United Space Structures wants to create a new space station .

The nine other doctors from across the country included Dr Joel Tepper, a cancer researcher from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Dr Gilbert Ross of the American Council on Science and Health in New York City. The physicians accused Dr Oz of pushing 'miracle' weight-loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work. The doctors wrote that Oz, for years a world-class Columbia cardiothoracic surgeon, has 'misled and endangered' the public. The letter read: 'He has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain.

"Guilty: Glenn Mason, 56, has said he will pay back the whole £185,000 out of his RBS pension pot . A respected NatWest bank manager who was jailed for stealing £185,000 from his elderly customers to fund his internet gambling addiction will have to pay back every penny. Glenn Mason, 56, plundered the accounts of nine pensioners including an 83 year-old woman and a 92 year-old man living near his branch in Biggin Hill, Kent, the Old Bailey heard. Mason, who was given an award by the Metropolitan Police in Bromley in 2009 for his crime fighting efforts, got away with the thefts for almost a year before his arrest in July 2012. His attempts to cover up his crime by transferring money using the identity of two of his colleagues, Julie Jeffrey, 50, and James Cato, 35, led to them being sacked and charged with fraud. It was only when Mason pleaded guilty in September that the case against them was dropped at the Old Bailey. Mason, who was jailed for 15 months in November last year, has said he will pay back the whole £185,000 out of his RBS pension pot. The bank has already refunded the customers targeted by Mason, and will receive the money as compensation. ‘The benefit was £185,000 and the recoverable amount is greater than that so the available amount will be the same’, said prosecutor David Hughes. ‘The loser here ultimately was RBS - they had to reimburse the account holders.’ Mr Hughes said the bank had started civil proceedings against Mason, as well as the compensation claim that comes after a criminal conviction. ‘If he makes a payment from his pension pot to RBS then that would deal with these proceedings and they would come to an end.’ Mason, who sobbed in the dock as he was jailed, did not appear in court for today’s hearing. Judge Stephen Kramer QC will confirm the money has been paid at a short hearing on May 15. At his sentencing hearing, Andrew Lawson, representing Mason, said the bank manager turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting with British troops in Afghanistan. Mr Lawson said that all of the stolen money was paid into his gambling account and told the court: ‘It was late night poker and online games that are designed to tempt you into spending money in the hope of a big win.’ The court also heard statements from two of Mason’s victims, Julie Amos and Leslie Pilditch, who both said they no longer felt able to trust banks. Julie Jeffrey also described how she lost her job after her arrest and added: ‘I no longer feel proud, my life has fallen apart.’ Mason's actions took place at Natwest in Biggin Hill (pictured). The bank manager was said to have turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting  in Afghanistan . Elaine May, the current manager of the NatWest Biggin Hill branch, also said in a statement that the thefts had ‘an ongoing impact within the community’ and put strain upon the staff. Mason continues to live in the area with his wife and son and has been working in a local newsagents. The judge, Mr Recorder Simon Farrell QC, told him: ‘You stole roughly £185,000 over a period of a year from nine victims who were all elderly and undoubtedly vulnerable. ‘Your fellow worker Julie Jeffrey, who was falsely arrested because you used her ID details to steal the money, described how, having worked for NatWest since the age of 16, losing her job as a 50 year-old woman and being reduced to delivery leaflets in all weathers. ‘Plainly these are very serious offences which everyone agrees cross the custody threshold. ‘You are of previous good character and someone who has suffered considerable personal tragedy. ‘Your wife suffered from cancer in 2005 and your son at only 19 went to Afghanistan to fight for his country and was the victim of an improvised explosive device that caused him very serious injury. ‘I accept this caused you to develop a serious gambling addiction which was in fact the root cause of stealing the money from customers. ‘In my judgement I am afraid these matters are so serious that I am not able to suspend the sentence. The best I can do is to pass a sentence of 15 months imprisonment. But for your personal mitigation this sentence would have been far longer.’ Mason, of Flamborough Close, Biggin Hill, pleaded guilty to a single charge of fraud. The case against Jeffrey, of Court Road, Orpington, Kent, and Cato, of Robert Street, Plumstead, south London, was discontinued by the prosecution.","Glenn Mason was jailed for 15 months for fraud in November last year .

Immediate action: TH Clements & Son (pictured) which owns the field in Benington, Lincolnshire, where the worker was caught urinating said he was sacked with immediate effect after the company was alerted . 'Highest quality': Tesco has said its vegetables undergo an 'extensive assessment and review process' before they reach supermarket shelves . 'Although he did not urinate on the crops, this does not excuse him from his actions. 'All our vegetables go through an extensive assessment and review process before they are distributed, including trimming and two quality assessment panels. 'The incident took place in an unplanted area of one of our fields and the worker in question has had his contract terminated as a result of this incident. 'On top of their usual training, all our field staff are currently undergoing a refresher induction.' TH Clements also said there was absolutely no health issues arising from the incident. The spokesman added: 'Urine is virtually sterile when it leaves the human body, it does not carry any bacteria, it has been used by avid growers for personal use for years as it is very high in Nitrogen. 'Urine is considered safe for individual use.' The team has more than 150 years combined experience in the Brassica industry. It grows vegetables in Benington which are supplied to several businesses including Tesco. A Tesco spokesman said: 'We work closely with our suppliers to make sure all the products we sell are of the highest quality. 'All our vegetables go through an extensive assessment and review process before they reach our shelves. 'We are working with our supplier to make sure all the right processes are in place for the future.'","The worker was caught on camera by a member of the public .

"They're supposed to be the ones who take the rubbish away. But in one residential street, a local refuse collector has been exposed as a rogue litterer, dumping plastic bin bags in an alleyway. His antics were captured on CCTV installed by frustrated residents in Oldham, Manchester, who had noticed the rubbish piling up. Residents confused over who had been dumping bags full of rubbish in an alley next to their street were stunned when CCTV revealed a binman . Rather than load the bags into his lorry, the bin man was filmed lifting them out of dustbins along Park Road in Glodwick before tossing them down an alley. Another CCTV video shows council workers arriving in the same alleyway days later. They searched the contents of the bags before placing stickers on each of them warning residents they could face fines of up to £50,000 for not having disposed of rubbish properly. It was captured on video installed by resident Zed Liaqat who, along with others on the street, thought one of their neighbours had been dumping the bags there. 'For at least a year now we have had an issue with rubbish bags being dumped in the alleyway,' said Mr Liaqat. 'There is always a pile of them there, cars drive over them because it is quite a busy passageway and the bags end up splitting and rubbish flies everywhere. 'For all this time I, along with fellow residents, assumed it was one of our neighbours and it has actually caused a bit of tension because we thought someone was doing this on their own doorstep.' The footage showed the binman lifting the bags out o wheelie bins before throwing them to the side . Adnan Islam's father had been sent a letter by the council inviting him to a recorded interview over the issue before the CCTV was obtained . After watching the footage Mr Liaqat was shocked to discover it had been council workers that were fly-tipping all along. 'When I watched it I was gobsmacked, it was a binman. You would have never thought it would be the people who are supposed to take the rubbish away. 'As a community we are shocked, something has to be done about this.' Some of the residents had been sent letters threatening legal action if the rubbish was not cleared up. Adnan Islam, who also lives on Park Road, revealed how his dad received such letter which invited him to a taped interview at Oldham Council Offices with a view to having the matter dealt with in magistrates' court. 'This has really worried my dad. The letter mentions court and says he will be arrested if he doesn¹t attend the interview,' said Mr Islam. 'After watching the video I have no doubt this is why my dad has been accused. 'When I saw the video I was stunned. We take pride in our area so we want answers.' Local councillor Arooj Shah said 'individuals' such as those shown in the video 'ruin it for everyone'. An Oldham Council spokesman said the issue was being dealt with 'extremely seriously'. 'Our staff must also lead by example. We are taking this matter extremely seriously and investigating it. 'We will not hesitate to take appropriate disciplinary action, where necessary,' Helen Lockwood, Oldham Council¹s executive director for co-operatives and neighbourhoods, said. Oldham Council had slapped stickers on the bin bags because they were not properly disposed of. It said it was investigating the footage .","Residents in Oldham were confused over growing pile of rubbish in alley .

"When high-energy electrons and ions from the sun hit Earth’s upper atmosphere, they can excite atoms and create fantastic colours - which we see on the ground as auroras. And now a study has claimed that we could create our own auroras, by firing a particle accelerator into the sky from space. The intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras  – and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere. Scientists in California have described how to create artificial auroras on Earth. They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space (illustration of a satellite in orbit shown). It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphere . The study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was picked up by Mark Zastrow from Eos. The accelerator being proposed would be three times stronger than anything like it before, producing a beam with particles 0.5 to 10 million electron volts. Pulses of the beam would last just 0.1 microseconds. The accelerator would be located in space, 185 miles (300km) above the ground, and would fire back towards Earth's atmosphere. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles (32 to 320km) above the planet’s surface. The interactions between the charged particles give off light. Auroral displays appear in many colours: red, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting. The common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles (240km). It would be based on a instrument called the Compact Particle Accelerator for Space Science (Compass), which is being developed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and SRI International, both in California. ‘The authors say that employing such instrumentation would offer many scientific opportunities to study the behaviour of particles in the upper atmosphere,’ wrote Mr Zastrow. ‘The paths of the electrons would trace out the arcing field lines of Earth’s magnetic field, illustrating how they bend and snap during the intense geomagnetic activity caused by solar storms. ‘As they descend into the Earth’s atmosphere, some of the electrons would strike atmospheric molecules, producing visible aurora-like emission.’ He added that the beam might even be able to trigger different forms of lightning, including red sprites and blue jets. For now the idea is only a concept, and there are no concrete plans to build it. But the team says that by proving it works, it could be a step towards actually making it. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Shown is the Aurora Borealis above the Snaefellsnes Peninsula in Iceland . It would not be the first experiment with Earth’s atmosphere, though. In Alaska there is an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp). Haarp is jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance. In Alaska there is already an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp), pictured. It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology . The station regularly uses a tool called the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. It is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the Ionosphere. Haarp has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories. It has been blamed for hurricanes, thunderstorms, major power outages and more, but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims.","Scientists in California described how to create artificial auroras on Earth .
