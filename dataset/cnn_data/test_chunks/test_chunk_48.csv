"Labour peer John Prescott has defended Prince Charles over allegations he tries to secretly influence government policy with scrawled private notes to ministers - insisting he should 'right to 'write as many damn letters as he likes'. The former deputy prime minister said he cannot see a problem with the future King writing to government ministers and insisted he had 'a lot to offer this country'. Lord Prescott's intervention comes after the Supreme Court backed a previous ruling paving the way for the publication of Prince Charles's so-called 'black spider' memos. Lord Prescott, left, said that the Prince of Wales has a lot to offer the country . The letters were penned between September 2004 and March 2005 and sent by the Prince to seven government departments. Lord Prescott, whose letters are separate to those due to be released, said that while he is 'not a raving loyalist', he has 'a lot of time for Charles' who he described as a passionate environmentalist. He said while he listens to the views of everyone who contacts him on political matters, he makes his own decisions. The former Labour minister, writing in the Sunday Mirror, said: ' Charles has an awful lot to offer this country. 'And if he wants to serve his subjects by helping young people into work, combating climate change and building sustainable communities, he can write as many damn letters as he likes.' Lord Prescott published extracts from two letters he received from the Prince - including one expressing his sadness at the death of the Labour politician's mother. The Labour peer said the notes proved 'the measure of the man'. He said: 'They show he has nothing to hide and he shouldn't be worried about publication.' The first letter is a typed ­invitation to a meeting of Regional­ ­Development Agency leaders in 1999. Charles says it would be 'splendid' to see Lord Prescott. The second is more personal and was written in the Prince's ­distinctive handwriting in 2003. It expresses sadness at the death of Lord Prescott's mother. The Prince opens by joking that he has 'been overdoing the quota' of letters to the Deputy PM. Prince Charles - with the Duchess of Cornwall at Ascot races last week - does a lot of good for the country, according to the former Labour minister Lord Prescott . But despite this – and the 'trouble' the press would give him – he goes on to express his sadness and says his 'heart goes out' to the politician. He added: 'I did receive letters from the prince when I was in government but they had no effect on any policy. People say he shouldn't be writing to ministers but he's quite entitled to express his opinion. 'Politicians are lobbied all the time by individuals and groups and none of them would allow a letter – even from Prince Charles – to unduly ­influence them.' Prince Charles has long been accused of 'bombarding' ministers with 'black spider' memos attacking government policy. His letters are so-named after his distinctive handwriting and abundant use of underlining and exclamation marks. Both  Clarence House and the Prime Minister expressed disappointment after the court ruling. The notes reflect,  according to previous attorney general Dominic Grieve, the prince's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs'.","Ex deputy PM said there was no problem with Charles writing to ministers .
Admitted Charles had sent him a lot of letters while he was in government .
Released two, including one condolence letter over death of his mother .

"Child sexual abuse reports have soared since Operation Yewtree which was sparked by Jimmy Savile's assaulting of dozens of children . Reports of child sex abuse cases have risen by more than 60 per cent in the wake of investigations such as Operation Yewtree and the Rotherham scandal. Figures revealed thousands more people had contacted police with allegations of abuse since 2011, with nearly 9,000 reports filed in 2014. Despite a surge in reports, the number of arrests fell by nine per cent, prompting critics to accuse the Government of failing victims of abuse. Among the forces to see the largest rise in reported cases was South Yorkshire where there was a 577 per cent increase over the last five years. It comes after an estimated 1,400 children were abused in the area over several years, with officials in Rotherham ousted as a result of the scandal having been deemed not fit for purpose. While only 74 cases of child sex abuse were reported to the force in 2011, 501 were investigated in 2014, the figures, obtained via Freedom of Information request by The Guardian, revealed. But while a surge in the number of reports suggested victims felt more comfortable coming forward, a decrease in the number of arrests made prompted critics to accuse police of not doing enough. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the ratio of reported crimes to arrests as a 'national scandal'. 'This isn't a problem from the past. It is a growing problem the Government should be confronting right now. 'Victims of child sex abuse are being let down when alongside a 60 per cent increase in reports there has been a nine per cent drop in arrests for child sex abuse, as well as falling prosecutions and convictions for child abuse offences as the police are unable to keep up.' Shaun Wright, the former Police and Crime Commissioner of South Yorkshire Police, resigned over the force's handling of the Rotherham child abuse scandal . Thames Valley Police made 191 arrests in relation to child sex abuse - up from just 13 in 2011. Campaigners said the rise was indicative of increased awareness of child sexual abuse among the public. 'In recent years there has been a huge increase in awareness of child sexual abuse and it’s good that more people are coming forward,' Alan Wardle, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the figures were a 'national scandal' 'Since the Operation Yewtree police investigation was launched in 2012, the NSPCC helpline has seen a huge rise in the number of victims willing to speak out, get support and help bring abusers to justice. 'In the year after Yewtree was launched there was an 81% increase in calls about sexual abuse to the NSPCC helpline and this surge continues. 'When children take the extremely difficult step of reporting abuse we need to ensure they are properly supported and get the help they need when they are brave enough to give evidence in court.' Operation Yewtree was sparked by revelations made in 2012 that the late comedian Jimmy Savile had sexually abused children and young women in the 1970s and 80s. The Scotland Yard investigation is understood to pursue three lines of inquiry. The first relates to Savile's crimes while the second to allegations made against him and other public figures. The third was set up to investigate reports made as a result of the high-profile Savile allegations.","Police have seen a surge in number of  child sex abuse cases since 2011 .

"This gives a whole new meaning to the phrase 'bouncing baby'. Angelina Santini from San Diego, California, filmed her nine-month-old son Marcus getting carried away in his bouncer one day. The comical clip shows the youngster lurching back and forth with the device almost touching the floor. 'Hi, are you having fun?' his mother asks at one point, to which Marcus replies with a loud squeal. He then stops to look at the camera before starting his bouncing stunt again. After a few gentle rocks, he's soon going at full speed with his arms waving in the air. Adding to the performance, he trills his lips at the same time. At the one-minute-30-second mark, Marcus shows no sign of slowing down. Four years on, videos show that the youngster has swapped his passion for bouncing with playing the guitar. With so much energy though, it's likely he'll be strumming some some rock n' roll beats instead of classical sounds.

"The televised debate between Democratic candidates running for mayor of Philadelphia came to a crashing halt on Tuesday, when 74-year-old Lynne Abraham collapsed on stage. It was only 10 minutes into the hour-long debate when Abraham was heard falling as Senator Anthony Williams answered a question, and the camera panned over to see the former Philadelphia District Attorney lying helpless on the floor. Mayoral candidate Nelson Diaz quickly came to Abraham's aide and helped her stand up when she regained consciousness. Scroll down for video . Philadelphia mayoral candidate Lynne Abraham (left) collapsed on stage 10 minutes into Tuesday night's hour-long debate between Democratic candidates . The former Philadelphia District Attorney Abraham allegedly suffered a momentary drop in blood pressure. She sat out the rest of the debate . The debate was paused as a doctor evaluated Abraham backstage and told her she probably suffered from a sudden drop in blood pressure due to the unforgiving stage lights. While Abraham was anxious to get back on stage and finish the debate, the doctor ordered her against returning. Speaking to reporters after her fall, Abraham said she was embarrassed but feeling well and that the incident won't impact her campaign. 'How'd you like my opening act?' Abraham joked to reporters. 'Nothing like fainting on stage.' Speaking to reporters after the fall, Abraham appeared to be in good spirits and said she would not let the incident impact her campaign. Pictured on the right before speaking to reporters after the fall . Describing the incident, Abraham said she was on a riser when she 'leaned over to look at [Williams] and the lights went out.' She said she has never fainted before. 'It just happened at an inopportune time. It's a little bit embarrassing but I fell gracefully. I didn't hurt anything I'm fine,' she said. Despite missing most of the debate, the fall appears to have had a strangely positive affect for Abraham. In a poll conducted after the debate, 54 per cent of participants said they would vote for Abraham in the Democratic primary, scheduled for May 19. Abraham appeared to be healthy on stage just before the debate began Tuesday night at Philadelphia's Kimmel Center. Pictured on the left, next to mayor candidate Nelson Diaz . After Abraham was taken off stage, the debate continued between the remaining candidates. From left to right: Abraham, Nelson Diaz, Jim Kenney, Doug Oliver, Milton Street and Senator Anthony Williams . That's likely good news to her campaign managers, since Abraham has been having a hard time raising enough money to compete with front-runners Williams and Jim Kenney, according to Philly.com.

"Millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst was indicted Wednesday on the two weapons charges that have kept him in New Orleans even though his lawyers say he wants to go to Los Angeles as soon as possible to face a murder charge there. A grand jury charged Durst with possession of a firearm by a felon, and possession of both a firearm and an illegal drug: 5 ounces of marijuana, said Assistant District Attorney Chris Bowman, spokesman for the district attorney. Durst's attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment. Millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst was indicted Wednesday on the two weapons charges that have kept him in New Orleans even though his lawyers say he wants to go to Los Angeles as soon as possible to face a murder charge there (file photo) His arrest related to those charges has kept Durst from being extradited to Los Angeles, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of longtime friend Susan Berman. He has waived extradition in that case. Until his indictment Wednesday, Durst had been arrested but not formally charged in connection with the .38-caliber revolver authorities say was found in his hotel room. According to court testimony, an FBI agent recognized Durst in a New Orleans hotel March 14 and escorted him to his hotel room. Durst was arrested early March 15 on the Los Angeles warrant and arrested separately on the weapons charges the next day. It was the day before the final HBO episode aired of The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst. A hearing in the New Orleans case had been scheduled for Thursday before a magistrate. Durst's attorneys maintain that the arrest on weapons charges was illegal, partly because FBI agents searched Durst's hotel room without a search warrant and before his arrest. The indictment puts the case before a Criminal District Court judge, rather than the magistrate. Durst turns 72 Sunday. Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. The real estate heir was temporarily placed on suicide watch soon after his arrest. His lawyers claim his Asperger's Syndrome led him to erroneously trust the HBO producers, who screened semi-confessional interviews that will now be used against him in trial. Durst, who prosecutors have said is worth up to $100 million, has long been estranged from his powerful family, which has major New York real estate holdings. He has been held without bail at a facility for mentally ill inmates about 70 miles (110 km) from New Orleans, with local authorities having labeled him a suicide risk.","Robert Durst was indicted Wednesday on the two weapons charges that have kept him in New Orleans .

"Israeli scholars are furious after new flooring was fitted 'behind their backs' by the Muslim authority in charge of Judaism's holiest site - potentially covering up clues to the location of the 'Lost Ark'. The work at the Dome of the Rock was simply meant to replace carpet, worn away by thousands of pilgrims at the gold-topped shrine, which overlooks old Jerusalem. But when the old carpet was lifted, it revealed previously undocumented ancient floor designs - which could point to where the gold-cased Ark of the Covenant was buried 2,500 years ago. The discovery of the cryptic geometric patterns immediately caught the attention of some researchers, thrilled at the possibility of solving the Indiana Jones-type mystery which touches upon a holy grail for biblical enthusiasts. Scroll down for video . Hidden: Workers place carpets over ancient floor designs in the cave under the Dome of the Rock, which Israeli scholars are angry they did not get the chance to document before they were covered . Legend: Scholars have suggested the flooring may give a clue as to where the Ark of the Covenant - imagined here in the 1981 Indiana Jones film - is hidden, which Jewish tradition says is buried under the Dome . 'Something is there. I don't know what. But something is hidden there,' said Israeli archaeologist Zachi Dvira, who studies the site. Yet it looks likely it will remain a mystery: scholars did not get the chance to document the designs before workmen began laying the new carpet, paid for by King Abdullah II of Jordan, the country which remains the custodian of the area's Muslim holy sites. It has sparked a war of words between the Waqf, the Muslim authority that administers the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, which includes the Dome of the Rock, and Israeli archaeological authorities, who say the repairs were carried out behind their backs. The scholars also fear the glue being used may permanently damage the floor. Israel's housing minister Uri Ariel, of the nationalist Jewish Home party, waded in to the argument to urge an immediate halt to the work. In an alarmed letter sent to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, he wrote: 'There is no need to elaborate on how important this site is, where every modification, every excavation with heavy equipment can cause irreparable harm to the foundations of the Temple.' Row: The Dome of the Rock is one of the most contentious religious spots in all of Jerusalem, and the argument over the carpet is simply the latest in a long line of battle between Muslim and Jewish groups . Holy: The Dome of the Rock and its hilltop plaza is considered Judaism's holiest spot and Islam's third holiest . But the Waqf reject the accusations. Sheikh Azzam Tamimi, the head of the Waqf, said the work is long overdue and has defiantly proclaimed that he was forbidding any Israeli involvement. 'Our work in Al Aqsa is transparent,' he said. 'We are only putting down carpet and felt. Nothing more, nothing less.' They also deny the work will cause any damage. Jamal Al Quda, a member of a group of Jordanian carpet layers who received Israeli visas for the job,  said it was necessary to affix the base layer of thin dark felt before rolling out the carpet above it. 'It comes off my hand,' he added, rubbing his fingers. Heritage: The Dome is thought to be one of the most interesting archaeological sites in Jerusalem . Finance: This latest work, pictured last Sunday, is being paid for by King Abdullah II of Jordan . This is not the first time tensions have flared over work at the Dome of the Rock. The Dome of the Rock is at the centre of competing claims. Muslims believe it enshrines the large rock slab where Muslim tradition says the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. Meanwhile, Jews believe the rock may be where the holiest part of the two ancient Temples stood as early as about 3,000 years ago — and where religious Jews pray a third Temple will one day be built. Ancient Jewish traditions say the Ark of the Covenant. which contained the Ten Commandments, may have been hidden away in a chamber when the First Jewish Temple was destroyed. The adjacent Western Wall, believed to be one of the last remnants of the Temple complex, is the holiest site where Jews can pray. But Palestinian officials reject Jewish historical ties to the site and the competing claims have been known to spill over into violence. While Jerusalem may be the most excavated city in the world, the Dome and its hilltop plaza are an archaeological goldmine which has never been properly dug because of the political sensitivities surrounding the site, which is considered Judaism's holiest spot and Islam's third holiest. In 1999, the Muslim authorities who administer the site dug an enormous hole 12 metres, or 40 feet, deep as part of construction for an underground prayer area, dumping 10,000 tons of earth in a nearby valley and an east Jerusalem dump. The director of the Israeli Antiquities Authority at the time called it an 'archaeological crime'. For years, Dvira and veteran Israeli archaeologist Gabriel Barkay have been leading a team of archaeologists and volunteers in combing through the dirt for historical finds. The initiative, called the Temple Mount Sifting Project, is conducted under the auspices of the Elad Foundation, a group that also purchases Arab homes in contested parts of East Jerusalem and helps move Jews in. Critics say this nationalist agenda should not mix with archaeology. Israel's state comptroller wrote a scathing report in 2010 about the Muslim authorities' illicit work projects at the compound and Israel's failure at enforcing supervision there. Israeli officials kept the report classified out of concern that its publication could harm the sensitive relationship with Jordan. Tens of thousands of worshippers attend weekly Friday prayers, and the carpets have been replaced before — most recently 12 years ago, at a time of heightened violence when Israeli antiquities officials were granted limited access to the site. Social media: Leaked photos of the work have fuelled this latest argument between the two sides . Past renovation projects were done quietly behind the scenes. Leaked photos posted on social media sites — combined with the political influence of Israeli nationalists monitoring the site — drew extra attention and fuelled the latest controversy. Photos that were leaked to Facebook from the off-limits restoration site showed a number of geometric floor patterns never before documented by archaeologists, said Frankie Snyder, a researcher with the Temple Mount Sifting Project. Some apparently date to when the Crusaders controlled the complex in the 12th century, she said. 'I'm worried about damage of the original floors,' said Barkay, the archaeologist. 'The patterns were never properly documented.' Israel Hasson, the director of the Israeli Antiquities Authority, said once the government body learned about the renovation, it made arrangements with the Waqf to send an archaeologist to document some of the floor patterns, but others already had been covered by the maroon and beige carpeting. 'We got to part of them. We didn't get to it all. I won't ask anyone to pull up the carpets to document it,' Hasson said. 'We will wait for the next opportunity. We're sure to be here over the next 2,000 years.'","Row erupted after mysterious geometric designs discovered under carpet .

"Behind the highly-publicized trial of murderer Aaron Hernandez has played out a painful and private feud between two sisters. Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, 25, sobbed and hugged the killer's mom in the Massachusetts court on Wednesday as the jury returned a guilty verdict for first-degree murder, sending the ex-NFL star to prison for life with no chance of release. Just feet away across the aisle in the packed courtroom, sat her 23-year-old sister, Shaneah Jenkins, the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd who Hernandez executed with five bullets on June 17, 2013. The once-close sisters, who shared an apartment in their native Bristol, Connecticut, have not spoken since it became clear that Hernandez had a role in Lloyd's brutal death. Scroll down for video . Happier times: Sisters Shaneah (pictured left) and Shayanna Jenkins (right) pictured in 2011. The Aaron Hernandez murder trial has left them estranged . Torn apart: Shayanna Jenkins (pictured right) and her younger sister Shaneah (left) in their senior yearbook photo from 2007 at Bristol Central High School, Connecticut. The two sisters were close until Aaron Hernandez's murder of Odin Lloyd left them on opposite sides of a murder trial . The girlfriend of Odin Lloyd (circled, bottom left) dabbed her eyes with a tissue as she sat across the aisle from her estranged sister and Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, who sobbed and hugged the former NFL player's mother Terri (top right) when the guilty verdict was announced . Shayanna Jenkins left the courtroom immediately after the guilty verdict on Wednesday morning and was seen driving away in her car, eyes shielded by sunglasses. She did not wait to hear the victim impact statement of Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, who said that she had forgiven those who 'had a hand in my son's murder both before and after'. The mother also spoke of how her son Odin introducing her to his girlfriend Shaneah had been 'a gift' in her life. Shaneah did not speak before the court but placed a comforting hand on Ms Ward when she spoke to media outside. The Jenkins sisters, who introduced the men, both attended the trial at times, sitting on opposite sides without exchanging a word, their rift on full display. Shayanna sat behind Hernandez, 25, and could be seen joking with him, several times exchanging whispered 'I love yous' when she attended. Shaneah sat with Lloyd's family. Before he was killed, she and Lloyd, 27, had made plans to move in together while she attended law school in Boston. Both sisters took the stand during the two-and-a-half-month murder trial in Fall River, Massachusetts. When Shaneah took the stand against Hernandez, her sister sat in the front row, supporting the former Pats star and father of her two-year-old daughter, Avielle. The sisters, for a time, took similar paths, according to Shaneah's testimony. The women grew up together in Bristol, Connecticut, and both attended Bristol Central High School. They have a 16-year-old younger sister. Shayanna had an on-and-off relationship with Hernandez that spanned the last two years of high school. When Hernandez went off to Florida to play football, Shayanna went to community college. After Hernandez was drafted by the Patriots in 2010, Shayanna left college and moved with him to a Massachusetts condo.

Her older sister, who had also once worked there, helped her get the job. It was there that Shaneah met Lloyd, who was doing electrical work with a crew staying at the hotel, in January 2012. By March, they were dating. They talked every day and after Lloyd's work in Connecticut ended, their relationship deepened. Lloyd and Hernandez first met in August 2012, when, for the younger sister's birthday, Hernandez got a skybox for a Patriots game at Gillette Stadium. After that, the men saw each other a few times a month, Shaneah told the court. She would stay with her sister and Hernandez when she went to Massachusetts to visit Lloyd every couple of weeks. 'Almost every time I went there, he was with me,' Shaneah testified. During those visits, while the sisters would hang out upstairs, go shopping or get their nails done, Lloyd and Hernandez would sometimes hole up in the basement 'man cave' and smoke marijuana, often with other people, Shaneah testified. A few times, the couples went to clubs together. By May 2013, Shaneah graduated college and had big plans: pursuing a law degree at New England School of Law. She was moving to Boston, she testified, and she and Lloyd were planning to move in together. The next month, Lloyd was dead. Shaneah, now a second-year criminal law student, tearfully testified about getting the call from police in the middle of the night. She called her mother. Her next call was to her older sister. After heading to see Lloyd's mother in Boston, Shaneah and her uncle drove to the home Shayanna and Hernandez shared. Surveillance video played in court from inside the home showed Shayanna giving her a long hug. As she watched the video play from her seat in the front row, Shayanna put her hand on her forehead, then wiped away tears. But other parts of Shaneah's testimony seemed to agitate the older sister, who had her arms crossed and bounced her leg, occasionally emitting sighs as her sister spoke. Ursula Ward, mother of the victim, speaks to the media outside court on Wednesday. Her late son's girlfriend, Shaneah Jenkins, (second left) gave her a comforting pat on the arm . Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, fled the court on Wednesday morning after Aaron Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder . Shayanna pulled out a notebook and began scribbling notes at a few points, including when Shaneah insisted Hernandez had checked in with her only once to see how she was doing in the days after Lloyd was found dead. Hernandez's lawyer presented Shaneah with her own grand jury testimony, when she said he had periodically asked if she was OK. Shayanna then shared the notes with Hernandez's legal team. Shayanna attended just one day of her sister's testimony - when Shaneah was cross-examined. During that time, the sisters did not make eye contact, except once. Soon after she took the stand, the prosecutor asked if she saw her sister in the courtroom. Shaneah at first said no, until Shayanna craned her neck to make sure she was seen. Hernandez had been in the way. Then at the end of last month, it was Shayanna's turn to take the stand for the prosecution after she was granted immunity. Prosecutors earlier accused Jenkins of lying to a grand jury 29 times as it probed Lloyd's murder. Shayanna Jenkins, fiancee of the former Patriots player, testified at his murder trial in March. She stuttered and said 'we're estranged' when asked about her relationship with her sister . Shayanna Jenkins' younger sister, Shaneah, cried in court as her sister testified about disposing of items from Hernandez's home after the murder. To her right is Lloyd's mother Ursula . They accused her of getting rid of possible evidence on Hernandez's instructions - including the murder weapon, a .45 Glock pistol. Shaneah testified she saw her sister carry a garbage bag to the basement after getting calls and texts the morning after Lloyd's body was found. Shayanna was seen on her own home surveillance cameras carrying a box from her basement and borrowing her sister's car to take it away. She testified to the court that she had 'no memory' of where she disposed of the box. The box, nor the murder weapon, has ever been found. Her sister, Shaneah Jenkins, who was dating murder victim Lloyd, left the court sobbing as she made that statement. Shayanna,wearing her large diamond engagement ring on the stand, borrowed Shaneah's car to carry out the errand after the younger sister came to her home to grieve for her murdered boyfriend. She told the court that she believed it was the first time she had ever borrowed her sister's vehicle. Shayanna appeared unruffled by the intense scrutiny being placed on by the prosecution over her alleged lies to the grand jury. But when she was asked about her relationship with her younger sister, she paused and stuttered: 'We're estranged.'","Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, 25, sobbed when the verdict of first-degree murder was announced on Wednesday .

"They are the remnant of a bygone era, when Sultan's ruled one of the world's oldest empires, living in a forgotten age of opulence and extravagance in India's immense palace estates. But when the Duke of Wellington 's forces defeated and killed Tipu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore, in 1799, troops plundered the city and the palace, returning to Britain with gold, jewellery, arms, armour, clothing and even Tipu's grand throne. This month, a collection of the historic artefacts from this exotic empire will go on sale at London auction house Bonhams, and experts expect them to fetch a total of around £1million. Pure opulence: A gem-set sword with pink, green and red stones and an ornate tiger's head pommel is expected to sell for £80,000. This rare quilted helmet with a gold koftgari bar, incredibly artistic stitching and the wonderfully bright colours of India is set to sell for £35,000 . Great adversaries: The Tiger of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, left, and army general, Arthur Wellesley, right, fought in India in 1799. War was waged after spies intercepted a letter from the Sultan proposing an alliance with the French. Wellesley went on to become the Duke of Wellington, defeating Napolean in the Battle of Waterloo. But he earned his stripes fighting in Mysore and rushed to check the sultan's pulse when he was killed . The item tipped to attract the biggest price is the Sultan's personal sporting gun, a four-foot-long rifle made by his own armoury, tipped to make £150,000 alone. It was given as a present to Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General of India, after the fall of Tipu and passed on to the Earls of Pembroke, staying in the family for 200 years. A gold-coloured gem-set sword with an artistic tiger's head pommel showing the craftsmanship of 18th-century Mysore is expected to sell for £80,000. An archer's set, made for Tipu, includes a beautiful gold and red embroidered quiver and arm guards, a belt with a finely-forged buckle and seven decorated arrows. It's expected to sell for £60,000. The collection also includes a rare quilted helmet with a gold koftgari bar, stitched with a finely detailed pattern and the wonderfully bright colours associated with India, which is set to sell for £35,000. One of the prize pieces is an artistically carved hardwood tiger-paw from the foot of Tipu's throne - the only surviving piece of the once magnificent structure - which could make £20,000. Bidders can buy a piece of history with a Mughal gem-set jade plaque, complete with a note stating it was found with the body of Tipu Sultan in 1799 after he died on the battlefield. Other items up for sale include pistols, helmets, swords, intricately embroidered clothing and even a bronze field cannon used to defend the fortress at Seringapatam. Atop of an empire: This historic picture shows what Tipu's magnificent throne would have looked like before he was toppled. On sale in the auction is the only surviving piece of the magnificent throne, a decoratively carved tiger foot with a silver plaque celebrating the victory . Foot of the throne: A carved wood tiger paw from the foot of the throne of Tipu Sultan, expected to sell for £20,000 . Medal of honour: The silver plaque atop the foot of the throne commemorates the victory over one of the greatest sultans in history . A golden age: This embroidered quiver and arm guards, belt and seven decorated arrows, made for Tipu, is expected to sell for £60,000 . The items were collected over 30 years by British Tipu expert Robin Wigington, who even turned part of his house in Stratford Upon Avon into a museum and allowed some of them to be displayed in exhibitions worldwide. He sold his collection to a private collector in 2005 and they have now been put up for sale again. Claire Penhallurick, head of Islamic and Indian art at Bonhams, said: 'It is very unusual for there to be an auction of so many artefacts that once belonged to Tipu. It is the product of one man who collected for nearly 30 years. 'Robin Wigington was an arms and armour gentleman dealer who collected these pieces over three decades. He was obsessed with Tipu - he published pieces and loaned items to major exhibitions. 'In the end he built his own museum at his home in Stratford Upon Avon which was open for six years, during which time it won an award for the best British museum. 'One of the highlights of this sale is one of the feet that Tipu's throne rested on. 'Quite a few of the items are signed and dated by the manufacturer, making them incredibly important historical documents because it allows other items from the same era to be dated. 'Many of the pieces have previous metal inlays and incredibly decorative touches. It's very obvious they're Tipu's pieces. 'Wigington had an eye for quality and he collected the best of the best. These items are not just arms and armour but far more than that - they're works of art. Storming of Seringapatam under General Baird and death of Tipu Sultan, May 4, 1799, in the Mysore War. Tipu Sultan was shot and killed in the onslaught . Wellington was a 30-year-old army general when he led troops to Mysore in the late 18th century. Then a young Arthur Wellesley, he earned his stripes and learned skills fighting Tipu, nicknamed the Tiger of Mysore, that would later prove vital in defeating French dictator Napoleon on the battlefields of Waterloo. His elder brother Richard Wellesley, the British Governor General, had waged war against the sultan after a spy intercepted a letter from Napoleon proposing an alliance. It was to be the fourth war between the Brits and the southern Indian kingdom of Mysore in just over 30 years. Wellesley led the British army into Tipu's stronghold of Seringapatam, the capital of Mysore, on April 5 1799 with the military planning and precision that came to be his strongest attributes. More than two decades letter Wellesley, by then the Duke of Wellington, used the same skills he had learned against Tipu Sultan to crush Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. After several weeks of besieging the city the Brits were able to breach the walls of its fortress. Tipu Sultan was shot and killed in the onslaught, and Wellesley dashed to the scene to check his pulse. Weelington went on to become one of the most famed leaders in military history. 'Tipu Sultan was one of the greatest rulers in Indian history, but interest in him comes from all over the world.' 'He was the first adversary of General Arthur Wellesley, who went on to become the Duke of Wellington. 'It would be fair to say Wellesley learned the skills he later displayed at the Battle of Waterloo fighting against Tipu, although Tipu gave the Brits a good run for their money. 'After the fall of Tipu the British took over his palace and some of his items were divided up among officers. 'A series of auctions were held over three days in Seringapatam where more treasures were sold. 'Some of these items we are selling could have come from these auctions, or they could have been gifted to officers at the time. 'Many of the pieces have 200-year provenances in the UK. 'Some were personal weapons of Tipu's - one such is a huge gun with a crouching tiger carved into the butt which was gifted to Lord Cornwallis after the fall of Seringapatam.

English Heritage is putting on new displays at Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner and nearby Apsley House, the London home of the first Duke of Wellington, who commanded the army that defeated Napolean in modern day Belgium in 1815. They mark the bicentenary of the battle in which British and Prussian forces finally defeated Bonaparte, bringing an end to conflict which had raged in Europe and the wider world for 20 years.

'Once the Waterloo Gallery was finished in 1828, the banquets expanded and became very glamorous affairs, so much so there were crowds outside, it was the red carpet event of its day.'","30-year-old Duke of Wellington fought Tipu Sultan as an army general in 1799 .

"Alex Impey is breaking the law selling his customers marijuana, but as long as he keeps hearing stories that the drug is helping them cope with pain, he couldn't care less. And business for medicinal marijuana is booming, with Mr Impey telling Daily Mail Australia he receives 20 new requests for help each week at his hemp store, Gnostic Hemporium, on the NSW Central Coast, north of Sydney. 'I've got people coming in all the time, who have everything from cancer to early onset Parkinson's,' the father of two said. 'And that woman [with Parkinson's] has had remarkable results when using the cannabis, it stopped her shuddering.' Scroll down for video . Alex Impey, is a father-of-two, who says he is selling marijuana to help to those suffering from serious illness . Larisa Rule recovers in hospital after one of her surgical procedures with mum Jaylen by her side. Her parents make no apologies for turning to marijuana to help their daughter cope with her conditions, which include epilepsy . The medicinal marijuana broken down into the oil used by chronic pain sufferers and terminally ill. Users say it is as simple as placing into food or bottles for babies. Some cancer sufferers can use up to a gram each day as treatment with costs of the oil between $80 to $150 per gram . Parents of children with serious illnesses are being taught how to grow their own marijuana crops, such as this one (above) 'And mate, there are two blokes who both have daughters with childhood epilepsy and they have only good things to say about the effect it has had on their kids, so I will keep doing it.' One of those 'blokes' is Peter Rule. His three-year-old daughter, Larisa, suffered brain damage at birth, leaving her partially blind and deaf, and with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Within two days she was having up to 60 uncontrollable seizures a day - some lasting more than an hour. Doctors, said her mother Jaylen Siery, tried almost everything to stop the convulsions and even considered brain surgery. So when traditional approaches did nothing to relieve her suffering, her parents, turned to less conventional methods, having heard the benefits others had had from a dose of liquid cannabis. Results, they insist, were immediate. Within 24 hours Larisa's seizures were down to just five a day. Ms Siery, 22, told Daily Mail Australia: 'People tell me I’m a terrible mother and they say things like ""you wouldn’t give your daughter heroin"". 'But little do they realise, most of the medicines the doctors gave us before had opium in - the same plant heroin is derived from,' she said. Jaylen Siery (above left with her baby Larisa, also right) tried almost everything to stop the now three-year-old's convulsions and even considered brain surgery. Mr Impey says Australia should follow the lead taken by parts of the United States, where the drug is approved for use in treating some serious illnesses . 'I’m not a bad mother, I want nothing but good for my child, she was in pain, she was suffering, and I tried everything before I tried this'. Mr Rule added: 'A lot of people forget about the hospital time we spend trialling medications until we decided the best treatment we already had in our own backyard. 'Now we are regaining what should have never been lost in the first place, for some the cannabis is the last option other than death. 'The government has not offered to help anyone at all, the demand for this medicine has grown to unmanageable levels .. local community based support is taking control of the health care of people sourcing other options. 'We have no other choice but to support those around us until we see changes regarding the epidemic of failing treatments and over-prescribed pharmaceutical medications.' Mr Rule turned to producing his own marijuana. Now the family has 'about three of four suppliers and they all look after us'. A police spokesperson said, despite instances where people are let off with a caution: 'It is still considered an illicit drug and if you manufacture, possess or use it, then it is against the law and you face prosecution.' Mr Impey is unconcerned at the prospect of prosecution, saying he's providing help where it's needed. The biggest problem they face is having their crops destroyed. 'It's difficult when growing is considered illegal and the police are still taking (away) medicinal cannabis .. but we'll keep going.' Researching Larisa's (second left) symptoms on the internet, Peter Rule (left) discovered a daily dose of liquid cannabis was an alternative therapy. Larisa Rule pictured in hospital. Her parents Peter and Jaylen say doctors tried all conventional methods and a continuous flow of medications to try and bring her seizures under control but 'nothing worked' and that's why they turned to marijuana . He said the liquid is made by soaking the cannabis flowers, leaves, or stems in ethyl alcohol to create a medicine. 'The Government has taken way too long to ensure the safe supply and regulation of whole plant products and while we wait on trials children and adults and dying and suffering,' he claimed. 'Because of this many of us are making a stand and taking back our right to grow and use this plant.' He admits, however, that striking the right balance of the active ingredients in marijuana is still a significant challenge, between the psycho-active chemical and cannabidiol - which is believed to provide much of the medicinal benefits. 'There are a wide variety of strains, we have to work on making one part of it lower and they other higher, each will have different effects on each individual... so it is important to have access to a wide variety of strains.' He says he's not the only one, claiming other communities are following his programmed approach, to try and stop the law intervening. 'The plan we've come up with means everyone does their part, including the individual who might be sick,' Mr Impey said. 'More than 20 people a week are seeking it, and I'm either making medicines for them or help in other ways. 'They just come in and ask me ""is this the stuff that cures cancer?"" You know they're desperate for help when they ask stuff like that.' He revealed that another supplier in Sydney receives double the number of people enquiring about medicinal marijuana, each week. His Woy Woy store is a legitimate hemp outlet, selling various hemp-based products including clothing and cosmetics. He has started a process whereby sufferers can learn to make it for themselves. For about a $2000 investment, those who are sick, or family members, are given the products and taught for a 12-week period on how to produce for themselves, 'rather than paying 6000 for a pound of crap'. 'We are working with people, and a lot of shop owners around the country have got into this,' he said. Mr Rule with daughter Larisa. Some of the regular hemp products Mr Impey stocks in his store, including hemp seeds . Alex Impey at his hemp store on the New South Wales central coast. He says more than 20 new requests for help come through the door each week . 'By doing this they don't have to go to the gangs who are growing, don't have to go down the back alley and deal with 16-year-old school-kids. 'A lot of it (marijuana) is now coming from South Australia, all that crap they make, it is a drug they are getting off the street, we are trying to go with a quality approach, focusing on the plants which help and doing it on a smaller scale like a hobby. 'So many people want access so even if it is legalised, it is never going to be just the one person or just the government, it isn't the case now. 'We offer a sort of, I guess, dispensary sort of business, using the same sort of guidelines they do in parts of the US, I heard of in California or Colorado.' In fact, marijuana is legal in more than 20 states in the US, if users can provide proof they are using it as treatment for serious illnesses, like Larisa's acute epilepsy. He explained that a group of 'about 50 people have set up our own cannabis club' but it is not without risk, on several levels. Peter Rule with daughter Larisa and partner Jaylen. He said: 'A lot of people forget about the hospital time we spend trialling (other) medications until we decided the best treatment we already had in our own backyard, we are regaining what should have never been lost in the first place' 'What is wrong with growing something that is helping people, we have a team of 15 growers, who supply those who cannot. 'It's not about making money,' he stressed, 'yes, I grow it but more importantly, I help set up people to help themselves'. He said that those suffering epilepsy work together, as do those with Parkinson's, 'we call ourselves cannabis clubs which encourage those coping with a problem being on the same page with someone else who is suffering in the same way'. 'The way we planned it is they get to understand how it best fits their problem, how much they need and they can swap notes, it's about feeling better, that's all.' 'We certainly don't want major corporations taking control of this - some sort of deregulation needs to happen and the laws need to change, giving people the right to be able to grow it, after all it's just another plant.'","Alex Impey is breaking the law by openly selling marijuana to customers seeking pain relief .

"A father who walked out of a secretive Christian commune where everyone wears blue uniforms and birth control is non-existent said living in the community was like being in a scary thriller movie. Elijah Overcomer, 26, left Gloriavale, a town of about 500 on New Zealand's west coast,  with his wife, Rosanna, 29, and their children in late March 2013. Shortly following their departure, the family watched the 2004 psychological thriller The Village, by M. Night Shyamalan. Mr Overcomer said the film - where residents of a pretend 19th century town fear the 'wicked' outside world - was a 'good comparison with our community', especially in their views of the greater world. '(In the film), all the kids have grown up and been told the outside is unsafe. They even make their own scare tactics to scare people from going outside the wee village,' he said. 'It's kind of the same thing here. You're told if you leave Gloriavale you're lost, you lose your Salvation.' Life in Gloriavale: Wearing their customary blue uniforms, Elijah Overcomer, now 26, wife Rosanna, now 29 and two of the three children they left with are photographed inside the commune .

Gloriavale, a secretive Christian commune, is nestled on the banks of Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast . Living in the now: The Overcomers have lived outside Gloriavale for two years . Sharing candid photographs of his family's time in Gloriavale with Daily Mail Australia, Mr Overcomer said  he had been told there was 'a lot of sin' and 'bad things' in the greater world. 'You almost only get to know about the evil while you're there. 'That's all you know to be outside Gloriavale, is a lot of evil and that sort of thing.' But following their departure, the family were 'blown away' by the kindness and support shown to them by New Zealand churches in Christchurch and Timaru. The latter town, some 300kms south of Gloriavale, has become home to several former members of the sect recently following a virtual exodus. According to Sunday NZ program,  22 residents have left in the past two months. Among them includes the Ben Canaan family of 14, who famously walked out this March. 'When we left we received so much help and gifts from people especially churches at Christchurch and then at Timaru,' Mr Overcomer told Daily Mail Australia. 'People (were) just helping us out giving us clothing, kitchen gear - heaps of stuff - and we were quite shocked with that. 'We've been blown away by how much love we've received outside of there. Even from people who aren't Christians, as well. 'There's a lot of really kind, caring people who want to help you. I mean, even in our district, you meet someone new and they just want to help. Just blown away. The family have faced two particular challenges leaving Gloriavale. The most devastating is that the couple are mostly unable to contact their large extended family inside the commune. 'Not being able to talk to them and see them is definitely the worst thing,' said Mr Overcomer, who is now managing a dairy farm and living in Timaru. 'Everyone can adapt into a different lifestyle. But you can't adapt from leaving your family.' A scene from the 2004 M. Night Shyamalan film, The Village. In the film, residents believed they were living in a 19th century village - but in reality the village had been founded in the 1970s .

Love in Gloriavale: Elijah is pictured here with Rosanna in scenic Gloriavale . One of the Overcomer's little boys, Seth, is pictured at Gloriavale . Love in Gloriavale: Rosanna is photographed here with three children, Seth (left), Zac and Honour . The deeply religious family were also forced to grapple with their views about Christianity. They were particularly afraid that, by walking out of Gloriavale they may have lost their 'Salvation' with God. 'I guess the biggest thing, other than leaving family, was feeling like our salvation was lost. 'For us, we felt that was the worst thing. Especially my wife really struggled with that. 'It wasn't until we got good teaching from the pastor at our church and he taught us through the Bible really well so we could be confident that Gloriavale was wrong and that we were actually free to go wherever we like... 'That really gave us a lot of security in what we've done. What we've been told wasn't true... You still have to tell yourself that.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist. Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book Sins of the Father, said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.'' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can. That's why they have big families.'Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt. And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms.The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels. Little Honour, pictured, grew up in Gloriavale and can be seen wearing her miniature blue uniform . Known by the name 'Hopeful Christian', Neville Cooper (pictured) was convicted of sex abuse and spent 11 months in prison in 1995 . Mr Overcomer was initially kicked out of the Gloriavale for five weeks around Christmas 2012 after 'asking too many questions' of the Elders, who rule the sect. Among the matters he asked about was the history of founder Neville Cooper, who was convicted and spent nearly a year imprisoned on sex abuse charges in 1995 . 'I don't know what really turned the corner with them. 'I guess the main thing is I even had the guts or whatever it was to ask them, to question it. 'It might seem strange looking in from out there. (But) growing up there you're real scared of them (the Elders), scared of getting in trouble with them. 'It was quite a courageous move to ask questions of them. Obviously I expected answers.' After five weeks of 'hell' separated from his family, Mr Overcomer 'repented' for his sins and returned home to Gloriavale. But the family soon decided to pick up and leave. In Gloriavale, women are required to wear a blue, full-length robe (pictured in a documentary above) Gloriavale families live together in large, communal hostels . One of the reasons the Overcomers decided to leave Gloriavale was to spend more time with their children, rather than them being 'raised as a part of a system' Mr Overcomer, who had worked outside Gloriavale, particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up. 'I worked outside Gloriavale, ""sharemilking"" on a neighbour's farm for the community. It was kind of then I thought I'd like my own house and things. 'And I'd like to look after my kids personally. There (in Gloriavale) your kids are raised by the system I guess. 'School, pre-school children go to pre-school - you don't really get a whole lot of time with them. 'With a farming lifestyle, you get to spend a bit more time with your children. You have a bigger input in their lives. Mr Overcomer, who had worked outside Gloriavale, particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up . Gloriavale is located on Lake Haupiri, on the west coast of New Zealand's South Island. Many families have left for Timaru, around 300kms south . He told Daily Mail Australia one of his 'biggest issues' with Gloriavale is how they separate dissenters from their families. 'That's the biggest thing I want to see stopped. I had a guy working for me for a while - he's got back in now. 'He was out for six months, away from his wife and family. He had three little children. 'It's that sort of behaviour I want to see stopped.' Mr Overcomer now manages a dairy farm with more than 700 cows. He said the family, who now have two more children, had 'definitely' adjusted to life in Timaru. 'We've been doing well.' Daily Mail Australia approached Gloriavale for comment but did not receive a response. The 'Ben Canaan' family of fourteen, pictured, left Gloriavale for Timaru in March 2015.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign will center on boosting economic security for the middle class and expanding opportunities for working families, while casting the former senator and secretary of state as a 'tenacious fighter' able to get results, two senior advisers said on Saturday. President Barack Obama all but endorsed her saying 'I think she would be an excellent president.' The senior advisers provided the first preview of the message Clinton planned to convey when she launches her long-anticipated campaign on Sunday with an online video. Scroll down for video . Two senior advisers said on Saturday that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign will center on boosting economic security for the middle class and expanding opportunities for working families . Until now, the former first lady has offered only hints of what would drive her if she were to run a second time for the White House. The strategy described by Clinton's advisers has echoes of Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. He framed the choice for voters as between Democrats focused on the middle class and Republicans wanting to protect the wealthy and return to policies that led to the 2008 economic collapse. The advisers said Clinton will argue that voters have a similar choice in 2016. Clinton also intends to sell herself as being able to work with Congress, businesses and world leaders. That approach could be perceived as a critique of Obama, Clinton's rival for the nomination in 2008. He has largely been unable to fulfill his pledge to end Washington's intense partisanship and found much of his presidency stymied by gridlock with Congress. The Clinton advisers spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss her plans ahead of Sunday's announcement. People familiar with the plans say Clinton will travel to Iowa and other early-voting states to hold small events with residents in the days after the video's release. On Saturday, President Barack Obama (pictured right with Clinton in 2012) said: 'I think she would be an excellent president' In New York on Saturday, at the final event put on by 'Ready for Hillary,' a group not connected with her campaign that's worked for the past few years to stoke excitement for it, enthusiastic supporters joined elected officials and local party leaders to celebrate the launch to come. 'After she left the State Department she could have slipped into grandmother-hood, but people want to call her back into public service,' said Jarret Berg, 29, a Democratic staffer in the New York legislature. 'It's time for her.' As her official announcement loomed, the Republican National Committee linked Clinton to Obama, a regular focus of criticism from the GOP. 'All Hillary Clinton is offering is a continuation of the same big government ideas that have grown Washington instead of the middle class,' RNC spokesman Michael Short said in a statement. 'That's why voters want fresh leadership and a new direction, not four more years of Obama's failed policies.' Clinton is not expected to roll out detailed policy positions in the first weeks of her campaign. Clinton plans to sell herself as being able to work with Congress, businesses and world leaders . Advisers said she planned to talk about ways families can increase take-home pay, the importance of expanding early childhood education and making higher education more affordable. It's not yet clear whether that will include a noticeable break with Obama on economic policy. The GOP has hammered Obama's approach as anti-business and insufficient in the wake of the recession. The White House says the economy has improved significantly in recent years. The unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in March, but manufacturing and new home construction slowed, cheaper gas has yet to ignite consumer spending and participation in the labor force remains sluggish. Clinton will enter the race as the overwhelming favorite for her party's nomination. Still, her team has said her early strategy is designed to avoid appearing to take that nomination for granted. Clinton received an early boost Saturday from Obama, who was asked if he would be involved in her expected campaign. 'She was a formidable candidate in 2008. She was a great supporter of mine in the general election. She was an outstanding secretary of state. She is my friend. I think she would be an excellent president, and I'm not on the ballot so I'm not going to step on her lines,' Obama said from Panama City as he wrapped up participation in a summit of Western Hemisphere leaders. Clinton's early events will include discussions at colleges, day care centers and private homes, and stops at coffee shops and diners. After about a month of such events, Clinton will give a broader speech outlining more specifics about her rationale for running. Clinton's husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, are unlikely to appear at her early events. Bill Clinton, the former two-term president, said recently that he wanted to play a role as a 'backstage adviser' in his wife's campaign. Advisers said Bill Clinton has been engaged with his wife in some of the policy discussions leading up to this weekend's rollout. To prepare for the campaign, Clinton has spent months meeting with economic policy experts, including Heather Boushey, whose research focuses on inequality, and Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and retirement policy expert. Clinton will announce her second run for the presidency on Sunday (above supporters listen to a speech during the Last Hillary Clinton Rally in New York on Saturday) The policy development process has been overseen by aides Jake Sullivan and Dan Schwerin. In the days before her announcement, Clinton has been holding lengthy meetings with her staff, sometimes joining them at her crowded personal offices in midtown Manhattan and other times participating by phone. She is expected to reach out to donors in the coming weeks, but does not plan to headline many fundraising events over the next month. Clinton's growing team of staffers began working Friday out of a new campaign headquarters in Brooklyn. They gathered Saturday to hear from campaign manager-in-waiting Robby Mook, who told them the campaign would value teamwork, diversity, discipline and humility. Mook distributed a memo titled 'We are Hillary for America' that included several guiding principles, including a vow to work together and respect each other. The campaign, the memo said, 'is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us - it's about the everyday Americans who are trying to build a better life for themselves and their families.' The meeting was described by a Democratic official in attendance who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private strategy session. The memo was first reported by Politico.","Ahead of launching her anticipated campaign on Sunday, two senior advisers said strategy has echoes of Obama's 2012 re-election campaign .

"Rhodri Giggs outside Manchester Magistrates Court yesterday, where he was banned from driving . The brother of ex-footballer Ryan Giggs has lost his job as a HGV driver after being banned from the roads for driving without insurance. Rhodri Giggs, 37, revealed that he is now unemployed as he lost his licence after being found guilty of driving a Mercedes C200 without insurance. Under the 'totting-up' procedure, the former player-manager of non-league side Salford City, was forced to hand over his licence having already accrued six points from two previous speeding offences. Arriving for sentencing at Manchester Magistrates Court yesterday dressed in a black blazer and jeans, Giggs, of Salford said the offence on October 14 last year 'wasn't intentional'. But Eddie Coyle, prosecuting, said: 'On October 14 last year at around 9.30pm, he was driving a Mercedes along Hyde Road in Ardwick when he was brought to a stop by officers who performed checks and confirmed no insurance was in force.' After accepting his wrongdoing, Giggs was asked whether he would like to pursue an 'exceptional hardship' application in an attempt to retain his licence. He declined but added that he would permanently lose his job as an HGV driver with an agency and hadn't worked since December as he was waiting for the decision of the courts. Speaking for himself with no legal representation, he said: 'I work for an agency. If I lost my job I could get something else. 'I want to get this sorted today. I haven't worked since December and have no income or benefits.' Giggs was then banned from driving for six months, fined £110 and ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £85 costs. In January, Rhodri Giggs spoke for the first time about his brother Ryan's eight-year affair with his then wife Natasha . In January, Giggs spoke for the first time about his 41-year-old brother Ryan's eight-year affair with his then-wife Natasha which emerged in 2011. The Manchester United assistant manager allegedly told Rhodri that the affair was only ever 'about sex' Natasha Giggs later filed for divorce and went on to appear on Celebrity Big Brother, while Ryan's wife Stacey stood by his side. Giggs enjoyed a successful non-league football career playing for FC United of Manchester and is a former manager of Salford City. Manchester United assistant manager Giggs, left, allegedly told his brother that the affair with his wife Natasha, right, was only ever 'about sex' Ryan, left, and Rhodri Giggs as children. Ryan is rumoured to be worth more than £40million and is the most decorated footballer in British history . His brother Ryan, is currently part of Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal's backroom staff with his side third in the Barclay's Premier League. He is rumoured to be worth more than £40million and is the most decorated footballer in British history with 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League winner's medals. He is now co-owner of Salford City alongside his former Old Trafford teammates Philip and Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, having bought shares in the club last year.","Rhodri Giggs, 37, lost his driving licence under a 'totting up' procedure .

"A conspiracy theorist claims to have found evidence that aliens have been watching our early attempts at space travel. UFO researcher Scott Waring says he has spotted an extra-terrestrial spacecraft in a 55-year-old photo from Nasa's Mercury Project. Scientists say radical claims such as this are a simple case of pareidolia, which is the psychological response to seeing significant items in random places. A close up view of what Scott Waring believes is the UFO coming into view.  The image was taken as part of Project Mercury, which was the US' first mission to put men in space. Scientists says claims such as this are a case of pareidolia, which tricks the brain into seeing familiar objects in random places . Many scientists believe UFO sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called pareidolia. Pareidolia is the response to seeing faces and other significant and items, such as UFO, in random stimulus. 'The vast majority of these images are as vague and elusive as those posted by UFO witnesses on Earth, and many have a fairly mundane explanation,' Nigel Watson author of the UFO investigations Manual told DailyMail.com . 'The problem is that the more Nasa denies such things or explains them, the more people think there is a conspiracy to hide the truth that aliens are visiting our planet.' The image was taken by unmanned space probe Mercury-Redstone 1A on December 19, 1960. 'Why wouldn't aliens be interested in watching a historical moment in human history?,' asked Waring in his blog. 'Especially since the capsule was unmanned, there were no worries that they would be seen.' The image was taken as part of Project Mercury, which was the US' first mission to put humans in space. It started in 1958 and ended in 1963. The objectives of the program were to orbit a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate man's ability to function in space, and to recover both the astronaut and spacecraft safely. The first United States astronaut was Alan Shepard, whose suborbital flight of the Freedom 7 space capsule on May 5, 1961, was the first success of the Mercury program. 'It's actually the Earth in the background and the UFO is in space observing the Mercury capsule,' Waring said . This isn't the first time UFO hunters have scoured old Nasa images in the hope of finding evidence of alien life. Earlier this year, Waring claimed to have seen two mysterious glowing objects in a photo from a Gemini mission in 1966. And a ten-year old image of the Martian yielded what Waring believed to be a rock shaped uncannily like the President Obama's head - and that it could be part of a statue.

"Marathon season is in full swing with the London Marathon set to take place a week on Sunday. The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for £130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out £130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget £19.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of £19.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost, £130: Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At £130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of £130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes, £19.99: The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for £14.99 in 2013. Aldi's £19.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty. But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas: The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At £19.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the £130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.","Running is often celebrated as a cheap sport to take up .

"An amorous Italian couple have been fined £9,000 for having such noisy sex that it forced their neighbours to move out. The pair, who are in their 30s, were convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the 'raucous screams' during steamy sex sessions at their apartment in the northern town of San Martino. Their long-suffering neighbours, who first took them to court in 2009, described the wails of passion as 'deafening' and said it kept them and their two children awake. The couple, who are in their 30s, have been ordered to pay £9,000 after being convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the 'deafening' screams during sex sessions at their home in San Martino, Italy (file picture) The man, who has not been named, was sentenced to four months in prison in 2011, and his fiancée given a noise abatement order. But the couple appealed the sentence and have now been ordered to pay £7,000 in damages to their neighbours who now live elsewhere, and £2,000 in legal fees. The apartment next door to the noisy couple currently remains unoccupied, the Provincia Pavese newspaper said. It comes less than six months after a woman from Tyne and Wear, in the north east of England, was given a 12-week jail term and a four-year anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) for having noisy sex. Neighbours complained about Caroline Cartwright's loud screams during sex sessions with her husband of 38 years and moaned that they could hear the bed banging against the wall from the adjacent house. At the time, Mrs Cartwright explained: 'It was a metal headboard so it used to bang on the wall. 'There was no carpet back then, so when you have sex, the bed goes back and forward. 'If you get to a point where the bed's banging on the wall, you're not going to stop, are you? 'As far as I'm concerned, that's what you should be doing. Just relax. Go with the flow. It's not as if I'm having sex and think: ""Oh, I'm making too much noise. I better be quiet"".' Mrs Cartwright was initially handed a noise abatement order which was later upgraded to an ASBO after she breached the order five times. The ASBO forbade her from 'shouting, screaming and vocalisation' during sex or from playing loud music. Caroline Cartwright, from Tyne and Wear, was jailed for 12 weeks and handed a four-year ASBO for having noisy sex with her husband of 38 years, Steve. Neighbours complained about Mrs Cartwright's loud screams . Caroline and Steve (pictured together above leaving court last year) were visited by police countless times after neighbours complained their sex sessions were loud enough to drown out television programmes . However, in a bid to get around the restrictions, Mrs Cartwright switched her sex sessions to the morning leaving neighbours - who complained that she was noisy enough to drown out their TVs - less than impressed. 'I wasn't supposed to make excessive noise that could be heard in a neighbouring property or outside,' she explained. Mrs Cartwright was later arrested and admits she was even having sex with her husband Steve when police arrived to take to her into custody. The 53-year-old was taken to court, handed an eight-week suspended prison sentence and forced to live in a bail hostel for weeks. A year later, and after scores more complaints and visits from the police, she was again arrested for breaching her ASBO following two police callouts in two days. Again, she was handed a suspended sentence, this time for 12 weeks, and sent to live in a bail hostel where she was held alongside serious criminals, including murderers. However, despite her convictions, Mrs Cartwright, who has since bought a less noisy wooden bed, remains adamant that she's done nothing wrong. She said: 'I don't see why I should stop having sex in my own house with my husband of 38 years. 'I'm sure there could be a lot worse things I could be doing. They all thought it was stupid I was in prison. 'I mean I was in the same prison as people like Rose West for making a noise when I have sex. There could be a real crime going on while they're busy arresting me.'","Italian couple fined £9,000 for having noisy sex in San Martino apartment .

"A recent cyber-attack on the State Department was reportedly carried out by high-level Russia hackers who also penetrated restricted parts of the White House computer system, such as the president's private schedule. CNN reported Tuesday, citing US officials briefed on the months-long investigation conducted by the FBI and Secret Service, that the hackers were able to access real-time, non-public schedule of President Obama, which is regarded as highly sensitive information that is sought after by foreign intelligence agencies. In October 2014, the White House acknowledged that there had been suspicious activity on its unclassified network serving the executive office, prompting system shutdowns and security upgrades. Vulnerable: A new report has revealed that Russian hackers launched a cyber-attack against White House's unclassified computer network last year . Privacy concerns: The hackers reportedly accessed President Obama's non-public schedule, which is considered highly sensitive information . Sneak attack: According to federal officials involved in the probe, the hackers wormed their way into the White House system by breaching first the State Department's network . A six-month investigation into the breach, described as one of the most sophisticated attacks against the US, reportedly uncovered evidence pointing to hackers working on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin's government. According to federal officials involved in the probe, the hackers wormed their way into the White House system by breaching first the State Department's network. To accomplish this task, the cyber-bandits allegedly working for the Kremlin commandeered a State Department email account and sent a phishing email to someone at the White House designed to trick the recipient into downloading malicious software. Silver lining: White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said last year's cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information . Once downloaded onto a White House computer, the malware presumably allowed the hackers to penetrate the unclassified network containing Obama's schedule that is not accessible to the general public. According to an anonymous government official, the hackers have been able to re-enter the State Department computer system, despite efforts to keep them out. The Russian Embassy did not publicly comment on the hacking allegations . The White House responded to CNN’s revelations by saying the report did not refer to a new incident but was ‘speculating’ about the source of cyber activities that were disclosed last year. Spokesman Mark Stroh said in a statement that the White House would not comment on CNN's attribution of the cyber-attack to Russian hackers. ‘Any such activity is something we take very seriously. In this case, as we made clear at the time, we took immediate measures to evaluate and mitigate the activity,’ Stroh stated. ‘As has been our position, we are not going to comment on the referenced article's attribution to specific actors.’ White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said in an appearance on CNN Tuesday that the White House in 2014 disclosed cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information. ‘We have an unclassified system and then we have a classified system, a top secret system,’ Rhodes said. ‘We do not believe that our classified systems were compromised.’ But he said, ‘There's always vulnerability.’ For that reason, Rhodes said the White House operates a separate, secure system for classified data. He assured the public that the White House takes regular actions to prevent intrusions on its unclassified network.","Hackers reportedly wormed their way into the White House system by breaching the State Department's network first .

"He's the latest person to travel to a galaxy far, far away. And on Sunday director Gareth Edwards took to the stage  to reveal a few details about Rogue One, the first of the standalone Star Wars films, at the Stars Wars Celebration in Anaheim, California. At the same time, the iconic franchise's Twitter account posted a capsule of the storyline, saying: 'A band of resistance fighters unite for a daring mission to steal the Death Star plans in Star Wars anthology film, Rogue One #RogueOne.' Scroll down for video ... First look: Director Gareth Edwards revealed a glimpse of the first Star Wars spin-off Rogue One at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California, on Sunday . Special: Fans at a Star Wars convention in California were treated to one last surprise before the event closed . Sneak peek: A preview from a Star Wars anthology film, Rogue One was screene . Expanding the universe far, far, away: In Rogue One 'a band of resistance fighters unite for a daring mission to steal the Death Star plans' 18 months away: The film has not yet begun shooting so it's not clear if these scenes will be in the final movie . One attendee managed to capture the preview of Rogue One on their cellphone before uploading it YouTube . Following the release of the trailer to Star Wars VII, Disney's share price rocketed with more than $US2 billion added to the company's value. Star Wars has attracted generations of loyal fans ever since the first film arrived nearly 40 years ago, creating a signature moment in the history of popular culture and launching one of the biggest movie franchises ever. After a second trilogy of prequel films wrapped in 2005, the movie franchise had lain dormant until Disney shelled out $US4 billion To buy creator Lucas’s Lucasfilm in October 2012. Disney soon announced plans for three new films in the series, with acclaimed Hollywood director J.J. Abrams being entrusted with the reboot. The Force isn’t just returning to the big screen, it's also reappearing in video games too. Star Wars Battlefront which was first teased at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2013, marks the first title in a 10-year deal between the Walt Disney Co. and Electronic Arts Inc. to create new games. 'For more than 1,000 generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times. Before the Empire,' the voiceover reads, as the camera tracks to show a ghostly Death Star hovering in the clouds. Set between the third and the fourth movies in the 'Star Wars' saga, the film will follow a band of resistance fighters who unite to steal the Death Star plans and 'bring a new hope,' referring to the subtitle of the original 'Star Wars.' Gareth Edwards who directed Godzilla debuted a tantalizing concept reel to preview the mysterious film, which is part of a series of films exploring other stories outside of the core 'Star Wars' saga. Gareth is due to start work on the spin-off, starring Felicity Jones as a Rebel fighter, this summer for a December 2016 release. Aside from the storyline, he also unveiled art and a brief sizzle reel for an audience of excited fans at the fourth and final day of the event at the Anaheim Convention Centre.. Gareth was joined onstage by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and head of development Kiri Hart who explained: 'We really wanted freedom to do some films that could stand on their own, and tell new stories.' She added that they are describing them as 'anthology films' that expand the Star Wars universe without necessarily using the main characters. Joing the Star Wars characters: Gareth, pictured at the Godzilla premiere in Beijing last June, will start work on Rogue One this summer for a December 2016 release . More to come: The Star Wars website released this Twitter describing the storyline for the film, which is described as an anthology movie adding to the Star Wars universe . Glamour girl: Felicity Jones, pictured at the Oscars in February, will star in Rogue One . According to Gareth, Rogue One is set after Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith and before the original Star Wars, which became Episode IV when George Lucas created the three prequels. Gareth said Rogue One won't have clear-cut villains and heroes, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And the crowd laughed when he joked about the content, saying: 'It's called Star WARS,' putting heavy emphasis on the last word. 'It’s about the fact that god’s not coming to save us, and we’re on our own. The absence of the Jedi is omnipresent in the film. It hangs over the whole movie,' he added. Felicity Jones, who recently garnered an Oscar nomination for her role in 'The Theory of Everything' is the only confirmed cast member for the film, which will shoot in London this summer for a December 2016 release. Edwards said that her character will not just be a stoic soldier, but a complex, fully rounded human. 'We wanted to see fear, warmth, all of those aspects that everybody has,' he said, excited that Jones embodies 'the complete package.' In the world of 'Rogue One,' Edwards said the 'absence of Jedi is omnipresent.' Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy appears on the Cantina set at Star Wars Celebration: The Ultimate Fan Experience held in Anaheim last week . The characters in the film realize that the 'gods are not coming to save us,' he said. 'It comes down to a group of people who don't have magical powers who band together to bring hope to the galaxy.' 'Cinderella' scribe Chis Weitz wrote the screenplay based on an idea from visual effects supervisor John Knoll. Josh Trank, who is set to direct the next, still untitled 'Star Wars' anthology film, did not attend the event although he was originally scheduled to appear. The idea for the film came from award-winning visual effects artist John Knoll, who pitched the idea internally before bringing it to Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm's Kiri Hart. Hart, vice president of development for Lucasfilm, said that the anthology films will vary in 'scale and genre.' She added that they are describing them as 'anthology films' that expand the Star Wars universe without necessarily using the main characters. 'We wanted freedom to do some films that would be able to stand on their own and tell unique stories,' she said. 'They can still feel like `Star Wars' and be `Star Wars.' Meanwhile, it was revealed that the trailer for Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, which debuted at the event on Thursday, was viewed 88 million times worldwide in the first 24 hours. Directed by JJ Abrams, the movie opens in the US on December 18.","Rogue One will be a prequel to the original trilogy .

"If you ever wanted to push the boat out (literally) and stay at one of the most unusual hotels on the ocean, look no further than No Man's Land Fort, a Victorian sea fort in the middle of the Solent, which is set to open this month. The spectacular isolated fort, one of three guarding the entrance to the Solent, just off the coast of the Isle of Wight, has been turned into a luxury impregnable haven complete with a rooftop hot tub, shops and even its own nightclub, thanks to a multi-million pound revamp. The unique hotel looks like could be a fortress of a James Bond villain and can sleep 44 guests with a capacity of 200 for parties and events. Scroll down for video . For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck for ocean views . The No Man's Fort has been transformed by AmaZing Venues to become a luxury hotel, and is set to open on April 23 . With four floors packed with a variety of entertaining facilities, it’s a unique location that’s sure to leave guests with unforgettable memories . The sea fort is located 2km out at sea, meaning guests have to make an exciting entrance by helicopter or by boat. On arrival at the ocean hotspot, guests can hit up the shops, restaurants, luxury spa, rooftop bar and firepit, cabaret bar, nightclub or LaZer Battle Arena. If water sports are more your style this is the perfect base for enjoying RIB rides, jet biking, sea kayaking, or kite surfing. A spokesman for AmaZing Venues said: 'No Man's Fort is an inspiring private island that offers an unrivalled experience. 'It is three times the size of Spitbank Fort and boasts its own lighthouse with spectacular views across the Solent. 'You'd think being a mile offshore is unique enough, but we've crammed every possible space with unusual things to see and experience. Built between 1867 and 1880, No Man's Fort was one of several forts ordered by then-Prime Minister Lord Palmerston to fend off the French Navy. It needed a huge engineering effort to cut vast blocks of granite and transport them by barge to the building site, before they were lowered onto the sea bed for its foundations. At the time it cost £462,500 to build, which with inflation would be equivalent to more than £43million today. It was the first fort in England, and possibly Europe, to use hydraulic power to move the guns in horizontal and vertical planes for targeting and the first to be lighted throughout with electricity. The fort was in active use by the military up to 1957 - housing anti-aircraft guns during the Second World War - and became a scheduled ancient monument in 1967. A developer bought it in 1987 to convert it into a luxury residence but failed to find a millionaire buyer. Birmingham businessman Harmesh Pooni bought it to run as as a corporate hospitality venue but he ran into financial difficulties and had to close down. He eventually barricaded himself inside until he was removed. The fort eventually sold in 2009 for just £910,000. 'The potential of this magnificent sea fortress is only restrained by your imagination. 'A trip to the fort can be as relaxing or action-packed as you wish. 'For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck.' Described on the website as '75,000 sq ft of fun,' adventurers can unwind overlooking the spectacular rooftop views, whilst enjoying a BBQ, before retiring to one of the 23 luxury suites which cost £450 per night. Those who have the means to splash out on the best suite in the fort, the plush lighthouse facilities can cost £1,150 a night during the summer. Bond villain haven! The modern fort has two helipad zones, as well as offering roof top BBQ facilities for an ocean-facing meal . Do not disturb! The fort boasts 23 luxury suites and can sleep 44 guests, with prices ranging from £450 per night . A room with a view! Not only does this hotel offer one of the most private hotel stays, but also incredible ocean views . The unusual destination boasts a colourful history and was even featured in the 1971 Dr Who episode, The Sea Devils, with Jon Pertwee. Built between 1867 and 1880, it was originally used to defend the coast against French invasion, and was used during both world wars to protect Portsmouth Harbour from attacks. In order to construct the impressive fort, huge blocks of granite were transported by barge to the site, and were lowered onto the seabed for its foundations. Luxury loo! The hotel has been renovated with many modern activities and facilities for guests to have a comfortable and memorable stay . Views above the atrium roof are spectacular, and guests can enjoy a meal on the roof overlooking the beautiful coast off the Isle of Wight . The thick 60ft-high concrete walls mean guests can rest easy knowing the fort can withstand any ocean waves crashing again its sides. While it would have cost about £462,500 to build when it was first created, inflation would equate to that figure being closer to £43million today. AmaZing Venues forked out £3million in first transforming sister venue, Spitbank Fort, which opened in 2012, with this venture being three times as big.

"The yoga being taught in a San Diego County school system is not a gateway to Hinduism and doesn't violate the religious rights of students or their parents, a California appeals court ruled Friday. The 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego upheld a lower court ruling that tossed out a family's lawsuit trying to block the Encinitas Union School District from teaching yoga as an alternative to traditional gym classes. The lawsuit brought by Stephen and Jennifer Sedlock and their two children claimed the school district's yoga classes promoted Hinduism and inhibited Christianity. Scroll down for video . Students hold their positions during a yoga class at Capri Elementary School in Encinitas, California, in 2012 . A California appeals court ruled yoga classes taught at Capri do not violate students' right to religious freedom . The court upheld the previous ruling in a 3-0 opinion. The district court wrote: 'While the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, yoga classes as taught in the district are, as the trial court determined, ""devoid of any religious, mystical, or spiritual trappings."" 'We conclude that the program is secular in purpose, does not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion and does not excessively entangle the school district in religion. 'The district's yoga program does not violate our state constitution.' The First Amendment bans school-sponsored religious promotion and prayer. Yoga instructor Kristen McCloskey (right) leads third graders at Olivenhain Pioneer Elementary School in 2012 . The Sedlocks were disappointed with the ruling and are considering their options. Attorney Dean Broyles said: 'No other court in the past 50 years has allowed public school officials to lead children in formal religious rituals like the Hindu liturgy of praying to, bowing to, and worshipping the sun god.' A school distort lawyer said there were no rituals occurring in the classroom and no one was worshipping the sun or leading Hindu rites. The district said the practice is taught in a secular way to promote strength, flexibility and balance. Yoga is now taught at schools across the country, but the district is believed to be the first with full-time yoga teachers at all schools. A three-year grant from the K.P. Jois Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes Ashtanga yoga, provides twice-weekly, 30-minute classes to the district's 5,600 students. About 30 families have opted out of the classes since they began in 2011.","Lawsuit tried to block Encinitas Union School District from teaching yoga .

"Killed: Police are investigating the alleged murder of Syrian-born imam Abdul Hadi Arwani . A fourth person has been arrested over the alleged murder of a Syrian imam who was shot dead in his car on a London street. Police announced today that they had arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Abdul Hadi Arwani, who was killed in Wembley two weeks ago. A Jamaican businessman has already appeared in court charged with Mr Arwani's murder, while a man and a woman were arrested this week on suspicion of terror offences. The father of six, who was an imam at a controversial mosque in west London, was found dead in his black Volkswagen Passat on April 7. Leslie Cooper, 36, appeared at the Old Bailey on Thursday, where the court was told that Mr Arwani, 48, was lured to a meeting with a potential customer for his construction business before being killed. Burnell Mitchell, 61, the brother of Boney M's lead singer, was arrested this week on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. A 53-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. They are both in Metropolitan Police custody while counter-terror officers continue to investigate Mr Arwani's killing. Police said in a statement today that they had arrested the fourth suspect, a 35-year-old man, on Friday, before releasing him on bail today. Suspects: Leslie Cooper, left, appeared in court charged with murder while Burnell Mitchell, right, has been arrested on suspicion of terror offences . Mr Arwani was previously a preacher at the An-Noor mosque in Acton but resigned after he apparently fell out with other community leaders. The mosque was founded by Mr Mitchell 20 years ago after he converted to Islam, and he remains a trustee of the centre as well as a director of the company which owns its premises. Mr Mitchell, whose sister Liz Mitchell was the lead singer of Boney M, was brought up a strict Christian before changing faith and becoming known as 'Khalid Rashad'. Both his home and the mosque were searched by police last week as part of the investigation into Mr Arwani's death. Mosque: Police standing outside the An-Noor cultural centre in Acton earlier this week . The Syrian-born imam fled his home country in the 1980s and became an outspoken opponent of president Bashar al-Assad's regime before his killing. Mr Arwani's son Murhaf said last week: 'He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. 'He did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. 'He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it. He was an advocate of peace for all and he showed us this in the way he lived his life from day to day.'

"Sisters Sophie Morgan , 21, and Sheree, 25, (both pictured outside Burnley Crown Court) allowed their bank accounts to be used to accept stolen money . Two sisters who allowed their bank accounts to be used in a 'vile' plot to con an elderly couple out of their £36,000 life savings have avoided jail. Sheree Morgan, 25,  and younger sister Sophie, 21, both of Nelson, Lancashire, agreed to let their bank accounts be used to accept thousands of pounds in stolen money after the victims were conned out of over £36,000 over the telephone by a fraudster posing as a policeman. The couple, a man aged 86, and his 84-year old wife from Cardiff in South Wales, were contacted by a man pretending to be a Metropolitan Police detective sergeant falsely claiming they were about to fall victim to an Eastern European crime gang who had got hold of their bank account details. He urged the elderly couple they needed to transfer their money into various accounts 'for their own security.' The caller even pretended he knew of a list of previous transactions the elderly couple had made, initially rattling off eight incorrect withdrawals before correctly guessing a £50 shopping bill at Asda. Consequently the couple were persuaded to go to their local Leeds Building Society and make transfers from their account and makes others from their HSBC savings totalling £36,140 to other accounts. The cash was immediately withdrawn after the transfers and were used pay for travellers cheques and Euros at travel agents. The elderly couple tried to get their money back when they realised they had been duped but their plea was refused after the banks said staff had acted 'without negligence and acted upon instruction.' Sheree claimed she was approached by a friend from school who asked her if she wanted to make some money. But  the actual conman who made the calls and pretended to be a police officer has never been traced. The couple later told police the fraudster who claimed to be 'Detective Sgt McDonald from Holborn Police' was 'extremely well spoken' and 'sounded as though he knew what he was talking about.' Sophie Morgan (pictured left) and her sister Sheree (right) with her ex-boyfriend Daniel Webster . Officers who investigated the scam discovered the Morgan sisters allowed £17,500 to be put into their bank accounts after the con. Sheree also recruited ex-boyfriend Daniel Webster, 23, and her mother Justine Davies, 44, to use their accounts for the illicit transfers. At Burnley Crown Court, all admitted money laundering but escaped jail after insisting they did not know who was to be conned. The fraud occurred in January 2014 when the fraudster rang the pensioners from an unregistered mobile phone - later cell sited in London. Sheree Morgan (pictured left) with her ex-boyfriend Daniel Webster (right) - both have avoided jail . Prosecutor Mr Stephen Parker said the unknown conman - who has never been traced - gave the account details of the Morgan sisters, their two accomplices and also another man living in Leeds. The elderly couple were advised to go into their local bank branch and transfer their funds into the accounts - but if queried were to tell staff that it was for 'home improvements' after being made to believe that the fraud was to do with an insider at the bank. Mr Parker said: 'For their own security they were to transfer the monies to various secure accounts, details of which he would give them. Any doubts or queries were alleviated by his persuasive nature by the man on the telephone. Justine Davies, the mother of Sheree and Sophie - she has been handed a one year community order . 'She described him as extremely well spoken and seemed to know what he was talking about. He asked about seven or eight transactions and one was eventually confirmed by the lady but it was a lucky guess. 'He told them if asked by members of staff at the bank where the monies were going that they effectively lie and say it was for home improvements, because it was believed the person was within the bank was involved in the gang who were operating the fraud. If queried they were to say it was for a new kitchen or bathroom. 'The couple will not be compensated by the banks. The bank said the bank staff acted without negligence and acted on instruction, they asked what the money was for. They have no intention of refunding that amount of money.' Mother of two Sheree received £5,000 in her account on January 17 2014 and withdrew the money straight away. Plasterer Webster had £10,250 put into his account which he withdrew and also spent on travellers cheques . Four days later on January 21 she received £7,700 and was to withdraw £5,000 the following day before buying £2,500 worth of traveller's cheques from the Co-Op travel agents on her card linked to the account. She  claimed she had been approached by former classmate from school who had asked if she had wanted to make money. She was told that all she needed to do was allow money to go through her bank in order to avoid paying tax and she would receive £700. She later introduced her sister to the friend and a few days later £4,800 was transferred into Sophie's account. The following day Sophie withdrew £3,000 of cash and spent £1,490 on travellers cheques and was paid £200 for allowing the transfer. Plasterer Webster had £10,250 put into his account which he withdrew and also spent on travellers cheques. Sisters Sophie (left) and Sheree Morgan (right) have avoided jail despite pleading guilty to money laundering . He said he was aware of what his ex-girlfriend had done and it was agreed he would be paid approximately £1,000. He spent his payout on clothes, shopping and items for the house. Davies was told a debt of £500 would be cleared if she allowed the transfers of £8,390. In mitigation Kevin Donnelly said Sheree - who is due to start a sociology and criminology course at Burnley College - had been 'unaware of the unpleasant and cynical targeting of the elderly couple'. She knew she was committing a dishonest act but when she found out the pensioners had lost their savings she was 'genuinely distressed and shocked'. For Sophie, Simon Gurney said: 'She dealt with the smallest sum of money, £4,800 in a single transaction put into her account. Accomplice university student Mohammad Aadil, 21, (pictured) of Leeds admitted money laundering and was sentenced to a one year community order . 'When she learned of the true nature of her offending she was horrified. She has expressed great shame.' Sheree was sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for two years and must complete 200 hours unpaid work. Sophie was sentenced to a one year community order and one year supervision with 120 hours unpaid work. Webster, of Nelson, was given a four month sentence, suspended for two years whilst Davies got a one year community order. Both were also ordered to complete 150 hours unpaid work. Another accomplice, university student Mohammad Aadil, 21, of Leeds, admitted money laundering and was sentenced to a community order for one year and 150 hours unpaid work. Judge Andrew Woolman said: 'The couple were clearly elderly and confused and found this fraudster persuasive and on the direction of the fraudster had large sums of money transferred - not into his account but he used you in order, no doubt, to ensure there was no evidence against him, having committed this offence. 'Your offending is vile and were there any suspicion that any of you knew what was going on or even suspected what was going on and the source of the money, you would go immediately to prison. 'Quite clearly none of you suspected the true source of money although all suspected it was criminal money in one way or another.' After the case the pensioners said: 'As far as we are concerned it's over and done with. It was a bad time and we want to forget it.'","Sheree Morgan, 25, and sister Sophie, allowed their bank accounts to be used to accept thousands of pounds stolen from elderly couple .

"A two-year-old girl who was born with abnormal facial development is now smiling, laughing and dancing again six months after a major surgery, aided by 3D printing, helped reshape her face. Violet Pietrok, who lives in Portland, Oregon, was born with frontonasal dysplasia, a malformation of the face and head that is developed in the womb. It is so rare only 100 cases have been reported. The condition caused a widening of Violet's facial features, specifically with her nose, which had no cartilage, and the space between her eyes. She also had a large central cleft in her face and a growth over her left eye. Two-year-old Violet Pietrok, from Portland, Oregon, is now smiling, laughing and dancing again six months after a major surgery, aided by 3D printing, helped reshape her face . Violet was born with frontonasal dysplasia, a congenital malformation that widened her facial features, specifically her nose and the space between her eyes . Violet's eyes were originally so far apart her vision was like that of a bird of prey's, her mother told the New York Times. Plastic surgeon-in-chief Dr. John Meara of Boston Children's Hospital spent months preparing for Violet's surgery, specifically with molds of her skull that were made using a 3D printer. Meara made about five different models from the time of Violet's first birthday to leading up to her October 2014 operation. He said he used them both to see how Violet was growing and developing, and to practice the cuts and incisions he knew he was going to have to make before he even stepped into an operating room. 'This isn't like free throw practice,' he told the Statesman Journal. 'You can't just go out and try and if you miss, try again. The molds allowed Meara and the other surgeons to see what possible problems could arise with certain methods. They also gave the doctors a fuller picture of what they were working with - one that was even better than what they'd be able to see during the operation. Meara used the molds during the almost seven-hour surgery, and referenced them when the doctors tried to find solutions for a complication, according to ABC News. Violet's new face allows her to be just as expressive as any of the other children her age . Violet's mother Alicia Taylor said that it took a 'little while' for Violet to get back to normal as she spent six weeks recovering from the operation in the hospital and adjusting to her new vision perception. 'It's all about perspective, cause it gets hard,' she said in a Boston Children's Hospital video. 'You just kind of have to see the finish line and keep and eye on where you're going and why you're doing this.' Plastic surgeon Dr. John Meara of Boston Children's Hospital spent months preparing for Violet's surgery with molds of her skull that were made using a 3D printer . There were physical complications, one which sent Violet back to the operating room, as well. It took more than three months for her scar, which threatened to unzip, to heal. But her stitches were finally removed at the end of February, just in time for Violet's second birthday. And she has been smiling the whole way through. Taylor said the only time her daughter, who she said is 'taking it all in stride', isn't smiling now is if she's sleeping or throwing a typical toddler fit. Even with the surgery, Taylor said Violet 'doesn't see herself as different'. The only thing that bothered her about her stitches was that she couldn't wear ribbons in her hair. But Taylor admits that as much as the family loves Violet's new face, they do find themselves missing her old face as well. 'I was so worried that they were going to take her and she was going to be unrecognizable,' she told ABC News. 'I miss that little face because you love it.' But Taylor said the surgery, and the cosmetic touch-ups that will occur once Violet reaches kindergarten, will be worth it in the long-run. 'This will make a huge impact with her quality of life and the way people perceive her,' she said. As for now, Taylor hopes that by sharing Violet's story she can help people become more aware of the condition - and hopefully change the way they react to it as well. Even with the surgery, Taylor said Violet 'doesn't see herself as different'.

"Michael Buckley, 60, from Forest Hill, south east London, died after being hit by a shopping trolley as he bought festive groceries at Marks & Spencer . A shopper caused the death of a frail widower by 'deliberately ramming' him with her trolley, a court heard yesterday. Melanie Buck is said to have become frustrated because the food aisles in Marks & Spencer were gridlocked by Christmas shoppers. When she could not get past 60-year-old Michael Buckley she exchanged heated words with him before knocking him over with her trolley, it was alleged. Mr Buckley – who suffered from diabetes and weighed only 8st – fell to the floor in the M&S aisle and broke his thighbone and wrist. When a shop assistant rushed to help him, he allegedly told her: 'She rammed me.' The following day, an operation under general anaesthetic to repair 5ft 5in Mr Buckley's injuries appeared to go well. But on Christmas Day his condition worsened after he suffered what doctors believe was a heart attack. He was taken into intensive care and put on a life- support machine. Two months later, the decision was taken to turn off the machine and he was pronounced dead. Prosecuting at Croydon Crown Court yesterday, David Howker QC said Miss Buck, 33, was out shopping with her mother on December 22, 2012. She arrived at the store in The Glades shopping centre, in Bromley, south-east London, at about 1pm. Mr Buckley, who wore a hearing aid and was described as 'frail', arrived after her and the pair bumped into each other in a food aisle. Mr Howker said: 'It appears there was something of a gridlock in the aisle and the defendant could not get past him. 'There may have been a clash between his basket and her trolley and a few words exchanged. 'But the upshot was that Miss Buck, perhaps out of a sense of frustration, deliberately rammed Mr Buckley with her trolley and the result was to knock him to the floor.' He added: 'Miss Buck assaulted Mr Buckley causing him to fall to the floor and injure himself and cause the chain of events that led to his death. She is responsible for that death.' As she made her way out of the store, the defendant was followed by a shop worker who told her she could not leave, the court heard. Melanie Serita Buck, 33, from Bromley (pictured outside Croydon Crown Court) is accused of killing the frail widower during the alleged trolley rage incident . Buck (left) has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter as well as an alternative charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm . Miss Buck, of Bromley, told her it was an accident, but the assistant 'disagreed' and said she would call security if Miss Buck tried to leave. The court heard Mr Buckley lived alone in Forest Hill, south-east London, following the death of his wife in 2010. Following his death, Miss Buck was charged with manslaughter and an alternative charge of grievous bodily harm. She denies both charges. When interviewed by police, she said she accidentally bumped into Mr Buckley's basket as the shop was so busy, and claimed he deliberately hit her trolley with the basket as she apologised. She told officers she accidentally knocked him down as she tried to get past him with her trolley. In court, Mr Howker admitted Mr Buckley's health was poor. 'Miss Buck would not have known that when she rammed him,' he added. 'However, her knowledge of Mr Buckley's condition is irrelevant really. If you assault someone who is not as robust as the next man or who has a particular susceptibility to injury or death then that is your lookout really. 'You take your victim as you find him … it will be no defence to say that the ordinary healthy man would not have died in similar circumstances.' The trial continues. The court heard how the  incident unfolded at the store (pictured) on December 22, 2012, when the store was 'gridlocked' with festive shoppers . Mr Buckley broke his wrist and thigh bones after crashing to the floor in the aisle (pictured).

"Jemma Peacock (pictured on her wedding day) says the NHS is denying her two daughters (pictured) their mother by refusing to fund a life-saving drug . A terminally-ill cancer sufferer has accused the NHS of denying her two daughters their mother by refusing to fund a potentially life-extending drug. Jemma Peacock, 31, suffers from a rare form of stomach cancer and is currently taking three drugs to try to prolong her life. The third and most effective drug - regorafenib - costs the NHS around £1,000 a week to provide and has been removed from the health service's approved list of treatments. Mrs Peacock, who lives with her husband Tony and daughters Kacie, six, and Willow, four, in Storrington, West Sussex, has wild-type gastrointestinal cancer, which causes tumours to grow in the stomach and intestines. The mother-of-two, who is yet to tell her young children about her condition, says she cannot afford to buy regorafenib privately and has called on NHS England to reverse their decision. She said: 'The final drug is the most effective and it is heart breaking they have removed it from the treatment list. 'The cancer that I have is extremely rare and the research into it is limited so it angers me that they are removing a drug that has been proven to work. 'I am lucky that I have managed to spend 14 months on the first drug, Imatinib, in the series but I know that it will soon have no effect on my body. 'The second drug, Sutan, is not very effective and I know that when I have to be put on it I will have minimal time left. 'You can buy regorafenib privately but that costs £3,700 a month and I don't have that kind of money. 'Family members have offered to sell their houses and belongings to pay for my treatment but I can't accept that. 'I cannot ask my family to put their lives on hold when I might only get another year of life.' Mrs Peacock (pictured with daughters Kacie, left, and Willow, right), who has a rare form of stomach cancer, has been refused a drug which could help her battle the disease . The mother-of-two, who set up a 100,000-strong petition for the drug regorafenib to be funded, has not told her daughters that she has cancer . Mrs Peackock, who lives in Storrington, West Sussex, with her daughters and husband Tony, has wild-type gastrointestinal cancer, which causes tumours to grow in the stomach and intestines . After NHS England removed the drug from their list of treatments in January this year, Mrs Peacock launched a petition calling on the NHS to reinstate it. More than 100,000 people have signed it, meaning MPs will have to discuss the issue in Parliament when they return to the Commons after the election - but by then Mrs Peacock's cancer may have progressed. Despite thousands joining her cause, Mrs Peacock is yet to tell her daughters that she has cancer. 'I do not want to scare them with what I am going through,' she said. 'We had to watch my dad die of lung cancer just 18 months ago and the girls found that really tough as they were very close to him. 'If I told them I had cancer it would scare them and no parent wants to scare their child. I do spoil them more then what other parents would but who can blame me. 'I want them to have as many happy memories with us as a family as possible before I get too ill and I can no longer enjoy the time I have. 'I think about the conversation I will have to have with them in the future and it heart wrenching that I will have to tell my daughters I will soon not be here anymore. 'But I know that I have to push that conversation to the back of mind and enjoy the time I have left with my family.' The NHS currently spends in the region of £1.3billion on cancer drugs a year, and receives a further £200million annual boost from the Cancer Drugs Fund - which helps to fund treatments for rare forms of the disease. NHS England then decides what drugs this money goes towards, with a ruling in January removing regorafenib from the fund's list because the treatment's effectiveness did not represent 'sufficient value for retention'. The report found that, on average, it cost £4,493 to provide a four-week cycle of regorafenib to a patient, with the average recipient needing the drug for 23 weeks. NHS England declined to comment.","Mother-of-two Jemma Peacock, 31, has a rare form of stomach cancer .

"Pet cats are being snatched off the streets and killed in their ten of thousands across Asia - to feed the booming appetite for their meat in Vietnam. Restaurants serving domestic cats – sold as a delicacy known as 'baby tiger' – are springing up across northern Vietnam, despite laws against eating the animals. And at one restaurant – an hour's drive from the capital Hanoi – the owner told MailOnline demand is so high he'd slaughtered 31 cats already that day just to keep up. Scroll down for video . Caught, skinned and boned: A wheelbarrow load of cats  arrives at popular restaurant near Hanoi, Vietnam . Although eating cat meat is illegal, police officers and lawyers are among Vietnam's biggest customers. Animal welfare groups blasted the illegal trade – and claim the animals are transported in appalling conditions across large distances before being skinned alive, the bones removed and eaten. The meat is so popular domestic cats are being stolen to order from the street and homes across Vietnam and smuggled across the border in tightly-packed trucks from neighbouring China and Laos. A cat knapper is paid anything between £37 to £52 by a restaurateur per animal, depending on its size. In January a lorry with three tonnes of cats crammed into bamboo cages stacked one on top of another was seized by police on its way to Hanoi from China. Some of the animals perished in searing heat during the journey – and the rest were crushed to death after they were rescued amid fears they might spread disease. The truck driver was fined just £250 (7.5 million Dong) for smuggling them. And a MailOnline probe has found pet cats destined for the dinner table are being held in horrific conditions as they await slaughter. In Va Town, Bac Ninh province, an hour's drive from Hanoi, is the popular Quy Beo restaurant where 'baby tiger' is served daily. The restaurant's most popular dishes are cat meat hot pot, on sale for around £40 pounds and feeds seven – a huge sum in rural Vietnam. Cat meat noodles are £3 pounds a bowl. Ready for dinner plate: Caged cats caught and smuggled across the border to Vietnam will be killed for their meat, which is an expensive 'delicacy' in Asia . Key ingredient: 'Baby tiger' is prepared in the kitchen at the Quy Beo restaurant - to will be served up with noodles and sold for £3 a bowl . Demand: 'Everybody wants to eat cat now – it is more delicious and exotic than other kinds of meat,' the owner boasted. Cat meat was banned in Vietnam in 1997 . Lucrative: Dog meat traders tells how she's also selling cats and business is booming . The owner – who wouldn't be named – led our investigators over the road to his home opposite the restaurant and showed where he keeps hundreds of terrified cats, hissing and pounding their paws against the bars of tiny cages piled on top of each other. The animals are then taken out and slaughtered just feet from their cages. They are allowed to bleed and dropped into boiling water, then skinned in a machine before being boned and taken across the road by wheelbarrow to serve up in the restaurant. Their bones are swept up into a pile in the forecourt of the owner's home after the cats are killed and later used to make broth. 'Everybody wants to eat cat now – it is more delicious and exotic than other kinds of meat,' the owner told us. 'I've killed 31 cats today already. We've never been busier. Some people are superstitious and eat it to bring them strength and good fortune. 'Lawyers, policemen and company directors eat it at the start of the lunar month. Factory workers eat it at the beginning of the month. Rich people eat it all month long.' As he spoke, staff from a nearby Samsung mobile phone factory poured into the restaurant and began ordering dishes after a company bus taking them straight from work pulled up outside. 'It's the best meat there is,' one factory official told us, his face flushed red with rice wine. 'Cats are particular about what they eat so the meat is cleaner and better for you inside.' In a smaller restaurant nearby, owner Nguyen The Tai said the popularity of cat meat had boomed since he opened his restaurant seven years ago. He told MailOnline: 'It's getting more popular because people have more money. On a good night, we kill five or six cats for our customers. 'The best cats are aged two and a half years old and weigh 2.5 kg. We buy live cats for £3.50 a kilo and sell the meat for about £7 a kilo.' Ngo Cong Thi opened a cat restaurant with his wife a mile from the centre of Hanoi eight months ago and said he had been busy from the first night. 'People come from all over to eat here,' he said. 'One evening, we even had three Australian customers in. They tried the cat hot pot and they said it was delicious. Brazen: Despite being banned cat meat is freely advertised at the Quy Beo restaurant in Va Town - an hour's drive from the capital Hanoi . Banned: Police officers and lawyers are some of the restaurant's biggest customers . 'More and more people are eating cat, especially policemen, people high up in the army and the directors of big companies. Cat hot pot and stir fried cat are our most popular dishes.' Ngo kept a cage full of cats ready to eat on a baking hot riverbank slope opposite his restaurant, covered with pieces of carpet and bedding to keep the sun off them. Many of the cats served up in Hanoi were smuggled from Laos or China through Thai Binh province where they are traded and then taken by lorry to Hanoi, he said. 'They can move up to 100 tonnes of cats a month from Thai Binh to Hanoi,' he said. 'It's very big business.' Former Prime Minister Phan Van Khai banned cat restaurants in 1997 when a plague of rats was threatening crops across the country. But the ban has been ignored since the plague was brought under control - allowing cat restaurants to flourish without any legal penalties. Le Duc Chinh, Vietnam coordinator of the Asia Canine Protection Alliance (ACPA) which campaigns against the eating of both cats and dogs, said: 'Sadly, the people who should be enforcing the law are eating in cat restaurants. 'People will stop eating cat meat when they stop eating dog meat. The suffering these intelligent animals go through is the same. 'The problem is people in Vietnam have money and they want to try something new. And the army officers and police officers eating it set a bad example. They are educated people and they should stop. 'Cats are being illegally smuggled in terrible conditions across borders and from one country to another to supply this industry. And because cats are small, many more of them have to suffer and die to meet demand.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A Utah father's 'awesome fun zone' for his children will be forced down by city officials who didn't appreciate his out-of-the-box thinking and called the cardboard castle in his front yard 'junk'. Jeremy Trentelman, 36, of Ogden, last week built a giant box fort for his three-year-old son Max and two-year-old daughter Story, that included trap doors and a small slide. The father, who works as a florist arranging intricate displays, was greeted with a letter from code enforcement city officials one day later saying that his creation must be scrapped. Scroll down for video . City code enforcement officials in Ogden, Utah, have told resident Jeremy Trentelman to take down the elaborate box fort he built for his son and daughter in his front yard . The family said it will leave the box fort, which includes a slide and trampoline, up for 14 days, the maximum allowed before a fine . Trentelman was only planning on leaving the fort in his yard for a few days, but now has decided to leave it up for the maximum two weeks before he receives a $125 fine. 'We've had so much fun with it that I really don't want to turn it into something's that's just stupid,' Mr Trentelman told KUTV, adding that he would not pay the $25 to contest the letter. 'So we'll enjoy it and take it down when we need to'. The city's letter said that  'waste material or junk' such as tires or furniture in a front yard violates ordinance's 'designed to protect property values, citizens' rights, neighborhood aesthetics and public safety'. Fines could be taken as a lien against the family's house, Mr Trentelman said. Mr Trentelman built the castle last week, though he quickly received a letter saying that his creation was classified as 'waste material or junk' The father, who works as a florist creating intricate flower displays, says he will not contest the ordinance because he does not want to turn the castle into something negative . The Trentelman children Max, (left) 3, and Story, (right) 2, have enjoyed playing in the fort and drawing on its cardboard walls with chalk. The family says that none of their neighbors have complained about the fort. 'It’s great what they’re doing for their kids. I think they should add on to it,' Curtis Price, who lives across the street, said. Mr Trentelman said that code enforcement's Gordon Sant often drives through the neighborhood. He has invited his neighbors to join them in the cardboard playhouse, which includes a trampoline and walls covered with his children's chalk drawings. One Ogden resident has created a Facebook event asking homeowners to build their own cardboard castles and leave them up for 14 days in solidarity.","Jeremy Trentelman, 36, of Ogden, built fort for young son and daughter .

"Debt: Parents are getting into debt by letting their adult children live at home for longer . Grown-up children who are still in their family home are living the ‘life of Riley’ while unknowingly pushing their parents into debt, research shows. The so-called ‘boomerang generation’ are placing their parents under serious financial pressure by living at home even in their twenties and thirties. Now, debt organisations have warned that parents should not be afraid to ask their children for rent and money towards household bills amid fears the British ‘stiff upper lip’ makes them reluctant to admit when they need help. Experts claim grown-up children still living at home are often completely unaware that they are forcing their parents further into debt. Research revealed that as many as three-quarters of parents whose children are over 18 still have at least one child living with them. But only 42 per cent charge their children rent – with many admitting they feel too guilty and uncomfortable to ask. And even if they manage to ask their offspring to contribute, most charge them just £150 a month, compared with a typical UK rent of £750. On top of this, 80 per cent still buy their adult child’s groceries, and 60 per cent cook dinner for them each night, according to the study by website TopCashBack. Parents expressed concern that their children could not afford to move out or were struggling to save for a house deposit. But the survey found the average salary of a grown-up child living at home is £26,000, giving them a comfortable £1,000 in disposable income each month. Half of parents who did charge rent admitted they relied on that money to cover living expenses such as groceries and utility bills. Food for thought: Eight out of ten parents survey said they still bought their children's groceries for them . In fact, a second study released today revealed that many debt-ridden parents are falling into deeper financial trouble because of their stay-at-home children. According to debt management specialist PayPlan, a third of parents in debt who have grown-up children living at home have been forced to take out a loan to meet the costs of housing and feeding them. Young adults brought up on the internet are beset by loneliness because they make friends online rather than face to face, a survey reveals. It found many of the so-called Facebook generation of internet-obsessed people in their late teens, twenties and early thirties say they feel lonely. One in seven of those who find it hard to make friends are too scared to talk to strangers. Their fear of relationships appears linked to how they usually communicate – by text, Facebook and email. But unlike older generations they seem to have no time or inclination to talk to their neighbours. The survey of nearly 2,500 people by The Big Lunch community campaign undermines the idea that loneliness mostly affects the elderly. Dr Rebecca Harris of the University of Bolton, who worked on the poll, said: ‘Our brains treat loneliness the same as physical pain. We’re spending less time having social interaction, we have fewer friends than we’d like and we’re finding it harder to make new friends.’ But half of these parents say they still refuse to ask their kids to contribute to the household pot. Jane Clack, of PayPlan, said: ‘In this country we are renowned for a stiff upper lip, but the truth is that many parents are under emotional strain as a result of their debts.’","75% of parents with children over 18 have at least one still living with them .

"Underlining a change across the nation, nearly 90per cent of U.S. adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive survey released Monday. Researchers behind the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index say the number of uninsured Americans is now at a record low. When tracking began in 2008 roughly 14per cent of citizens were uninsured, peaking at 18per cent in the third quarter of 2013. But marking a shift in the trend, for the first three months of this year the rate dropped to 11.9per cent. Whether the new findings turn out to be a high-water mark for President Barack Obama's health care law, or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all U.S. residents covered, remains to be seen. Underlining a change across the nation, nearly nine in ten adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive survey released Monday . The law's future is still up in the air, and will turn on factors ranging from an upcoming Supreme Court decision on consumer subsidies to actions by Republican leaders in states opposed to Medicaid expansion. The latest update from the Gallup-Healthways survey overlaps with the period when the health law's second sign-up season was winding down. Coverage gains from 2014-2015 translate to about 3.6 million fewer adults uninsured since the fall, before open enrollment got under way, according to Gallup. 'The Affordable Care Act had three major objectives: increase coverage, slow the rate of increase in costs, and improve health,' said Dan Witters, research director for the poll. 'The first one is clearly a win. Coverage is increasing; there is no question about it.' On balance, an estimated 14.75 million adults have gained coverage since the fall of 2013, when the law's first open enrollment season was about to begin, according to Gallup. The uninsured rate lowest since Gallup and Healthways began tracking in 2008 . 'A big outstanding question is what will happen over the next couple of years,' said Larry Levitt, a health insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. 'To meet expectations, enrollment has to continue to grow and push the number of uninsured down.' The Gallup-Healthways survey is closely followed because it combines the depth of government-sponsored research with the timeliness of media polls. Pollsters interview 500 people a day, nearly every day of the year. One of the questions they ask is whether people have health insurance. The health care law offers subsidized private insurance for people who don't have access to job-based coverage, combined with an expansion of Medicaid aimed at low-income adults in states that accept it. Big states like Florida and Texas are among those refusing to expand Medicaid. The law requires nearly all Americans to have coverage, either through an employer, a government program, or by purchasing their own plan. Those remaining uninsured risk fines. It also provides subsidies to help low-to moderate-income people buy their own insurance. Comparing the most recent sign-up period with the first open enrollment season, the survey found that the uninsured rate declined at a slightly slower pace this time around. In the first three months of this year, the uninsured rate fell by one percentage point. Over the same period last year there was a 1.5 percentage-point decline. From government officials to local volunteers, many people involved with the health care law expected some kind of second-year slowdown. Open enrollment season was shorter, and those who had remained uninsured were seen as more skeptical about the value of coverage. The survey also found that Hispanics saw the biggest coverage gains of any ethnic or racial group. The uninsured rate dropped 8.3 points among Latinos since the end of 2013. Even so, Hispanics are still more likely to be uninsured. 'At a time when Republicans are very keenly trying to court the Hispanic vote, a large chunk of Hispanics are gaining insurance via the Affordable Care Act,' Witters said. President Barack Obama's health care law requires nearly all Americans to have coverage, either through an employer, a government program, or by purchasing their own plan - those remaining uninsured risk fines . The most notable improvement has been among those making less than $36,000 a year, a group that traditionally struggled to get and keep health insurance . Recent gains in coverage have benefited people up and down the income ladder. But the most notable improvement has been among those making less than $36,000 a year, a group that traditionally struggled to get and keep health insurance. Their uninsured rate dropped 8.7 points since the end of 2013. Although the economic recovery is likely to be contributing to coverage gains, the uninsured rate is now significantly lower than it was in early 2008, before the recession. That suggests that the gains in coverage are due to more than an improving economy. Five years after its passage, the biggest question now for Obama's health care law is a Supreme Court challenge. Opponents of the law argue that its literal language only allows the government to subsidize premiums in states that set up their own online insurance markets. Most have not done so, defaulting to the federal HealthCare.gov. Supporters say that while some provisions may be confusing when read in isolation, the intent of Congress was to help consumers in every state pay their premiums. A decision in that case is expected by late June. The survey results were based on landline and cellphone interviews conducted from January 2 to March 31 with a random sample of 43,575 adults ages 18 and older. For results based on the total sample, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point.","Researchers behind the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index say the number of uninsured Americans is now at a record low .

"Methane, the principle component in natural gas, is usually produced by organic material decomposing. But there is another form of the deadly gas, dubbed abiotic methane, that is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor. Now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane – a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor . The reservoirs are secure, and scientists don't believe they will impact climate change. Instead, they say similar formations could someday be used to store methane, that can later be used as fuel. One reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge, in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'This ultraslow spreading ridge shows that the Arctic environment is ideal for this type of methane production,' said Joel Johnson associate professor at the University of New Hampshire. The Center for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Climate and Environment (Cage) estimates that up to 15,000 gigatonnes of carbon may be stored in the form of hydrates in the ocean floor. Scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane – a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide. One such reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge (pictured), in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'But this estimate is not accounting for abiotic methane. So there is probably much more,' said Cage director Jürgen Mienert. Methane is the second-largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change. The gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming. Methane pollution has declined by 11 per cent since 1990 even as the governments has pushed for greater use of natural gas. But the longer view on methane pollution show that it will rise. The Obama administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, if no action is taken. However, methane is also the principle component in natural gas. It is a lucrative fuel source, which could contain more energy than all the world's oil, coal and gas put together. They believe the gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. 'Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor,' said Johnson. 'These only form in slow to ultraslow spreading seafloor crust. The optimal temperature range for serpentinisation of ocean crust is 200 – 350 degrees Celsius.' Methane produced by serpentinisation can escape through cracks and faults, and end up at the ocean floor, causing a concern for future global warming. But in the Knipovich Ridge it is trapped as gas hydrate in the sediments. 'In other known settings the abiotic methane escapes into the ocean, where it potentially influences ocean chemistry,' says Johnson. 'But if the pressure is high enough, and the subsea floor temperature is cold enough, the gas gets trapped in a hydrate structure below the sea floor.' Bünz says that there are many places in the Arctic Ocean with a similar tectonic setting as the Knipovich ridge. Rather than causing a concern, the study claims that active tectonic environments may serve as a stable area for long-term storage of methane carbon in deep-marine sediments. But other types of methane in the Arctic are causing a concern for scientists. Last year Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He tweeted: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane – which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. Samples of the gas hydrates will provide more knowledge on abiotic methane. But they need to be drilled, as they are 140 metres under the ocean floor .","Vast water hydrates in the Arctic are reservoirs for abiotic methane .

"Ed Miliband, pictured arriving in Manchester ahead of the manifesto launch, will today pledge to cut the deficit every year if Labour wins the election . Ed Miliband will today pledge to cut the deficit every year if Labour wins the election. In a last-ditch attempt to steal the Tories’ mantle as the party of economic responsibility, he will warn supporters that Labour faces coming to power in a ‘time of scarcity’. Launching the party’s manifesto in Manchester, Mr Miliband will claim ‘not one policy’ in it would be funded through additional government borrowing. He will insist a Labour government would ‘cut the deficit every year’ and have national debt falling ‘as soon as possible’, though he will not set a date. Labour’s manifesto, published last night, contains a commitment on its first page to a ‘Budget Responsibility Lock’. The party says this would be ‘the basis for all our plans because it is by securing our national finances that we are able to secure the family finances of the working people of Britain’. Mr Miliband infamously forgot to make any mention of the deficit in his party conference speech last year, and polls show Labour lags far behind the Conservatives in trust on managing the public finances. But Mr Miliband will today insist that Labour is ‘not only the party of change but the party of responsibility too’. He will accuse the Tories of ‘throwing spending promises around with no idea of where the money is coming from’. The Labour leader will pledge ‘strong, fair fiscal rules’ meaning the national debt falls and a surplus on the ‘current budget’ – applying to day-to-day spending, not capital spending – is secured ‘as soon as possible in the next parliament’. He will say: ‘The very start of our manifesto is different to previous elections. ‘It does not do what most manifestos do...It does something different: its very first page sets out a vow to protect our nation’s finances; a clear commitment that every policy in this manifesto is paid for without a single penny of extra borrowing. ‘The plan we lay before you is no less ambitious because we live in a time of scarcity. It is more ambitious because it starts from a clear commitment to balance the books.’ Policies in Labour’s manifesto include a £2.5billion NHS fund paid for from a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and closing a hedge fund tax avoidance loophole. The Labour leader, pictured in Leeds yesterday after launching the health manifesto, will insist a Labour government would ‘cut the deficit every year’ and have national debt falling ‘as soon as possible' Scrapping the ‘non-dom’ rule could set Labour on a collision course with the Governor of the Bank of England. Mark Carney features among a list of heavyweight figures in the City who could be forced to pay higher taxes if Labour wins power next month. The Canadian is one of 116,000 non-doms in Britain, meaning he has to pay tax on his UK earnings but not on income generated overseas. Mr Miliband wants to scrap the tax break, describing it as ‘indefensible’. A spokesman for the Bank defended the Governor’s status, saying: ‘This is not a choice. It’s a straight outcome of the tests that determine domicile status in the UK.’ He added that Mr Carney pays full UK tax on his £874,000 pay package. Others who would be affected by the crackdown include the foreign-born chiefs of RBS and Lloyds. It will also commit to 25 hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds, paid for by increasing the banking levy, and smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds, funded by scrapping the free schools programme. George Osborne said Labour’s plans would ‘bankrupt’ the country, and put the 300-year-old union with Scotland at risk if the party were propped up by the Scottish Nationalists. ‘If you have an Ed Miliband/Scottish Nationalist government, they will trash this economy,’ Mr Osborne told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. He said the Tories had a ‘balanced plan’ to finish the job of restoring order to the public finances that involved cutting £1 in every £100 of government spending for a further two years. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused Labour of ‘playing Russian roulette’ with the economy. Labour officials said ‘any government led by Ed Miliband’ would not compromise on the deficit. That will be seen as a bid to ease fears a Labour administration propped up by the SNP would wreak havoc with the public finances. ■ Labour would ensure Premiership football teams give millions to smaller clubs, Andy Burnham has said. The shadow health spokesman said it would enforce a Premier League commitment to invest 5 per cent of the proceeds from lucrative TV rights deals in grassroots sport. By Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor for The Daily Mail . Labour yesterday admitted it cannot match David Cameron’s pledge to provide the NHS with an £8billion cash injection. The two main parties angrily traded blows over which would provide the most secure future for the Health Service. But independent experts urged Labour to back plans to plug a £30billion hole in the books. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (pictured) repeatedly refused to say whether Labour would provide the £8billion funding . These plans, drawn up by NHS boss Simon Stevens, commit the service to making £22billion of savings, but also require an extra £8billion a year by 2020. The independent Nuffield Trust said failure to make the financial commitment would have ‘serious consequences for the viability of the service’. Chief executive Nigel Edwards said Labour’s stance was ‘regrettable’, adding: ‘The NHS has a plan, which has been endorsed by all leading organisations in the sector. Labour are now the only party not to have committed to this £8billion and yet their proposals are likely to require more spending on the NHS.’ The Nuffield Trust also warned that Labour’s ‘health manifesto’, launched at the weekend, suggested a return to the top-down management style it used when it was last in office. Mr Edwards said: ‘The level of detail set out in this [Labour] document is somewhat concerning. The NHS is complex and often responds best to locally driven initiatives. ‘There is a risk that elements of this detailed approach could trigger further reorganisation.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper repeatedly refused to say whether Labour would provide the £8billion funding. She said: ‘We will make sure the NHS has the money it needs and that’s what we’ve always done. ‘We’ll have practical measures that will raise £2.5billion – we can say where the money will come from, the Tories can’t.’ Miss Cooper also denied that Labour’s target to cut tax dodging by £7.5billion was simply ‘plucked from the air’. The party has promised to reduce evasion and avoidance by this amount by the end of 2017. But tax experts warned it would lead to a crackdown by HMRC on small firms – further souring relations between Labour and business. Challenged on the pledge yesterday, Miss Cooper said: ‘It is an ambitious and it’s a stretching target but we think it is right to do so because under the Conservatives the gap between the amount of tax that should be being paid and that is being paid has been widening.’","Miliband will warn that the party faces coming to power in ‘time of scarcity’

"The mass stranding of 160 melon-headed whales on two beaches in Japan has triggered fears of upcoming earthquake and tsunami. The whales, which are in fact a species of dolphin, were found washed up along a 6-mile (10km) stretch of the Pacific coast of Hokato, around 60 miles (100km) north of Tokyo. Although officials are still investigating the cause of the strandings, they triggered rumours on social media of an impending earthquake. Scroll down for video . More than 160 melon-headed whales washed onto two beaches at Hokota city, north-east of Tokyo . The fears appeared to be based on the appearance of 50 melon-headed whales six days before the devastating undersea earthquake in 2011 that caused a tsunami and left 19,000 people dead. However, experts have dismissed the claims as being 'unscientific'. For centuries there have been accounts of animals behaving bizarrely before earthquakes. Now scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short-term seismic forecasting. They found that animals in Peru - such as pumas and razor-billed curassow birds - ran for cover days before the event. Researchers believe that the changes in behaviour may be linked to airborne ions. Led by Dr Rachel Grant of Anglia Ruskin University, experts used data gathered from a series of motion-triggered cameras located in the Yanachaga National Park in Peru. The research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 Contamana earthquake that struck the region in 2011. On a typical day, the cameras would record between five and 15 animal sightings. However, within the two-day period in the run-up to the earthquake, they recorded five or fewer sightings. Instead they believe the melon-headed whales may have suffered a parasitic infection. Others believe the sandy shoals around Hokato city may have also made the animal's sonar ineffective. Toshiaki Kishiro, head of Cetacean Resources at Japan's National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries, said while it was possible the whales frightened by disturbances in the Earth's electromagnetic field caused by movement in the tectonic plates - there were was no firm evidence of this. Speaking to the Telegraph he said: 'This area of Japan has had many similar cases of beachings in the past, and especially of this species, so we are trying to find out why it happens.' He added that the animals, which measure two to three metres in length, could have been trying to avoid predators like killer whales and come too close to the shore. However, despite attempts to reassure the public, social media sites like Twitter have been ablaze with rumours of an impending earthquake. One Twitter user wrote: 'Is the next one coming? Be ready for a quake.' The whales first began to appear on the beach last week but officials said they had discovered eight more bodies today. Local residents had rushed to the beaches with buckets and towels in an attempt to help keep the marine mammals alive. Scientists are still investigating what caused the whales to become stranded on the beaches of Hokota city . Local resident used buckets of water in an attempt to keep the melon-headed whales alive on the beaches . Officials have spent the weekend removing and buring the dead melon-headed whales after they stranded . However, almost all of the animals have now died although a few were returned to the ocean. The strandings in 2011 before the magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of Japan is not the first association of whale strandings with tectonic activity. Around 100 pilot whales died in a mass stranding on a remote beach in New Zealand just two days before a large earthquake hit Christchurch in 2011. The 2004 Boxing Day earthquake in the Indian Ocean that also triggered a devastating tsunami also saw 170 whales stranded on beaches in Australia and New Zealand in the days before. Those whales that survived were taken back out to sea by the Japan Coast Guard to return them to the ocean . Japan Coast Guard personnel managed to return some of the whales back to the sea . The whales were stranded on two beaches close to Hokota city around 60 miles north of Tokyo . According to the US Geological Survey, which monitors tremors around the world, there was a small magnitude 5.3 earthquake 157 miles (252km) off the coast of Namie, Japan. Quakes of this size are relatively common along the fault line. However, researchers have found it is possible detect tiny pulses in the Earth's magnetic field in the areas around the epicentre of earthquakes in the weeks before they occur. Researchers at San Jose State University have been developing new techniques to use these pulses to predict earthquakes using highly sensitive magnetometres. However, it is not know if whales have the ability to detect such tiny fluctuations. Tadasu Yamada, a senior researcher at the National Museum of Nature and Science, said investigations were still ongoing into what caused the whales to strand in Hokato. He told public broadcaster NHK: 'We don't see any immediate signs of diseases on their bodies, such as cancer. 'We want to figure out what killed these animals.' Residents struggled to return the whales to the sea after the mammals became exhausted in the shallow water . Once stranded, the animals are vulnerable to dehydration and sunburn until rescuers can use the high tide to move their massive weight back into deeper water. Efforts to save the dolphins stood in marked contrast to the global view of Japan and its relationship with cetaceans. Despite international opprobrium, Japan hunts minke and pilot whales off its coast, and has for many years also pursued the mammals in the Antarctic Ocean, where it takes advantage of a scientific exemption to an international moratorium on whaling. It has never made a secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed. A United Nations court ruled last year that the Antarctic hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as research, prompting Tokyo to suspend operations, but it vowed to redesign the programme to make it more scientific. The International Whaling Commission's (IWC) panel of experts said today that it opposed Japan's proposal for its scientific research whaling programme, saying it did not demonstrate a need for killing whales.","The whales washed up along a 6 mile stretch of coast near Hokato, Japan .

"With summer well and truly over, it's inevitable allergy and flu season is upon us and there's no escaping the nasty germs in the air. But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled 1,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits, indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there’s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you’re allergic to dust mites you basically can’t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings’ or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body’s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: ""Should I get a humidifier?"".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They’re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that’s not why you’re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It’s because your dog’s hair has allergens on it – left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too – forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.","Our houses are overtaken with dust mites, leading to winter illnesses .
We shed 50g every week in dead skin, mostly in our bed .

"An Italian woman accused of  carrying out acid attacks on her ex-boyfriends was desperate to 'purge' her previous relationships, a Milan court heard. Martina Levato and her German boyfriend Alexander Boettcher, 30, planned to throw 'corrosive liquid' at men she had previously been linked to even if just by a kiss, it was claimed. The 23-year-old, who was reportedly a student at Milan's private Bocconi university, also tried to castrate a man's genitals while in his car in May 2014, prosecutors alleged. Martina Levato (left) and her German boyfriend Alexander Boettcher (right), 30, wanted to 'purge' her previous relationships by assaulting men she had previously been linked to, a Milan court heard . The couple was detained on December 28 last year on suspicion of throwing acid on the face and body of her ex-boyfriend Pietro Barbini. The 22-year-old was left with third-degree burns and damage to his right eye. The court heard Levato said she would 'do something bad' for property broker Boettcher, who asked her to draw up a list of ex-boyfriends. One of their plans included travelling to London in January to carry out an attack on a man that flirted with Levato in Ibiza, the investigating judge Giuseppe Gennari said.

"A 50-year-old man should die in prison for the alleged brutal murder of his wife - 20 years after he killed his first partner, prosecutors said on Monday. Tony Degrafreed, of Indianapolis, Indiana, has been charged with murder for allegedly beating to death wife Rebecca Degrafreed, 47, at their home on July 20, 2014. Marion County prosecutor's office filed the request on Monday, for life without the chance of parole for Degrafreed.

'Witnesses in the home reported that they heard a banging noise from the bedroom where the victim was found.' Rebecca Degrafreed died from blunt and sharp force traumatic injures to the head and neck, according to an autopsy report. Mrs Degrafreed’s son, Jordan Yarbro, was also injured in the incident when Degrafreed allegedly stabbed him in the chest before fleeing the scene. Family members said Rebecca, who worked at IU Methodist Hospital, married Tony in 2006 after he'd been released from prison. The mother-of-three accepted her new husband's past and devoted herself to his rehabilitation, relatives said. The couple had originally met as teenagers. In January 1994, Tony Degrafreed was arrested and charged with murder, two counts of attempted murder and illegal possession of a handgun, The Indianapolis News reported. According to news reports at the time, he shot his estranged 26-year-old wife, Stacy Degrafreed, in the chest and thigh. She died in hospital. Police said he also shot two neighbors, Frank and Phyllis Sommerville, in the same incident. He was convicted of murder in 1995 and sentenced to 30 years in prison, but served less than half of that sentence.

"It is the historic site where King John sealed the Magna Carta to establish the rule of law. But just a few hundred yards from the famous setting at Runnymede in Surrey – which the Queen will visit in June to celebrate the document’s 800th anniversary – dozens of anarchists have made their squalid home in a litter-strewn shanty town. Squatting on the private land, the group, who are linked to the Occupy London movement that caused chaos in London when they set up camp outside St Paul’s Cathedral in 2011, have left locals outraged. Squatter Vinny outside one of the make-shift homes the group has set up just yards away from where the Magna Carta was sealed in Runnymede, Surrey . In contrast to the neatly tended Magna Carta memorial nearby, a used condom and grubby mattress lie at the entrance to the ramshackle squatters’ camp. Inside, a Mail on Sunday reporter witnessed one anarchist openly smoking cannabis just feet from a two-year-old child. The battle to evict the squatters is set to come to a head just before the Magna Carta anniversary on June 15. Last Thursday the squatters were granted a stay of execution when a county court judge allowed them two weeks to submit a defence ahead of a hearing next month. One camp leader, Vinny, who would not give his surname, said: ‘This is about using the land to grow our own vegetables. It’s a place to give people life skills, a sanctuary for the displaced.’ The dope-smoking 48-year-old added: ‘Why can’t we have equality with land ownership? Why can’t we have a few acres each?’ Last Thursday the squatters were granted a stay of execution when a county court judge allowed them two weeks to submit a defence ahead of a hearing next month . The camp was set up three years ago in woodland on a disused Brunel University site. Property developers Orchid Runnymede has planning permission to build affordable homes, student accommodation, an elderly care facility, and private housing on the land. But the community of about 30 squatters are refusing to leave. They claim to live off the land, using solar panels for electricity, a freshwater spring to wash and a vegetable patch to grow food, as well as raiding supermarket rubbish bins. King John sealed the Magna Carta to establish the rule of law. Above, a painting illustrating the historic moment . But David Sheldrake, whose farm borders the camp, said they have been stealing from water tanks for his cattle, adding: ‘I’m 69 and there are young people there – able, fit people who don’t want to work.’ One of the camp’s founding members, James Hampson, claims some of the squatters do work full-time. He has not worked since staying at the camp but said he has not claimed any benefits either. The former IT worker said: ‘Our aim here has always been to build a sustainable community.’ Mr Hampson is pledging to peacefully resist any attempt by developers – who recently erected a steel fence around the squat – to retake the land. The squatters’ lifestyle is a far cry from that in the leafy village of Englefield just 200 yards away, where houses fetch more than £1 million. Marketing consultant Lisa Lawson, 55, whose house borders the development site, said: ‘If you really believe in keeping everything nice and living off the land, why is there such a load of rubbish down there?’ Retired engineer Janet Ferstl, 60, added: ‘I used to walk my dogs down there a lot but I don’t any more. I don’t feel safe.’ A spokesman for Arts Estates, which manages the land, said: ‘We are building a valuable development for the community and we have to do so within the laws of the land.’","Squatters have set up shanty town just yards from Runnymede in Surrey .

"Clothing that features slogans joking about stalking has been slammed by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, a London-based charity which aims to 'make society a safer place'. A number of online retailers stock the offending garments, which feature phrases such as  'I heart my stalker' and 'Some people call it stalking. I call it love!' According to the SLT, the T-shirts mock a serious issue which affects one in six women, and play into people's fear of being laughed at, which prevents victims from seeking help to deal with stalkers and puts them at a higher risk of being attacked. Scroll down for video . Funny? A selection of T-shirts (pictured) branded with jokes about stalking has been slammed by The Suzy Lamplugh Trust, a charity which aims to 'make society a safer place' The T-shirts in question are sold in US and UK stores including Zazzle, Look Human and North Shore Shirts. 'Are you stalking me? 'Cause that would be super', reads one, priced at $10.99 (£7.40) in the US. 'I stalk you on Facebook', another states, priced at £16.95 ($25.35). 'Stalking is when Channing Tatum and I go for long romantic walk together but only one of us knows about it', another $28 (£18.90) specimen muses. 'Stalking is such a strong word, I prefer intense research of an individual,' reads a $27 (£18.11) shirt, featuring the  description: 'Sometimes when you want to bag a mate you have to do some reconnaissance.' A spokesman from the Suzy Lamplugh Trust told MailOnline that these common slogans seem harmless but they prevent the crime from being taken seriously. She said: 'It does all add to the feeling that it’s something that’s a little bit humorous. It’s not, especially for victims. Making light: According to the SLT, the T-shirts mock a serious issue which affects one in six women, and play into people's fear of being laughed at, which prevents victims from seeking help with stalkers . 'If we're  still making jokes about stalking it’s harder for victims to come forward. 'Things are sold with humour but when they’re so commonplace they start to dilute the language around them it starts to become a problem and stalking is a serious offense. 'It doesn’t help that the messages are out there, it just reinforces the myths that are around stalking.' She added: 'Even the language around stalking is potentially damaging, we all talk about stalking people on Facebook but we don’t mean it, we mean we’re looking up someone we went to school with. She said a common view of stalking is that it's romantic, with stalkers leaving bunches of flowers, teddy bears or money on victims' windscreens. 'The behaviours may not seem offensive in that way but if it’s unwanted attention from someone, it’s a problem.' Offending articles: The T-shirts in question are sold in US and UK stores including Zazzle, Look Human (pictured) and North Shore Shirts . In honour of National Stalking Awareness Week, which started on Monday, the personal safety charity, which runs the National Stalking Helpline, has released a two-minute animated film to help shift the public's, at times, blasé perspective on the matter. The video's voiceover states: 'What does stalking actually mean? 'It doesn't just mean a stranger ambushing you from the bushes or lurking through the window. 'It can also mean disturbing emails, non-stop phone calls, creepy letters and social media abuse. It means the other person ignores your ""no"". 'It means you're forced to change your life routine for months or even years. 'Oh, and it's not flattering or funny, it's a serious crime. 'So if you're being followed, if there are eyes on you wherever you go, if you are scared to open the door or your mailbox or your text messages, if you jump every time the phone rings, if you haven't had a good night's sleep for a very long time... then this is stalking.' According to the campaign - which seeks to challenge the notion that stalking is 'romantic, trivial or funny' - 80 per cent of victims are women, and more than 80 per cent of men and women combined are stalked by someone they know. Of this, 45 per cent of stalkers are ex-partners, 22 per cent are 'acquaintances', five per cent are colleagues or ex-colleagues, and four per cent are family members. 'It is hard to give an exact definition of stalking because stalkers will often use multiple and differing methods to harass their victims,' the trust explains. Serious crime: 'It is hard to give an exact definition of stalking because stalkers will often use multiple and differing methods to harass their victims,' the SLT explains (picture posed by model) 'Stalking can consist of any type of behaviour, such as regularly sending flowers or gifts, making unwanted or malicious communication (including calls, texts and emails), damaging property and physical or sexual assault. 'If the behaviour is persistent, unwanted and is causing you fear, harassment or anxiety then it is stalking and you should not have to live with it.' The SLT was set up by Diana Lamplugh, the late mother of Suzy, a 25-year-old estate agent who disappeared in Fulham, south west London, in 1986. She was presumed murdered and declared dead in 1993, and no one has ever been charged over her killing.

"Attorneys for two sides agree that in April 1995, a 24-year-old man who had been pointed out by a Southern California college student as her rapist had his truck rear-ended before he was kidnapped, brutally beaten and killed. Where they differ is on the role of now-45-year-old Gianni Van in the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez, whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of a road. At the opening of his trial Wednesday, prosecutors said Van was enraged after his ex-girlfriend Norma Patricia Esparza told him Ramirez had raped her and he must be held responsible for the attack. She's expected to testify Thursday. Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of f Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . Van's lawyer said his client had no knowledge of the plan to harm Ramirez and was threatened that he would suffer a similar fate if he snitched on a friend and friend's employee who carried out the killing. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza — who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France — was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from sexual assault victim advocates who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. During opening statements, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). Esparza and Van allegedly entered into a sham marriage before Van's original arrest for the crime. Esparza could not be forced to testify and Van was released. They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in France and the mother of a little girl . Arrested: In 2012, Esparza was arrested in connection to the slaying when she re-entered the United States for an academic conference . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.' 'He felt that he had been violated,' Murray said of Van. Van is charged with murder during the commission of a kidnapping. If convicted, he could get life in prison without the possibility of parole. Kody Tran died when he killed himself in an unrelated July 2013 standoff with police. His wife Diane has taken a plea deal and was expected to testify against Van. Shannon Gries still faces murder charges. After the killing, Van and Esparza — who had been questioned by police — entered into a sham marriage to avoid prosecution, Murray said. While Van was arrested in 1996, he was released because Esparza could not be forced to testify against her husband, he said. Esparza later divorced Van. Esparza's husband, Jorge Mancillas, had said at a 2013 news conference that his wife had confided in Van about the rape and he took matters into his own hands. Involved?

Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client knew nothing of the plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez but was shown his severely beaten body strung up by chains at Tran's auto transmission shop and warned he would face the same fate if he ever snitched. 'He didn't ask anyone to kill anyone. He never had homicidal thoughts of revenge,' Dolnick told jurors, adding that Van had confided in Tran about Esparza's rape and that Tran and Gries took matters into their own hands. Esparza, 40, is now the mother of a little girl. She pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in an agreement with prosecutors last year. She is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. A fourth defendant also pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors. Plea: Esparza, here in 2013, claims she was coerced by Van into pointing out her rapist in 1995. She is expected to receive a 6-year sentence after testifying that Van murdered Ramirez .","Gianni Van, now 45, is accused of kidnapping and brutally killing his then girlfriend's accused rapist while in college in Southern California in 1995 .

"Hundreds of staff at the Royal Courts of Justice and London School of Economics were evacuated again today after a building due to be demolished collapsed 'like a pancake' injuring a 56-year-old workman. Workers underneath the six-storey structure fled for their lives after the fifth, fourth and third floors crashed down on to the rest of the building - sending a huge cloud of dust into the air. The terrifying incident is just yards from where an underground cable fire ripped through Holborn on April 1 bringing parts of central London to a standstill and costing local firms £40million. Scroll down for video . Building collapse: Hundreds of staff at the Royal Courts of Justice and London School of Economics were evacuated again today after a six-storey structure collapsed . Injury: Police said a 56-year-old man was being treated for injuries this afternoon following the disaster . Staff at both LSE and the Royal Courts of Justice were also evacuated on that occasion and at this stage it is unknown whether the two incidents are related. The collapsed building, located just behind the university, was covered in scaffolding when disaster struck shortly after 4pm this afternoon. Students at LSE were seen evacuating the university's library and have been told to 'stay clear' of the area. One worker suffered head injuries and a broken arm and was treated by colleagues trained in first aid until an ambulance arrived. Two incidents in a matter of weeks: A map shows where the building collapsed today - not far from the underground cable fire that tore through Holborn on April 1 costing local firms an estimated £40million . An air ambulance was seen arriving at the scene this evening and a 56-year-old was taken to hospital with head injuries . He was the only casualty among 30 workers on site at the time. Nathan Kennedy, 28, was working in the site office when the building behind the Royal Court of Justice and LSE began to collapse. He said: 'We are used to big bangs and crashes all the time, that's the nature of demolition. 'I was just finishing off some paperwork when there was a huge crash and a rumble, we knew it was out of the ordinary and everyone ran outside. 'We are trained for this so everyone kept calm, but it was the first time anything like this has happened to me. 'There was a huge dust ball, we were checking everyone was all right when a couple of the first aiders brought out one of the guys. Parts of scaffolding spill over the barrier around the site and a construction vehicle could also be seen among the piles of rubble . The building, located directly behind LSE, is just yards from where the underground cable fire started at the beginning of April, bringing parts of central London to a standstill . 'He had a bad cut on his forehead and I think he could have broken his arm. We are all worried for him, he's called Keiran and he's in his 50s or 60s. 'Everyone is shaken up, we just hope he's all right.' A London Air Ambulance helicopter landed in nearby Lincoln's Inn Fields to pick up the injured man. Workmen have been on site for around five months and demolition was in progress when the collapse occurred. Mr Kennedy added: 'There a stretch around 15 to 20m that's collapsed. We've been here since December, the building was seven floors and we've gone down three. 'There's some heavy machinery on the higher floors, we use a machine called a muncher that chews through the walls, it's like a big claw, that may have fallen down. 'There's been a lot of building work around here but this is far enough away I would be surprised if that had anything to do it.' Speaking at the scene London Fire Brigade station manager John Snelgrove said: 'We have one waking wounded who has been taken to hospital and we are unaware of his condition. A cloud of dust hovers in the air following the building collapse in Holborn, central London . Fire crews attend the scene on Portugal Street, near the London School of Economics, today . People in the vicinity reported feeling the ground shake as part of the huge building collapsed into rubble . 'The collapse is known as a pancake and has taken around third to two thirds of one of the sides down with it. 'Fortuitously the collapse has largely stayed within the site and not hurt any passers by. 'This is a busy area, luckily the building collapsed inwardly, although a few cars were damaged by fallen masonry.' Scotland Yard said: 'We were called at 4.14pm to Portugal Street, Aldwych, following reports of a partial building collapse on a building site. 'Officers, London Ambulance service and London Fiere Brigade are in attendance. One male aged 56 is being treated at the scene. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and road closures are currently in place.' A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'One hundred people were evacuated from the building site and a further 100 people were evacuated from nearby properties. A safety cordon is in place.' The London School of Economics (LSE) Students' Union's Twitter account tweeted a picture of the scene and said it was 'just by' the LSE campus. And LSE assistant professor Bryan Roberts tweeted: 'Building just collapsed next to my office at LSE in Holborn. When the structure came down there were 30 men working on the site - luckily just one was injured . Students at the London School of Economics have been evacuated and told to 'stay clear' of the area . 'Some workers hurt. Shook the whole campus. Ambulances just arrived at LSE where the building fell down. It's the old London School of Business building.' Eyewitness Murat Akkulak, a research co-ordinator at the Royal College of Surgeons, told the BBC: 'There was a lot of dust but I could see there was a digger down amongst the rubble and one or two builders were running around trying to get someone out of the digger. 'They seem to have had a really lucky escape to me, because everything else had just collapsed around them.' The incident comes just weeks after a fire on nearby Kingsway, which was caused by faulty electrical cables underground, sending thick clouds of smoke into the air - engulfing buildings. Dramatic photographs from the scene showed crowds of people on the street as power cuts hit office buildings. Onlookers reported 'struggling to breathe' while later that night some 5,000 homes and businesses in central London were left without electricity following a huge power cut. Phone lines went down, thousands of workers fled their offices while West End shows including The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong were all cancelled.

"An ingenious British  designer has come up with the ultimate environmentally-friendly way to create stunning household furniture - by letting Mother Nature do all the hard work. Gavin Munro  grows young trees into specially-designed plastic moulds, pruning and guiding the branches into shape before grafting them together to form ultra-tough joints. Using this method he's already created several prototype pieces and has a field in Derbyshire where he's currently tending a crop of 400 tables, chairs and lampshades  which he hopes to harvest next year. Scroll down for video . Farm fresh: The field in Derbyshire where British designer Gavin Munro is growing his unique and beautiful furniture . Crops: A row of willow dining chairs growing directly into shape which Mr Munro hopes to have ready for market by 2017 . Finished articles: Prototype versions of a table and chair created by growing trees directly into plastic moulds . Mr Munro, 39, a keen environmentalist, believes the technique - which has been dubbed botanical manufacturing - could one day be used to create sustainable and ecologically-sound furniture on a much larger scale. He explains: 'You start by training and pruning young tree branches as they grow over specially made formers. 'At certain points we then graft them together so that the object grows in to one solid piece - I’m interested in the way this is like a kind of organic 3D printing that uses air, soil and sunshine as its source material. 'After it's grown into the shape we want, we continue to care and nurture the tree as it thickens and matures before harvesting it in the Winter and then letting it season and dry. 'It's then a matter of planing and finishing to show off the wood and grain inside.' Furniture farmer: Gavin Munro with a prototype wooden lampshade grown into shape using his ingenious technique . Botanical manufacturing: A light shade being grown, left, and as a finished article, right . Working together with his wife Alice, Mr Munro mainly uses strong, fast-growing willow for his designs but is also experimenting with ash, sycamore, hazel, crab apple, sessile oak and red oak. He had the original idea while working as a gardener in San Francisco and making furniture from driftwood in his spare time. Remembering an old over-grown bonsai tree  in his mother's garden when he was child which resembled a throne, he decided it would be faster to grow furniture directly rather chopping a mature tree into bits. As well as avoiding the need for nails, fixings and machinery, the designs should last longer than traditionally-made chairs as they don't have the weak points around the joins. Wife Alice, 40, explains: 'Just like a broken bone will be a lot stronger where it heals, the points where the wood is grafted are extremely strong. The field in Derbyshire where the unusual crop is growing. Mr Munro hopes it will be ready to harvest next year . Form and function: The technique creates furniture which is not just beautiful to look at but extremely strong too . 'It means you don't have joints which come lose like with a traditionally made chair so they should last a whole lot longer.' The first prototypes were grown in Alice's mother's garden before Alice persuaded her husband to give up working as a gardener and web designer and focus on the project full time. Mr Munro, who has named his company Full Grown, has already harvested chairs, a table and lampshades and is currently working on more complex designs including a bookshelf and a chest of drawers. But it's not simply a matter of setting up the molds and sitting back and letting the trees grow into shape. The technique involves copious amounts of pruning, coppicing and grafting. Tragedy struck early on when a herd of cows rampaged through the field damaging many of the young trees. Detail: A close up of one of the light shades. Mr Munro hopes to have them on sale in 2017 priced at £1,000 and £1,500 depending on the size . But the Munros recovered and weather-permitting they hope to have their first big crop harvested in 2016 and ready for sale in 2017. Most of the pieces have already been pre-ordered with the chairs selling for £2,500 each and the light shades priced between £1,000 and £1,500. Mr Munro added: 'The whole process takes place over seasons and years - between four and eight years to grow a chair for example. 'But when you look at how long and how much effort it actually takes us now to go from having no tree to final wooden object then you realise that the craft we’re a part of developing is not just more cooperative with the natural world; it has an elegant efficiency all of it own. 'I’m only making 50 or so pieces a year but for every 100 trees you grow there are a 1,000 branches you need to care for and 10,000 shoots you have to prune at the right time.  It’s an art-form in itself keeping track of everything.'

"Celebrities are putting their first face forward by snapping just one selfie and sharing it unfiltered on social media in aid of a new campaign dubbed #SelfieEsteem. Female stars including Nancy Dell'Olio, Josie Gibson, Jamelia and Susanna Reid have all stepped up to the plate for Good Morning Britain's initiative, which launched today, as well as male contenders including Piers Morgan and Richard Madeley. According to a survey conducted by the ITV breakfast show, women take an average of six selfies before posting one online and men take four, such is the pressure to look their very best on social media.

"Volvo teamed up with a Swedish start-up to make a light reflective spray for cyclists, called Life Paint . Volvo is known for making cars packed with safety features but it’s a low-tech safety solution for cyclists that has proved a surprising success. The car manufacturer teamed up with a Sweden-based start-up to make a temporary light reflective spray for cyclists, called Life Paint. The paint has proved so popular that the trial cans up for grabs at certain cycling shops in London were snapped up in days. And some of these are now on sale on eBay for £45 ($66) at the time of writing. Volvo launched the paint to increase the visibility of cyclists on the road. It contains powder-fine reflective particles designed to react to a car’s headlights, alerting drivers to the presence of cyclists in the dark. The paint is invisible in daylight, but in the dark it reflects light in the same direction as the light source to illuminate the objects it has been sprayed on. Dispensed in a spray can, the paint can be washed off, so it can also be applied to clothes, helmets, pushchairs, dog leads and obviously, bikes. A trial began in London bike shops on 2 April to gauge public interest and 2,000 cans were given away free as word of the popular product spread. At the time, Volvo said that if the paint proved a hit, the project ‘will expand nationally and internationally’. A spokesman told MailOnline that the company is ‘extremely pleased with the response’ and experts at Volvo's headquarters in Stockholm are discussing whether the product could be sold, and is comparable with Volvo's auto offering.

It washes off but can last for days on bike frames (pictured) Life Paint is a reflective safety spray. It’s invisible by daylight but reflects light in the dark. Designed to react to a car’s headlights, the spray reflects light in the same direction as the light source - shining brightly and alerting drivers to a cyclist’s presence. It washes off completely and won’t mark surfaces, so it can be used on clothing, helmets, metal frames and even pets’ collars. The paint lasts approximately one week after application, depending on surface it’s sprayed upon and how much a user applies. However, there are no immediate plans to sell the paint. Consequently, information about how much it may retail for has not been revealed, but there is still a chance cyclists might be able to buy Life Paint in the future in cycling shops or even at Volvo garages. The lack of concrete plans has led cyclists eager to try the paint to attempt to get hold of some on eBay, where cans  are on currently on sale for £45 ($66). But in fact, savvy shoppers can try a similar spray for less than £18. Life Paint is made by a Swedish start-up called Albedo 100. It currently sells four different types of spray: a light-reflective spray for metal, wood and plastic, an invisible reflective spray for textiles, a pale grey version of the same kind, and even a light-reflective spray for pets on its website. All of them are temporary and can be washed off.

Life Paint (pictured on a bike's chain and spokes) is made by a Swedish start-up called Albedo 100. The firm currently sells four different types of spray on its website . It automatically brakes if the driver fails to take the necessary action, while Active Bending Headlights search around corners to provide drivers with better visibility to spot vulnerable cyclists at night. Volvo said that Intellisafe provided the inspiration for LifePaint. ‘Every year more than 19,000 cyclists are injured on the UK’s roads,’ said Nick Connor, managing director at Volvo Car UK. ‘At Volvo, we believe that the best way to survive a crash is not to crash at all, and are committed to making the roads a safer place by reducing the number of accidents. ‘Volvo is a world-leader in safety technology, and we are proud to be extending our reach beyond just those driving our cars. ‘By making cyclists increasingly visible as well as increasing the safety capabilities of our cars, we are doing our utmost to protect everyone on the road.’ Life Paint is made by a Swedish start-up called Albedo 100, which sells four different types of spray: a light-reflective spray for metal, wood and plastic, an invisible reflective spray for textiles, a pale grey version of the same kind, and even a light-reflective spray for pets (shown in the video above) Nissan has trialled technology that means cars could glow-in-the-dark on the roads to become more visible.

The 'ultraviolet-energised paint' on the Nissan Leaf electric car is a demonstration of a secret paint formula made up of organic materials. Use the slider, above to see the car glow after dark . Known as Starpath, the paint is applied by spraying and absorbs UV energy from the sun throughout the day. It is able to glow for between eight and 10 hours when the sun goes down. The paint is the brainchild of Surrey-based inventor Hamish Scott, who is already trialling glow-in-the-dark cycle paths in Cambridge. It’s made from very rare earth materials, including Strontium Aluminate, which is solid, odourless and chemically and biologically inert. However, the paint option won't be a choice for future customers because the ingredients mean it is unlikely to be used on a large scale.","Volvo and a start-up made Life Paint - a wash-off reflective spray for bikes .

"One in five parents sedates their children before a long road trip, despite fears the medication can cause breathing problems. A national driving survey analysed the travel habits of 3700 Australian families which revealed four in five families use technology to deal with bored children, giving them a hand held computer game, like an iPad, while another 70 per cent said they give their kids treats to sweeten the ride. Almost 20 per cent of NSW families use a more extreme technique, admitting they have used sedatives like the antihistamine Phenergan to knock their kids out so their journey will be more pleasant. One in five NSW families have admitted to sedating their children before taking them on long car trips . The over the counter drug Phenergan is commonly used to treat allergies however it contains a sedative called promethazine which is widely known to cause breathing problems in young children. The medical community claim the sedative Phenergan should not be used on children younger than two years old as side effects like respiratory depression, more commonly known as hypoventilation, can be fatal. Warnings about the use of drugs like Phenergan on children have been around since 2006 when the US Food and Drug Administration found the medication was linked to 22 cases of respiratory depression in infants, seven of which were fatal. Westmead Children's Hospital head of general medicine Joanne Ging told Fairfax that Phenergan is far too unpredictable to use as a sedative on children. The medical community claim the sedative Phenergan should not be used on children younger than two years old as side effects like respiratory depression can be fatal. 'We would never recommend it for children on plane trips, car trips or wherever, because its side effects can trigger the exact opposite effect, including hallucinations. It's a medication that really should only ever be used for allergies.' Family therapist and child psychologist Michael Hawton condemned the trend labelling it 'extraordinary' and 'horrible'. 'The whole idea of heading off on a family holiday is to enjoy time together. There's a big difference between entertaining your children and medically straitjacketing them,' he said. 'The whole idea of heading off on a family holiday is to enjoy time together. There's a big difference between entertaining your children and medically straitjacketing them' Respiratory depression refers to a decrease in a person's ability to inhale a sufficient amount of oxygen and exhale enough carbon dioxide. Simply, the person will have difficulty in breathing. This can cause the person to appear out of breath and often lead to a tightness in the chest. The survey also revealed more than half of parents said they are 'sometimes distracted' by their kids who fight, kick the seat or intentionally interfere with the driver. Around 56 per cent of drivers admitted to turning the music up to drown the children out with a further 64 per cent of parents claiming they have threatened children that they will stop the car and leave the unruly kids behind.","A new national survey analysed the travel habits of Australian parents .

"Blogger: Lisa is the author of Canadian Expat Mom . When Canadian expat Lisa Webb first sent her vegetable-phobic three-year-old to school in France, she feared her daughter would starve during the day. The former assistant elementary school principal, who moved to France in 2009, was shocked to find rôti de boeuf and cordon bleu de dinde on the menu for toddlers - dishes she was used to eating in fancy restaurants with her husband. But when offered the chance to sit in on her eldest daughter's lunch breaks for one week, she witnessed tots using 'grown-up knives and forks' and eating everything put in front of them. In her native Canada, children would sit on the floor in the gym to eat their lunch. They were given 20 minutes to wolf down whatever their parents had packed for them and 20 minutes to play. In 2009, Lisa and her husband made the move to France and she began working as a substitute teacher in Paris. Writing in her blog - Canadian Expat Mom - the 34-year-old said: 'I’ll never forget dreading the fact that I was on lunchtime supervision because I saw that fish was on the menu that day. 'I had been a teacher for long enough to know that there was going to be a lot of elementary school kids plugging their noses and telling me they didn’t like fish. This was going to be a long supervision period.' But those children proved her wrong - they didn't turn up their noses and even asked for seconds. Scroll down for video . Speaking to MailOnline from her home in the Aquitaine region of southern France, she said: 'That's when I first encountered kids eating whatever was being put in front of them. 'I was shocked because it wasn't necessarily what I wanted to eat.' Fast forward five years to 2014, and Lisa had her own daughter to get ready for her first day at school. At three years old, she enjoyed a healthy continental diet but refused to eat vegetables. Three-course meal: Lisa Webb was nervous about sending her vegetable-phobic child to a school where pupils eat what they are served . 'Initially I think that we did give her everything, we eat very healthily as a family,' Lisa explained. 'Even if we wanted to give our kids fast food it doesn't really exist. Fast food for us is grabbing a baguette and a chunk of cheese. 'She ate everything but vegetables - foie gras, saucisson, lapin (rabbit). At home I stopped offering her broccoli because I didn't like wasting food. 'I was a little bit nervous. I thought ""there is no way she can stay at school, she will be starving"".' Writing in her blog, she added: 'Each week I would head over to the bulletin board posted outside the school and check what they were eating for lunch. There wasn’t a burger and fries or chicken finger to be seen on the list. 'It all sounded so fancy. Was Julia Child working in the kitchen? How were they serving this to three-year-olds? Did they have a magic wand to get these kids to eat this very grown up list of food? 'Whenever I would come across the ladies that worked in the lunchroom, I would stare in disbelief as they would tell me what a good eater my daughter was. 'Were they sure they had the right kid? Because mine would barely touch a vegetable at home. Yet, she wasn’t coming home hungry, so she must have been eating something.' 'There’s no plastic cutlery or non-breakable plates,' Lisa wrote. 'The kids are served their meal at the table, not buffet style' When the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime, where there is a constantly changing menu of salads, seasonal vegetables, meats and fish, the mum-of-two jumped at the chance. 'There’s no plastic cutlery or non-breakable plates,' she wrote. 'The kids are served their meal at the table, not buffet style. 'This is France after all, where the gastronomic meal is protected as a UNESCO intangible world heritage item. There’s no messing around when it comes to the French and eating. 'All the kids ate what was served and there is no food brought from home. Each day at lunch there was a three-course meal; no exceptions. 'The kids came into the lunchroom and sat politely using their manners, just like little adults. 'They were always offered seconds when they were done, and not forced to eat something they didn’t like, yet always encouraged to try it. Not liking something didn’t happened often though. 'However, if someone didn’t like something there wasn’t a fuss made, their plate was cleared and the next course was served.' When the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime the mum-of-two jumped at the chance . The meal at the French state school costs parents just €2.60 (£1.90) each day. 'I think a big part of it is that they are with their friends and they see all the other kids eating the same thing,' she told MailOnline. 'There is no jealousy of what everyone else has. 'I think it's amazing and it makes me happy that my kids are going to school here. 'Since we have lived here we go out for dinner and see kids eating in restaurants. You don't see them with a kids' menu or colouring in front of them. 'I think they learn it from when they are three years old. 'My daughter eats a lot more and it was a good eye-opener for me to see what she will eat. She gets vegetables every night.' Lisa, who is writing a book about life in France, added: 'My eyes have been opened and I am amazed by the what the French public school system does daily at noon. Well done France.' Monday .

"An unemployed 32-stone woman receives £18,000 a year in benefits because she claims her weight-related illness makes her a danger to the public. Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to obesity - which she says leaves her so tired that she falls asleep unexpectedly. The 21-year-old, who put on 13 stone in four years by eating through 'boredom', has not worked for five years because she says she would be a 'danger' in the workplace. Pressure group the Taxpayers' Alliance has now warned that the benefit system should not become a 'comfort blanket' and that people should 'get themselves in shape' to work. Scroll down for video . Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson (left and right) claims £18,000 in benefits because she suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to excessive weight - which leaves her so tired that she can't stay awake . Ms Coulson told MailOnline: 'I can't work because of my condition. If I was sat in an office, I would just fall asleep and the manager will end up sacking me. 'It's not just that, but I could make something go wrong, couldn't I? By falling asleep and making a mistake. Who knows what buttons I would press or what would happen? It wouldn't be fair on my colleagues.' Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she needs a state-funded support worker to write her meal plans. Instead, she continues to claim £18,712 a year in benefits - the equivalent of a £22,000 taxable salary - which is more than a nurse's starting wage and the same pay as a newly-qualified teacher. She added: 'I would love to have a job, I didn't chose to be like this. But I can't. I'm too dangerous. I can't do anything if I'm falling asleep the whole time.' Ms Coulson, who lives alone in New Milton, Hampshire, said she has always battled with her weight. However, her weight spiralled out of control after she left home four years ago. Unable to get a job due to being signed off with depression, the young woman started eating up to ten packs of crisps per day because she was 'bored'. She would also have an evening takeaway - and had soon put on 13 stone. Ms Coulson, pictured with her mother Lynda, 50, says she would like to work if she were able to do so . Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she can only do that with a state-funded support worker to help her write meal plans . She said: 'I developed depression and that just made me eat more. I would have takeaways most nights. I ate a lot, including chocolate and crisps. It was a way of coping.' Sleep apnoea is a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, which interrupts normal breathing and can stop someone getting a decent night's sleep. Ms Coulson, who is 5ft 6in, claims the condition leaves her so tired that she cannot travel to work, incase she drifts off to sleep and misses her bus stop. She also says she is not allowed to drive incase she nods off at the wheel. Rochelle Coulson is entitled to a raft of benefits every month which means she has not had to work for five years. Every month she is entitled to: . Total: £18, 712 . The 21-year-old is supposed to use a Continuous Positive Air Pressure machine (CPAP) to help her sleep during the night. But she decided not to use it because she claims she cannot travel to the doctors for a check-up. She has also been offered half-price gym membership by the NHS to help her lose weight - but says she cannot use it because it is too painful to walk. Despite this, Ms Coulson says the NHS could be doing a lot more to help her. She said: 'Yes I do feel there is more out there to help me and the NHS could have done better. 'They haven't done enough to help me tackle my weight. It would be nice to have a check-up each week, or month, when me and the doctor sit down and write a meal plan. Or they could try and get me a support worker. 'I am supposed to have a CPAP machine to help but I do not use it because I can't get back to hospital for a check-up. 'I can't go to hospital because I can't go on public transport as I will fall asleep and my mum can't always be there with me. I can't drive either because of my condition.' Ms Coulson said she started applying for jobs when she first finished college at the age of 18. But she was soon diagnosed with depression and told she was not capable of working. In December 2012, she was then diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Now, she claims she can drop off to sleep unexpectedly for up to six hours per day, meaning she relies on repeat sick notes to claim her state handouts. But in June last year, Ms Coulson was struck off from a GP surgery when her mother Lynda, 50, asked for a three-month note which the doctor refused. When the doctor offered to give her a one-month note instead, the pair were banned for being 'verbally abusive'. Ms Coulson then had to be 'interviewed' before being rejected by another surgery. In November, she was finally signed off for five months, after signing up to her third GP. The 21-year-old, who spends her days playing on Facebook, has not had a job for five years because she says she cannot stay awake . This healthy meal of carrots, potatoes, chicken and salad, recently posted by Ms Coulson, is an alternative to her usual takeaways and crisps . In total, Ms Coulson gets £411 in Personal Independence Payment a month, as well as £260 Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) a fortnight. Her £135 a week rent is also covered through housing benefit. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'The benefit system is a valuable safety net, and those with genuine conditions must of course be caught by it, but it can never become a comfort blanket and we must ask individuals to get themselves in shape to work. 'Taxpayers cannot afford to support individuals who simply choose not to work, so the authorities must be strict about who is deemed 'fit to work' or not. Ultimately, the benefit system has to encourage people to take responsibility for themselves.' Ms Coulson is now trying to lose weight by swapping her takeaways for healthy alternatives. She hopes that by losing some weight that she will be able to become more active. Nurse starting salary: £21,388. This job requires students to complete a three-year degree at university. Nurses then work a complex shift pattern, including weekends, evenings and nights. Teacher starting salary: £22,023. This requires the person to complete an undergraduate degree - usually three years long - and a one-year PGCE. Alternatively, the trainee teacher can complete an intensive year-long school-centred initial teacher training course on the job (SCITT). Care home worker: Between £14,000 and £18,000. This usually requires someone to complete a diploma in health and social care, as well as to undertake training and courses while on the job. She said: 'At the moment, it's hard for me to do everyday things like getting out of bed. The hardest is getting out of my mum's couch. It hurts my hips to lift myself out, because the sofa is broken due to my weight. 'My back also can't cope with standing for too long because of my weight, which means it very painful to walk.' She added: 'I'm dropping things like crisps and chocolate and replacing it with low fat Greek yoghurt. I used to eat takeaways on a regular basis but now I don't. 'Once I've shifted some, I can hopefully get out a little more.' Ms Coulson also said she had a blood test last week which showed she is borderline diabetic and has an underactive thyroid, for which she is now taking medication. A DWP spokesman said: 'Being obese in itself does not entitle a person to disability benefits, although the associated long-term health effects may. 'Decisions on whether a person is entitled to disability benefits are based on thorough assessments and consideration of any medical evidence, including from their GP.'","Rochelle Coulson, from New Milton, gets equivalent to £22k taxable salary .

"This is the moment an unlucky man was gored between the legs by a rampaging bull after being knocked to the ground during a bullrunning celebration in Spain. The unnamed man was sprinting ahead of the animal, trying to make it to the safety behind a set of iron bars when the angry animal sent him sprawling to the floor. And despite his desperate efforts to climb back up, the bull appeared to hit him right in the bottom with one of its horns as he tried to scramble away. Scroll down for video . This unlucky man was gored during a bullrunning event in Teulada, a small coastal town on Spain's Costa Blanca, after falling over in front of the beast . The man, who has not been identified, was seen running away from the angry animal before it caught him with one horn, sending him sprawling to the floor . Pictures show him crawling desperately towards the safety of the bull bars, but he was unable to make it before the horn hit him square between the legs . The unfortunate incident happened on the street in Teulada, a small coastal town on Spain's Costa Blanca, during the annual fiesta. The celebrations begin on April 8 and last until April 19, and include floatillas and parades celebrating the town's patron saint, Sant Vicent Ferrer. As part of the fiesta, large, aggressive bulls are let loose to run around the streets, with local and visitors invited to run alongside them. The challenge is to tease the animals before escaping behind one of the wooden pallets or iron bull bars to safety. Witnesses said the man was seen limping towards medical crews after the attack, but was unsupported and appeared not to have been seriously hurt . The bullrunning takes place during the town's annual fiesta, which includes float parades in honour of Sant Vicent Ferrer, the village's patron saint . Websites advertising the bull running recommend leaving the sport to the experienced locals, noting that the animals are faster than people think, and that it is mostly foreigners that get injured. While it is not known where this man came from, he was seen limping away to be tended by medical crews after the attack. He was not though to have been seriously injured.","Man was fleeing bull during fiesta celebrations in Teulada, eastern Spain .

"A mother was left in shock after her four-year-old daughter discovered a four-foot snake in the bath - just a week after moving into the house. Michelle Woods, from Norton in Teesside, was told by her daughter Elisha Mann that 'something was moving' in the bath. And when the pair walked into the bathroom to check what was there, that's when they came face to face with the reptile. The four-foot red and orange corn snake, which Michelle Woods discovered slithering around in the bathroom of her new home. She believes it may belong to the property's previous tenant . Mrs Woods, a full-time mother, said: 'I thought she was joking, but Elisha made me go and have a look, so I went and checked the bin and nothing was there. 'But then I looked up and I was face-to-face with a snake. I nearly jumped out of my skin and slammed the door shut. 'I even made sure our cat Smotker was locked downstairs in case it tried to attack it. I had no idea at the time if it was dangerous or not.' Panicking, Ms Woods said she called the RSPCA, who were unable to help - so in desperation, posted an appeal on Facebook. Within an hour, a local woman who keeps snakes had recognised her plight and identified the reptile as a corn snake, a non-venomous species normally kept as a pet. The woman then came to the house and took away the snake so Ms Woods and Elisha could get a good night's sleep. Ms Woods, 44, added: 'It was a great response. Obviously, they thought I was just joking at first but when I sent them a picture they posted it up online and I got some help straight away. Michelle Woods with her daughter Elisha Mann, who first spotted the snake in the bath before alerting her mother . It is not clear how the snake ended up in the bathroom, but Ms Woods believes that the previous tenant may have kept snakes as pets and lost the red and orange reptile while moving. She explained: 'We couldn't think of another way it could have got into the house, but goodness knows where it had been for the week we lived there before he spotted it. 'I was petrified at first and I was a bit nervoud about using the bathroom for the rest of the night. 'But luckily we haven't found anything else yet!' But the encounter didn't faze four-year-old Elisha, who said: 'When I saw the snake it was really still. 'I wasn't scared at all. I knew not to touch it. I'm looking forward to telling me friends about it at school.'","Michelle Woods told by her daughter of 'something moving' in the bath .

"While you were stuck in a traffic jam this Easter, the Rich Kids of Instagram continued their lifelong adventure across the world's most beautiful locations, exclusive beach-side restaurants and star-studded parties. Your average package holiday won't do for these youngsters who travel by private jet, sleep in presidential suites, wake up to scrambled eggs topped with truffles - and spend the rest of the day lounging on a luxurious yacht. MailOnline caught up with the world's most extravagant 18 to 26-year-olds who blew their cash in Miami, New York, Marbella and Monaco to name but a few cities before indulging in their stratospheric nightlife during Spring Break. While the glamorous Scolaro sisters 'partied with A-list movie stars', self-made millionaire Tomer Sror continued to earn hundreds of thousands in minutes over online trades – even when he was sunbathing on the beach. And their message to the 'haters' remains exactly the same: 'Keep watching and enjoying. There is more to come.' Scroll down for video . Jet-setter: 'Sometimes it's not about where you go, but rather how you get there,' says Marcus W.A. as he boards a £2 million private jet . Travel in style: For 25-year-old Andreas Arnhoff from Norway it is more about the journey - on a luxury yacht - than the destination which just so happens to be the gorgeous beaches of Miami . Glamorous: And when she needs to get to the other end of Monaco or Milan, Lana Scolaro (pictured) takes a pristine Bentley Continental . Loaded: Online trader and workaholic Tomer Sror travels light with one of his many passports, his $1,000 Hermes loafers and piles of cash . Businesswoman: Having grown up between New York, Monaco and London, with her sister Stephanie (right), 20-year-old fashion designer Lana Scolaro (left) knows nothing but the jet-set lifestyle . Whether on a £2million Phenom E100 private jet or a brand new Bentley Continental, they travel in style. And no one does it quite like 18-year-old Marcus W.A. who 'constantly needs to be on the move' and hates being in 'one place for two weeks'. In the last two months alone, the native New-Yorker has flown to Costa Rica, Nantucket, Boston, The Hamptons and Switzerland, where he stayed in the famous Badrutt's Palace and skied every single day. But not before heading down to Louis Vuitton to pick up a gold and brown document holder worth over £750 which has made several appearances on his opulent Instagram account. The young investor says it's not all fun, games and champagne - telling MailOnline: 'I wouldn't exactly say that life is just one big holiday because while I travel I'm not just sitting there and relaxing I'm always networking or doing meetings. 'But the concept that life is just one long fun trip that is constantly moving around definitely can describe my mindset.' 20-year-old Lana Scolaro and her sister Stephanie - who have been travelling back and forth between countries since they were young children - have become pretty used to the jet-setting lifestyle. Lana told MailOnline: 'We were just in LA partying with our usual crowd and a lot of the same friends we hang with in Saint Bart's. 'We hung out at the Beverly Hills Hotel a lot with some friends who are actors we'd prefer not to name, and went to some cool house parties in the hills.' But Tomer Sror who describes himself as a self-made man believes vacations should be spent relaxing with a beautiful girl. He told MailOnline: 'Unlike the other kids I have had to work for the money so ''vacation'' is what I do. I can't just be away all the time because I'm running a business but I still try to take time off as much as I can.' High-fliers: While most 20-somethings would shack up in a local hostel, the jet-setting Scolaro sisters spend their vacations in Monaco in the Cafe . Scenic: And instead of hiring a cheap rental car for a cross-country road trip, Andreas Arnhoff does the trip in his Porsche Turbo before enjoying a beautiful panoramic view of Oslo fjord . Wish you were here: 20-year-old businesswoman Lana Scolaro says she travels to promote her jewellery business as much as to have an adventure . Can't stop: Marcus W.A. who 'constantly needs to be on the move' used his mind-blowing trip to Machu Pichu in Peru to satisfy his need not to be 'one place for two weeks' Playtime: After spending time in Los Angeles and London, Lana was delighted to be back in her 'playground' of Monte Carlo . Unlike most 23-year-olds who would book into a local hostel, he spent his time between the presidential suites of the Elysium in Rhodes which set him back around £1,000-a-night and the Eilat in Israel which costs at least £500-a-night. For Lana who grew up between New York, London and Monaco, travelling both a hobby and a necessity to promote her luxury jewellery company Lana Scolaro Diamonds around the world. She said: 'In the last few months I've invested a lot into my new up and coming Jewellery collection which involves rare sapphires, rubies, emeralds and diamonds.' And despite his own desire to unwind and relax, even Tomer takes time away from the jet-ski and presidential suite to make a quick '209k profit'. The online trader's Instagram account is packed with huge piles of cash in different currencies and screenshots of his enormously lucrative trades. Following a post of Tomer asleep on a bed of money is a which suggests he made a staggering €209,000 in a single day. He told MailOnline: 'Money never sleeps and too much is never enough. I admit that I work a lot. I don't like being lazy. I'm very motivated and always wish to grow more and expend.' Same is the case for globe-trotting Marcus who told MailOnline: 'I wouldn't exactly say that life is just one big holiday because while I travel I'm not just sitting there and relaxing I'm always networking or doing meetings!' Quick round: 26-year-old Andreas Arnhoff spends his time in the United States at the glorious Miami Beach Golf Club with his friends . Soaking it in: Lana Scolaro (pictured), prefers to spend her time working on her tan on a west-Hollywood rooftop in Los Angeles . Getting dirty: Go-karting is a no-go for native New-Yorker Marcus W.A. who enjoys a spot of dirt racing in sunny Costa Rica . Big money: Self-made Israeli businessman Tomer Sror can't bare to leave the office at home and manages to make a quick few hundred thousand while on vacation . Stunning: The Scolaro sisters Lana (left) and Stephanie (right) still manage to fit in a bike ride on Venice Beach in between their many meetings . Despite the extreme levels of wealth he flaunts on his social media site, the 18-year-old insists he is not out to make people jealous or infuriate the so-called 'haters' - but to inspire people to reach higher. He said: 'To me I think anyone who takes Instagram that serious is just being silly. My followers like luxury content and inspiration to do better and when I can give that content its great. 'I hope that all my followers are happy with the content I bring to them and with every like and every comment I am motivated to keep it up. In addition, keep in mind there are certainly people out there who are crazier than me and spend much, much more and whenever I look at their pages I don't get mad. Norwegian real-estate developer Andreas once joked that he preferred his Porsche Cayenne Turbo over his exquisite Rolls Royce 'for the comfort'. He previously ran the marketing department in the family business and used his savings - and a little borrowed cash from the family - to buy his apartment in Oslo, Norway. He has been spending his Spring Break relaxing on his yacht in Miami harbour, enjoying Florida's beautiful open golf courses and road-tripping across Europe in his pristine Porsche. Mile high: Marcus even relaxes in style wearing his vintage Ray Bans and expensive time piece in the back of a £2million personal jet . Chilling: Andreas' choice of hang-out spot after a yacht ride and a round of golf in Miami isn't too shabby either, as he stretches his legs in the Marquis residence in Miami where apartments cost up to £3.2million . Sunset cocktail: What better way to relax and watch the sunset after a busy day of business meetings in Malibu than dinner at the exclusive Nobu restaurant rooftop . Cheers: And Tomer who says he is 'unlike the other kids' because he 'had to work for the money' says there is nothing better than using your vacation to kick back and relax .","Rich Kids of Instagram have been spending Spring in the most glamorous hotels in Monaco, New York and Rhodes .

"The largest single high-definition map of mysterious dark matter has been produced. It is the first in a series of  maps of the cosmos that will eventually allow a 3D view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky. And the map should allow astronomers to study how galaxies formed in the universe. University of Manchester researchers have revealed an HD dark matter map (shown). It shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4 per cent of the sky. The goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years. Red here shows more dark matter, and blue shows less. The moon is shown top left for scale . A team from the University of Manchester, led by Dr Sarah Bridle, has spent the past two years measuring the shapes of galaxies used to construct the map. And the map was released today at the April meeting of the American Physical Society in Baltimore, Maryland. It was created using data captured by the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel imaging device that is the primary instrument for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) led by Fermilab in the US. The survey uses the 13ft (four metres) Victor M. Blanco Telescope located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. And the project is run overall as part of the five-year Dark Energy Survey (DES), and is the largest map of this detail. Of course, we can’t actually directly observe dark matter yet - so the survey instead looks for its noticeable effect on galaxies. Studying this enables the predicted amounts of dark matter in a given area to be mapped, based on its gravitational effects. ‘Dark matter could equally be called “transparent matter”, because we see things behind it that gets distorted by gravity,’ Dr Bridle told MailOnline. In the map she explained we’re seeing about 150 times the area of the full moon, which is about 0.4 per cent of the whole sky. The goal of the DES is to map 12.5 per cent of the entire sky, creating a 3D map of dark matter - and dark energy. ‘It is amazing to see a map of the dark matter over such a large region of the sky, and the full Dark Energy Survey mass map will be more than 30 times bigger still,’ Dr Bridle said in a separate statement. 'Analysis of the clumpiness of the dark matter in the maps will also allow us to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy, believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up.' This mosaic image shows the different telescope shots that were combined to make the dark matter map. The survey has just completed its second year. As scientists expand their search they’ll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter . The survey has just completed its second year. As scientists expand their search, they’ll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter. Those theories suggest that, since there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible matter, galaxies will form where there are large concentrations of dark matter (and hence stronger gravity) present. So far, the DES analysis backs this up. The maps show large filaments of matter along which visible galaxies and galaxy clusters lie and cosmic voids where very few galaxies reside. Follow-up studies of some of the enormous filaments and voids, and the enormous volume of data, collected throughout the survey will reveal more about this interplay of mass and light. These maps show how the amount of dark matter corresponds to the formation rate of galaxies. On the left, galaxies can be seen near dark matter clumps (in red), and further away from sparse regions (blue). The image on the right shows some of the regions of sky that were studied . The team at Manchester analysed 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies to make the map. The process of measuring the galaxies is so complex and time consuming that some of the world's largest supercomputers are needed to do it. Each time a new catalogue is made it takes about as much computing power as running 500 ordinary desktop computers for two weeks. 'We have to measure the shape of each galaxy - how distorted it is - with extremely high precision, about one part in 1000,' said Dr Joe Zuntz, also of the University of Manchester, who has been making the measurements. The survey uses the 13ft (four metres) Victor M. Blanco Telescope (middle) located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile, outfitted with a newly designed, state-of-the-art Dark Energy Camera (DECam). It will be completed by 2018, mapping dark matter of an eighth of the sky in the process . Dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up 85 per cent of all matter in the universe, is invisible to even the most sensitive astronomical instruments because it does not emit or block light. But its effects can be seen using a technique called gravitational lensing - studying the distortion that occurs when the gravitational pull of dark matter bends light around distant galaxies. Understanding how the clumpiness of dark matter changes with time will reveal the nature of the enigmatic dark energy, which is the ultimate goal of the survey. The dark matter map released makes use of early DES observations and covers only about three percent of the area of sky DES will document over its five-year mission.","University of Manchester researchers reveal HD dark matter map .

"For most of the country, spring is already in full force. But chilly temperatures in the northeast have kept snow on the ground well into April. One family on New York's Long Island were even able to keep a snowman alive until this weekend, when their Frosty finally melted in 70-degree temperatures. But before the snowman withered away, he became somewhat of an internet celebrity, with more than 3,000 people liking the page the family dedicated to their carrot-nosed friend on Facebook. Scroll down for video . Until next year! A family on New York's Long Island tried to keep this snowman alive for as long as possible, but the Frosty melted this weekend when 70-degree temperatures hit the area . Remnants: The Fregoe family took a small ball of ice from the snowman to store in the freezer until next winter, when he will come to life again . Mike Fregoe of Massapequa Park says he and his family built the snowman in January, when it grew to be more than 9-feet tall. Since then, the snowman's height has fluctuated as late winter storms have continued to dump snow even into March. He says he has kept the snowman alive with his teen daughter Rebecca. 'It started out as a small project for fun, and it's morphed into the ongoing snow saga, and it's a great thing that makes everybody smile and happy, and we're having fun with it still,' Mr Fregoe told CBS New York last week. Keeping winter alive: Mike Fregoe went to a local park every day to collect melting snow by the bucket-full to add to his snowman . Last ditch effort: Mr Fregoe pictured adding to the snowman last week, when the weather was so warm he was wearing a tank top . But since the beginning of April, the snowman began shrinking and the family started a Facebook page asking for 'snownations' to keep their beloved  Frosty alive. 'I won’t take snow from an ice skating rink or any artificial snow,' Mr Fregoe said. 'The only way this guy is going to stay alive is with the snow from this winter.' Mr Fregoe says he's received snow from people visiting the snowman from as far away as Vermont, as well as closer communities like the Hamptons. The Fregoes also did a lot of the work themselves, taking daily trips to the park to shovel melting snow by the bucket load. Ups and downs: Above, pictures of the Fregoe's snowman this winter, when he climbed to 9-feet tall after a late January snow storm . In his natural environment: The snowman pictured above on March 20, in the midst of a spring snowstorm . Getting a tan: Frosty sports a hat for St Patrick's day on the left, and is shielded from the sun on the right with an umbrella . To protect the snowman from melting faster, they also shaded him with an umbrella and comically added a bottle of suntan lotion to one of his twig arms. Last week, when Mr Fregoe spoke with CBS, temperatures had risen so much that he was shoveling snow in a tank top. The family finally gave up on Frosty on Sunday, after the snowman weathered 70-degree temperatures the day before. The announced the end of the snowman's relatively long life on Facebook. 'We have so much enjoyed meeting all you wonderful people that stopped by, called, e-mailed or posted on Facebook to us! We are honored to have become part of your lives, heard your stories...even invited you into our home. I never could have imagined the Save the Snowman idea becoming all that it has become. It has been one great ride...thank you all so very much! ...and don't be shy...say hi when u go by, we don't need a snowman to remind us that a smile and a wave goes a long way!' The family is currently storing a small ball of ice in their freezer to start a new snowman next winter.","The Fregoe family of Massapequa Park, New York built their own Frosty in January .

"Gwyneth Paltrow has vowed to live on just $29 worth of food for a week, after agreeing to take on a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness and funds for New York's food banks. The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans. 'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image.

Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him  by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don’t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of 7,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life. I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef Mario Batali, who is a member of the Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face. 'Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,' the food bank's fundraising page explains. 'New Yorkers can't afford any cuts to Food Stamps…The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.' It is not known whether Gywneth's two children with ex-husband Chris Martin, Apple, ten, and Moses, nine, will also be taking part in the challenge however, given the limited supply of food featured in her Twitter picture, it is thought the Shakespeare in Love star is going it alone this time around.","The 42-year-old mother-of-two tweeted a picture of her $29 grocery shop, which included eggs, vegetables, brown rice and black beans .

"A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner. Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs – a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky’s ear as if whispering something – Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky’s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl, which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo. The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder. The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up. No encore? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying: ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.’ And the three dogs, rather put out about being interrupted, stopping and turning to look at him in surprise.","The dogs called Sky, Sadie and Marshall each stand in the front room .

"A Los Angeles-bound flight has returned to Seattle after it was discovered a worker had fallen asleep in the cargo hold before take-off. Fourteen minutes after Alaska Airlines flight 448 took off on Monday, the pilot and passengers in first class heard screaming and banging from beneath the aircraft. 'Help! Help! Help!' the man screamed, according to one passenger. The airline said in a news release the captain immediately returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and declared an emergency for priority landing. The cargo hold where the handler was trapped is temperature controlled and pressurized, so he was not in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen. Scroll down for video . This is the moment an Alaska Airlines baggage handler was pulled from the cargo hold after falling asleep .

'At some point the marshal kind of made himself known and started banging back and he yelled really loud and said, ""We're getting ready to land, hold on to something,""' Troi Ge, a passenger on board the flight, told NBC News. Mr Ge, a sound designer from Burbank, recorded video aboard the plane in which passengers could hear the banging from the cargo hold. After the plane landed a ramp agent was found inside the front cargo hold. Video taken by KIRO 7 showed the worker calmly walking out of the cargo hold and putting on a high visibility jacket. He stood talking to airport staff for a few seconds before walking off towards the terminal. 'Upon exiting, he told authorities he had fallen asleep,' the airline said.

"Britain is on course to be the second fastest growing major economy in the world, in a major boost for George Osborne who said it was 'proof our economic plan is working'. The International Monetary Fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016, beaten only by the United States. It comes as the Tories were buoyed by the news that inflation remains at zero per cent, with food and fuel prices down sharply year on year. Britain is on course to be the second fastest growing major economy in the world, in a major boost for George Osborne. The International Monetary Fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016, beaten only by the United States . Low oil prices are expected to help bolster steady growth in the UK. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF predicted world growth of 3.5 per cent this year, unchanged from its previous projection in January. Its forecast for UK growth this year remains at 2.7 per cent though for next year it is cut from 2.4 per cent to 2.3 per cent. It said: 'In the United Kingdom, lower oil prices and improved financial market conditions are expected to support continued steady growth.' Chancellor George Osborne told MailOnline: 'These IMF growth forecasts for the UK are further proof our economic plan is working. 'But this growth, and the jobs and security it brings, would all be put at risk with the chaos of an Ed Miliband/Scottish Nationalist government. 'So we must keep on working through our economic plan and finish the job. 'This is the only way to deliver an economy that offers working people security at every stage of their lives.' David Cameron today warned that growth in the UK could be put at risk if the Tories are not returned to power. He urged voters to 'see this plan through and Britain will keep exporting, growing, job-creating, and yes – we'll be back in the black but only if Conservatives are back in Government'. He added: 'The next five years are much, much more important than the past five. Because having rescued our economy and set Britain back on her feet, now is our chance to truly finish the job, to make this a country where those who work hard and do the right thing can enjoy a good life.' David Cameron today warned that growth in the UK could be put at risk if the Tories are not returned to power . The IMF said global expansion this year 'will be driven by a rebound in advanced economies supported by the decline in oil prices'. But global prospects were 'uneven' with growth slipping back in emerging economies. There would be weaker activity for some major oil exporters, with the Russian economy - also hit by tensions over Ukraine - expected to shrink by 3.8 per cent this year, worse than the previously estimated 3 per cent. The IMF said that while risks to global growth 'are now more balanced' than six months ago, they 'remain tilted to the downside'. These included the danger of low inflation in countries saddled by high debt, with the warning coming on the same day that official figures showed inflation falling to minus 0.01 per cent in the UK. Inflation remained at a record low of zero per cent for the second consecutive month, official figures revealed this morning . Inflation remained at a record low of zero per cent for the second consecutive month, official figures revealed this morning. It means that in the 12 months to March family living costs have not risen at all – while at the same time people's pay jumped by 1.8 per cent. Prices are being held down by the falling cost of food, fuel and women's clothes, the office for national statistics said this morning. Petrol prices fell by 13.7 per cent over the year to March, but saw a slight increase between February and March. The average petrol price rose by 3.8p per litre between February and March. The biggest price falls came from clothing and footwear which fell by 0.1 per cent between February and March. This is the first time that prices have fallen between February and March since month-on-month inflation was first measured. Normally prices rise as they recover following the January sales period. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said: 'A number of complex forces are shaping the prospects around the world. 'Legacies of both the financial and euro area crises - weak banks and high levels of public, corporate, and household debt - are still weighing on spending and growth in some countries.' The outlook for the US this year has been slashed by 0.5 per cent to 3.1 per cent while for the eurozone it has been upgraded from 1.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent, helped by low oil prices and a weaker single currency amid a 1.1 trillion euro (£790 billion) stimulus programme. The IMF still said conditions were ripe for 'robust US economic performance in 2015' but pointed to risks such as the strong dollar hitting exports and the low oil price suppressing investment in that sector. It said macroeconomic risks to global growth, such as a recession in the eurozone, had slightly decreased, but that financial and geopolitical risks had increased. The latter included below-target inflation in countries with high debt and low growth since the financial crisis, with little room to provide more monetary stimulus. The report said: 'Stagnation and low inflation in advanced economies, notwithstanding the recent upgrade to the near-term growth forecasts for some of these economies, could hamper the recovery.' It said prospects for some economies were 'clouded' by ageing populations, weak investment and lacklustre productivity growth as well as high debt both among governments and in the private sector. The report added: 'Inflation and inflation expectations in most advanced economies are below target and are in some cases still declining - a particular concern for countries with crisis legacies of high debt and low growth, and little or no room to ease monetary policy.' Financial risks could also include a further surge in the US dollar and strong market reactions as 'accommodative' monetary policies supporting recovery - such as low interest rates and money printing - start to be withdrawn. Geopolitical risks included tensions 'stemming from ongoing events in Ukraine, the Middle East and West Africa' which 'could generate regional and global spillover'.","International Monetary Fund says UK economy will grow by 2.7% this year .

"Sharmeena: The teenager flew in secret to Syria . The jihadi bride who persuaded three friends to follow her to Syria was brought up in a strict Muslim household which turned to Islamic State apologists Cage when she disappeared, it emerged yesterday. Sharmeena Begum, 15, was raised by her uncle Shamim Miah, a devout Muslim and former religious scholar. He encouraged her to pray each dawn before classes at Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets. He blames the airport authorities, police and her school for letting Sharmeena flee the country last December, flying from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing the border to Syria. Controversially, he has turned for advice to Cage, the hardline human rights group whose leaders have said IS executioner Jihadi John is a ‘beautiful young man’. In an exclusive interview this week, Mr Miah, 38, sat at the kitchen table of his terraced house, a few minutes’ walk from the academy in East London. It is where Sharmeena lived with him, her mother Shahnaz – until her death from cancer aged 33 last year – and her grandmother, Jahanara, 66. Close to tears, he disclosed how his niece used £1,000 to go to Syria, money given by relatives after her mother’s death as a traditional gift in Bangladeshi families to show respect for the deceased. ‘At first her Nan – my mother –kept the money safe. Then Sharmeena asked to open her own bank account and she gave the cash to her,’ said Mr Miah. ‘She also pressed to keep her passport in her bedroom and we allowed that too. If her mother had not died, she would never have had money to go.’ Mr Miah was born in Bangladesh and came to this country as a boy with his parents. He studied Islam before becoming a takeaway restaurant owner and now works nights at a supermarket. ‘I have known Sharmeena since she was born,’ he said. ‘She grew up in my house with her mother Shahnaz, my sister.’ Shamima Begum's family at Scotland Yard's headquarters, London, pictured with Abase Hussen, father of Amira Abase . Lured to jihad: Kadiza Sultana, 16, left, Shamima Begum, 15, centre, and Amira Abase, 15, right, at Gatwick . He explained that Sharmeena’s father, Mohammad Uddin, had not often lived at the house because his work took him away so often. Mr Uddin, 39, a waiter, has remarried and lives with his new wife in a block of flats in Bethnal Green. Mr Miah has been interviewed by police about his missing niece and the disappearance of her three classmates: Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, earlier this year. It is thought that Sharmeena was the ringleader, inspiring the other three to follow her to Syria. It has emerged that a fifth girl from the academy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also plotted to become a jihadi bride. She boarded a plane for Syria from Heathrow on the same Saturday which Sharmeena flew from Gatwick. This girl’s parents alerted police, the jet was stopped on the runway and she was removed. It has also emerged that Amira’s father Hussen Abase is an Islamic militant who marched at the front of a rally led by hate preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of soldier Lee Rigby. Like Mr Miah, Mr Abase is receiving advice from Cage. But her uncle denies his devotion to Islam influenced Sharmeena. He has already been asked by police if she was radicalised at home. ‘The loss of her mum turned my niece’s life upside down despite our Islamic belief that earthly life means nothing,’ he said. ‘It is the hereafter that we prepare for. She turned to religion after her death.’ He feels let down by police and the school, alleging that neither care about Sharmeena ‘because she is a Muslim girl’. Mr Miah added: ‘You tell the police everything you know but they seem to do nothing to get Sharmeena back. I am really scared of what they might do to me if I am blamed for her going to Syria.’ He is also worried for Sharmeena if she does return to the UK. ‘I believe she will be prosecuted. I don’t think she will ever be allowed to return to our home. The police will want information from her about the Islamic State and life will never be normal for her again.’ Reliving the morning his niece disappeared, Mr Miah told how the teenager said her prayers at 5am as usual. ‘The early prayers are what we do every day in our Muslim religion,’ he explained solemnly. Sharmeena then came downstairs and told her grandmother that she had extra classes at school. ‘She left at about nine in Western clothes, leaving her Asian ones. We do not know whether she took a taxi, bus or train to the airport. Or if she was picked up by a car. I came back from the night shift at ten but I was not alarmed.’ Flight to terror: Clutching their luggage, the three teenage friends prepare to board a flight to Istanbul . But by midday, the family was worried. They rang Sharmeena’s mobile but had no answer. At 5pm, it was offering to take messages in Turkish. ‘We realised she was abroad and I rang the local police, who said she was a missing girl who would come home,’ said Mr Miah. He found a UK number on Sharmeena’s phone records which she had rung constantly, including the morning she disappeared. When he called it, a woman’s voice said: ‘Who is Sharmeena? I don’t know a Sharmeena’ and put the phone down. Mr Miah now suspects the woman was an IS recruiter based in London. ‘In my faith, we believe in an eye for an eye, a life for a life, and I would like to kill the person who persuaded her to go away,’ he said. ‘I also feel let down by the authorities, who allowed Sharmeena out to Syria and then three of her friends, all from the same school.’ When Sharmeena went missing, he alerted her father and told him he must go to the academy and warn teachers what might happen to other girls. Mr Uddin did but said staff did not listen to him. Mr Miah went a day later and saw a senior teacher. ‘I said parents should be warned their daughters might go to Syria. I offered to speak to them myself but I have not been invited.’ Frustrated, Mr Miah turned to officials at Cage, who told him Sharmeena went to Syria ‘to get married’ or ‘for radicalisation’ by IS. He feels it is the only organisation listening to him or which might help get her back. However, some of his family blame him for her disappearance, added Mr Miah. ‘We knew nothing about her plan. I am in shock. Her grandmother is so upset. ‘We think only of Sharmeena and worry if she has enough food to eat in Syria. We feel hopeless.’ A Labour councillor’s son seized attempting to cross into war-torn Syria with four children had been targeted by the Government’s anti-extremism Prevent strategy, sources said last night. As counter-terrorism police last night searched the home of Shakil Ahmed – recently pictured with Ed Miliband – and Turkish authorities prepared to deport the group of nine, questions were asked over whether signs of 21-year-old Waheed’s apparent radicalisation had been missed. The politics student’s father, 45, was in hiding yesterday as officers combed the family home in Rochdale, examining a car parked outside and removing several items. The adults in Turkey were named as Waheed’s maternal aunt, Zareeda Bi, 47, her sons Mahboob Yasin, 22, and Habib Yasin, 24, along with Habib’s wife, Samia Bi, 22. On radar: Counter-terrorism police searched the home of Shakil Ahmed, pictured here with Ed Miliband, as it is revealed his son Waheed Ahmed (right) was targeted by the Government's anti-extremism Prevent strategy . Sources claimed Waheed had been monitored by the Government’s Prevent strategy, which aims to stop extremists resorting to acts of terrorism but has been slammed as a ‘toxic’ brand which further alienates disaffected young Muslims. Friends said they had not noticed a change in Waheed’s behaviour. Raided: Police searched councillor Shakil Ahmed's home after his son was seized trying to cross to war-torn Syria . Bassat Yousaf, 21, who has known Waheed since they were at primary school, said: ‘He’s really a quiet guy. Seeing him on the news came as a shock for me. He didn’t seem that kind of person. ‘We used to talk about Palestine and Syria and he sometimes collected charity money. I used to see him collecting a lot of charity money for people whose homes have been blown up.’ The nine were seized as they tried to cross into Syria on Wednesday, but Waheed’s father said he had believed his son was on ‘a work placement in Birmingham’. The Home Office declined to comment on reports of Waheed’s involvement with its Prevent strategy, which last year resulted in 77 reports from worried families to anti-terror police. Police refused to say if the adults would be arrested on their return to the UK.","Sharmeena Begum was raised by uncle who was former religious scholar .

"The co-authors of Pete Evans' controversial infant cookbook have spoken out  in defence of the chef's decision to independently release the book despite being dumped by publishers. Speaking on The Morning Show, co-authors of 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way', Charlotte Carr and Helen Padarin said they are 'confident' about the changes they have made to the book since it was branded with major health warnings. The cookbook, which was supposed to be released last Month was delayed before being cancelled completely by Pan Macmillan over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth. Scroll down for video . Pete Evans' (pictured) book was dumped by publishers Pan Macmillan after it was revealed that one of the recipes included the ingredients liver and bone broth . We don't want confusion. 'We've taken all of the [health] information on board and applied it to the book' said Carr on the popular morning show. 'We're very confident that this is a very safe, gentle, beautiful book for children,' she said. 'We're really confident that the information we've got in the book is very good information,' Padarin added. 'It is a recipe book, it's not a way of treatment or medicine. If people have issues then yes, of course they should be seeing a practitioner about it.' The pair did address the controversial 'Happy Tummy Brew' recipe which attracted criticism for it's  ingredients, claiming they have added more vitamin C to the formula. The recipe is based on a formula by a US health company called Weston A Price. The Paelo Way co-authors Charlotte Carr (centre) and Helen Padarin (right) have spoken out in defence of Pete Evan's (left) decision to release the book independently . Pete Evans is famously known for his role as a judge on My Kitchen Rules alongside Manu Fieldel (left) 'We had just taken the recipe and put it in [the book] and it needed more details,'  Carr said. 'Happy Tummy Brew','It was called a formula and by definition it's not a formula - it's a drink - so we've changed [the name] and made it really clear about when it should be implemented in the child's diet so it's really safe.' Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the Public Health Association of Australia said there was a 'very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead'. However, the book is reportedly set for release online amidst the controversy. Australian Women's Weekly recently reported that Naturopath Helen Padarin had been slammed by the Health Care Complaints Commission with sources saying she breached their codes of conduct. Pete Evans has been dropped as the celebrity ambassador for popular salad chain 'Sumo Salad' She reportedly provided incorrect information over the nutritional comparisons between breast milk and baby formula made of liver and bone broth - a recipe in Bubba Yum Yum. Blogger and co-author, Charlotte Carr has also received negative headlines after it was revealed that she has been doing voice-overs for fast-food chains KFC, Coca-Cola and Cadbury's whilst promoting a paleo lifestyle. In March, chef Pete Evans declared that he was forging ahead with his plans to release the book independently after being sensationally dumped by his publisher. 'Charlotte, Helen and I are thrilled to announce that 'Bubba Yum Yum The Paleo Way' will be a proudly independent digital worldwide release in April with print to follow,' Evans' Facebook post read at the time. Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way is set to be self-published at the end of this month as a digital book . 'We didn't want to wait, too many people are wanting this beautiful treasure trove of nutritional recipes and we are extremely thankful to all our followers and colleagues for their support. 'A huge thank goes out to all the media for helping raise awareness about this over the last week, we hope you continue to do more of the same.' Pan Macmillan also distanced themselves from the TV chef's baby book, posting a statement to their website to say they would not be publishing the book in any format. Sumo Salad maintains that their decision was not due to Evans' paleo controversies . 'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' a statement from the publisher read. The celebrity chef lost another profitable deal at the start of April after being dropped as an ambassador by the national salad chain, Sumo Salad. The food chain strongly denied that the move was related to Evans' recent paleo controversies, and maintained that the decision to not renew his two-year contract was made a long time ago. The head of marketing for Sumo Salad, Petra Orrenius told news.com.au  they had a positive collaboration with Pete Evans but had been with him for too long. They have decided to take their marketing in a different direction and this does not include Evans. 'I think often when you're trying to make a difference you have to be a bit radical and stand out. We've always been very supportive of Pete and we're happy with that,' Orrenius said.

"George Osborne was challenged 18 times yesterday to explain where the next Tory government would find the extra £8billion it has promised the NHS. During tense exchanges with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, the Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions about exactly how the massive cash boost would be paid for. Mr Osborne said it would come from the Conservatives’ ‘balanced plan’ for the economy, but declined to go into further detail. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne and Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman, appearing on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show . In one exchange, Mr Marr said: ‘You’ve just found an extra £8billion. All I’m asking is where does it come from? No higher taxes, extra public spending cuts? Where?’ Mr Osborne replied: 'Well it’s part of our balanced plan. And if you look over the last five years …’ But Mr Marr interjected: ‘That’s not really an answer, Chancellor.’ Harriet Harman was left squirming yesterday after ‘posh’ George Osborne revealed on the Andrew Marr show that they had attended the same £21,000-a-year private school. She went to St Paul’s Girls’ school in West London while Mr Osborne attended the boys’ school. During tense exchanges with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, the Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions about exactly how the massive cash boost would be paid for . Mr Osborne insisted, however, that the Conservatives had shown in government that they were able to make the savings necessary to deliver additional funding for the NHS. Migrants will have to pay in more than £20,000 in taxes before they receive access to the benefits system under Tory plans. Home Secretary Theresa May said the new rules would end welfare tourism and make the UK less attractive to Eastern European migrants. New arrivals will be banned from claiming benefits until they have paid into the system for four years. The plan to ensure that they have to pay £22,600 in tax and national insurance before they can claim a penny will be part of the Tory manifesto. European job hunters would be denied unemployment benefits and forced to leave within six months if they do not find work. Those who get a job would be denied in-work benefits, including council housing, for four years. They will also be refused child benefit for offspring living anywhere else in Europe. ‘We have a balanced plan to grow our economy, to make savings in government including in welfare to fund our NHS each and every year,’ he said. ‘We have to make similar savings each year that we have made for five years of this parliament but for two years. ‘We have a track record in this parliament where we found almost £8billion extra in real terms for the National Health Service in very, very difficult economic circumstances so we have proved our mettle, we have proved our ability to stand behind the National Health Service in this parliament. We can do it in the next.’ Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, who also appeared on the programme, said the promise was ‘illusory’ and that Tory spending plans represented a ‘real threat’ to the health service. ‘The reality is that the spending programme that they have put forward is a threat to cut the NHS,’ she said. ‘People know that they find it harder to see their GP since the Tories came into government, they know that they wait longer in accident and emergency and that waiting lists are starting to grow.’","During exchanges with  Marr, Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions .

"Pensioner David Atherton was shocked to find a three-foot snake slithering inside his oven when he innocently went to cook his pie and chips. The 65-year old from Halliwell, Bolton was just about to put his meal in the cooker when he caught sight of the black and white California king hiding inside. Atherton scooped up the reptile and placed it in a plastic food recycling box before alerting the police. Shocked: David Atherton, 65, went to put his meal in the oven when he discovered a three-foot California king snake (pictured) hiding inside . RSPCA officers came to collect the snake the same evening and it has been given a temporary home with a local conservationist since. Atherton's 73-year-old sister Margaret - who has a phobia of snakes - became severely distressed when she heard about the incident and needed to go to hospital with heart problems. He said: 'Her phobia is so bad she cannot even look at a snake on TV, let alone see one in real life. 'I would not like to hazard a guess as to what would have happened if she had been the one to open the oven and see it. It could have been much worse.' He added: 'When I pulled down the oven door I saw the snake hanging down from the side and and at first I thought it was part of a food packet, but then I realised what it was. 'There is a small gap between the oven and the fitted cupboards, which must be what it came through. 'You could not make it up and I must confess it is not something that happens every day.' Experts said the banded California king snakes can grow up to 6ft in length and were commonly kept as pets. Slither: Atherton - whose sister has an extreme phobia of snakes - scooped up the reptile and placed it inside a plastic food recycling box (pictured) RSPCA inspector Melissa Furey said it is common to see an influx of snakes coming out in April as the weather gets warmer. She added: 'It is the time of year when they come out basking in the sun - this is the second escaped snake in just over a week which has made an appearance in Greater Manchester. 'Pet owners need to be responsible and make sure they have the correct equipment - vivariums with locks - because snakes are really good escape artists and can slip through the smallest of gaps.'","65-year-old David Atherton shocked to discover the black and white reptile .

"Marion 'Suge' Knight has been rushed to hospital for an unspecified medical emergency after a judge ruled on Thursday that he will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges. The former rap music mogul struck two men with his pickup truck in January, killing one and seriously injuring the other. Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida says Knight was transported to a hospital from the downtown courthouse. She says no further details could be released. Scroll down for video . 'Suge' Knight, pictured above on April 8, will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges following a hit-and-run, an LA judge said on Thursday . The parents of Suge Knight (pictured left) and his girlfriend (right) comfort each other outside the Los Angeles courthouse after learning on Thursday that he will stand trial for murder . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen made the ruling on Thursday after concluding a hearing that focused heavily on testimony from Cle 'Bone' Sloan, who was hit outside a Compton burger stand in Los Angeles county. The judge also reduced bail from $25 million to $10 million. On Thursday morning, Knight walked out of court after the hearing. A message sent to Knight’s attorney Matt Fletcher wasn’t immediately returned. Sloan told detectives that he attacked Knight but testified on Monday that he didn't remember the fight and did not want to be a 'snitch'. Prosecutors played Sloan's statement to police, which offered a lucid, detailed account of the events on January 29 that led up to the deadly encounter. Authorities contend Knight intentionally hit the men, killing Terry Carter, 55. Suge Knight's parents seen leaving the courthouse in Los Angeles on Thursday after a judge ruled that their son will stand trial for murder and attempted murder . Victim Terry Carter's eldest daughter seen leaving court with attorney Carl Douglas after the announcement that Marion Suge Knight will stand trial for murder and attempted murder on Thursday . Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, said his client was ambushed and was trying to escape Sloan's attack when he ran over the men. Sloan's testimony demonstrated the difficulty in prosecuting Knight, who has gang ties and a reputation for intimidating witnesses. 'I will not be used to send Suge Knight to prison,' Sloan testified, adding that he was only on the stand because he was subpoenaed. Prosecutors granted Sloan, a former gang member who's known Knight for decades, limited immunity after he said he intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. Knight, 49, was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists. Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy. Sloan, an adviser on the upcoming film 'Straight Outta Compton,' said he was trying to forget details of the crash, in which he suffered two fractured ankles, a serious cut to his head, two torn knee ligaments and a shoulder injury. 'Every day, I try to forget it,' Sloan said. 'I just know, I screwed up, and Terry's dead.' Sloan's memory troubles prompted the judge to comment on his testimony: 'I find that this witness is being deceptive.' The judge also heard from the lead detective investigating the case and watched security camera footage of the crash. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs -  at one hearing in March, a medical condition sent him to the hospital . The camera caught a limited view of the parking lot but shows Knight struggling with Sloan through the window of his truck before putting the vehicle in reverse, striking Sloan, then hitting him again and running over Carter while fleeing the scene. Fletcher, Knight's attorney, pressed Sloan on his feelings toward Knight and whether he was 'enraged' at him on the day of the crash. Sloan said he was mad but disputed that he told detectives he was enraged. Fletcher also painted Sloan as the aggressor, saying Knight 'hadn't attacked you in any form, fashion or manner. You agree?' 'Yes,' Sloan said. Knight faces up to life in prison if convicted in the case. He has prior felony convictions for armed robbery and assault with a gun. Knight pleaded no contest in 1995 and was sentenced to five years' probation in an assault on two rap entertainers at a Hollywood recording studio in 1992. The rap figure was sentenced to prison in February 1997 for violating terms of that probation by taking part in a fight at a Las Vegas hotel hours before Shakur was fatally wounded in a drive-by attack as he rode in Knight's car near the Strip. Shakur's slaying remains unsolved. Prosecutors only had to present a fraction of their evidence against Knight during the preliminary hearing that began on Monday. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs - he fired one set of attorneys during a hearing and medical conditions sent him to the hospital four times from courthouse appearances. He complained earlier this month when deputies brought him into court handcuffed to a wheelchair and has detailed health woes, including weight loss and blindness in one eye, when he's been allowed to speak in court.

"Sunshine smile: Judy Murray waves to the crowds . Her youngest son has only just tied the knot with his long-term partner Kim Sears. But Judy Murray has already wasted no time in revealing she simply ‘can’t wait to be a granny’. However, the tennis coach, who helped propel Andy, 27, and his brother, Jamie, 29, to sporting success, has a couple of caveats – he has to get the French Open and Wimbledon out of the way first. Mrs Murray, 55, who has carved out her own star status after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing last year, also said she would be a ‘very active granny’ and in the same way she coached her sons, she already has plans to introduce her grandchildren to tennis. She told Closer magazine: ‘I’m really looking forward to being a granny. I’ve always wanted to have grandchildren but I had to be patient and let them get married first. ‘I’m not sure when they will have kids as Andy has the French Open followed by Wimbledon, but I know he wants them. I will be a very active granny, that’s for sure – and I can’t wait to introduce them to tennis.’ Her words come only a few days after her son and his bride wed at Dunblane Cathedral on Saturday, drawing more than 3,000 well-wishers to the streets of his home town. Writing in the guest book of Cromlix House Hotel – a property Murray purchased in 2013 for £1.8million and where his brother got married – the happy couple thanked staff for their hard work around the top-secret event and signed as ‘Andy & Kimberly Murray’.

Gemma Greer, manager at the Dunblane Centre, said: ‘Judy came in and said she was bringing round some of the flowers to the community. ‘They are centrepieces from the tables at Cromlix and they are beautiful.’","Andy Murray and Kim Sears married at Dumblane Cathedral on Saturday .

'I feel it's important that this boat is remembered as more than just a modern recreation, that it represents the historical boat as well,' said Adam Hodges-LeClaire, a U.S. citizen, history student and one of the 80-strong crew aboard the 1.2 tonne warship. Hodges-LeClaire had made his own period costume to wear during the voyage. The frigate is due to arrive in Yorktown on June 5 for a two-month tour of key locations in the American Revolution, including Annapolis, Boston, Philadelphia and New York City. A number of smaller boards surround the replica near Fouras, southwest France . French President Francois Hollande (right) and the captain of the Hermione, Yann Cariou attend the ceremony of departure of the frigate 'L'Hermione'. The French helped the Red Coats during the War of Independence . Hollande took a short trip on the boat before it left on it's voyage across the Atlantic . To the American independence movement of the time, Lafayette - whose full name was Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert de Motier de Lafayette - was 'our Marquis'. Although an aristocrat who persuaded King Louis XVI into sending military help to Washington's men, Lafayette also maintained a civic role after the king and much of the French nobility had been executed in France's own revolution, which began in 1789, less than a decade after his voyage. The two countries sealed their friendship almost a century after Lafayette's voyage with the 1876 inauguration of the Statue of Liberty at the entrance to New York harbour, a gift from the French people to commemorate the centenary of the declaration of independence. Since then, Franco-U.S. military and diplomatic relations have ebbed and flowed, hitting a recent low point when France opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. More recently, France resisted, then gave in to pressure from the United States, its NATO ally, to delay the delivery of a helicopter-carrying warship to Russia due to the Ukraine crisis. Fireworks crackle around the replica of the frigate Hermione, used to bring French troops and funds to American revolutionaries in 1780 .

"As healer Mangu Ram rests with a threadbare blanket over his creaking knees, the 82-year-old looks to the future. It is almost 70 years since he fled the violence that followed the partition of India, and he is still regarded as a second class citizen in Indian Kashmir – unable to own property or vote in state elections. But now Ram and thousands like him are daring to hope they will finally be able to shed the refugee status that has plagued them for decades, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party won a share of power in India's only Muslim-majority state. Mangu Ram was 14 when he fled to Kashmir as a refugee - now an old man, for the past 70 years he has been denied citizenship rights . A Hindu, traditional healer Ram lives a slum house within India's only Muslim-majority state. Its rulers have refused to give the West Pakistan Refugees (WPRs) the right to own property or vote in state elections - meaning three generations are caught in abject poverty . ‘If something can be done, then maybe I will finally have some enjoyment in this life,’ the traditional healer said from his slum home on the outskirts of Jammu, Kashmir's winter capital. ‘If only the gods could show us some mercy.’ Ram, a Hindu, was born in an area of Punjab province, part of modern-day Pakistan but within India’s boundaries before the country became independent in 1947. Hundreds of thousands of families fled across both sides of the border during the conflict which led to the partition of the sub-continent. Around one million people were killed in the bloody war between the two countries . Ram, aged 82, with the success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party at a recent state vote, he says he is hopeful change will come for the West Pakistan Refugees: 'If something can be done, then maybe I will finally have some enjoyment in this life' Around 100,000 people are classified as refugees - despite most of them never visiting Pakistan, and living in the Jammu region of India . Most of those refugees were quickly absorbed in towns and cities of the newly-independent nations. However the fate of the West Pakistan Refugees (WPRs) like Ram who decamped to Jammu and Kashmir state became mired in the dispute with Pakistan over the territory. Because of this, its rulers held off granting the refugees residential rights, including the right to buy land, vote in state polls or work in the state government.. Observers say the reluctance of successive state governments to grant full rights to the overwhelmingly Hindu WPRs stems from fears of upsetting the demographic balance in India's only Muslim-majority state, which has special autonomy enshrined in the constitution. A Hindu refugee washes pots at a communal hand pump in Surej Chak, on the outskirts of Jammu. The area has evolved into one of the many slum settlements in Hind-dominated areas of the city region of Jammu, within India's only Muslim-majority state . Generations of families have become stuck in poverty because of their continuing refugee status. Successive governments have failed to act to due, say commentators, to a fear of upsetting the demographic balance of the state between the Muslim and HIndu populations . The WPRs, whose families mainly originate from Punjab, have fallen foul of a pre-independence law that only grants citizenship to people born - or descendants of those born - in the old undivided kingdom of Kashmir. The same legislation has allowed around 35,000 Hindus who have fled Pakistan-controlled Kashmir since partition to be granted citizenship. There are around 100,000 people classified as WPRs, most living in the Jammu region. Hardly any of them have ever set foot in Pakistan. A Hindu refugee widow, who receives a monthly pension of £2, walks in Surej Chak. The community live in poverty, while Kashmir is one of India's more prosperous states. Activist Labha Ram Gandhi said: 'Granting us state-subject rights is the only way to improve our condition' With a Hindu nationalist party winning a share of power in Kashmir, there is hope. Bharatiya Janata Party are expected to champion the refugees' cause. But a veteran activist Labha Ram Ghandi warned the community is not afraid to take matters into their own hands . Suspected rebels shot dead three unarmed policemen Monday in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. The three policemen were investigating a dispute between neighbours when they were fired on by at least three militants wearing army uniforms, officials said. In a separate attack, another officer was critically wounded after suspected militants shot at him inside a bus near northern Pattan town, police said. No rebel group immediately claimed responsibility for either attack. Kashmir has been in conflict for decades, with rebels fighting either for independence or a merger with neighboring Pakistan, which also claims the territory in its entirety while administering part of it. Source: Associated Press . And despite prevailing unrest from different factions, who either fight for independence or to merge once again with Pakistan, Kashmir is one of India's more prosperous states. Yet the estimated 18,000 WPR families however live in abject poverty, mostly marrying among themselves because of their low economic status. 'I spend whatever money I earn to send my children to school,"" said Ramesh Kumar, a part-time driver who lives with his wife, two children and mother in a two-room hovel. He says he thinks the law is ‘ridiculous’, adding: ‘I was born here (in India). My roots are here. What else do I and my children need to be citizens of this place?’ As things stand, Kumar's children cannot be admitted to state-run training colleges or be employed in the state government, although they can work for the federal one. But the tide may soon turn on the rights given to refugees, after a pledge by the newly-elected Bharatiya Janata Party to normalise the WPRs' status. Although the BJP came second in the December hustings, they have joined a Kashmir governing coalition for the first time and are expected to champion the WPRs' cause. 'We have been living here like this for three generations now,' said veteran activist Labha Ram Gandhi. 'Granting us state-subject rights is the only way to improve our condition.' But he warned the community is ready to take matters into their own hands if their hopes are dashed again. ‘We will spill our blood on the streets for our rights,’ he says. The daughter of a Hindu refugee studies in her slum home in Surej Chak. Under the current laws she is not allowed to enrolled at a state-run training college or be employed by the state government.

"Sometimes walking in a straight line without tripping over with just two feet is enough of a challenge. So imagine the kind of coordination it would require if you had eight legs. Now scientists have unraveled how octopuses manage to keep track of all of their flailing limbs as they crawl over objects. The video above, recorded by researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, shows how that despite its body orientation (green arrow) the octopus can crawl in any direction (blue arrow) thanks to its flexible arms . Using high speed videos of octopuses as they negotiated obstacles, biologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel studied the cephlopods movement. They found that the orientation of the creature's body and the crawling direction are controlled independently in the brain. Male octopuses have a long, detachable penis in order to mate with females that are five times bigger than itself. When a female swims by, the male Argonaut sends his penis off to swim to the female and mate with her. In fact, the penis is a ball of sperm in a tentacle called a hectocotylus and females can be fertilised by more than one, by storing them in the mantle cavity. The male dies soon after his unique ordeal, whereas the female can mate several times and even store multiple hectocotyli in a special cavity until they’re needed. In the past, scientists that caught female specimens confused the attached penises for parasitic worms. The male mollusc won almost a third of votes in a survey set up by the Society of Biology to identify the strangest animal sex. The thrust comes from arms that push by elongation rather than arms that pull. This combined with they symmetrical arrangement of the arms around the body helps to give the marine creatures their extraordinary maneuverability. It is the first time scientists have been able to fully understand how octopuses are able to control their movements without a rigid skeleton. The findings may help scientists develop new ways for soft robots to move around and can also shed some light on how octopuses evolved in the first place. Professor Binyamin Hochner, who led the research, said: 'Octopuses use unique locomotion strategies that are different from those found in other animals. 'This is most likely due to their soft molluscan body that led to the evolution of 'strange' morphology, enabling efficient locomotion control without a rigid skeleton.' Octopuses are thought to have evolved from clam-like creatures in the mollusc family. But as they lost their hard protective shell, they seem to have evolved to move far faster than other members of the mollusc family like slugs or snails. The octopus was found to move by pushing with its legs rather than pulling while it could move in any direction regardless of the position of its body - something that humans find extremely difficult to do without falling over . Dr Guy Levy, a neurobiologist who also took part in the research at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said: 'During evolution, octopuses lost their heavy protective shells and became more maneuverable on the one hand, but also more vulnerable on the other hand. 'Their locomotory abilities evolved to be much faster than those of typical molluscs, probably to compensate for the lack of shell.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Current Biology, found that despite their large number of arms, octopuses do not move them in any rhythmical pattern like insects and millipedes do, for example. Speaking to the BBC, Dr Levy said the findings could help develop robots that can squeeze into difficult to reach spaces. He said: 'People want to build soft robots for medical purposes and rescue operations.'","Biologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel used high speed videos of octopuses crawling over objects to study how the animals move .
Rather than pulling themselves along they use their legs to push instead .
They can move in one direction while their bodies face a different direction .

"Boko Haram   militants have disguised themselves as preachers in order to carry out a savage gun massacre in northern Nigeria that left at least 24 people dead. The Islamic extremists drove cars to a mosque in the remote village of Kwajafa in Borno state, where they told locals they were there to teach Islam.

Last week the U.N.'s human rights chief said Boko Haram fighters have been murdering dozens of young women and girls they had taken as 'wives' and using children as 'expendable cannon fodder'. As the Islamist militant group has retreated from parts of northeastern Nigeria, 'gruesome scenes of mass graves and further evident signs of slaughter,' has been brought to light, Zeid Raad al-Hussein told a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. Boko Haram's reported use of children as shields and human bombs would, if confirmed, constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, he said. This comes in response to recent reports that hundreds of women and children had been seized from Nigerian primary schools by Boko Haram militants to be used as 'human shields'. The Islamists took as many as 500 adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak in late February, Mike Omeri, spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, said. Still there: A boy is photographed yesterday walking past a burnt house and car in N'Gouboua, near Lake Chad in Chad, which was attacked by Islamist group Boko Haram earlier in the year . Today it emerged that those caught up in deadly attacks by Boko Haram - who declared their allegiance to the Islamic State terror group earlier this year - have been asked to draw pictures of the massacres as part of their therapy. Young men and women at a UNICEF-run refugee camp near Baga Sola in Chad were photographed using pencils and crayons to draw bloody scenes of assault rifle-wielding gunmen carrying out slaughters from the back of pick-up trucks. The chilling creations illustrate the innocence of the young victim savagely murdered by the jihadis. Boko Haram has been waging a guerilla war in northern Nigeria and also attacked towns in neighboring countries, prompting nations in the region including Chad and Niger to put together a force to combat them. The newly elected president of Nigeria, General Muhammadu Buhari, who beat incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in a landslide win last night, has promised to 'stamp out' the insurgency . In Kano state, where Boko Haram's 'war' on the civilian population has been most prominent, Buhari delivered a crushing defeat to Jonathan, winning 1.9 million votes for Jonathan's 215,800.

"The heartbroken mother of Becky Watts has spoken of her fear of coming face-to-face with Anje Galsworthy - whose son is accused of the teenager's murder. Tania Watts is likely to see her at Becky's funeral, as Ms Galsworthy was also stepmother to the 16-year-old. Speaking to ITV today, Ms Watts spoke of the 'hell' she has endured since the murder, adding: 'I'm still in the back of my mind not accepting...that I'm not going to see her.' Murdered: The body parts of Becky Watts, 16, were found at house in Bristol on March 2 and police charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder . Dreading meeting: Becky's heartbroken mother Tani Watts said she fears coming face-to-face with Anjie Galsworthy, (pictured with Becky's father Darren) whose son is accused of the teenager's murder . Becky, 16, vanished from her father's family home in Crown Hill, Bristol, on February 19, sparking a huge search operation. Police discovered her body parts at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol, on March 2 and charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder. In an ITV interview, Ms Watts described her daughter as a 'caring, normal, happy, lovely girl'. She said: 'She made you feel alive. Everyone loved her. Knowing it's happened, it's like you are talking about someone else's kid. 'You shouldn't have to bury a child. There are a lot of people on this Earth who don't deserve to be here but Becky was not one of them. 'She should be here.' Accused: Becky's stepbrother Nathan Matthews is set to go on trial for the 16-year-old's murder . Mr Matthews is pictured in fancy dress alongside his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, who is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police . Becky grew up with her parents - mother Ms Watts and father Darren Galsworthy - living in separate homes but often tried to bring them together. Ms Watts added: 'That was her aim to make sure we all got on and this is why it was so upsetting because she succeeded in that. 'The one person who was so loyal, so caring and loved us all equally has now gone.' Ms Watts said her daughter was a regular guest at her home, visiting twice a week or so depending on her busy social life. 'She had some hard times in the past, she was very insecure, unconfident, but she got her confidence back and she got a bit of fight in her,' she said. Ms Watts cannot comprehend how, Nathan Matthews, the man accused of her daughter's murder comes from within the 16 year old's home - and she is understandably nervous about seeing his mother, Ms Galsworthy. Becky's family home - where she lived with Mr and Mrs Galsworthy - has been the subject of forensic searches since she was reported missing on February 20. Police launched a huge search operation, which included a social media campaign, using the hashtag 'FindBecky'. Anjie and Darren Galsworthy are pictured speaking in a video appeal one week after the 16-year-old's disappearance . A house in Barton Court, Bristol, is cordoned off on March 3 after police discovered the body parts of murdered Becky . Bouquets, teddies and cards have been left at the family home, as well as at Barton Court where her body parts were found. Two online fundraising pages have also raised more than £11,000, which will pay for Becky's funeral and a foundation in her memory. Mr Matthews, of Warmley, South Gloucestershire, appeared at Bristol Crown Court on March 26, along with five others charged in connection with the death. His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police. Jaydene Parsons, 23, James Ireland, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, are accused of helping dispose of and conceal Becky's body parts. A plea hearing has been set for August 4, with a provisional trial date of October 5. All six defendants have been remanded in custody.

"A brother and sister were left severely disabled after maternity staff at the hospital where they were both born, two years apart, made the same mistakes. Paula McKay was told her daughter Natasha had suffered brain damage and would be left disabled after errors were made by medics at the former Sharoe Green Hospital in Preston. When she became pregnant with her second child, less than two years later, she was reassured the same mistakes would not be repeated. But the promise was an empty one. When Patrick was delivered at the same hospital, the same errors were made, leaving her son brain damaged and severely disabled like his older sister. Ms McKay, from Leyland, near Preston, has been awarded £13 million in compensation, a £7 million care package for her daughter five years after a £6 million sum for her son's lifelong care was agreed. Paula McKay, centre, has won a 20-year legal battle to secure £13 million compensation for her two children Natasha, 24, left and Patrick, 22, right. They were both left severely disabled after the same mistakes were repeated by staff at the same hospital, two years apart, during their births . Maternity staff at the hospital failed to monitor Ms McKay, and failed to recognise Natasha was in distress in the womb. She was delivered 10 weeks prematurely by C-section, but staff failed to ventilate her properly, which caused severe brain damage . Natasha, who is now 24, is confined to a wheelchair and will rely on 24-hour care from a team of nurses who help her dress and eat for the rest of her life. After she was starved of oxygen at birth, Natasha was diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Maternity staff at the hospital failed to monitor Ms McKay, and failed to recognise Natasha was in distress in the womb. She was delivered 10 weeks prematurely by C-section, but staff failed to ventilate her properly, which caused severe brain damage. Seventeen months later when she became pregnant with her son, Patrick, Ms McKay returned to the same hospital. Staff assured her, the same mistakes would not be repeated. However, medics once again failed to monitor her condition, and did not spot that Patrick's heart rate was very low. Ms McKay was, once again, rushed to theatre for an emergency C-section to deliver her son. As a result of the mistakes made, Patrick, now 22, was left brain-damaged and with cerebral palsy. Ms McKay, who has since divorced Natasha and Patrick's father and remarried, said what had happened to her family was a nightmare. 'Natasha and Patrick have been through so much in their lives and it has been heart-breaking to see them suffer at times due to the injuries they were left with.' She told the Telegraph: 'It has been a huge struggle. This feels like the end of a very long, dark tunnel. 'It’s obviously devastating for it to happen to one of your children, but for it to happen to two of them, you just can’t take it in.' She added: 'It upsets me to think about any other families going through the same ordeal and having to fight hospital trusts to help children they have failed. 'However I would say to any other parents in the same situation not to give up hope, you can eventually get the help you and your child needs and things can get better.' The family have fought for 20 years to secure compensation to ensure Natasha and Patrick will receive the care they need for life. In 2008 the NHS North West strategic health authority, formerly the body responsible for the hospital, admitted liability in Patrick's case. Two years later the NHS Litigation Authority paid £6 million for his ongoing care. When Ms McKay went into labour with her second child, medics once again failed to monitor her condition, and did not spot that Patrick's heart rate was very low. Ms McKay was, once again, rushed to theatre for an emergency C-section to deliver her son . Natasha and Patrick both suffered brain damage, and as a result were diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Natasha is confined to a wheelchair and requires 24-hour care from a team of nurses . However, Natasha's case took longer to investigate and conclude, because it was extremely complicated. The strategic health authority, which no longer exists, admitted liability in her case five years ago when she was 19. The final compensation, again paid by the NHS Litigation Authority, was delayed to allow Natasha to finish at Beaumont College, a specialist college for people affected by cerebral palsy. The delay also allowed for a property to be bought, extended and adapted for Natasha, to live with a team of full-time carers. Cerebral palsy is a neurological condition that affects movement and co-ordination. It is often caused by brain damage, during or shortly after birth. Other causes of the condition include: . It is estimated that around one in 400 people in the UK is affected. The symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child's life. The main characteristics of the condition are: . The symptoms can affect different areas of the body and vary in severity from person to person. Many sufferers will also suffer repeated seizures, drooling problems and swallowing difficulties. Some will also have communication and learning difficulties. Source: NHS Choices . The family have now been awarded £7 million in Natasha's case. Ms McKay said the final settlement has brought her some comfort, reassuring her that her children will always be cared for. 'I am relieved that I no longer have to worry about what will happen when I am not here anymore, and that both will have access to the specialist care they need and deserve,' she said. 'Another important factor of this financial settlement is that it will ensure Natasha receives excellent ongoing care that will not ever be affected by local or national budget cuts.' Olivia Scates, a partner at JMW Solicitors, who represented both Natasha and Patrick, said this was an 'unprecedented situation' where two children in one family had suffered brain damage and cerebral palsy as a result of negligence. 'Paula has had to cope with two avoidable tragedies involving her children,' she said. 'To go through such an ordeal once and a child's life to be devastated is tragic, for it to happen to two children in the same family is unbelievably sad. 'However Paula is an incredible mother who has dedicated her life to caring for Natasha and Patrick and has conducted herself with great dignity throughout their cases. 'Nothing can be done to turn back the clock but with the settlement of Natasha's case Paula will have the support she needs to provide that care to her daughter and ensure that she does not have to worry about the future, especially when she is not here anymore, which was a huge concern. 'Natasha will never be able to live independently, work or do any of the things the rest of us take for granted. 'However as well as the highly specialist accommodation and equipment she requires now she will have access to excellent care that will improve her quality of life and enable her to access therapies and activities designed for people with her level of disability.' Ms McKay has a third child, George, now 19, who was born at Kings College in London without any complications. He is now training to become a nurse, to continue to help disabled people in his working life, after helping care for his siblings at home. Sharoe Green Hospital closed in 2004, when it merged with the Royal Preston Hospital to become Preston Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.","Natasha, 24, and Patrick Jackson, 22, were both left brain damaged at birth .

"A formerly obese man has revealed how he finally became motivated to lose 160lbs from his 354lbs frame over the course of 20 months, after nearly a lifetime of emotional eating and self-loathing. Atlanta-based writer Alex Gray, 27, admitted that he once made excuses for his gluttonous habits, which included trips to drive-through restaurants up to four times a day, but it wasn't until an obese friend 'unveiled a shockingly svelte silhouette' that he was inspired to make changes in his own life . 'There are a lot of platitudes about weight,' he wrote in an essay for Salon. 'One of them is that you should love yourself no matter your size. I’m here to say that’s bullsh**. Being fat sucks. I love myself way more now than I ever have. Scroll down for video . Inner turmoil: Alex aid that he had 'missed out on a lot' when he was clocking in at 354lbs (pictured) New man: The writer was pictured at a Miami Dolphins football game after he lost nearly half of his body weight in 20 months . Alex explained that there are people who are unable to lose weight because of genetics or other factors - but he was not one of them. 'For those who can do something about their size, and simply refuse to, trust me: Life is so much better on the other side,' he explained. Alex said that he couldn't think of a 'specific catalyst' that prompted him to gain weight, but he recalled that he had an insatiable appetite 'as an only child with unabated access to nearly everything'. As he got older, he grew bigger, and by the time he was in college, he found himself struggling with physical intimacy because of his size. Alex recalled one woman who called him out for breathing heavily during one of their sexual encounters. He confessed that the panting was because he was winded - not because he was caught up in the heat of the moment. But the worse he felt about himself, the more he ate. 'I’ve never tried drugs, but I empathize with those addicted to the needle, or the pipe,' he wrote. 'I know what it feels like to be acutely aware your vice is killing you, or at the very least, keeping you from living your best life. Alex explained attempted to lose weight a few times, but neither the promise of an extended football career or a new car could motivate him to stick with it because he was unable to 'escape food's gravitational pull'. It wasn't until he saw his friend Joubert, who once had a similar frame to his, show off his fit new body at a Cinco De Mayo reunion that he became motivated to start making changes in his own life. Days later, Alex went walking, and eventually his walks turned into runs. He made dietary changes too, including swapping burgers for lean rotisserie chicken. It took a little less than two years to reach his 'physical ideal', and Alex explained that his whole world has changed. His only regret is not doing it sooner.

"No matter how young or old we are, most of us experience the odd memory lapse. Perhaps it will be forgetting where you put the car keys, or what you went to get from upstairs. Thankfully, these moments pass. But for those with dementia there is no such relief. Imagine what it's like being unable to recall what you'd done an hour before. Or not remembering how to navigate around your own house or the names of your nearest and dearest. Or knowing what everyday things are for, such as a fridge. Today, in the third part of our major Good Health series on dementia, we look at ways to help minimise the impact of these memory problems, to prolong independence and help those with dementia live as full a life as possible. Scroll down for video . Older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep - but they still need just as much . THINGS THAT SABOTAGE YOUR MEMORY . Getting overtired: If the brain is tired, it affects the memory even for those without dementia. Recently, scientists have found out why. During deep sleep, brain waves move memories from the hippocampus - the area of the brain that is involved in short-term memory - to the prefrontal cortex at the front of the brain, where long-term memories are stored. If this doesn't happen, short-term memories get overwritten with new ones and the consequence is forgetfulness, according to researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. It is a common misconception that we need less sleep as we get older - in fact we need just as much, the problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep. Getting a good night's sleep can be especially difficult for those with dementia, especially those with Alzheimer's disease who may experience changes to their sleeping patterns. Quite why this happens is not understood, but it may be related to the impact the condition has on the brain. But there are steps that can make it easier. One of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day (this becomes harder to avoid as dementia becomes more advanced). Catnapping makes it both harder to fall asleep at night and more likely you'll wake up earlier than desired. Other steps include avoiding caffeine - coffee or tea - in the evening. A regular bedtime is also important as this gives the body the cues it needs to feel sleepy at set times, making it easier to fall asleep. Although many people believe a nightcap will help them sleep, alcohol is counter-productive and tends to make you wake in the night. It is a diuretic and, therefore, you are likely to wake up needing to go to the loo. It is also known to reduce the amount of the night you spend in deep, restorative sleep. Regularly eating food high in fat and sugar leads to inflammation in the hippocampus . Eating too much junk food: Cakes, chips and biscuits won't just impact on the waistline - they can adversely affect your memory, too. Recent research has found that regularly eating food high in fat and sugar leads to inflammation in the hippocampus. Scientists at the University of New South Wales, Australia, found that eating these foods every day caused inflammation in the brain after just one week. The work was done on rats, but it is thought the principle could extend to humans. Smoking: Many studies have found that even occasional smoking can impact on the brain. One study, from King's College London, analysed 8,000 over-50s and found that smokers performed worst in memory tests, learning ability and reasoning. Why this happens is thought to be linked to the fact that smoking reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain. Those who have smoked have also been shown to have greater overall shrinkage of the brain. Not 'using it': When someone is diagnosed with dementia, they often start to withdraw from their normal hobbies and activities. Yet to retain your mental ability and memory skills for as long as possible you need to keep the brain stimulated. Think of it this way: just as our bodies need physical exercise in order to stay as strong as possible so, too, do our brains. It's a tried-and-tested principle: for example, a review of 15 studies by the respected Cochrane Library looked at the benefits of a variety of activities designed to stimulate the brain and promote memory such as word games, puzzles, listening to music and practical activities such as baking and indoor gardening. The studies involved 718 participants with dementia - some took part in these activities and others did not. After between one and three months those who'd taken part in the brain stimulating and practical activities did better on cognitive function tests than those who did not. TIPS TO HELP WITH A FAILING MEMORY . A failing short-term memory is a characteristic of dementia and can make it difficult to cope with day-to-day life. The following strategies may help: . One of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day . Have set meal times, as these are easier to remember - and write them down on a whiteboard to help recall what time is meal time. The Mediterranean type of diet may be most beneficial as it's been shown to maintain the health of the blood vessels, and keeping a healthy circulation is key for people with dementia as it ensures a healthy flow of blood to the brain. Try to include oily fish such as trout, salmon or mackerel three times a week: the latest research suggests this is a good way to stop brain shrinkage. These fish contain omega-3 fatty acids and research has found that people with the highest level of these have less shrinkage in the hippocampus, the area associated with memory. To confirm a diagnosis of dementia or to access specialist services, a GP can refer a patient to a memory clinic. Normally, these are based either at a community clinic or at a hospital. They will have a team of psychologist nurses and doctors. As well as running tests that can help provide a diagnosis, they co-ordinate a range of services to help the dementia patient. For example, all clinics will offer cognitive stimulation therapy. This takes the form of group activities and exercises the patient is invited to attend twice a week for seven weeks. These activities could involve word games or even singing and have been found to help improve language skills and comprehension. Each session lasts for about 45 minutes. You cannot simply attend a clinic - you need to be referred. Typically, there is a four-to-six week wait after referral for an appointment. If the patient is too infirm or incapacitated to attend, most clinics can offer a home assessment by one of the community mental health team. Do it in chronological order. Having a history of their life can help them remember and, as the condition progresses this book may also be useful to bring out to show them if they seem distressed. Asking the person with dementia to reminisce and recall stories about the people or events shown in the pictures can also be a good way to 'use it'.

We look at ways to help minimise the impact of memory problems .
For example, we need just as much sleep as we get older .
The problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep .
When the short-term memory starts to go, it can make it hard for someone to recall what they have already done that day, such as whether they've had breakfast, or showered, or spoken to someone.
It can help to keep a diary - a record of what has been done through the day. Writing also helps encourage the cognitive processes, which can help slow down future decline.
Create a memory hub - that is, a central place in the home, perhaps the dining room table or a desk, where important notes, car keys, house keys and drugs that need to be taken are kept. Put things here that you want to be able to find quickly. Get into the habit of having everything in this one place rather than having things scattered about the home.
Get a whiteboard or blackboard - that can be used to record a timetable of what needs to be done each day that week. Things that get done can be ticked off. It is another way to show what has been done, but also shows what remains to be done.
Label doors, drawers, cupboards and cabinets to avoid confusion about what goes where.
Have a list of the numbers of key people by the phone - your GP and other care professionals, carers, family and reliable friends.
Have a daily newspaper delivered - it is a simple way of keeping aware of what is happening in the world and is a useful reminder of that day's date.
When showering or having a bath, establish a routine as a reminder of whether your hair has been washed. For example, move the conditioner and shampoo from one side of the bath to the other once you've used them.
Eat regular meals. While other body cells can take fuel from elsewhere, the brain relies on a good supply of glucose from the blood. That's why skipping a meal can affect reasoning, cognition and memory.
In the early stages of dementia, begin a reminiscence book to act as a reminder of key events in that person's life and who people are. It's a nice thing for the person with dementia and a loved one to do together. Include pictures and snippets of information and date and label every entry."
"A bedlington lurcher named Twiglet suffered a 'serious hallucinogenic episode' after accidentally eating a stash of drugs he found at a village bus stop. Vet Nick Fisher, 31, from Leintwardine, Shropshire, said  Twiglet was left behaving strangely after swallowing the unidentified substance while on a walk near their home last Monday. The four-year-old hound seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drugs near the village bus stop. Vet Nick Fisher, 31, from Leintwardine, Shropshire, said his bedlington lurcher Twiglet (pictured) was left behaving strangely after eating the drugs he found at a bus stop while on a walk near their home last Monday . Twiglet seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drug . But after 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth uncontrollably, shaking and walking into walls Twiglet seemed back to normal following his 'trip'. Today Mr Fisher, a veterinary surgeon, said: 'We had been taking Twiglet out for a walk as we normally do. 'We went past the bus stop which is just like a seat around an oak tree. 'A few people often hang out there and drop things like food and so on, so the dogs like to go scavenging around that area. 'He came back in the house and lay down and was tired as you might expect. 'But then he got up and started running around, doing laps of the room as if he was being chased. The bus stop in Leintwardine, Shorpshire, where Twiglet found and consumed the unidentified narcotics . After  drooling at the mouth uncontrollably, shaking and walking into walls he seems to be back to normal . 'He had his tail between his legs and his head down, which he only does when he is being chased around by our other dogs. 'When I got hold of him he started shaking uncontrollably, producing huge quantities of saliva and panting excessively. 'He then lost his balance on the laminate flooring and fell onto his side. 'My wife was obviously quite upset. She's never seen a dog go through anything neurological before. Let alone tripping on drugs. 'I just reacted instinctively and had to treat him like any client's dog. I took step back and tried to remain calm.' Because of Twiglet's symptoms Mr Fisher believes his dog may have ingested something hallucinogenic . The father-of-one said he phoned the nurse at his surgery in Ludlow, Shropshire, to come and take a blood sample and made Twiglet vomit. The blood test did not show any obvious medical cause but a veterinary neurologist believed the illness to have been caused by narcotics. He added: 'The next day he was completely back to normal - although his eyes were very red. 'I've got a friend who is a neurologist so I asked them what they thought it was. 'Because of the circumstances and symptoms they suggested it sounded like he'd ingested something hallucinogenic. 'For a dog with no history of having any neurological issues to behave like this for a short period is usually related to drugs. Twiglet's scavenging days would appear to be over following the unfortunate incident last week . 'He would have been quite an unlucky dog to have had all those symptoms and for it to be anything else. 'It's not a common diagnosis around our village but there is a bit of a hippie commune up the road. Maybe something was dropped or had fallen out of someone's pocket. 'I have only seen one similar case in which we found a dog had swallowed a bag of marijuana - we just want other owners to be careful in future.' Wife Karen, 33, a farm consultant, added: 'It led to a 45 minute episode in which Twiglet showed symptoms of being under the influence of narcotics. 'Symptoms include hallucinating, partial seizures, tremors, hyper salivating, in-coordination and collapsing. 'We want to make other owners aware to be vigilant when walking their dogs in the area.' The vet is urging dog owners to be vigilant while walking pets in the area in case a similar incident occurs .","Twiglet the bedlington lurcher had a bad trip after accidentally eating drugs .

"Nick Clegg today revealed he struggled with maths at school, as he prepares to launch his election manifesto which will promise to balance the nation's books 'fairly'. The Lib Dem leader told a group of children he was better at languages and art when he was at school. He will use tomorrow's manifesto launch to promise a 'stronger economy and a fairer society', and accuse the Tories of wanting to embark on an unnecessarily deep cuts. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today revealed he struggled with maths at school, as he prepares to launch his election manifesto which will promise to balance the nation's books 'fairly' Mr Clegg has promised to 'spread the burden' of deficit reduction, with cuts to benefits and Whitehall budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy. He has set out plans for £5billion in new tax rises, £7billion raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance, £12 billion in public spending reductions and a £3 billion cut from welfare. But today he admitted that maths had not been his strong point as a youngster. Answering questions from youngsters at the Cradle Hill community primary school in Seaford, East Sussex, Mr Clegg said: 'My grades were OK. I was better at languages and English and art and history, I was a bit better at that than I was at maths and science.' Despite his professed weakness in science he added:'I liked physics.' Mr Clegg visited the school alongside former minister Norman Baker, who hopes to retain the Lewes seat. Mr Clegg, campaigning with Lib Dem minister Simon Hughes in Southwark, has promised to 'spread the burden' of deficit reduction, with cuts to benefits and Whitehall budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy . The Lib Dems will launch their manifesto tomorrow, after the Tories unveiled their promise of 'the Good Life' today and Labour's Ed Miliband vowed to cut the deficit every year at his launch yesterday. On the campaign trail in south London earlier, Mr Clegg criticised Conservative plans to extend the Margaret Thatcher's flagship Right to Buy scheme. The existing scheme allows tenants living in council-owned properties local authority tenants to buy houses and flats at a discount of as much as 70 per cent up to a maximum of £102,700 in London and £77,000 across the rest of England. The Conservatives plan would extend the scheme to people living in properties owned by housing associations - not-for-profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low-cost homes. But Mr Clegg said: 'It's a measure of how much the Conservatives have run out of new ideas that the big idea on the day they publish their manifesto is a poor cover version of one of Margaret Thatcher's 1980s hits. It doesn't even add up, it's not even affordable as the housing industry has said.' 'It will not help people who don't presently live in their own home, it does not help the youngsters who are living with mum and dad and want to move out, it does not help the millions of people in private rented accommodation who want to own their own home. 'As the housing industry has said, actually under this plan you will see affordable housing go down rather than go up.' Miriam Clegg at a campaign event in Greater Manchester . Nick Clegg's wife Miriam today revealed how she is juggling the election campaign with making sure their three sons are 'OK during this intensive time'. Mrs Clegg, who uses her maiden name Gonzalez Durantez, hit the campaign trail in Hazel Grove, Greater Manchester. She took part in a series of activities in the guides hut, including making lava lamps and also edible pigs made from cream eggs, chocolate digestives and fondant. Asked if the campaign was a hard time for her and her family, she said: 'It's a busy time. 'I primarily focus on ensuring that our children are OK during this intensive time and then I continue with my normal life and try to help from time to time as I see that I can fit, without changing completely my life, but helping as much as I can.' She said: 'It's an exciting campaign. It's obviously a very close campaign for everybody. Nobody's going to have an outright majority and that makes it quite interesting.' On whether Mr Clegg was holding up, she said: 'Oh yes, you can see him.' The couple have three sons: Alberto, Migel and Antonio.","Clegg tells pupils he was better at languages and art as a youngster .

"A 73-year-old woman died in front of horrified family members after she was knocked over by a Canadian tourist while visiting the Great Wall of China. Cui Hongfang, from Heilongjiang Province in north-eastern China, hit the back of her head on a corner of the stone wall after she collided with the 38-year-old Canadian woman. Police have ruled the tragedy an accident, although they are still investigating the circumstances of the Chinese woman’s death. Cui Hongfang's family told Chinese media that the Canadian tourist was running down steep steps . The victim’s husband told The Beijing News that his wife was knocked over as the tourist ran down steps on a steep section of the wall on Wednesday. He told the newspaper: ‘The foreigner was moving really fast. She was chasing [someone] and laughing and wanted to go between me and my wife.’ Mrs Hongfang’s family members said she lost conscious immediately, was bleeding from her mouth, nose and ears, and stopped breathing shortly after she was knocked over on the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall. They said the tourist ran further down the wall and then returned to the spot where the collision occurred. Police in Beijing have ruled Cui Hongfang's death an accident, although they are still investigating . Mrs Hongfang’s family called police and paramedics, who did not arrive until approximately one hour later due to the remote location north of Beijing. An official with the Mutianyu Great Wall Tourism Services Company told news website China.org.cn that the collision occurred in a ‘blind spot’ within the CCTV system, so there is no footage of it. The official said: ‘We have rules and warnings for tourists, asking them not to chase each other, run fast or play around on the steep sections of the Great Wall.’ Police decided not to charge the Canadian woman after interviewing her and witnesses. Mrs Hongfang’s relatives were not pleased that the woman has not been charged with an offence such as involuntary manslaughter, and investigators advised them to file a civil lawsuit against the tourist, who has since returned to Canada.","Cui Hongfang hit the back of her head on a corner of the stone wall .

"The girlfriend of an Australian baseball player who was shot in back while jogging in Oklahoma appeared in court on Thursday and faced his suspected killer as the prosecution rested their case. Sarah Harper was in a relationship with Christopher Lane, 22, when he was gunned down while visiting in the city of Duncan in August 2013. He was born in Melbourne, Australia, but was in the United States on a baseball scholarship when 17-year-old Chancey Allen Luna allegedly murdered him. The couple had returned from a trip to Australia just two days earlier. Scroll down for video . Sarah Harper (pictured left walking into court on Thursday) was in a relationship with Christopher Lane, 22, when he was gunned down while visiting in the city of Duncan in August 2013 . The couple had returned from a trip to Australia just two days before he was gunned down while out jogging . Harper sat and listened to the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on him, claiming that only a 'miracle' would have saved the talented sportsman. Lane's mother Donna Lane, wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Prosecutors told the court that 104 bullets were found in the car involved in the drive-by shooting. All of them were live rounds. According to The Oklahoman Yacoub testified in the first-degree murder trial that the bullet fired at Lane was small, but caused severe damage. He said: 'Despite being small, it damaged vital structures and caused significant bleeding,' Yacoub told jurors, striking two major blood vessels, puncturing both lungs and breaking two ribs. The prosecution rested following Yacoub's testimony. Defense attorneys acknowledge that Luna fired the fatal shot but say he was only trying to scare Lane, a native of Melbourne, Australia, who was in Oklahoma on a college baseball scholarship. Lane was about to start his senior year at East Central University in Ada and was in Duncan visiting his girlfriend. Luna is not expected to testify and the defense indicated it may call just one witness, Luna's mother, Jennifer. She took to the stand and was asked only one question by defense attorneys: 'Do you love your son?' To which she replied: 'Yes.' He was born in Melbourne, Australia, but was in the United States on a baseball scholarship when 17-year-old Chancey Allen Luna (pictured walking into court on Thursday) allegedly murdered him . Donna Lane (left) and her husband, Peter (right), parents of Australian baseball player Chris Lane walk into court. Mrs Lane broke down in tears when the court was shown images of the bloody t-shirt her son was wearing when he was shot dead . Outside court she said that she doesn't believe her son is guilty, despite his attorneys' comments to the jury. 'Those are court-appointed lawyers. If I had the money to get a real lawyer, it wouldn't go this way,' Jennifer Luna sad. 'If my son did it, it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't meant to be. My son would never intentionally try to hurt somebody at all.' The teenager faces life in prison either with or without the possibility of parole if convicted of first-degree murder. Defense attorneys plan to ask that the jury be allowed to consider second-degree murder in the case, which carries a prison term of 10 years to life in prison. Closing arguments and the start of jury deliberations are expected on Friday. Luna's mother, Jennifer (pictured sitting outside the courttoom on Thursday), claims her son did not mean to kill Lane 'on purpose' and claims he is innocent.

"After Tony Blair’s speech in his former constituency of Sedgefield last week, the former PM made an appearance at a low-key private fundraising dinner for 15 Labour target seats. But despite the fact that Blair has a record of three general election victories, only one Shadow Cabinet minister, Chuka Umunna, could be bothered to attend. During a dinner held in an Indian banquet hall in Morden, Blair (pictured last week in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham) name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements . The dashing Shadow Business Secretary is being mentored by Lord Mandelson, the former Blairite Cabinet minister, who wants to see him as the next Labour leader. The programme for the dinner, held in an Indian banquet hall in less-than-glamorous Morden High Street, South London, was littered with errors and even misspelt Umunna’s name. A clearly uncomfortable Blair name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements. Bizarrely, Blair shared a stage with musician Steve Brookstein, who won the first X Factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than Blair’s popularity. Brookstein’s last record (he had a box full of them to give away) is an apt metaphor for Blair in the eyes of the current Labour Party. It’s called The Forgotten Man. One of many critics of Blair’s appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: ‘Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.’ Galloway is one to talk. Last year he earned £303,000 in addition to his MP’s salary, mostly from £1,600-an-hour appearances on Iran’s Press TV and Russia Today. The national treasure that is Andrew Marr gets to the heart of what is wrong with the election campaign. ‘There’s this thing called the deficit sitting there like a great stinking ordure in the middle of public life. To deal with it, big taxes have to go up. The Tories seem to have forgotten that,’ he writes in The Spectator. ‘They now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the NHS; Labour has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters. The other parties want to spend more and don’t want to talk about taxation. ‘The deficit? Apparently if it’s left alone it’s just going to melt away. Huddled-down, risk-averse politicians from all the main parties have decided to treat us like credulous children.’ Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour's 'Controls On Immigration' mug embarrassing . Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour’s embarrassing ‘Controls On Immigration’ mug at the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in her Sky News interview yesterday. Cooper coolly took the mug and cleverly turned the slogan away from the cameras. ‘A storm in a coffee cup,’ Cooper, aka Mrs Ed Balls, said. The influential Labour Uncut blog says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon’s claim that Red Ed Miliband ‘stabbed his own brother in the back’ to lead Labour, and would do the same to Britain by negotiating away Trident, will help the Tories. ‘The manner in which Ed Miliband defeated his brother is regularly brought up on the doorstep with Labour canvassers and crystallises discomfort with the idea of Ed Miliband as an untrustworthy leader,’ the website says. ‘The gutter is an ugly place to be but. . . it’s where elections are won.’ Plaid Cymru is under pressure to dump its candidate for Ceredigion, Mike Parker, for saying in 2001 English-born inhabitants of rural Wales were ‘gun-toting final solution crackpots’.

"When two complete strangers living just an hour apart in Ireland discovered they looked so alike they could be identical twins this week, the world was shocked. But unlikely as it may seem, Niamh Geaney, 26, and Karen Branigan, 29, aren't the only pair to have found their real-life doppelgängers, either by mistake or after a social media hunt. Now three similar British cases have been revealed; a London-based journalist who found hers in Birmingham, two male university students, also in London, and two retired men in Essex. Scroll down for video . What are the odds? Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, (right) moved to Braintree in Essex to be confronted with his doppelgänger, former head teacher John Jemison, 74, (left) Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old TV presenter from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' last week in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, moved to Braintree and was surprised to greeted with waves and 'hello John' greetings wherever he went. 'John' turned out to be John Jemison, a 74-year-old former head teacher who was well-known to the town, and just so happened to look exactly like Mr Richardson. Upon meeting, the pair, who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised that as well as being doppelgängers, they had an awful lot in common. Both had attended the same college, and both became RE teachers and choir singers. The pair finally came face-to-face in March when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a Friends of Braintree Museum visit to the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library. 'It was quite spooky,' said Mr Jemison, adding that they 'hit it off immediately' and are now friends. 'My only worry is the number of people who probably think I've been ignoring them when they've been saying ""Hello John"" to Neil all this time.' Upon meeting, Mr Richardson (left) and Mr Jemison (right), who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised they  had a lot in common in terms of their life stories . Mr Richardson married his wife in 1968 (left) while Mr Jemison also married wife Jenny in the sixties (right) In 2011, Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed became fascinated by the idea that there might be someone out there in the world who looked exactly like her. In fact, she was the inspiration behind Miss Geaney's ultimately successful social media search. In much the same way, Ms Robehmed launched her mission to find her doppelgänger by publicising it on Facebook, YouTube, and through blogs around the world. And just like Miss Geaney, it turned out that Ms Robehmed didn't need to look that far. Her closest match turned out to be Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher, who worked in the film industry and shared a mutual friend. Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed (right) launched a hunt to find her 'twin stranger' in 2011 and found Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher (left) through a mutual friend . After seeing Ms Hatcher's photo, Miss Robehmed set up a meeting in Covent Garden in London, and the rest is history. And in another accidental result, doppelgängers Jonny Sandgrove and Michael Harris, both based in London, got to know each other at university. As cases of mistaken identity around the campus began to mount up, the pair met, again though mutual acquaintances, and ultimately became firm friends. Doppelgängers Jonny Sandgrove (left) and Michael Harris (right), both based in London, got to know each other at University, after friends kept getting them confused . When Mr Harris married his then-girlfriend Naomi a little while later, several members of his family approached Johnny at the wedding to congratulate him. All this comes after Miss Geaney and Miss Branigan's story blew up across the media yesterday, for being the most twin-like case yet. Miss Geaney, a TV presenter, found Miss Branigan after she teamed up with two friends to launch a project called Twin Strangers. This is the moment that Miss Geaney (right) met her doppleganger Miss Branigan (left) for the first time . 'I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me' Miss Geaney (right) said about Miss Branigan (left) The aim of the social media experiment was to see which of the three could find their closest lookalike within 28 days and it attracted submissions to their website TwinStrangers from across the world. Incredibly, Miss Geaney found Miss Branigan in just two weeks - just an hour away. After their first meeting she said: ‘I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face. ‘And some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, “Oh my God that’s my face”. I can’t remember the number of times I said “this is so freaky”. It was truly amazing. Uncanny: Miss Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Miss Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . ‘I would say Karen is the shyer of the two of us,’ said Miss Geaney. ‘But then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me. I’m the weirdo that contacted Karen and asked her to meet me.’ Miss Branigan, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Miss Geaney has two sisters and a brother, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Since meeting, Miss Greaney and Miss Branigan - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'. Miss Branigan (right) turned out to be a fellow Ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from Miss Geaney (left), making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together . She added, 'Some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, ""Oh my God that’s my face""' While Miss Geaney appears to have beaten her fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry and 22-year-old Terence, hands down, the search isn't over until April 27. 'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry English said. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence Manzanga. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!' Miss Geaney (right) said she and Miss Branigan (left) got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities (pictured) Friends for life?

Challenge: Miss Geaney's (right) fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry (left) and 22-year-old Terence (centre), are still looking for their doppelgängers, and the search isn't over until April 27 . Miss Geaney, who is still promoting the project across social media with Harry and Terence as interest spreads, says there will be no prize for the winner, just 'pride'. They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' She said.

"The six-month-old foal was in a pitiful state. Dumped on the side of a busy road outside Southampton, emaciated and riddled with worms, he was shivering pitifully in the January chill and clinging to life by a thread. His rescuers called him Rupert: a teddy bear name for a teddy bear temperament. Despite what he has endured, Rupert is a loving, affectionate soul who likes nothing more than to have the back of his head rubbed. To see him today, three months on but still unsteady on his feet, it seems heartless beyond belief that anyone could leave such a vulnerable creature to die. Sixteen-year-old Elise, from Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire, is just one of the many people finding that they can no longer keep up with the financial costs of keeping and looking after a horse . But, sadly, stories like Rupert’s are all too common. Across the country, horses, ponies and donkeys — many of them once much-loved family pets — are being abandoned in record numbers and left to fend for themselves or tied up on busy roadsides in the hope that someone will rescue them. Animal welfare charities, meanwhile, are full to capacity, leaving them increasingly helpless in the wake of the hundreds of calls they receive every month about neglected or abandoned horses. Earlier this month, in desperation, the RSPCA launched an urgent appeal to rehome some of the hundreds of horses in their care. Their three sanctuaries, with capacity for 640 horses, are full, with 500 other horses being kept at huge expense in private boarding stables while they wait for a place. Three thousand more, meanwhile, are estimated to be at risk, although the real number could be much higher. Last year, the RSPCA alone took in 1,500 horses, many of them former family pets. Little wonder that the word RSPCA workers are using to describe the situation is ‘crisis’. As Anna Hemmings, centre manager at Lockwood, one of their three animal centres, puts it, trying to provide care for the ever-growing numbers of needy equines is a ‘constant battle’. ‘The moment we rehome a horse another one steps into its place,’ she says. ‘I have been here for four years and every year the problem has got worse.’ Sara Cooper, 33, a trainee agricultural assistant from Wiltshire, says that since an accident which hurt her back she can no longer ride her horse Pip, and as a result can't afford to keep him either . It’s hard to argue with the numbers, which all equine welfare organisations say have risen steadily in the recession, and continue to do so, despite the economy improving. Dene Stansall, a horse consultant for campaign group Animal Aid, says that many people remain unable to afford the minimum £3,000 cost per year to keep a horse — a sum that can soar if there are veterinary bills. Yet those who bought a horse years ago and are now struggling to afford it, find they have no one to sell to. ‘There is no demand or buoyancy in the market compared with seven or eight years ago,’ says Dene. ‘People might afford a new TV, but they can’t commit to the long-term care of an animal.’ Sara's horse Pip (pictured) is one of the many family pets who find themselves either being sold on by owners who can no longer afford to keep them, or abandoned by those who fail to find them a new home . Reluctant to sell their horses to abattoirs, many owners mistakenly believe that leaving them to fend for themselves on a patch of land such as a roadside verge — a common practice known as fly-grazing, which is illegal — is the better option. In reality, however, most horses cannot survive for long without human care. The problem is that more and more owners are taking on horses without preparation. Mother-of-four Teresa Christie, from Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire, is the first to admit she was naive about horse ownership — and as a result has been left frantically trying to find a home for her 16-year-old daughter Elise’s Irish cob Beau, without success. ‘None of us realised the financial commitment of owning a horse,’ says Teresa. ‘We didn’t have any land so found him a field and stables which cost £80 a month.’ Then there is Beau’s food and hay, which can cost up to £100 a month, and the regular £30 charge to keep his hooves trimmed. ‘We’ve at least been lucky that he’s been healthy, so the vet bills have been low, but vaccinations are still £260 a year,’ she says. ‘It began to get more and more of a stretch to care for him.’ Sara's back pain forced her to give up her beloved horse Pip (pictured together left). 'On average, I was paying £160 a month to rent a field and a stable. It was £10 for a bag of feed which lasts two or three days' The situation reached crisis point last summer — by when Teresa had taken a part-time cleaning job to help fund Beau’s care, while Elise had started work as a trainee hairdresser to help out, too. ‘But it still wasn’t enough money. I thought: “I can’t do this any more” — I’ve got four children and there are other priorities,’ says Teresa. ‘It’s been a difficult decision, but the truth is Beau is a luxury we can’t afford.’ So, earlier this year, the family made the reluctant decision to put him up for sale. Yet months on, there still have been no takers — though the family is adamant they will not abandon him. Teresa’s experience chimes with that of Sara Cooper, 33, a trainee agricultural assistant from Wiltshire. The mother-of-two has always loved riding her 20-year-old horse Pip, but last year had to stop after being kicked by a cow, leaving her with back pain. ‘Riding now exacerbates the pain and I simply can’t afford to keep a horse that I can’t ride,’ she says. ‘On average, I was paying £160 a month to rent a field and a stable. It was £10 for a bag of feed which lasts two or three days.’ Long-time rider Melanie Maddocks, a 54-year-old self-employed carer from Barnstable, Devon, says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14-year-old cob, Connie . And so, like Teresa, she had to make the painful decision to get rid of Pip, selling him to a family in Buckinghamshire. The price of hay has risen far beyond inflation, with some farmers putting up a bale by £5. It is a cost hitting busy animal sanctuaries harder than ever. Fiona Oakes, who runs Tower Hill Stables Animal Sanctuary in Tillingham, Essex, is overseeing 50 abandoned or neglected horses. ‘We have had them left tied up outside the Sanctuary gates,’ says Fiona, 48. ‘We’ve found horses in such a pitiful state that it makes you want to weep.’ Like the beautiful Palomino pony, found in a coal shed, skeletally thin, cast aside when she was too old to be ridden. ‘She would have been every little girl’s fantasy in her prime, but once she had outlived her usefulness she ended up in this appalling state,’ says Fiona. ‘It was heartbreaking.’ Melanie found it so difficult to find a buyer for horse Connie, at one point she considered having her put to sleep. 'The thought broke my heart, but I didn’t know what to do,’ she says . Long-time rider Melanie Maddocks, a 54-year-old self-employed carer from Barnstable, Devon, says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14-year-old cob, Connie, who she couldn’t afford alongside her other horse, Flossie. At one point last year, she became so overwhelmed that she contemplated having Connie put to sleep. ‘The thought broke my heart, but I didn’t know what to do,’ she says. In the end, after many frantic phone calls, Melanie found a local stud farm, who took Connie to breed from. ‘I was lucky, although it was devastating. But a lot of people abandon their horses as they don’t know what else to do and think it’s the kinder option.’ Well-meaning or not, fly-grazing is now heartbreakingly common and many owners do not comply with laws requiring them to microchip their horses, making tracing them impossible. So it is left to animal sanctuaries to take in the poor creatures — if they are discovered in time to save them.","Increasing costs mean few owners can keep up with looking after a horse .

Previous satellite images revealed that China has made rapid progress in building an airstrip suitable for military use on the contested Fiery Cross Reef  and may be planning another. Images revealed Fiery Cross Reef virtually untouched by man-made structures in March 2014 but by March this year, it had been transformed into an artificial island. They followed equally disturbing photographs released earlier this month showing a flotilla of Chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built island on the nearby Mischief Reef.

Disputed: China has built the airstrip (pictured) on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands without consulting the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan who all claim the region . 'We have compelling reasons to raise our voice to tell the whole world the adverse effects of China's aggressiveness,' Catapang told reporters, describing the reclamation and construction activities as 'massive'. Catapang said this was causing concern 'not only because it would deter freedom of navigation, but also due to its possibility of military purposes'. Edward Schwarck, Research Fellow in Asia Studies at defence think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, said that the installations China is building could lead to military conflict. He told MailOnline: ‘Assertive behaviour from China in this region is not a new thing. Chinese maritime law enforcement vessels have been harassing fishermen and US vessels for years. ‘The concern is that they give the Chinese military the ability to project force and sovereignty much better into the South China Sea. They could be used as launch pads for law enforcement vessels and harassing operations of other countries in the region. ‘These have been very provocative in the past and the installations mean more ships, that in turn escalates conflict.’ He added: ‘As they stand they’re not a threat. In a military conflict these sorts of installations would be sitting ducks. The concern is what it signifies about China’s long-term intentions.’ China claims most of the potentially energy-rich South China . Sea, disputed in parts with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, . Brunei and Taiwan, and denies accusations its actions in its own . territory are provocative. General Catapang showed journalists surveillance photographs of construction work at Johnson, Fiery Cross, Cuarteron, Kennan and Gaven reefs. He added: 'Our biggest problem now is the Mischief Reef. This is worrisome. This is our main . concern now. This is the issue that we are now trying to . address. 'We feel that we are in a very difficult situation. If they reclaim the Mischief Reef, we will be cut off. We have a series of islands going down south and going up north. It will challenge the Ayungin Shoal that we are claiming. Military troops from the Philippines and United States hold up their respective national flags during opening rites of the Philippines-US Exercise Balikatan in Quezon City, east of Manila . Force: Following their release, U.S. President Barack Obama accused China of using its military might to reclaim the contested territory in the South China Sea . Worrying: A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the scale of China's land reclamation in the South China Sea (pictured) is fueling concerns in the region that China intends to militarise its outposts . Territory: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly Islands (pictured) and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty' Ownership: China claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea . The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake. There are soldiers there and if this happens, they are very near each other. I hope there will be no miscalculations or aggressiveness on both sides.' 'The president will raise... definitely the reclamation . issue,' Foreign Ministry official Luis Cruz official told . reporters. 'We would aim for a collective statement, this time . on the issue of the reclamation of some features in the South . China Sea.' Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak hosts the 26th . Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, which . begins on Friday. In an interview with AFP last week, President Aquino said the world should fear China's actions in the disputed sea, warning they could lead to military conflict. The United States' military commander for Asia has said China could eventually deploy radar and missile systems on the outposts it is building in the region, which would give it the power to enforce an exclusion zone. China's ambassador to the United States has said it was 'natural' that his country's reclamation work would include military defence facilities. Cui Tiankai said there 'should be no illusion that anyone could... repeatedly violate China's sovereignty without consequences'. Its actions in the South China Sea have been described as 'aggressive' by Senator John McCain, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. He urged President Obama's administration to move more military resources into the economically important Asian region - and boost cooperation with Asian countries worried by China. Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki said China had a duty to address regional concerns And his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yong stressed the importance of stability in the South China Sea for trading nations like his. China's leadership hit back at U.S. President Barack Obama who recently condemned the country for constructing the artificial island on Mischief Reef. Obama claimed Beijing was 'using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions'.","Philippines voiced alarm about Chinese 'aggressiveness' in the South China Sea ahead of war games with the US .

Sarah, 23, was devastated to find out the man she's always thought was her father is not her biological parent as she appeared on today's Jeremy Kyle Show . Phil, who has raised Sarah, was equally upset to learn he is not her real father and was comforted by her and presenter Jeremy Kyle, left, on the ITV show . Presenter Jeremy Kyle, left, broke the news of the DNA test to Phil and Sarah . Sarah's mother had dropped the bombshell that Phil - who had raised Sarah - may not actually be related to her last year. In an experience akin to the plot of musical Mamma Mia, Sarah was told one of three men could be her father. Determined to find out the truth, the pair went on the Jeremy Kyle Show - famed for it's revealing DNA tests - to get an answer. Before the results were revealed, Sarah spoke of how Phil has always been a father figure in her life. The pair appeared on the show after Sarah's mother told her last year that Phil wasn't her real father . She said: 'He put a roof over my head, he's always been there for me. I'd be over the moon if he was my father. I don't know what I will do if he's not but he will still be like father to me.' Phil added: 'Whatever happens today she will still be my daughter. If she is, it will be the proudest day of my life.' Jeremy read a statement from Sarah's mother - who is no longer in contact with her daughter - in which she confirmed Phil was not Sarah's father. But Sarah and Phil wanted to have the DNA test to know for sure. Before finding out the DNA results, Phil said it would be the proudest day of his life if Sarah was his daughter, while she said she would be 'over the moon' The DNA test confirmed Phil and Sarah are not related but they said it won't change their relationship . 'I want to find out truth, it's been going too long now,' Sarah said. But her fears were realised when the DNA test confirmed Phil was not her father. On hearing the news, Phil held his head in his hands while Sarah burst into tears. The pair hugged and vowed the truth would not change their relationship - while Jeremy said the show's team would give them any support they needed moving forward. On discovering the truth, Phil told Jeremy he will always be a father to Sarah . Wiping away her tears, Sarah said: 'I would like to find out who but my real father is but Phil will always be my dad.' Jeremy told Phil that he should still be proud of himself: 'You can make a baby in a millisecond but it takes 23 years of support to make a dad.'

"It wasn't just Steve McQueen's rugged looks that sent ladies into a frenzy in the 1960s. The actor's enduring sex appeal may have been boosted by his aftershave, Eau Sauvage, which contained a potent chemical known as Hedione. Now scientists have revealed how this chemical activates the hypothalamus - an area of the brain responsible for triggering the release of sex hormones in women. Scroll down for video . It wasn't just Steve McQueen's rugged looks that sent ladies into a frenzy in the 1960s. The actor's enduring sex appeal may have been boosted by his aftershave, Eau Sauvage, which contained a potent chemical known as Hedione. Pictured is Steve Mcqueen starring in the 1965 film The Cincinnati Kid . Hedione - derived from the Greek word 'hedone', for fun, pleasure, lust - has a fresh jasmine-magnolia scent. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage, was the first to use it in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne, Paco by Paco Rabane and Chanel no. 19. The latest study shows how Hedione - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro-jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor VN1R in humans. This activates part of the hypothalamus - an area of the brain responsible for triggering the release of sex hormones in women. Hedione - derived from the Greek word 'hedone', for fun, pleasure, lust - has a fresh jasmine-magnolia scent. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage, was the first to use it in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne and Chanel no. 19. The study found that Hedione creates 'sex-specific activation patterns' in the tissue found in the nasal cavity which connects to the brain, according to a report in the Telegraph. Here Hedione - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro-jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor VN1R in humans. 'These results constitute compelling evidence that a pheromone effect different from normal olfactory perception indeed exists in humans,' says scent researcher Prof Hanns Hatt from Ruhr-Universität Bochum in Germany. Scientists analysed brain activity when a person smelled Hedione to find out how it changed their emotions and behaviour. They then compared the results with the effects caused by a common floral fragrance known as phenylethyl alcohol. Hedione triggered brain areas in the limbic system, which is responsible for emotions, memory and motivation, more effectively than phenylethyl alcohol. It also activated an area of the hypothalamus which releases sex hormones throughout body to turn people on. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage (left), was the first to use Hedione in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne and Chanel no. 19 (right) The German study found that Hedione activated a specific hypothalamic region, in women more strongly than in men. But scientists are still divided over whether humans can actually communicate via pheromones. In the animal kingdom, this kind of communication is widespread. Mice have around 300 different genes for pheromone receptors; in humans, probably only five of them are still functional. 'In the next stage, we want to find out which physiological and psychological parameters are affected when Hedione activates the pheromone receptor,' explains Hanns Hatt. 'We also have to search for scent molecules in bodily secretions, which resemble Hedione and activate the receptor. 'With its help, humans could actually communicate with each other.'","Actor was famous for wearing Christian Dior's Eau Sauvage aftershave .

"A lesbian couple in North Carolina who documented how they created their new family in a series of online pictures say they are shocked but thankful after people said the catalogue of images were an 'inspiration'. In order to start their new family, the moms, Melanie and Vanessa Iris Roy, decided to each carry a child one year apart. They took photos at each stage of their respective pregnancies, recording when their first child, a son Jax, was born followed by their daughter Ero, a year later. The couple then uploaded the images to Instagram and they quickly went viral - their young family becoming an unexpected internet sensation almost overnight. Scroll down for video .

The women say they are shocked and overwhelmed at the support their photos have garnered online, after each documented their pregnancy . 'It's crazy to see that people were referring to my family as an inspiration,' Melanie told The Huffington Post. 'We are still in complete shock.' The pictures show the women together when each one is pregnant, in a series of snaps that show how they supported eachother as their bodies - and their family - changed. Other photos show them with one child when the other is expecting, and then with their family of four. Each wanted to be mothers, so they said said the decision to create their family of four was an easy one. The Roys hope by sharing the experience they would inspire other same sex couples to start a family. Melanie added: 'The woman's body is incredible. The way it creates and grows another human being is amazing. We hope that our picture is that sign that some women may need to encourage them to carry a child.' Each of the women said they hope the pictures will inspire others to start a family and celebrate how the body changes during pregnancy .

"GoPro director Nick Woodman is set to be named the highest-paid CEO of 2014 at the tender age of 39. The pioneering camera innovator clinched the title after being granted 4.5 million restricted stock units - valued at $284.5 million - at the end of the year. It won him the top spot on the annual Bloomberg Pay Index. Slumping to second place, Chenerie Energy's Houston-based chief executive Charif Souki was valued at $281 million. And now the firm has announced it is cutting his pay. In his prime: GoPro creator Nick Woodman, 39, is set to be named America's highest-paid CEO of 2014 . Woodman's product - a camera which can be fixed to helmets, the body, or a hand-held pole - made waves in when it debuted in 2006. They are used by professionals and hobbyists conquering six-foot waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps. The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife Jill giving birth to one of their sons. The Californian surfing couple have come a long way since the business was founded in 2004 with one product: a waterproof film camera. Before sales took off, Woodman posed as the model for their self-made adverts. But his posing days didn't last long. In 2006, the firm launched its first digital camera. Three years later it began selling a high-definition camera. The cameras are light, small and waterproof. They have other uses besides sports. TV producers use them to film in areas where big professional cameras can't go. Since launching its high-definition camera in 2009, it has sold 8.5 million of them, including 3.8 million in 2013. Its cameras are sold in more than 25,000 stores and cost between $200 and $400. The day the company first went public, they sold 3.6 million shares of GoPro stock to rake in an astounding $86 million before taxes.

They are used by professionals and hobbyists conquering 6ft waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps. The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife giving birth to one of their sons. They are WiFi capable, typically come with remotes for control and have a capacity of 64GB currently. They are also versatile thanks to numerous add-ons, including LCD screens, and the most expensive model is $400. Woodman's father, Dean, has also found himself an overnight millionaire. The elder Woodman loaned his son $200,000 to help get GoPro off the ground. Dean Woodman - who sold none of his shares at the IPO - now owns $280 million in GoPro shares. As Forbes notes, that is a 140,000 percent return on his initial $200,000 investment. Its list of competitors is short, but growing. Consumer electronics companies Garmin, Samsung and Sony have all entered the market. GoPro had the best-selling camcorder in 2013, according to government paperwork filed by the company. It also sells accessories such as cases, battery packs and mounts that help users attach their cameras to surfboards, helmets or their wrists. It also has a free app and software that lets users edit, store and publish their videos to their social media accounts including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Additional growth may come from the wild videos its cameras create, which the company hopes to use to create a media company.

"Police in Argentina are hunting a family-of-six who crammed onto one motorbike before riding through the streets without helmets. They were spotted driving through the city of San Miguel de Tucuman in Argentina's north-western province of Tucuman. A man was pictured holding the handlebars of the bike while three young children straddled the petrol tank in front of him and a girl and a woman sat on the seat behind him. People carrier: Two adults and four children were pictured riding on the same motorbike in San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina . It comes just weeks after a similar  pictured emerged of a family of seven riding on the same motorbike though the city of Junin in Argentina's eastern province of Buenos Aires. Describing the most recent case, passer-by Etel Ramirez Nazario, 46, said: 'It was shocking to see. 'Three little children who couldn't be more than three or four were all at the front, the dad was behind them. 'Behind him was another child who I'd say was about seven or eight and then the mum on the back. 'They were going pretty fast and none of them had helmets. I dread to think what would have happened if they had hit another car or fallen off.' Police are also hunting a family of seven seen riding on the same motorbike through the city of Junin just weeks ago . The family's actions were condemned on social media sites after pictures of the incident appeared online in Argentina. One user, Amatista Avalos Muro, wrote: 'This is absolutely unbelievable. These parents are setting their kids up for death.' Another, Ramses Crespo Cruz, posted: 'So sad that some parents are so irresponsible. Those poor children.' Police say they are looking for the parents. A spokesman said: 'We have seen the picture and strongly condemn this utterly irresponsible and dangerous behaviour. 'We have appealed for anyone who recognises the family to come forward.'","Family seen riding through streets of San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina .

"She is best known for her World War II saga, The Cazalet Chronicles, but  novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard had a passion for history of a considerably more ancient kind. The novelist, who died in 2014 aged 90, amassed a spectacular collection of Greek, Egyptian and Roman jewellery during her lifetime, among them pieces up to 3,500 years old. Now the collection is to go under the hammer, with auctioneers saying they expect the exquisite pieces to fetch up to £20,000. Collector: Elizabeth Jane Howard, pictured with Kingsley Amis, collected ancient jewellery . Howard, a former model who became the second wife of Lucky Jim novelist Kingsley Amis in 1965, adored historic jewellery and, despite its great age, was regularly photographed in it. 'Unlike many collectors who prefer to display their treasures, Elizabeth Jane Howard held the view that jewellery was made to be used,' explains Madeleine Perridge, head of antiquities at Bonhams. 'She took great pleasure in wearing beautiful objects that had been worn by women thousands of years ago.' The nine lots, which will go under the hammer at Bonhams auction house in London on Thursday, include rings, bracelets, pendants and earrings. Among the most striking is a gold Roman bracelet made from three gold wires twisted into a spiral design, which has a reserve price of £5,000. Spectacular: This Roman bracelet, which is made from twisted strands of gold, is expected to fetch £5,000 . Beautiful: This pair of earrings are 2,400 years old and are part of a collection thought to be worth £20,000 . Magnificent: This 2,000-year-old pendant depicts the goddess Aphrodite and her son, Eros . A pair of Hellenistic gold hoop earrings, which are thought to be around 2,400 years old, are expected to fetch £2,000. There is also a gold pendant depicting Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, with Eros, the Greek god of love hovering above her right shoulder. The piece is set with a cabochon garnet, a nod to Dionysus, the Greek god of wine-making, festivities and fertility, and is likely to have been presented to its original owner as a love token or wedding gift. Oldest of all the items is a pair of Egyptian gold hair rings which have been dated to somewhere between 1550-1295 BC, and are being sold as part of a lot that includes a pair of Roman earrings. Howard, who was born in 1923, started her career as an actress and model but shot to fame in 1950 when her debut novel, The Beautiful Visit, won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. Subsequent novels included Three Miles Up and Other Strange Stories, Something in Disguise and Getting it Right, although it is the Cazalet Chronicles for which she is best known. The epic six-novel saga charts the fortunes of the eponymous Cazalets, beginning in 1937 as the Second World War looms. Ending in the 1950s, the series has also been described as being a slice of social history and chronicles the changing fortunes of the aristocracy as they face up to a democratic post-war world. But Howard wasn't only known for her books, with the much-married author's tumultuous love life garnering as many headlines as her books. Literary couple: Howard was Kingsley Amis' second wife and the pair married in 1965 . Turbulent: Sadly, their marriage did not last and the couple divorced in 1983 . First married in 1942 to Sir Peter Scott, the conservationist who famously helped found the Worldwide Fund for Nature and provided a scientific name for the Loch Ness Monster, she went on to wed twice more. Of all her marriages, though, it was her turbulent third to Sir Kingsley Amis in 1965 that is best remembered. The pair, who met while both were helping to organise the Cheltenham Literary Festival, eventually divorced in 1983.","The ancient jewels belonged to novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard .

"You can now book a London hotel stay by the number of hours you need the room for rather than by the number of nights you intend to stay. While booking hotels by the hour may have a somewhat seedy reputation, one company is allowing businessman and women and those who need a short rest to book well-known London hotels in three-hour blocks. Barcelona-based booking platform ByHours allows users to organise stays of three, six and 12 hours, and it has already got 25 hotels in the capital on board. You can enjoy the luxury of the Academy Hotel in London for a three-hour slot with ByHours.com . The App allows the user to select their area, and then their time slot, to be then shown a list of available hotels .

Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney Ray Larson would not say if there were other suspects, what the men are accused of stealing or how many weapons were used. 'I suspect that if there are other arrests the police will say that,' Larson said. 'I really am not going to talk about the facts of a pending case. And if you were on trial, you'd want me to say that.'

"A mother who one day woke up believing she was a teenager after losing 17 years of memory overnight is set to detail her remarkable experience in a new book. In 2008, Naomi Jacobs - then aged 32 - woke up terrified of her son, in totally unrecognisable surroundings and thought she was 15 years old. Overnight, she had been struck with Transient Global Amnesia, a form of memory loss brought on by stress that had wiped the 'episodic' part of her memory. Naomi Jacobs was 32 when she woke up one morning having lost her memory of the past 17 years of her life . The last thing she could remember was falling asleep in her bunk bed as a schoolgirl, dreaming about a boy she had a crush on. She thought it was 1992, John Major was prime minister and she was about to sit her GCSEs. Mobile phones were still the size of a house brick, the internet a mystery - and her 10-year-old son was a stranger. But Miss Jacobs told the BBC it was when her son bounded up to her yelling 'mum' that she succumbed to 'total shock'. She said: 'Everything from fear to joy from seeing this child that I didn't have any memory of giving birth to, but knew undoubtedly that he was mine because he looked so much like me, to terror of having the responsibility of this small child. 'I was convinced that I was going to fall asleep again that night and wake up in 1992. It wasn't real to me what was happening.' Miss Jacobs pictured as a 15-year-old - the age she believed she was when she woke up one morning when struck by amnesia in her early 30s . Miss Jacobs had Transient Global Amnesia, a form of memory loss brought on by stress. It affects five in 100,000 people in Britain, rising to 23 in 100,000 in the over 50s. Before her attack, Miss Jacobs, of Manchester, was worrying about a homeopathy business she ran. She was studying for a psychology degree and had her final exams approaching, and had recently split up with the father of her child. The condition caused the 'episodic' part of her memory to shut down, meaning she had lost all her emotional memories. But her semantic memory was still intact, meaning she could remember things she had repeated over time such as how to drive and phone numbers she had regularly dialled. Miss Jacobs has previously described lying awake at night and crying as she desperately tried to make sense of her life and longed to be back at school. She is now set to detail how she began to understand who she was in a new book, titled Forgotten Girl. The book reveals how she went about piecing her life back together using her personal diaries and those close to her. There is no specific treatment for Transient Global Amnesia other than support and reassurance from family and loved ones. Fortunately, Miss Jacobs had this support, and after eight weeks her memory began to return to normal. Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a type of amnesia involving the sudden, temporary disturbance in an otherwise healthy person's memory. The leading hypotheses are some form of epileptic event, a problem with blood circulation around, to or from the brain, or some kind of migraine-like phenomenon. TGA attacks are associated with some form of precipitating event in at least one-third of cases. In females, this event is more often of a strong emotional character; in males, it is more often related to some physical exertion. The most commonly cited precipitating events include sexual intercourse, swimming in cold water or enduring other temperature changes, and emotionally traumatic or stressful events. TGA is most common in people between age 56 and 75, with the average age of a person experiencing TGA being approximately 62.","Naomi Jacobs woke up one morning believing she was 15 years old .

"Recorder Philip Cattan (pictured), 65, from Cheshire was seen to fall asleep during the rape trial of John Quingley at Manchester Crown Court . A Judge who fell asleep while a child abuse victim gave evidence and caused the trial to collapse has been reprimanded by his bosses . The part-time judge, Recorder Philip Cattan, 65, from Cheshire was seen to fall asleep during the rape trial of John Quingley at Manchester Crown Court last summer. A retrial had to be ordered and with the child having to give evidence for a second time, the Daily Mirror reported. While the jury was out of the room, the judge was confronted with the claim that he had slept through part of the cross-examination of the witness, who was giving evidence via videolink because of her age. The incident was witnessed by the family of the victim in the trial of John Quigley, which was expected to last five days . The girl giving evidence was the first of two young girls expected to testify that they were abused in offences spanning from 2006 to 2013. The body that regulates the judiciary, the Judicial Conduct Investigations office has rapped the Manchester recorder over the incident. The Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice were quoted as saying they found evidence of serious misconduct following complaints that Cattan gave the appearance of falling asleep. The cost of the abandoned trial and the retrial is believed to have cost the taxpayer £10,000. The defendant, Quingley, 49, of Benchill Manchester was found guilty of child sex charges and jailed for 14 years. Leading criminal barrister, Kama Melly, who specialises in child sex crime, told the Daily Mirror, when the trial was suspended, that it is always devastating for a victim to have a trial delayed so long while an investigation takes place. ‘This is no doubt a traumatic time for the family and this will only serve to make matters worse for them,’ she explained. The Lord Chief Justice Thomas of Cwmgiedd (left) and the Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling (right) were quoted as saying they found evidence of serious misconduct following complaints that Cattan fell asleep . Cattan’s role as recorder means he sits for up to thirty days a year as a judge and he has previously. He has overseen cases on gangland murders, the Oldham riots and major drugs cases. Judge Gabriel Hutton, a former senior judge at Gloucester Crown Court, fell asleep during the trial of Lee Woodward, who was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl on a riverbank in Sharpness, Gloucestershire. He was granted bail and a retrial was demanded where he was cleared. Judge Hutton, now retired, was ordered to apologise for the incident.

"A young woman has revealed details about her lengthy battle with a rare condition that left her unable to eat anything for a year and a half – despite the fact that she still felt desperately hungry. Kyli Wilfson, a self-confessed ‘food person’, was 26 when she first started experiencing agonizing pain – which made her feel like she had been ‘kicked in the abdomen' – whenever she ate, a symptom which doctors initially brushed off as being due to a mild pancreatic problem which would ‘resolve itself’ in a matter of days. Kyli, now 29, was eventually diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, and the North Carolina resident found herself looking at a lifetime spent on a feeding tube, as the disease, which effects less than .01 per cent of people, would only get worse. Within months she had dropped to a startling 80lbs, she revealed to Cosmopolitan.com, and  had to postpone her wedding as she spent more and more time in hospitals. Mystery illness: Kyli Wolfson, pictured, had trouble getting a correct diagnosis when she woke up in excruciating pain in October 2012; her illness left her unable to eat for a year and a half . At first, doctors faced difficulties even diagnosing Kyli; though she'd had digestive problems for years, her rare disease wasn't initially considered. Instead, doctors at her local ER insisted that she had acute pancreatitis, a condition that commonly effects heavy drinkers. However, Kyli's pain continued to return every time she tried to eat anything — even soup — leading her to visit two more hospitals in search of a new diagnosis and a cure. 'It never even changed,' she said, explaining that when she tried to eat, it felt like she was burning on the inside. 'It was still ten-out-of-ten pain.' Three months after her first visit to the emergency room, she was finally diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, a condition she had likely had since birth but was only found after doctors put a camera down her throat to her pancreas — a potentially life-threatening procedure that was only tried after all other options had been exhausted. Literally starving: Still maintaining an appetite but unable to eat without pain, Kyli was constantly hungry — leading her fiancé Dustin Wood to feel bad eating in front of her . Rapid weight loss: Kyli's weight, which is normally at around 110lbs, dropped to 80lbs when she was at her lightest . Sufferers of the illness, which is characterized by an inflammation of the pancreas, have to be fed through a feeding tube because the condition never improves, and eventually leads to permanent damage. Kyli spent a year and half abstaining from eating entirely, which was an incredibly trying ordeal for both her and her fiancé Dustin Wood. 'We're food people,' she said. 'We [love] to bake, order takeout. Now he felt bad eating in front of me.' Luckily, Kyli found a support group for people who have chronic pancreatitis on Facebook, some of whom said they found a way to eat: a risky surgical procedure to remove the pancreas, spleen, gallbladder, appendix, and duodenum, which allows the pancreas' cells to be transplanted into the liver, enabling it to function as a pancreas. So Kyli flew to a hospital in Minnesota that specializes in the 14-hour surgery, and scheduled her procedure for January 2014. Enduring love: Kyli's wedding to fiancé Dustin is back on, now scheduled three years after she first went to the emergency room with stomach pain . After her surgery, Kyli spent another two and a half weeks using a feeding tube before being told to try food again. 'I was excited, but nervous, since it had been so long since I'd eaten,' she said. 'Sure enough, I had chicken broth and juice and it didn't affect anything. It was amazing.' She soon began enjoying ice cream, lobster, and pizza, and was able to return to her normal weight of 110lbs.

"Could these be the boots of a disembodied samurai soldier, lingering mysteriously behind this little girl? A spooky dark visage that appears behind the child in this photograph has sparked online rumours of a ghost. This photograph was captured in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan - 'nearby some samurai tombs', apparently - late last year. The Reddit user who posted it online - a friend of the photographer - insisted it was 'not photoshopped' and that paranormal forces could be at work. 'I'm not saying it's anything - just that it looks an awful lot like disembodied boots and legs...' 'Obiaruf ' told users. Scroll down for video . A trick of the light or paranormal forces at play? There is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is . Eerie: A pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there . The Reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure . He then suggested they appeared to be 'samurai boots to me'. 'I know there are several very old samurai tombs nearby. 'Again, not saying that this is what is there, just that, based on preliminary research, this is my best guess...' Photographs from the same set show the little girl with nothing behind her and the snapper 'swears' there was nothing behind her at the time. In this picture from the same set, no one appears to be standing behind this little girl . However, in this other picture, the black boots have returned . Another conspirator suggested they could be combat boots from the World War II era. 'My grandfather was in the pacific theater (Okinawa Japan) in WWII and I recognize what the man in the background is wearing. Its a US Navy Uniform from WWII.' But not everyone was so convinced by the tricky picture. Some users suggested it was likely an optical illusion - a trick of the light - or the presence of a real-life human being. Or both. 'Looks like a living person in boots and dark pants and a light blue, possibly denim colored shirt,' said Jack_Shid. Sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl . 'Because of the perspective, the rest of the person is hidden behind the girl . Last month, a chilling image emerged on the 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook past, with its owner claiming it showed the ghost on a young drowning victim. The photograph, which was taken in 2014, was posted on Facebook by Australian Kim Davison, from Queensland. Social media users are claiming that the white shape at the back of the image, circled, shows a ghostly face . Photo was taken at Murphy's Hole which is the same location 13-year-old Doreen O'Sullivan drowned in 1915 . Was it Doreen O'Sullivan' ghost? Ms Davison claims her daughter's leg was grabbed by something in the water . The image appeared to show two women and four children swimming at Murphy's Hole in the Lockyer River, south-east Queensland. But Ms Davison and Jessie Lu, the other adult in the photo, were adamant they were only accompanied by three children. It provoked fierce discussion online after it was revealed a little girl had died in the watering hole a century prior. A Brisbane Courier newspaper clipping from November 22 1913 included a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole. 'Doreen O Sullivan, aged 13 years, eldest daughter of Mr. James O'Sullivan was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the Lockyer Creek on Friday afternoon,' the notice read. 'Nearly an hour elapsed, before the body was recovered. The spot, which has always been considered dangerous, is known as Murphy's Hole, and is over 20 foot deep. Ms Davison insisted: 'At the time of taking this photo there was nothing between us. 'I'm holding the little girl and that white head next to me with horns is not human, I can promise you that. 'Its fingers are on my shoulder and on my daughter's arm. They are long skeletal type fingers.' An admin from the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page posted a negative version of the image, saying: 'Light flare will always show up as black shadowing when the photo is inverted.. and in this case the light flare is coming from full sunlight reflecting off the water onto the child' Tragic Doreen O'Sullivan was only 13 when she accidentally drowned in the swimming hole in 1915 . Disturbingly, Ms Davison claims that there had been strange occurrences that day as they swam in the water, which only firms her belief that a spirit was present. 'On this day my daughter had her leg grabbed two times by something in the water.' 'When I went back in for one last dip to cool off I did feel something behind me as I was walking out of water but tried to ignore it. Ms Davison was convinced the shadowy visage in the photograph was Doreen O'Sullivan's photograph. A sceptic responded to Ms Davison's claims, pointing out another possibility. 'The eye sees what it wants to see. In my opinion, it's nothing more than a splash of water,' wrote Max Meara. 'Notice the child facing away from the camera - their left arm has just surfaced, causing a splash.' Brad Glynn had another explanation: 'I think it is another kid just the sun is over exposed more on the face as they are facing the sun.' The 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook page administrators were not convinced by either explanation. 'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!' they wrote. Ms Davison posted the photo on the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page . The administrators were shocked by the photo, writing 'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!' Ms Davison claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915 . Ms Davison was also of the opinion that the figure in the photo was a demon who tried to take her daughter . The spot, which has always been considered dangerous, is known as Murphy's Hole, and is over 20 foot deep .","Are these the ghostly disembodied boots of a samurai soldier?

"Two birds of prey have been caught on camera brutally fighting over a nesting box, staring each other down before attacking each other with sharp talons and beaks. A kestrel and a barn owl repeatedly lunged at each other while trying to gain mastery of the box so they could lay eggs and rear their young in safety. And despite the owl's cuddly reputation, it came out the victor, forcing the kestrel to seek an alternative home for itself and its mate. Face-off: A barn owl and a kestrel have been caught on camera fighting in a nesting box . Conflict: The two birds of prey lunged at each other in a vicious scrap . The fight was captured on video by wildlife photographer Robert Fuller, using a camera he set up inside a 13ft-high elm tree stump in his garden in Thixendale, North Yorkshire. He said that a pair of kestrels had been guarding the nesting box in the tree, but when they left in the evening a barn owl swooped in and laid a claim to the nest. After the owl drove the kestrels away he managed to attract a mate to share his new home - but the kestrels found an alternative nesting box in Mr Fuller's garden. The cameras were set up as part of an exhibition at Mr Fuller's gallery, monitoring the nest of blackbirds, blue tits and pheasants as well as birds of prey. Confrontation: The kestrel was attempting to win back the nesting box after guarding it all day . Flurry: A video camera captured the vicious fight, with the two birds throwing themselves at each other . On top: At one point the kestrel had the owl up against the wall of the box inside an old tree stump . Mr Fuller said: 'The nest has been used in the past by tawny owls and this year the kestrels were showing a lot of interest in it. 'The female was guarding it during the day then in the evening a male barn owl started coming in and calling for a mate. 'The kestrel and barn owl battle is absolutely spectacular footage. It's much more exciting than any soap or drama on TV. 'In the footage you can see the barn owl lands and the kestrel comes right behind and hits so hard it knocks it inside and into the nest wall. 'Both birds are very well equipped to kill things, they have very sharp talons. They often have disputes in the air but here they were in a very confined space. Turnaround: Despite the kestrel's more aggressive reputation, the barn owl ended up defeating it . Victor: At the end of the video the owl can be seen admiring its new home . 'At the beginning the barn owl was looking for an escape route but the male kestrel keeps appearing at the opening. 'Kestrels have a terrier mentality, they're aggressive. Barn owls aren't really but they do have very long legs and talons, it was a fairly even battle. 'The kestrels have been here since 2006 and I feed them in the garden, they're like part of the family. But the barn owl is my favourite bird and I wanted them to nest here too. I didn't want either of them to get injured. 'The barn owl won, he's found a mate now and the kestrels are in a different nesting box in my garden. The female is guarding it day and night, she's not going to get caught out again.' Barn owls and kestrels are both attracted to nests which overlook open land, meaning that it is fairly common for them to compete for the same nesting space.","Two birds of prey fought each other in a North Yorkshire garden .

"Worried: Alice Dreger attended the class at East Lansing High School after her son asked her to sit in on it so she could hear what was going on first hand . An outraged mom live tweeted her son's sex education class after becoming outraged by its abstinence only stance. Author Alice Dreger took to Twitter to express her horror at what she heard at East Lansing High School, in Michigan, when she sat in on a lesson earlier this week. Ms Dreger, a respected professor, began furiously tweeting out the contents of the lesson - which was filled with horror stories about what happened to people who have pre-marital sex. According to the 45 tweets sent by Ms Dreger during the lesson, stories included people who lost all their friends when they became pregnant, people who fell into comas for 11 years after taking drugs and high school dropouts. 'The whole lesson here is ""sex is part of a terrible lifestyle. Drugs, unemployment, failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster"",' tweeted Ms Dreger. She added: 'I feel like raising my hand and saying ""Can I tell my sexual history, which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage?""' Ms Dreger also complained of the incorrect information being handed to the students, who are freshmen in high school, by the teacher, who did not normally work at the school. At one point, paper babies were handed around the class to show how 'easily' condoms fail: the teacher claimed they were ineffective one in six times. ""We are going to roll this dice eight times,' Ms Dreger reported the teacher as saying. 'Every time your number comes up, in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby.' In fact, according to the NHS, just two in 100 women will get pregnant a year when people use condoms correctly. Outrage: Ms Dreger's tweets, above, show just how cross she got during the class earlier this week . Untrue: The school has denied it only teaches abstinence, saying it just happened to be that day's lesson . The tweets went viral, with people across the world getting involved with the debate over sex education. But the school has denied it only teaches abstinence - saying it was just that day's lecture which focused on the subject. 'Abstinence-based instruction teaches that abstinence is the only way to be completely safe, but the curriculum also reviews contraception choices. This parent attended on a day where abstinence was being taught,' high school principal Coby Fletcher said in the statement released to The Lansing State Journal. The school has taken no direct action against Ms Dreger for the tweets. They have, however, banned her from the premises - apart from her son's events - for swearing at the end of the lesson. @alicedreger: The kid has invited me to his health class on sex ed to see how bad it is, so I'm going. But hands over my mouth means I can't live-tweet it . @alicedreger: Uh oh. They stuck me in the corner with my computer and there is wifi....so I can live tweet this. We still pledge loyalty to the flag, huh? @alicedreger: I can't stand this. They're teaching ""abstinence stories"" that worked and non-abstinence"" stories that ""led to consequences."" @alicedreger: The visitor-teacher is telling my kid abstinence education reduces premarital sex. My kid is trying to show her studies that dispute that. @alicedreger: She's being completely condescending. ""You can look up anything on the internet"" Then refers him to site on abstinence education! @alicedreger: I feel like raising my hand and saying ""Can I tell my sexual history, which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage?"" @alicedreger: And how I've had a lot of lovers and have never gotten pregnant by accident? Yes, I had HPV! And I would get the vaccine! @alicedreger: In fact I have had the vaccine! @alicedreger: Now we're hearing a horror story about marijuana use. @alicedreger: The regular health teacher in trying to shut my kid up referred to ""LGBYT."" And how the board decides what we learn. @alicedreger: The guy telling the ""abstinence"" story is now telling us about having sex as a teenager. I'm confused. @alicedreger: Now he's talking about getting a girl preg and them hiding it from their parents. Yup, that's what sexual shame does, dude! @alicedreger: Preg girl got picked on so her friends desserted her. That's what happens if you have sex, kids! Yup! Pregnant and NO FRIENDS! @alicedreger: He and the girl both had alcoholic fathers. But somehow he's not recommending never drinking. @alicedreger: The whole lesson here is ""sex is part of a terrible lifestyle.

Tore their family apart."" FFS. Welcome to sex ed. @alicedreger: This whole story of OD's, people in prison, out-of-marriage pregnancies is ironically a story of this guy's resilience and normalcy. @alicedreger: ""I have a daughter whose 21 and I would go absolutely nuts if I knew she ever let a stranger into her house."" @alicedreger: ""I finally met a great girl who was brought up in abstinence, and her life was so much better. I put her on a pedestal above everyone else."" @alicedreger: ""I liked her so much [I so wanted to **** her] I decided to change my lifestyle and go with abstinence [until I could F*** her]."" @alicedreger: ""Two years after we started dating I asked her to marry me and we're 8 years married."" And I'll bet yer f****, aren't ya! @alicedreger: ""We're not saying having sex is a bad thing. My story I can say having sex was a bad thing for me because I craved it."" @alicedreger: ""You'll find a good girl. If you find one that says 'no,' that's the one you want."" HE ACTUALLY JUST SAID THAT. @alicedreger: ""We can look up things on the internet but until you live that lifestyle you won't see it the same."" The whole talk is ""lifestyle."" @alicedreger: Now the woman is up. ""Sometimes condoms fail."" @alicedreger: She says ""it is absolutely better to use something than nothing"" in terms of birth control. ""But it can fail."" @alicedreger: ""It takes only 1 sperm to fertilize an egg. It takes only 1 time having sex to get pregnant."" Yet she's not suggesting oral or a***. @alicedreger: She's now telling story of condom box in which EVERY SINGLE CONDOM HAD A HOLE. @alicedreger: She says per the FDA 1 out of every 400 boxes of condom can be totally defective. ""You might get that 400th box."" BE AFRAID! @alicedreger: About 18% chance a condom will fail, she says. @alicedreger: ""On average 1 out of 6 times there is a mishap with a condom."" ""Every day in US 1600+ teen pregnancies."" Lesson: condoms fail? WTF? @alicedreger: Condoms. They fail. You get pregnant. Your friends leave you. You drop out of school. Your kids end up in the army. @alicedreger: ""We are going to roll this dice 8 times. Every time your number comes up, in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby.""

There are apparently no scissors in the room for paper abortions. @alicedreger: ""I'm going to collect the babies that you don't want.

"A New York City tattoo parlor at the center of a VH1 reality series just got a serving of drama - but not the kind that makes for good publicity. A woman from South Carolina is suing Harlem tattoo parlor Black Ink, claiming an artist there did a botch job on a chest piece that left her disfigured and in pain. The Harlem tattoo parlor's owner and artists star in their own reality show, Black Ink Crew, which has had three seasons. Scroll down for video . Scarred: Asabi Barner, 37 (pictured), is suing Black Ink tattoo parlor in Harlem, New York City for a chest tattoo that left her scarred . The damage: Barner says she went to the parlor after watching the reality show which features the shop on VH1 . In pain: Barner said she trusted the artists, but came away with a tattoo that remains painful a year later . Asabi Barner told PIX 11 that she visited New York last year and decided to stop by the parlor to get a new tattoo to cover up a unicorn and horseshoe piece that she got when she was 18. She said she had watched the parlor's reality show and trusted the artists, who specialize in tattooing on dark skin tones. Barner left the shop happy with her 'phenomenal' new chest tattoo of fruits and vegetables to represent her career in the culinary industry. Reality stars: The owner and artists at Black Ink tattoo star in their own VH1 reality show, Black Ink Crew . But the next day she was still in pain and then noticed that the tattoo started to puss and ooze in the area around her left breast. Back home in South Carolina, Barner asked a local tattoo artist what was wrong and the artist said that her skin had been  'overworked' in an attempt to bring out a white color in the tattoo.  She also went to a plastic surgeon to see if the tattoo could be remedied, but the doctor said any procedure would only leave a bigger scar. More than a year later, Barner says she has to apply a ice pack to the tattoo every day to relieve the burning and itching pain. Photos of the botched tattoo show Barner's chest covered in raised scars that have left her uncomfortable in her own skin. 'In the intimate moments it creates a problem because you don’t have that confidence. I wasn’t overly confident before, but I felt good about myself. Felt good about my body, but it just changes you,' Barner told PIX 11.

"She was chained inside Cleveland's 'house of horrors' for almost 10 years - the longest of the three women who were kidnapped, imprisoned and abused by Ariel Castro. But Michelle Knight, who appeared at the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center's Faces of Change Luncheon on Wednesday, refuses to be considered a victim.

Speaking out: Michelle Knight, who was held captive by Ariel Castro for more than a decade, spoke Wednesday at the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center Faces of Change Luncheon . Part of that flourishing, it seems, is a new relationship. According to Fox 8 Cleveland, Knight was signing copies of her book, Finding Me: A Decade of Darkness, a Life Reclaimed, after the event, when she revealed to readers that she does has a boyfriend. Knight did not reveal anymore about the man in her life, but said she feels comfortable sharing her story, because it can give others 'the same courage, hope and faith that I had'. She has a second book that she is working on based on what has become of her life since being rescued from Castro's house on May 6, 2013. Amanda Berry managed to escape from the house with her six-year-old daughter, with a neighbor calling police. Knight and the third victim, Georgina 'Gina' DeJesus, were then rescued.

Castro pleaded guilty to 937 criminal counts of rape, kidnapping, and aggravated murder as part of a plea bargain and was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years. However, less than one month into the sentence, he hanged himself using the bed sheets in his cell. During the talk at Wednesday's luncheon, Knight mentioned Castro, saying he too had been abused and did not seek help. 'My healing process is going forward,' Knight said. 'I’m starting to be more free now; I’m able to talk about it without crying.' The luncheon raised a record $254,000 for the center, which counsels rape survivors.

"Ever wondered if your personality was decided at birth? It turns out, the order in which you were born can not only have an effect on your personality, but also your chances of academic success. According to Canadian duo Mitchell Moffit and Greg Brown, from Toronto, who present an online science show, several theories suggest that where you are in your family determines who you are. Scroll down for video . (Pictured from left to right: Khloé, Kourtney and Kim Kardashian). The Kardashians are a strong example of a large celebrity family where the siblings share very different personality traits . On AsapSCIENCE on YouTube, the pair discuss how being the first, middle, youngest, or an only child affects us. The personality traits are also supposedly affected by whether parents have high expectations and how strict they were. FIRST-BORNS . According to Mitchell and Brown, first-born children are expected to be higher academic achievers and more ambitious. They also have a stronger sense of responsibility and are generally more mature. (Pictured from left to right) Beyoncé and Kate Middleton are famous first-borns. Oldest children tend be ambitious and have strong leadership skills . They also tend to have better leadership skills than other birth orders. The explanation is because although they get a lot more affection and attention from their parents, their parents have higher expectations as the first child. This works as a self-fulfilling prophecy: if there are high expectations placed on you, you are more likely to want to work hard and live up to these expectations. (Pictured from left to right) Kim Kardashian and Madonna are famous middle-borns. Middle children tend to be co-operative and are more likely to be social butterflies . MIDDLE-BORNS . Middle-born children apparently tend to be more co-operative, flexible and sociable. They are also the birth order that are able to make and maintain friendships easily. This is due to the fact that as a middle-born child, there aren't the high expectations of the first child, nor the relaxed attitude accorded to the last child. As a result, they also tend to be less ambitious than their older brothers and sisters, and so will have a more relaxed attitude in life. As middle children receive less attention than their other siblings, they seek out relationships and friendships outside of their family, and can be social butterflies. (Pictured from left to right) Jennifer Lawrence and Angelina Jolie are famous youngest children. Last-borns tend to be charming and confident . LAST-BORNS . The video highlights how youngest children tend to be likeable and charming. Other traits they carry are that they are more creative than older siblings, and have a stronger sense of security and confidence. As their parents have already had other children, they tend to be a lot less strict and are a lot more lenient with their youngest children. Parents' expectations will also be lower. As a result, youngest children will generally be less responsible and mature than older siblings, as they constantly feel like others will take the lead. (Pictured from left to right) Leonardo DiCaprio and Drew Barrymore are famous only-children. Only children tend to be creative and responsible . ONLY CHILD . Only children tend to be academically-able, creative and resourceful. They are also mature and responsible, and dislike disorder and like to be in control. Being a parent's only child, expectations are always high, but unlike a first-born, they never need to fight for the attention of their parents. Not to mention, being in a household with only adults often leads the child to mature more quickly and copy the actions of the parents, rather than being moulded by siblings' childish or youthful interests. But because they have never had to interact with siblings or companions of a similar age, they can have trouble relating to peers and can feel out of control when things in their life don't go their way. The presenters of the video highlight that these are just theories relating to order of birth. They add that gender, social status, age gaps between siblings and the number of siblings can play a huge role in determining traits. Moffit and Brown reiterate: 'Some aspects may be true for you, or make a lot of sense, but it wouldn’t be the same for every single person around the world in your specific birth order. 'It’s important to remember that your personality and your destiny in life is not predetermined at birth.'","Mitchell Moffit and Greg Brown from AsapSCIENCE present theories .

"Tons of rotting fish have filled a lagoon in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where Olympic rowing and canoeing events will be held during next year's Games. Over the past week, thousands of the silver fish have died and have been scooped out of Rodrigo de Freitas lake, but city authorities and biologists have argued about the cause. More than 37 tons of fish have been collected, according to Rio's waste management company, but there is still an overwhelming stench, sparking complaints from neighbours and passers-by. Clearing: Rio's waste management company said it has cleared more than 37 tons of fish, which have been taken to the city's main dump . Olympics: Rodrigo de Freitas lake is set to host the Olympic rowing and canoeing events during next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . There is an overwhelming stench coming from the lake and authorities and biologists have argued about about the cause of the deaths . Rubbish collectors will continue to rake the decomposing fish, a small silvery species called twaite shad, off the water's surface until the the mass dying subsides. They are being taken to the city's main dump. The die-offs are common in Rio, where rivers, lakes and even the ocean are blighted by raw sewage and garbage. Rower and Olympic hopeful Felipe Xavier said: 'I have to come train but these dead fish bother us because the smell is very strong and the huge amount of fish slows the boat.' But Alexandre Fernandez, rowing coach of Botafogo club based in Rio, said he had no worries about the phenomenon and  believes the cause was natural, not because of pollution. In February, twaite shad died  in the blighted waters of Guanabara Bay, where the Olympic sailing events are to be held. Members of a local rowing club have to train among the dead fish in Rodrigo de Freitas lake ahead of the Olympic Games in the city in 2016 .

The dead fish are being scooped out of the water by rubbish collectors using nets and are then taken to Rio de Janeiro's main dump . Rio's environmental secretariat has insisted that the latest incident is the result of a sudden change in water temperature. 'The intense rains that happened last week and a rise in the sea levels led to a spike in the (sea) water entering the lake, causing a thermal shock,' it said in a statement, reporting that water temperature in the lake quickly fell by 4C. However, several scientists have rejected that explanation, saying that pollution is really to blame. Estefan Monteiro da Fonseca, an oceanographer at Fluminense Federal University, said the official explanation 'makes no sense'. Despite more than 37 tons of the fish being removed from the water, there is still an overwhelming stench which has prompted complaints . Picturesque? Rio de Janeiro's stunning landscape has been blighted by the dead fish, which are currently being cleared from the water .

Alexandre Fernandez (not pictured), rowing coach of Botafogo club, said he's not worried and believes the cause of the deaths was natural . He said: 'The lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage.' He added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it, and depending on the wind, that material rises to the surface and kills fish. Rio's water quality has become one of the most contentious issues heading into the 2016 Olympics. Authorities have long said  the games would be the catalyst for a major cleanup of the city's waterways, but as the  sporting event approaches with few improvements, they are now admitting that the Olympic promises won't be met.

"Pregnant women who suffer extreme morning sickness are at greater risk of their children having language and speech delays, and attention disorders, warn researchers. A new study shows the condition suffered by the Duchess of Cambridge during both her pregnancies triples the risk of developmental problems compared with women who have normal nausea and vomiting. About 10,000 women a year in the UK are affected by the debilitating hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) - a severe form of morning sickness which causes constant vomiting, crippling weakness and dehydration. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum - the severe morning sickness suffered by Kate Middleton - are more likely to have children with language and speech delays, and attention disorders, a study claims . A new study from the University of California, Los Angeles, (UCLA) looks specifically at whether the condition affects brain development in childhood. Marlena Fejzo, an associate researcher in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said the link appeared to be due to lack of nutrition in early pregnancy – especially in the first five weeks – rather than medication. She said: ‘These findings show that it is vital to take HG seriously so these pregnant women can get nutritional support right away. ‘An encouraging finding is that we did not find any association with medications to treat this disorder and neurodevelopmental delays, so I speculate that the neurodevelopmental outcomes are more likely caused by nutrient deficiency early in pregnancy rather than medication.’ The research appears in the online edition of the European Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Reproductive Biology. The study looked at 312 children born to 203 mothers with HG between 2007 and 2011 and compared those to 169 children born to 89 mothers who did not have HG. More than 1,000 women with severe morning sickness have an abortion each year because their symptoms are so unbearable, research shows. Many are denied vital yet relatively cheap treatment by GPs who expect them to simply ‘get on with it’ or end their pregnancy. The condition Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) – which the Duchess of Cambridge has suffered during both her pregnancies – affects about one in 100 expectant mothers a year. It is far more severe than ordinary morning sickness and some women are left bedbound or need to be admitted to hospital due to extreme dehydration. Research by abortion provider BPAS and Pregnancy Sickness Support found many women were refused treatment because doctors deemed it too costly, unnecessary or potentially harmful. The disorders found included attention and sensory disorders and learning, speech and language delays. Dr Fejzo said the mechanism for exposure to HG and the resulting abnormal neurologic development is not clear. The women in the study experienced nausea and vomiting so severe that they lost at least five pounds and became so dehydrated they needed intravenous fluids. Children exposed in the womb to HG had a 3.28-fold increased risk of neurodevelopmental delays. Dr Fejzo said: ‘There is an urgent need to address whether aggressive treatment that includes vitamin and nutrient supplementation in women with early symptoms of severe nausea and vomiting decreases that risk of neurodevelopmental delay.’ Previous studies have shown that HG is associated with low birth weight babies, small size for gestational age and pre-term births. Earlier research by Dr Fejzo’s team found HG was associated with a 3.6-fold increased risk of behavioural or emotional disorders in adults. The researchers are investigating the genetic basis of HG, as well as looking at risk factors and outcomes. They also hope to determine whether earlier treatment in women with symptoms limits or prevents the adverse outcomes identified in this study. The study states: ‘A significant increase in neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders in children exposed to HG in utero was demonstrated which suggests HG may be linked to life-long effects on the exposed fetus. ‘The cause for this is unknown, but may be due to maternal stress, abnormal hormone levels during fetal development and/or maternal-newborn bonding after birth, or malnutrition and vitamin deficiency.’ Some women with the extreme sickness experienced nausea and vomiting so severe that they lost at least 5lbs (2.27kg) and became so dehydrated they needed intravenous fluids (file photo)","Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) triples risk compared with regular sickness .

Four were killed instantly in the collision. Of the 13 people injured, one later died in hospital from their wounds . Veronica and Ely’s sister, who has not been identified, were both killed in the horrific accident which involved eight to ten vehicles. Two young children travelling with them survived the incident. Veronica Gonzalez was herself badly injured. She lost a leg and remained unconscious in critical condition yesterday. She had not been told the fate of her sister and girlfriend. Local police said the series of collisions took place just past the freeway’s westbound Oakland boulevard exit. The first crash - the incident the good Samaritans stopped at - occurred when a when a driver slammed onto a concrete barrier on the stretch of road’s central reservation, local police said. An 18-wheeler Ryder truck later careered into the earlier crash and those people unfortunate enough to have been caught up at the scene. It then burst into flames. Veronica (right) died at the scene of the crash. Ely (left) lost a leg in the incident and has not regained consciousness. The lorry was transporting the Sunday edition of local daily the Star Telegram, the newspaper’s website reported. Fort Worth firefighters found the truck on fire when they arrived. Fire Department lieutenant Kyle Falkner was quoted as saying such a fire could happen in high-speed crashes. What happened to the vehicle’s diver is unknown. The 18 Wheeler which caused so much devastation - the vehicle burst into flames because of the speed of the crash, fire fighters said . The crash occured on interstate 30 - in the first accident a motorist ploughed into the central reservation . Two of the dead were identified by the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office Sunday: Gonzalez and Mary Hernandez, 42, both of Fort Worth. Friends of another couple of good Samaritans caught at the scene Steve and Tracy Franklin. It is understood that Steve was also killed in the crash with Tracy reportedly in critical condition. The family owned an air-conditioning business in Arlington. Veronica ‘Roni’ Gonzalez had just celebrated her 43rd birthday. Her cousin Sarafina Gonzalz was quoted as saying she was a ‘loving, caring’ person who loved to dance.","Woman celebrating with her fiance was killed in fiery collision with truck .

"When Jason Archinaco's wife said she wanted to get a fourth cat, it is unlikely that this is quite the  addition to the household she imagined. Because, since Monday, the family have been sharing their home with arguably Los Angeles' most famous mountain lion, P-22. The cougar, the other name for the species, has made his home in the crawlspace under the house in the hilly Los Feliz neighborhood - and has so far resisted all attempts to get him to move out. Scroll down for video . New home: The lion - known as P-22 - was found by workers in the crawl space at midday on Monday . Rescue: Attempts to get the lion to move out - including firing tennis balls - have so far been unsuccessful . Resident: The beautiful animal may have been living in the crawlspace for some time before being discovered . Workers discovered the big cat on Monday at noon, as they were trying to install a security system. Ten hours later - despite animal welfare officers using a prod, and even firing tennis balls and bean bags at it - he was still refusing to move. 'I don't think he's going to come out,' Archinaco told  KNBC-TV. 'He's probably been living here for a while. 'He thinks this is his den.' But then, this level of determination will probably come as no surprise to those who know the tale of P-22. It is thought the lion crossed the 405 and 101 freeways more than three years ago, as he travelled from his home in the Santa Monica Mountains. He has been living in nearby Griffith Park ever since - where scientists managed to catch and tag him. But his fame reached new heights after National Geographic photographer Steve Winter managed to capture him walking in front of the Hollywood sign in 2013. Then, last year, the big cat survived mange and a meal of rat poison to become apparently healthy again. Fame: P-22 is best-known for being pictured in front of the Hollywood sign in 2013 . Hiding: It is thought the lion crossed two freeways to get to his home in Griffith Park, but it is not known how long he has been living in the crawl space in the Los Feliz hills . Beanbags: The animal rescue workers have even resorted to using beanbags to move the lion . However, all this is nothing to the furore surrounding his latest move. The LA Times reports a scene worthy of any film star - with news vans filling the street, helicopters flying overhead and even a live news feed on a local channel reporting the latest. However, they were not rewarded for their patience, and state wildlife officials cleared most media and gawkers away from the area as night fell. They continued with their attempts to dislodge P-22, starting with poking him gently with a long prod, but that did little — other than temporarily lose the pricey GoPro camera they'd attached to the end of it that fell off. They then attempted to fire a tennis ball cannon into the crawl space with hopes that at least the noise and commotion would scare him out, a tactic that often works with coyotes. Next, they fired small bean bags, the same kind police sometimes use for human crowd control, toward the cat. Live feed: The incident has created quite a furore - with people watching it unfold live on television (pictured) All of the tactics, shown live on streaming video, drew mild reactions from P-22, but none came close to drawing him out or even getting him to significantly move. Wildlife officials said late Monday night that their next move would be to just wait. 'We're going to let him settle, we're going to let everything calm down, we're going to be really still and give him time to get out of there,' said Janice Mackey of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Archinaco said he and his wife have three ordinary house cats and had thought about adding to their numbers. 'My wife wanted a fourth one,' he said, 'but not this way.'","P-22 has made himself a new den underneath a house in Los Feliz .

That's the synthetic version of the stimulant cathinone, the same type of chemical that is used to make bath salts. The use of flakka  a designer drug that can be even stronger than crystal meth or bath salts, is up in Florida . Flakka can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other drugs and substances like marijuana . Flakka resembles a mix of crack cocaine and meth and it has a noticeably foul smell (bath salts pictured) Flakka resembles a mix of crack cocaine and meth and it has a noticeably foul smell, WPBF 25 News reported. St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office special investigations Sgt. Rob Pettit said: 'It has a strong odor like a sweaty sock. 'It's pretty serious. 'We're always trying to play catchup with the drug dealers as it is, and now here we are trying to get accustomed to finding yet another drug.' Once ingested, the drug causes a feeling of euphoria, hallucinations and sometimes psychosis or apparent superhuman strength. The high lasts for a couple hours and users are left with a strong desire to use again. Users have nicknamed the drug '$5 insanity' because hits often cost less than $10, the Sun-Sentinel reported. Cathinone use is apparently up across the nation and the use of Flakka is also certainly increasing in Florida . Flakka has been involved in a number of incidents in recent weeks, including one where a man impaled himself white trying to scale a fence, CBS reported. Jim Hall, an epidemiologist at the Center for Applied Research on Substance Use and Health Disparities at Nova Southeastern University, said: 'We're starting to see a rash of cases of a syndrome referred to as excited delirium. 'This is where the body goes into hyperthermia, generally a temperature of 105 degrees. 'The individual becomes psychotic, they often rip off their clothes and run out into the street violently and have an adrenaline-like strength and police are called and it takes four or five officers to restrain them. 'Then once they are restrained, if they don't receive immediate medical attention they can die.' There were more than 670 Flakka occurrences in Florida in 2014, up from 85 in 2012 and zero in 2010, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.","Drug is made from same version of stimulant used to produce bath salts .

"These stunning images capture the way young people in Iran are defying the country's hardline Islamic image to create a more Westernised society. Taken in the capital Tehran, the photographs show teenagers and people in their early 20s kissing in public, drinking alcohol and living openly gay lifestyles.

The Iranian youth is also among the most politically active groups within the 57 nations that make up the Islamic world. As the most restive segment of Iranian society, the young also represent one of the greatest long-term threats to the current form of theocratic rule. Young activists have influenced the Islamic Republic's political agenda since 1997. After the 2009 presidential election, the Iranian youth was the biggest bloc involved in the region's first sustained 'people power' movement for democratic change, which helped create a new political dynamic in the Middle East. In many ways the highly-politicised largely Shiite youth of Iran can be seen as a forerunner of the Arab Spring movement that swept the Sunni Muslim world in 2011.

Making a change: The Iranian youth is among the most politically active groups within the 57 nations that make up the Islamic world . Unconventional: A young parkour performer runs, jumps and climbs on metal railings outside a mosque in the Iranian capital Tehran . The Islamic Republic of Iran forcibly regained control over the most rebellious sector of society through detentions, expulsions from universities, and expanding the powers of its own young paramilitary forces following the rise of the 'people power' movement in 2009. But youth demands have not changed, and anger simmers beneath the surface. The regime also remains vulnerable because it has failed to address basic socio-economic problems among the young. The will of young people in Iran has also influenced Iran's changing relationship with the U.S, which has just come to preliminary nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic. The biggest enforcement provision in that agreement is turning into one of the mostly hotly contested elements, however. And the debate barely involves Iran. Instead, it concerns the Obama administration's promise to quickly re-impose sanctions on Iran if the country cheats on any part of the agreement to limit its nuclear program to peaceful pursuits. This would be relatively straightforward for the sanctions imposed by the U.S., as Congress is eager to keep the pressure on. But it is far from clear whether President Barack Obama can guarantee such action at the United Nations, which has imposed wide-ranging penalties that all U.N. members must enforce . As the most restive segment of Iranian society, the young also represent one of the greatest long-term threats to Iran's theocratic rule . Hip hop and break dance performers pose for the camera as the dance in the streets of the modern Ekbatan neighbourhood of Tehran .

Love and religion: A gay couple kiss one another while holding a copy of the Koran as a symbol of the struggle for change in Iran . A young Iranian is seen driving in to the country's desert to join one of the many illegal, alcohol-fuelled parties hosted there . At present, there's no firm agreement on how or when to lift the sanctions in the first place. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, and President Hassan Rouhani yesterday said they want all sanctions lifted on the first day of implementation. That's not the position of U.S. and other negotiators, a major issue that still must be worked out. Assuming it can be, that still would leave the big question of possible re-imposition. The disagreement on this issue is between the U.S. and its European allies on one side, and Russia and China on the other - all countries involved in the nuclear negotiations. And even though all six world powers and Iran agreed last week to the framework agreement that is supposed to be finalized by June 30, the 'snapback' mechanism for U.N. sanctions remains poorly defined and may prove unworkable. 'If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place,' Obama declared last week.

Superman: A young parkour performer runs, jumps and climbs over a concrete bench outside a mosque in the Iranian capital Tehran . Defying the regime: It is illegal for people to kiss in public in Iran - something man young people choose to ignore . Obama went further this week, saying that restoring the international sanctions would not require consensus among U.N. Security Council members. And Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who helped seal last week's pact, insisted 'no one country could block the snapback.' That assertion rests on an informal compromise reached at the talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, to bypass the typical U.N. Security Council process if Iran breaks the agreement. Normally in that body, any one of the five permanent members - the U.S., Britain, France, Russia and China, which are all party to the Iran negotiations - can veto resolutions. But many questions remain, including what would happen if two or more countries object. Russia and China have traditionally opposed almost all U.N. sanctions measures, and, perhaps tellingly, neither country's foreign minister was present when the April 2 framework was unveiled. Washington and its negotiating partners plan to suspend or lift many sanctions after the U.N. nuclear agency confirms Iran has scaled back its activity in accordance with a final deal. But the U.S. and its European partners want the capacity to quickly reinstate the restrictions if Iran reneges.","People aged under 30 currently represent a staggering 63 per cent of Iran's population of 73 million citizens .

Filmmakers said they plan to use the latest digital camera technology as they venture from the planet's ice caps to ocean depths to deserts and remote forest. 'Our Planet' will focus on the Earth's last wilderness areas and the animals living there, the project's British producers said Wednesday. Audiences will have to be patient: The eight-part series will take four years to make and is planned for a 2019 debut for Netflix customers internationally. 'Our Planet' is being produced by U.K.-based Silverback Films in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund, an independent conservation group. Silverback company directors Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey, whose credits include 'Frozen Planet' and 'African Cats' as well as 'Planet Earth,' will lead the production. 'We will reveal the most amazing sights on Earth and show them in ways they have never been seen before,' Fothergill and Scholey promised in a statement. The series is intended to wow 'global audiences with the wonder and importance of the natural world,' they said. 'Netflix is proud to be the global home for perhaps Silverback's most ambitious project to date,' said Lisa Nishimura of the streaming firm.

"Modelling, acting, fashion design... is there anything Michelle Keegan can't do? The star, who started out playing Tina McIntyre in Coronation Street, has launched a stellar career since leaving the cobbled streets of Weatherfield behind. The pint-sized brunette may be busy filming for her new show, as well as modelling in her new Garnier Ambre Solaire campaign, but she's managed to fit designing a new fashion range into her hectic schedule. Scroll down for video . Michelle Keegan, who found fame on Coronation Street, has managed to fit designing a new fashion range for Lipsy into her hectic schedule . The actress and model has unveiled her stunning summer range in full - and shows off her summer dresses embellished with lace and feminine florals to perfection in the new shoot. Michelle, 27, who is getting set to tie the knot with fiance Mark Wright, shows off her summer tan and enviable curves posing by a pool in the new campaign imagery to promote the range, which lands today.

The actress and model shows off her natural beauty posing by the ocean in the summer shoot . The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and says she can't believe how successful they've been . The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash 'flicking' treatments . Michelle Keegan teased fashion fans with some items from her new Lipsy range on Tuesday, and has unveiled her designs in full today . As the clothes horse shows, her new range is full of colourful print playsuits, cool crochet and lots of sophisticated lace. Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Michelle revealed the regime that keeps her fit, healthy and glowing from the inside out. Sharing her top tanning tips for a flawless faux glow as she shows off her natural beauty in behind the scenes imagery, Michelle advised: 'Always exfoliate first and not just knees and elbows, all over your body. 'Next, I moisturise all over and then use Garnier Dry Body Mist all over my body, including the underside of my arms.' The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash treatments. LVL, which stands for length, volume and lift, flicks, curls and straightens lashes from the roots up so they appear much longer. 'It helps make my lashes darker and more voluminous,' says Michelle of the treatment, which takes an hour and a half and lasts over two months. Michelle, 27, has been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want for the warmer months to come . The designer's success shows no sign of abating as she unveils yet another stylish range . The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins serums and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers. In terms of her diet, Michelle starts the day with scrambled egg on brown toast with tomato, followed by a high protein banana smoothie with peanut butter. For lunch, she has a turkey or chicken salad sandwich on brown bread and dinner is salad with chicken or prawn. The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. The star, 27, seen in her Garnier Ambre Solaire campaign, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.'","Michelle unveils full Lipsy summer range .

"A young woman who was subjected to years of abuse by Bega Cheese boss Maurice Van Ryn has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life. For years she kept what Van Ryn did to her a secret, but when she found out he had been caught she knew she had to break her silence. The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, including the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child.

"Surveys find that men in U.S. special operations forces do not believe women can meet the physical and mental demands of their commando jobs, and they fear the Pentagon will lower standards to integrate women into their elite units, according to interviews and documents obtained by The Associated Press. Studies that surveyed personnel found 'major misconceptions' within special operations about whether women should be brought into the male-only jobs. They also revealed concerns that department leaders would 'capitulate to political pressure, allowing erosion of training standards,' according to one document. Up to the mark? Surveys find that men in U.S. special operations forces do not think women can meet the physical and mental demands of their commando jobs . Second best: Male special op combat troops fear the Pentagon will lower standards to integrate women into their elite units . Some of those concerns were not limited to men, researchers found, but also were found among women in special operations jobs. Dan Bland, force management director for U.S. Special Operations Command, told the AP that the survey results have 'already driven us to do some different things in terms of educating the force.' About 68,800 people serve in the command, including 3,000 civilians. The main survey went to about 18,000 people who are in positions closed to women, and the response was about 50 percent. The high response rate, officials said, reflects the wide interest in the subject. The studies are part of the Pentagon's effort to open all military combat positions to women or provide reasons why any jobs should remain closed. One survey, by RAND Corp., reflected doubts that women could meet the overall job demands, found concerns that sexual harassment or assault could increase, and cited worries about 'unequal treatment' of special operations candidates and personnel. Some worried that if women were let in to some jobs, they might be treated more harshly. Survey details have not been released. This was the first time that officials from Special Operations Command publicly discussed the results. Changing times: In the past the military acknowledged that women will not be able to fill every combat role . Andy Hamilton, who works with Bland and has expertise on this issue, noted that women in special operations jobs had concerns, too, about the broader integration. 'They're concerned that this might result in the lowering of the standards in what are currently our male-only occupations, and that would then reflect on either them or on the women who come into those occupations,' said Hamilton. Pentagon leaders lifted the ban on women in combat jobs in 2012, but gave the military services time to integrate women gradually and systematically into the male-only front-line positions. By January 2016, the military must open all combat jobs to women or explain why any exceptions must be made. Positions within the special operations forces, including the clandestine Navy SEAL and Army Delta units, are considered the most grueling and difficult jobs in the military, with training and qualifying courses that push troops to their physical, mental and emotional limits. The commandos often work in small teams in harsh, remote locations. As a result, those jobs are some of the last to be addressed as commanders review the qualifications needed and assess the impact of bringing in women. As integration unfolds, the surveys have brought home the reality that there are 'some reservations or misperceptions in the force in terms of why we're doing this,' Bland said. Defense officials have stressed that they will not reduce standards in order to let in women. Women have so far had mixed results as they try to move into the more demanding combat positions — jobs for which men also have difficulty qualifying. New opportunities: In 2013 the Defense Department rescinded its 1994 policy restricting women from serving in combat-focused positions such as infantry units, opening up 230,000 positions to female service members . So far, about 7,200 positions within the special operations forces have been opened to women, including combat jobs in the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, a specialized unit used to fly forces fast, low and deep behind enemy lines at night. For the first time, a woman last year made it through training and began serving as a pilot in the unit. Three female pilots, 25 women in other jobs, and 16 other women are now going through initial training for these helicopter crews, known as Night Stalkers. Most female soldiers do not want combat jobs, an earlier survey found. But among those who do, the Night Stalkers were a popular choice. Women have moved into Army artillery jobs and serve on Navy submarines and in the naval Riverine units. But none has made it through the Marine Corps' officer infantry course. Special operations command leaders have made it clear that genuine concerns exist about incorporating women into some jobs. Examinations: The studies are part of the Pentagon's effort to open all military combat positions to women or provide reasons why any jobs should remain closed . In 2013, when the planning was in its infancy, then-Maj. Gen. Bennet Sacolick spoke of demanding nature of missions requiring forces 'to operate in small, self-contained teams, many of which are in austere, geographically isolated, politically sensitive environments for extended periods of time.' In an email last month to members of the special operations forces across the services, Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, said leaders had done initial analysis on training, facilities, education and other policies. Now, officials are examining 'the social and cultural challenges of integrating females' into male-only jobs. Next, Votel said, officials will analyze requirements for the jobs to make sure standards are accurate and gender neutral. 'We will continue in our commitment to provide the best manned, trained, and equipped special operations personnel to execute our nation's most difficult and sensitive missions,' Votel said. 'With that in mind, we can assure you that our high standards will not be lowered.' Bland said that in addition to Votel's email to service members, leaders have discussed the issue with commanders at frequent meetings so they can better educate their troops.","Men in U.S. special operations forces  fear the Pentagon will lower standards to integrate women into their elite units .

"Esa’s Rosetta spacecraft has captured stunning images of a dust jet erupting from comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The jet may have been caused by a wave of heat reaching ice trapped under the surface, causing an explosion of material. But it is unusual, because so far such activity has only been spotted on the day-side of the comet - not the night, like this. Scroll down for video . This animation shows the jet erupting from comet 67P. The first image was taken at 7:13am BST (2:13am EST) on 12 March, and the second was taken two minutes later. The jet is unusual because it is erupting from the dark underside of the comet, whereas such activity had only been seen on the day side so far. Credit: Esa . The two images, released yesterday, were taken by the Osiris camera on the Rosetta spacecraft from a distance of 47 miles (75km), according to Esa. As the comet gets closer to the sun, its surface gets warmer, causing frozen gases to erupt from the surface, carrying dust particles. But it’s not clear if this caused the jet - or an explosion of material caused by ice sublimating (turning from solid to gas) underground. In the first image, taken at 7:13am BST (2:13am EST) on 12 March, the upper comet can be seen with several rays of dust illuminated by the sun, while the dark underside shows no such features. Two minutes later though, in the second image, a spectacular new jet emerges from the dark side, hurling dust into space at 26ft (eight metres) per second. ‘This was a chance discovery,’ said Osiris principal investigator Dr Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany. ‘No one has ever witnessed the wake-up of a dust jet before. It is impossible to plan such an image.’ How or why the activity occurred in the dark region of the comet, though, is not yet understood. ‘It is possible that the first rays of sunlight hit some cliffs or outcrops that remained hidden to Rosetta due to the orbital position at the time,’ said Osiris scientist Dr Jean-Baptiste Vincent, also from the MPS. The Rosetta probe, which carried the Philae lander, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It chased comet 67P through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 3.3ft (one metre) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Philae managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing to orbit and study the comet. From data collected by the two proves, Esa said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. In the first image (left), the upper comet can be seen with several rays of dust illuminated by the sun, while the dark underside shows no such features. Two minutes later, in the second image (right), a spectacular new jet emerges from the dark side, hurling dust into space at 26ft (eight metres) per second . The Rosetta probe, illustrated, which carried the Philae lander, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014 . The region of the comet where this jet erupted from is known as Imhotep. By 7:17am BST (2:17am EST), the region had rotated into sunlight, and the jet was no longer visible against the overexposed coma. This means scientists aren’t sure if the eruption was short-lived, or was a continuous jet. ‘Usually, 67P’s dust-jets are rather long-lived,’ said Dr Vincent. ‘Most of them last for a full dayside rotation of approximately six hours and even reappear in the next rotation.’ Rosetta is continuing to study comet 67P ahead of its closest approach to the sun in August. And engineers on Earth are also hopeful that the Philae lander on the surface will soon get enough solar power to wake up from its slumber. This recent image was taken on 15 April from a distance of 103 miles (165km). It has been processed to spotlight the comet’s activity, including a striking jet on the left, near the neck region . This image was also taken on 15 April, from a distance of 106 miles (170km) from the comet’s centre. It shows the small lobe of the comet on the left, and its large lobe on the right .

"A Ukip MEP has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a ‘very strong leader’ who has ‘put Russia first’. Diane James, Ukip’s Justice Spokesman, also applauded Mr Putin's nationalist credentials and argued he was forced into invading Ukraine because of the European Union. Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked a row last year when he hailed Russian President as a ‘brilliant operator'. Scroll down for video . Praising Putin: Diane James, Ukip's Justice Spokesperson applauded Russian President Vladimir Putin's nationalist credentials . Taking part in a women leaders' debate on LBC radio, Mrs James - who is considered a potential successor of Nigel Farage - said: ‘Nigel went on record saying if you provoke the Russian bear you get a reaction. ‘I admire him from the point of view that he’s standing up for his country. He is very nationalist. ‘He is a very strong leader. He is putting Russia first, and he has issues with the way the EU encouraged a change of government in the Ukraine which he felt put at risk a Russian population in that country,' she said. Mrs James was the Ukip candidate in the Eastleigh by-election and currently represents the south east of England in the European Parliament. Ukip leader Nigel Farage caused controversy in March 2014 after he admitted he admired Putin as a ‘brilliant operator’ for his stance on the Syrian conflict. However, unlike Mrs James, he clarified his view on Putin by adding: ‘Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?’ His comments followed the annexation of Crimea, but before the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine and the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which is widely believed to have been carried out by Russian-supported separatists. Mrs James told presenter Iain Dale (far left) that she admires Putin because he stands up for his country . Ukip smiles: Diane James is widely considered to be Nigel Farage's successor as the leader of Ukip . Mrs James' comments came as Ukip’s election campaign chief admitted the party sometimes resembles a ‘rugby club on tour’ with members who can be ‘boorish’ and ‘chauvinistic’. Patrick O’Flynn, who is also the party’s economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to ‘work harder’ as it is ‘lagging’ behind with female voters. As he launched the party’s ‘policies for women’ alongside the Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and Mrs James, Mr O’Flynn was forced to defend its ‘blokeish’ image under Nigel Farage. Mrs James' comments come as Ukip's campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn said the party resembled a 'rugby club on tour' He said: ‘Nigel has said sometimes Ukip has resembled a rugby club on tour. I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. ‘But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. ‘We’re a very fast-growing party, we’re increasing our attraction – it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we’re not maximising our support in every potential group. ‘And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters – we still are, we’ve got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.’ The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. The party used the event to confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a ‘tampon tax’. It also said it would give ‘absolute, full and unconditional’ support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are ‘properly resourced’. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is ‘accepted cultural practice’ for some of ‘our ethnic compatriots’. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party’s election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on ‘lies’ and ‘myths’ spread about the party. She said: ‘I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. ‘There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. ‘Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.’ Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as ‘sluts’. Mr Farage, who was absent from the women’s event, has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave. In a 2010 interview, the party leader who has often been photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer, also boasted: ‘I’ve got so many women pregnant over the years.’","Diane James described her admiration for Putin during radio debate .

"Anti-Hillary Clinton street art emerged in Brooklyn just hours before Clinton's presidential candidacy announcement on Sunday. The signs feature portraits of Clinton with phrases including 'Dont Say Secretive', 'Don't Say Entitled' and 'Don't Say Ambitious'. The street art appears to be a dig at a group of Clinton supporters who said it would be on the look out for evidence of sexism in reporting about the Democratic politician, according to the Weekly Standard. Last month, the New York Times' Amy Chozick brought attention to the efforts made by the group, which goes by the name of 'HRC Super Volunteers'. The descriptive terms that Clinton's fan club said it does not want applied to their candidate include 'polarizing, calculating, disingenuous, insincere, ambitious, inevitable, entitled' and 'over confident.' Scroll down for videos . Pedestrians walk past an anti-Hillary Clinton poster that says 'Don't Say Secretive' across the street from the purported Clinton campaign headquarters on Sunday in Brooklyn, New York . Another anti-Hillary Clinton poster that says 'Don't Say Entitled' is affixed to a traffic light across the street from Clinton campaign headquarters where her growing staffers began working on Friday . The posters are said to have appeared in Brooklyn on Saturday night near her campaign's new headquarters in the borough, where staffers began working on Friday. It is not known who created or posted the Brooklyn street art. Following Clinton's announcement on Sunday, a hashtag on Twitter also began trending called #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. In this image taken from video posted to hillaryclinton.com on Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton announces her campaign for president . A wave of users began using the hashtag giving their reasons for why they would not be voting for the Democratic candidate.

'The Hillary Clinton campaign had it removed, that's right Hillary Clinton's campaign can delete the #1 hashtag in America for a cost of money. 'I'm proud that people helped me make a statement, I can say I've been causing Hillary problems since day one of her campaign. How many people can say they started the #1 hashtag in the USA and had it deleted by Hillary herself?' Clinton made her presidential campaign announcement on Sunday afternoon  leaning on a message of middle-class rescue and claims that America's economy is 'still stacked in favor of those at the top,' according to the campaign video.","The posters feature a portrait of Clinton with phrases including 'Don't Say Ambitious' and 'Don't Say Entitled'

Ready to roll: A pit pull puppy who couldn’t walk due to a crippling birth defect has now been likened to the sprightly-footed tap dancer Fred Astaire after undergoing reconstructive surgery . Tap dog! Four-month-old Roscoe was caught on camera this week at the Asheville Humane Society in North Carolina taking some of his first steps . The rescue pup was born with a deformity which caused his front to legs to be bent backwards at the knees. As a result, he was forced to crawl around on his joints. However, thanks to more than $3,000 in public donations, the canine was able to have the life-changing operation he needed. Both of his limbs were broken and reset into a straight position. Flashback: The rescue pup was born with a deformity which caused his front to legs to be bent backwards at the knees - as a result, he was forced to crawl around on his joints . Commenting on Roscoe's progress his foster owner, Laurel York, told WLOS-TV: 'For the first couple of days he was really wobbly on his stilts. 'But [now] he's kinda like tap dancing like Fred Astaire.' Dr. David Crouch, who operated on Roscoe, said he's been impressed by the pup's swift turnaround. Recalling his pre-surgery appearance, the vet said: He was left with little flippers and trying to walk on the tops of his wrists and created bloody sores.' It's hoped in around three to four months’ time Roscoe will be fully healed and ready for adoption.","Roscoe was caught on camera this week at the Asheville Humane Society in North Carolina taking some of his first steps .

"The last two 'Doolittle Tokyo Raiders' presented the group's Congressional Gold Medal for permanent display at the National Museum of the US Air Force on Saturday, 73 years to the day after their daring bombing attack on Japan rallied Americans in World War II. Retired Lt Col Richard 'Dick' Cole, age 99, gave the medal to the museum's director in a ceremony at the museum attended by military and political officials and relatives of the original 80 Raiders. The medal, awarded by Congress earlier in the week, arrived in a ceremonial B-25 flight. Scroll down for video . Staff Sgt David Thacker (left) and Lt Col Richard Cole (right) presented the Doolittle medal during a ceremony . The last Tokyo Doolittle Raiders gave the Congressional Gold Medal to the National Museum of the US Air Force . The important medal, which was awarded by Congress earlier in the week, arrived in a ceremonial B-25 flight . Cole, a Dayton native, was mission leader and James 'Jimmy' Doolittle's co-pilot for the B-25 bombers' attack that stunned Japan and lifted American spirits less than five months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Last month, Lt Col Robert Hite (pictured), one of the three remaining Tokyo Doolittle Raiders, died after a battle with Alzheimer's disease at the age of 95 . Retired Staff Sgt David Thatcher, 93, came from Missoula, Montana, for the event, and said the medal was for all 80. Cole came from Comfort, Texas. Cole recalled wryly Saturday that on the evening of April 18, 1942, Thatcher was on the beach in China helping save his crew after a crash-landing, 'And I was hanging in my parachute in a tree.' Cole flew with Doolittle in plane No. 1 of the 16 launched from an aircraft carrier. Thatcher was engineer-gunner aboard the 7th plane, nicknamed 'The Ruptured Duck,' whose crew's crash-landing and evasion of Japanese troops in China was depicted in the movie Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. Thatcher, who was played by Robert Walker in the movie while Spencer Tracy portrayed Doolittle, chuckled as he recounted how the Raiders had given little thought at the time of the raid about earning a place in history. 'We figured it was just another bombing mission,' he said in a recent phone interview from his home. In the years afterward, though, he said, they realized: 'It was an important event in World War II.' Cole said: 'We proudly hand over our Congressional Gold Medal to [museum director retired Lt Gen] Jack Hudson, who we trust will respectfully guard it and have it securely displayed... for the world to see and appreciate.' Their medal will join the museum's diorama about their raid. Hudson has pledged their inspirational story 'will live on.' The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on April 18, 1942, caused negligible material damage to Japan . The raid by the US boosted American morale in the wake of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 . Three Raiders have died since their 70th anniversary reunion at the museum in Ohio, two of them this year. The latest to fall was Lt. Col. Robert Hite, who died March 29 at age 95 at a Nashville, Tennessee, nursing facility. Hite was also the last of the eight Raiders who were captured by Japanese soldiers. Three were executed and a fourth died in captivity. Three other Raiders were killed soon after the bombing run, as most crash-landed or had to bail out. Thatcher joined Cole and Lt. Col. Edward Saylor at the museum less than two years ago for a public 'Final Toast' in which they lifted specially engraved silver goblets for the traditional toast of their reunions to those who have gone. He and Cole planned to do so again this weekend at a private gathering, now saluting Hite and Saylor, who died in January at 94. The medal will join a diorama about the raid and museum director John Hudson (right) pledged the story will live . The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on 18 April 1942, was an air raid by the United States during World War II. The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, caused negligible material damage to Japan, but helped to boost a wounded nation's morale in the aftermath of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. US Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers, with five crewmen on each were launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, took off from the aircraft carrier on less than 500 feet of runway. They had only enough fuel to drop their bombs on military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety. Pilots volunteered and trained in Florida for what they only knew was 'extremely hazardous.' Navigator Griffin, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, got top-secret briefings with pilot David Jones in Washington, just five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Once at sea, the rest learned targets - factories, plants, military facilities on mainland Japan. They knew the uncertainties: what if the Navy task force was attacked? What defences would they face? And with B-25s unable to land on a carrier decks, could they reach friendly bases in China? Aircraft: The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, B-25B Mitchell medium bomber launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific . The Raiders brushed aside Doolittle's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw. After encountering Japanese patrols, the raid launched ahead of plan, some 200 miles farther from shore for fuel-stretched bombers. Doolittle's plane took off first at 08:20 from a pitching carrier deck. They flew low in radio silence, skimming seas and then treetops. Cole recalls the country song 'Wabash Cannonball' running through his head. He tapped his foot in time until Doolittle shot him a questioning look. They were greeted by anti-aircraft guns and puffs of black smoke. Flak shook planes. When they arrived at the target, Col. Doolittle ordered to open up the bomb bay doors. The bombs dropped, and the raiders 'got the heck out of there.' The danger was just beginning. All 16 planes lacked enough fuel to reach bases and either crash-landed or ditched in dark, rough weather along China's coast south of Shanghai. They narrowly stayed ahead of Japanese searchers, who killed villagers suspected of helping the Americans. Eight Raiders were captured, and three executed. A fourth died in captivity. Three had died off the coast of China. In the end, fourteen crews, except for one crewman, returned either to the United States or to American forces. Bird's eye view: The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, would fly over military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety .","Lt Col Richard 'Dick' Cole, 99, gave the medal to Air Force museum director .

"Expat: Detectives are investigating the killing of David King (pictured), a 70-year-old pensioner from Newham, east London, who retired to Normandy . A fight over stolen vegetables may have led to a British expat being murdered and dumped at the bottom of a well, French police fear. The macabre theory has been outlined by detectives investigating the killing of David King, a 70-year-old pensioner from Newham, east London, who retired to Normandy 15 years ago. His body was found by sniffer dogs last week in the picturesque hamlet of Pierres, south-west of Caen, and an unnamed 28-year-old Frenchman has been charged with his murder. The alleged killer was living rough in the area, and is thought to have been behind a number of thefts in the area. Now prosecutor Carole Etienne has said that Mr King, a keen gardener, may well have confronted the man over stolen vegetables. Ms Etienne, who is leading the police enquiry, said: ‘Among the vague attempts at an explanation given by the accused, we are looking at the possibility of a fight over the theft of foodstuffs. ‘In one night, a whole plot of leeks might disappear. One person saw four rabbits vanishing overnight.’ Ms Etienne added: ‘People were getting more and more angry, and some were even threatening to defend their plots with shotguns’. Neighbours of Mr King, who was hugely proud of his vegetable garden, told Le Parisien newspaper that a description of the thief corresponds to the alleged murderer. Discovery: In February, Mr King's car, a Renault Scenic (above) was found parked in Vire, a nearby town, but there was no sign of any body . Family and neighbours of Mr King have attacked detectives for allowing his suspected murderer to remain at large for six months. Interpol, the international police organisation, had initially refused to open a missing person’s enquiry. Instead they believed Mr King had travelled to Australia to see his daughter, Sandie Ray. Mr King had been living in France for 15 years . Ms Ray, who lives in Perth, Australia, said her father’s passport details had been mixed up with another David King, who had indeed travelled to Australia from France. She said this was known by November last year, but ‘the French authorities still hadn’t been formally notified of this via Interpol until approximately three months later’. Ms Ray said a quicker enquiry would have avoided ‘lots of anxiety and frustration for our family and dads friends.’ John King, Mr King’s son, who lives in Brighton, East Sussex, said the botched investigation had been a ‘bureaucratic nightmare’ for all concerned. Other expats living in the area said it was ‘hugely frightening’ to have a suspected murderer living in their midst while the operation went on. ‘This is an isolated part of the world, and everyone is potentially vulnerable to attack,’ said one. ‘Detectives should have worked out what was going on far quicker. The slow speed of the enquiry was unacceptable.' In February, Mr King's car, a Renault Scenic was found parked in Vire, a nearby town, but there was no sign of any body.","David King, 70, from east London, retired to Normandy 15 years ago .

"A 73-year-old reserve deputy shot and killed a man during an undercover operation after thinking he had his stun gun when he opened fire. Robert Charles Bates shot and killed Eric Courtney Harris as the younger man was trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a dollar store. Harris, 44, was being restrained by one of the undercover police officers when Bates, who was monitoring from afar, ran up 'trying to get the situation under control' and fired one shot. According to police at the scene in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bates, a former full-time officer, accidentally pulled out his service weapon instead of the stun gun. Confusion: Robert Charles Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot a man dead, it has been claimed . Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control, inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. He also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition and ran when deputies tried to arrest him, then fought with another deputy when he was shot. Killed: Eric Harris, 44, was allegedly meeting with undercover deputies to buy a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol . He was gunned down after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area ... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' CNN reported. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons. With the same power as paid deputies, reserves can conduct their own investigations, make arrests and work on task forces.","Robert Charles Bates, 73, was allegedly trying to pull out his taser .

The 33-year-old recently announced in February, along with her departure from Radio 1, that she is pregnant with her second child with Jesse Wood, son of Rolling Stones guitarist, Ronnie Wood. COMFORT OVER STYLE . Mila Kunis, 31, is another actress that had no problem with being seen out in public in casual comfortable clothing during her pregnancy . A huge majority of women will understandably opt for comfort over style. Keira Knightley's off-duty pregnancy style is based around loose, baggy attire - but without losing her hipster edge.

"It’s no secret that almost all dogs love water, but very few are making waves like these two border collies. One-year-old Anna and six-year-old Indi have been thrilling crowds at surfing competitions for dogs after taking to the sport like a duck to water. With the help of their owner, Zane Jones, the four-legged surfers use their low centre of gravity to keep them stable while hanging ten off the coast of Queensland, Australia. Anna and Indi, owned by 32-year-old Zane Jones, have been surfing since they were about 10 weeks old . Zane, a 32-year-old search and rescue crewman, said: ‘I have been surfing for around 16 years, but when we got Indi, I suddenly had a new riding partner. ‘She would perch on the front of the board and as we caught the waves occasionally lifting one paw up as if she was hanging five, which is Indi's famous trade mark. ‘Anna was exactly the same, they both loved the water from the very first day we took them to the beach.’ Zane and his partner, Caitlin Ollier, 26, have owned the dogs, who both began surfing when they were just 10 weeks old, since they were puppies. Indi, who won a runners-up medal at a competition, has been trained to lift her paw to 'hang five' The dogs use their low centre of gravity to keep them stable while surfing in Queensland, Australia . The dogs haven’t won a competition yet, but their owners are hoping they can top their best result to date – a runners-up medal for Indi and the Noosa Festival of Surfing. Zane said: ‘Both girls are naturals when it comes to balance and knowing where to stand on the board. ‘When I take Indi and Anna out on the waves at our local surfing spot we always draw a big crowd of people who watch from the board walk or the beach. ‘We even get stopped when we go for walks as people are starting to recognise the girls. ‘Hopefully we can improve our competition performance in the future, but the girls are getting better every day.'","Anna and Indi have been surfing since they were about 10 weeks old .

"Video footage has emerged of a drunken stag party group who caused mayhem on a flight from Scotland to Spain. Fellow passengers sat stunned as the yobs - some of whom were shirtless - sung and swore their way from Glasgow to Alicante on a Jet2 flight last Friday morning. Witnesses said the group drank heavily, abused fellow passengers and airline staff and refused to sit down when the aircraft was landing. Scroll down for video . Footage has emerged of a drunken group of yobs on board a Jet2 flight from Glasgow to Alicante last week . Spanish police were called by cabin crew to escort one of the party, a man in his thirties, off the aircraft when it arrived in Spain. All passengers on the Jet2 flight had to wait in their seats as the plane waited on the runway while officers dealt with the situation. Mobile phone footage of the incident shows a female passenger arguing and grappling with a group of men in the aisle of the plane. One passenger said: 'It was the most horrendous flight I have ever been on. 'There was a large stag party who boarded the plane at Glasgow and they obviously had already had a lot to drink. 'They were shouting, singing and swearing throughout the flight. A few of them took their tops off and refused to sit in their seats when told to.' The video shows the group - some of whom are shirtless -  jostling a woman who tries to calm them down . The incident took place on a Jet2 flight to Alicante, where the men were heading for a stag party . The passenger added: 'One of them in particular was swearing constantly and getting into arguments with other passengers. The airline staff were struggling to cope with his rowdiness. 'There were families on the flight and the behaviour was totally out of order. When we landed we were all held on the flight to wait for police to come on board and remove one of the guys. 'One woman got really frustrated at the delay and got involved in a bit of a pushing match with the group.' The group, who were travelling to the Spanish holiday resort of Benidorm, left Glasgow airport for the three-hour flight to Alicante on Friday morning. It is understood the man who was held by police was later released and he was banned from travelling home on his booked Jet2 flight. One man was escorted from the plane after it landed in Alicante (pictured). He was banned from flying back . A spokeswoman for Jet2 said: 'We can confirm that following disruptive behaviour on flight LS177 from Glasgow to Alicante a passenger was denied boarding on his return flight. 'The safety and security of our customers is paramount and this particular passenger's conduct on the outbound flight was disappointing and not acceptable. 'This was an isolated incident and was certainly not representative of our passengers who are often families and couples just on their way to enjoy their holiday.' Earlier this month, Ryanair announced they were banning alcohol on a notorious flight from Scotland to party island Ibiza. The airline told passengers travelling from Glasgow Prestwick to the Spanish isle that they will no longer be able to take alcohol on board.","Yobs had 'already  drunk a lot' when they boarded early morning flight .

"An unemployed woman has her heart set on a 'fairy-tale church wedding' - and believes the taxpayer should foot the bill as it is her basic human right to be a bride. Anna Broom, of Gillingham, in Kent, has not worked since the age of 19, during which time she has claimed more than £100,000 in benefits. The jobless 33-year-old now wants an extra £10,000 to fund her dream 'traditional English wedding and party in a castle'. Miss Broom is desperate for a church ceremony, designer dress, horse and carriage - 'like Katie Price' - and champagne for her 50 guests. Scroll down for video . Dream wedding: Miss Broom wants the government to loan her £10,000 for her wedding to Jordan Burford . And she wants the taxpayer to stump up a further £2,000 for her honeymoon, where she hopes to jet off to Mexico. The Gillingham resident claims it is her 'basic human right' to be a bride and says that tying the knot would boost her fragile confidence and encourage her to try and find a job again. Miss Broom receives monthly benefits including £460 disability living allowance and joint £200 housing benefit with fiancé Jordan Burford, 39, who also gets £134 income support a month. The size 24 bride-to-be said: 'I've dreamed about being a bride since I was 12 years old. 'I deserve a fairy-tale church wedding and a party in a castle - but there's no way I could afford it on benefits and I can't work because I'm overweight.' True gent: Miss Broom met her fiancé in a pub in 2009 and said it was 'love at first sight' - she now wants a 'fairy-tale church wedding and a party in a castle' as well as a honeymoon in Mexico, paid for by the taxpayer . She added: 'I want the taxpayer to fund my £10,000 dream wedding - it's a basic human right to be a bride. I don't see why I should have a small wedding at a registry office - I wouldn't be able to fit in all my guests and a church wedding is far more romantic. 'I'm stuck in a rut at the moment and can't find the motivation to lose weight, but if I was getting married I know I'd slim down because all eyes would be on me.' Miss Broom left school without any qualifications and started a job as a nursery nurse aged 16 for two years. She left after being overlooked for a secretarial role by a 'skinny blonde' and applied for several other jobs, without success. She then lost interest in trying to find work and resorted to binge-eating crisps and sweets. Within a year, Miss Broom weighed 17 stone and in 2001, aged 19, was declared unfit to work after suffering from depression and back problems associated with her size. She qualified for benefits and has not worked since. Honeymoon: Miss Broom also wants the government to loan her £2,000 for a honeymoon to Mexico (pictured) Bridezilla: The 33-year-old from Gillingham wants to arrive at her wedding in her horse and carriage similar to Katie Price, who arrived in the carriage (pictured above) in her wedding to Peter Andre in September 2005 at Highclere Castle, in Hampshire . Jobless: Miss Broom has not worked since 2001 when she was 19 years old after she was declared unfit to work after suffering from depression and back problems associated with her size . But Miss Broom found comfort in her life in the form of fiancé Jordan, who she met in a pub in 2009. Recalling the moment, she said: 'It was love at first sight. He's got a lovely smile and he's a true gent. We have lots in common - we both love heavy metal and Bon Jovi.' Two years later, he popped the question outside a Primark store. She said: 'The ring is lovely - it has a gold band with a pink stone.' After getting engaged, the 33-year-old started making plans for the big day after leafing through glossy magazines and watching wedding shows on TV. She said: 'I realised I want a traditional English wedding - a church ceremony, followed by a reception in a castle. 'I dream about arriving in a horse and carriage - like Katie Price!' She added: 'I picture myself in a silk dress that shows off my cleavage, as Jordan likes my boobs! 'I'd like a long veil and sparkly red designer heels and I want two bridesmaids and flower girls scattering petals down the aisle. 'We'd serve posh prawn canapes, a roast dinner and champagne. I'd have around 50 guests with a five-tier cake and a big buffet too. 'I'd also love a big band and have picked out Savage Garden's Truly, Madly Deeply for our first dance.' But she quickly realised she would be unable to foot the bill for her dream wedding. She said: 'I was gutted. We only get £800 a month in benefits between us and after we've paid for bills, a night out at the pub, dog food for our Labrador, cigarettes and the odd kebab, there's barely anything left. 'I'd rather not get married than have a cheap do - it'd only make me unhappy.' Miss Broom receives monthly benefits including £460 disability living allowance and joint £200 housing benefit with fiancé Jordan Burford, 39, who also gets £134 income support a month. Mr Burford suffers from epilepsy and has never worked. The total the couple receive equates to £794 a month. But Miss Broom says that after 'we've paid for bills, a night out at the pub, dog food for our Labrador, cigarettes and the odd kebab, there's barely anything left.' Now she hopes the government will loan her the money for the big day, as well as her honeymoon in the Mexican sunshine. The 33-year-old admits she will struggle to pay back the full amount and says she'd prefer to go halves. She said: 'Even if I only got £5,000 in vouchers to put towards the wedding, that'd make life easier. 'Jordan just wants us to get married and only wants a limo and cream suit, but I want to feel like a princess for the day.' Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive at The Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'The benefit system is a valuable safety net but must not be a comfort blanket. 'People have to finance their own weddings rather than rely on a government loan, which would be funded by the taxpayer, to pick up the tab.'","Anna Broom, 33, not worked since 2001 and has claimed total of £100,000 .

"One-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan (above) is on hunger strike for the second time in a bid to be moved from prison to a secure psychiatric hospital . One-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan is on hunger strike for the second time in a bid to be moved to a secure psychiatric hospital. The 31-year-old was reportedly transferred to solitary confinement in HMP Manchester, formerly Strangeways, a month ago after being caught smuggling a mobile phone and cannabis into his prison cell, sources said. But in a desperate attempt to get himself moved Cregan, who was jailed for life after shooting police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in 2012, has apparently stopped eating. He is hoping to be transferred from the Category A prison to Ashworth Hospital, a high-security psychiatric unit in Maghull, Merseyside, the Daily Star Sunday reported. Before the fallout sources told the Star that Cregan had an enhanced status and was allowed additional time in the games area and yard, as well as a flat-screen TV and DVD player in his room. But the benefits were taken off him after he was caught smuggling for a second time. 'Cregan has burned all his bridges in here,' the source said. 'He has not eaten since he was sent into segregation. That is 30 days of not eating.' Ashworth hospital offers comfortable bedrooms and patients are allowed personal items such as CDs, photos and books. Art and music workshops, pottery and cooking classes, and social events such as bingo and film nights are also offered to the patients. Cregan went on the run in 2012 after murdering David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23, in a bar fight. The killer, who lost an eye in a separate brawl, lured officers Bone and Hughes into his house four months later with a fake 999 call.

"James May has been forced to backtrack for suggesting Top Gear viewers who sent threatening tweets to Sue Perkins should 'kill themselves'. Perkins, who became a favourite to replace the ousted Jeremy Clarkson after a flurry of bets, recently announced she was leaving Twitter  as a result of the horrific abuse. In response, May said: 'If you're one of the people sending death threats to Sue Perkins, could you please do the world a much bigger favour by killing yourself.' The presenter quickly clarified: 'Obviously I don't actually want people to kill themselves but, really, we don't want them as fans.' James May (right) backtracked on his comment that Top Gear viewers who sent threatening tweets to Sue Perkins (left) should 'kill themselves' May is currently getting ready to tour a Top Gear spin-off around the UK alongside Clarkson and Richard Hammond, following the BBC's sacking of Clarkson for punching a producer. They will be stripped of all BBC branding and instead be presented as 'Clarkson, Hammond and May Live', meaning the show will not be able to use clips from Top Gear - or even feature the Stig. May's comments were made after Perkins finally decided to take a break from Twitter in response to the barrage of abuse. She had earlier stated: 'Guys, post the utterly fabricated story about me and Top Gear, my timeline has been full of blokes wishing me dead. This morning, someone suggested they'd like to see me burn to death. 'All of which goes to say that I am off Twitter for a bit. Love and peace x.' The Great British Bake Off host was said to be the front-runner for the job, according to bookmakers Coral, with Dermot O'Leary second favourite at 2-1. Actor Philip Glenister, famed for his role as the detective in Life On Mars, has also been rumoured to replace the ousted Clarkson. The Bake Off star denied the rumours, resulting in a torrent of abuse from Top Gear fans. Perkins said on Twitter last week: 'Just back from night shoot in Kolkata sewers to find my timeline busy with middle-aged man-trolls. General gist: Man do cars, woman do cake.' Jeremy Clarkson, pictured here smoking and looking tired in London this week, attacked one of the Top Gear producers . Clarkson was the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him in a 30-second assault on March 4. He was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 before it announced his contract would not be renewed. The star received widespread public support - including from his friend Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the fracas, and one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him. But director-general Tony Hall said 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'.","James May has backtracked on comment suggesting trolls 'kill themselves'

"These are the shocking scenes as a cyclist in Russia narrowly escapes death when a HGV knocks him from his bicycle following a reckless overtaking manoeuvre on a motorway. The cyclist is pedaling in front of his friend past a junction when the truck comes speeding along the inside, clipping the rider and throwing him clear of his bike. The second cyclist does not have any time to react to his friend's accident and is knocked to the ground after careering into the stricken bicycle. This is the moment a Russian truck flies past a cyclist, pictured, on the outskirts of St Petersberg . The truck continued along the road for 100 metres before it was stopped by the driver on the hard shoulder . Marathon rider Ruslan Bazarov, 28, suffered pelvic injuries and a broken leg when the truck overtook him on the St Petersburg ring road. Bazarov was taking part in the first 100 kilometre ride of the season of the Baltic Star club when the incident happened. Moments before the accident, Bazarov made a hand signal to indicate that he was moving into the right hand lane, but the truck, which was carrying flour, sounded its horn and flashed by. Bazarov was sucked in towards the truck's trailer and knocked to the ground. The riders had planned to ride from Poklonnaya Hill, across the Vyborg, Primorsk and Zelenogorsk highways with the planned finish at Savushkina street in the city. The truck driver braked heavily as Bazorov tumbled along the tarmac where he suffered fractrues . Bazorov suffered two fractures to his legs and a pelvic area after the collision in St Petersberg . The cyclist cried out in pain due to the serious nature of his injuries suffered during the collision. Luckily Bazorov bounced clear of the truck's massive wheels although his bike was badly bent. The video, which has since gone viral on the internet has prompted members of Russia's cycling community to demand the creation of safe areas to ride. Bazorov suffered a double fracture to his leg as a result of his accident. The truck's driver pulled over to the side of the road after 100 metres and blamed Bazarov for causing the incident. The driver can be heard on the video remarking: 'Don't complain, it's your own fault. I was driving normally, bro!' Fellow rider Paul Gavrilov, 35, said: 'This accident should have been avoided because he could have been killed. If there were better cycle ways and proper access to the ones that exist it would make it safer.'","Ruslan Bazarov was on a 100km cycle ride when he was struck by the truck .

"The average pet spends a staggering 21 hours a week watching TV, according to a new study. Owners admit they spend hours watching the box with their animals and even leave it on when they are out to keep them company. And the nation's cats, dogs and pigs show a marked preference for programmes featuring other animals while shunning reality shows such as the Keeping Up With The Kardashians and TOWIE. Paul O'Grady's show 'For the Love of Dogs' is an absolute television favourite of pets . Almost two thirds of goldfish owners, 63 per cent, even confess to putting the tank in sight of the TV so their fish can watch it for more than three and a half hours a day. The survey of 1,000 pet owners even found the owner of a micro pig lets their pet watch four hours of shows per day - or 28 hours a week. The new study by Virgin Media reveals how much our household pets love sitting in front of the box and watching their favourite TV programmes. Over a third of us, 34 per cent, say their pets watch three hours a day while left home alone - the equivalent of 42 episodes of EastEnders in a week. A quarter, 24 per cent, say their pets love watching TV so much they spend an incredible nine hours glued to it every day. Two-thirds of goldfish owners owned up to putting the bowl in sight of the TV and even the owner of a micro pig lets their pet watch 28 hours of TV a week . A survey has revealed that on average, pets watch 21 hours of TV of week, whether its with their owners or by themselves . A square-eyed one per cent of dogs are glued to the TV for over 10 hours. Owners heading off to work or spending the day out feel guilty for leaving their pet alone, as 29 per cent admit they turn on the TV as they believe their animal may get lonely without them. Pets’ favourite show is TV presenter Paul O’Grady’s For The Love Of Dogs as 17 per cent of animal owners said their pet can’t get enough of it. Documentary Natural World is a hit with pets as 14 per cent of owners say it’s their animals’ favourite show. Springwatch is pets’ third favourite show with 12 per cent of votes - and soap EastEnders is surprisingly fifth with 11 per cent.

"A convicted felon who robbed a bank so he could go back to prison for food and shelter is staying on the straight and narrow after an outpouring of support from his community. David Potchen, who robbed a bank in Merrillville, Indiana, last June, now has a job as a welder and is staying out of trouble after receiving help from family members that had long been estranged. The man, 53, had told a Lake County judge earlier this year that he attempted to rob a local Chase bank so that he could get placed back in custody, where he had served 12 and a half years in prison. David Potchen (pictured 2014), who robbed a bank in Merrillville, Indiana, and waited for police to arrive so he could go back to prison, is now employed and living with the support of his relatives . Potchen, who was originally sentenced for a 2000 bank robbery, had been making $8.29 an hour in prison but had trouble finding a job on his release, according to the Chicago Tribune. He  was on probation in June and served 286 more days before he told Judge Clarence Murray that he would plead guilty only if he got the maximum eight years for the recent theft and was put back in prison. 'In my lifetime I have had occasion to run into a lot of homeless people, but I don't recall ever meeting face-to-face a hopeless person. To me, someone who would give up on freedom, it was just shocking,' Murray said. Potchen had decided he needed to go back to prison after his years free had left him without a job or a place to stay and sleeping in mosquito-filled woods. After stealing roughly $1,000 with a bank robbery note on the back of his resume, he sat on the curb outside and waited for police. Potchen had lost his job,  lost his place to stay and spent a night in the woods before deciding to rob a bank in Indiana with a note on the back of his resume . The ex-con spent 12 and a half years in prison (pictured) and said that he wanted to go back after hitting rock bottom during his parole last year . The judge decided to let Potchen withdraw his plea and give the 53-year-old a conversion charge that will drop the robbery charge if he stays out of trouble for one year. 'You’re not a throwaway, Mr. Potchen. You have value, sir. I’m always optimistic and hopeful that there are still good people out there who believe freedom is important,' Murray said in February. Murray appealed to those who heard about the case to offer the defendant help. Now the reformed man has reconnected with cousins who have bought him a microwave, clothes and a coffee maker to help him adjust to life on the outside and continue working welding truck flat beds in Illinois. 'I can't stop them. They keep buying me things,' he said. The owner of the trucking company, a devout Christian, has hired ex-convicts before and felt like he needed to do something to help Potchen. He said he was 'all about the job'.","David Potchen, 53, robbed bank and sat on curb waiting for police in June .

"Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. 'Epidemic': By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight (file photo) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.","Researchers claimed antibiotics could be  contributing to 'obesity epidemic'

"Obese children in one Chinese school are being helped to get back into shape by special gym lessons - called 'Kung Fu Panda' classes. Around 50 obese pupils at Jianxin Primary School, in China's eastern Zhejiang province, are put through their paces by instructors every day after school to help them lose weight. The Kung Fu Panda classes were set up after a survey showed that 5 per cent of its 858 students were obese, with one 11-year-old pupil weighing in at 180lbs, reports The People's Daily Online. Around 50 obese children from Jianxin Primary School, in eastern China, are being sent to special Kung Fu Panda classes in order to help them lose weight . Teachers set up the lessons after a survey revealed 5 per cent of the school's 800 pupils were obese, including one 11-year-old who weighs 180lbs . While some of the exercises may appear grueling, instructors say they are focused on making fitness fun, and also work with parents to help control the pupils' weights . Despite some grueling-looking exercises appearing in these pictures, the school insists that the classes focus on making fitness fun. The lessons are named after the Dreamworks film of the same name, in which an overweight panda becomes a Kung Fu master. School Principal Yan Xue told reporters from Urban Express Newspaper: 'When a child is obese there are serious negative health consequences. 'The child could also develop a lack of self-confidence as well as the possibility of being socially excluded. 'Diabetes and high blood pressure are also risks therefore the issue of obesity must be tackled at an early stage.' The school says teachers have been asked to keep an eye on their students' weights, and inform parents if they start to pile on the pounds. The school's headmaster said he wanted to tackle the issue of obesity to stop the children developing health problems in later life, and becoming socially isolated . The Kung Fu Panda classes, which inspectors say are aimed at making fitness fun, are named after a Dreamworks film of the same name in which an overweight panda becomes a kung fu master . Teachers at the school have also been told to monitor each child's weight, and will report back to their parents if they start piling on the pounds . Class instructor Wang Tao added: 'Children’s exercise classes are different to adults. We do not want to make the children afraid or hate coming to the lessons. 'We foster a relaxed atmosphere where the children can enjoy themselves so even if they are a bit noisy we won’t stop them. 'After just 3 weeks of Kung Fu Panda classes there have been a number of students who have seen visible differences in their physiques take place, this is also the result of our close cooperation with the families.' He added that since setting the classes up they have become extremely popular, including with the senior girls. One of the fitness instructors said that, since setting up the classes, they have even become popular with children of a healthy weight, especially the older girls . Pupils complete star jumps during a Kung Fu Panda fitness class at a school in eastern China . The school has also enlisted the help of a nutritionist to help the pupils maintain a healthy weight. Principle Yan added: 'This is an important stage of a child’s development and we are giving them the best nutritional advice from a scientific perspective which will help them control their weight but also not affect their physical development. 'We ask parents to list their weekly food they give their children and our nutritionist will give individual advice on their choices.' The classes have been so successful that they are now going to be used as a model for other schools throughout the city. According to the World Health Organisation, obesity in China is a major problem, with rates of the illness reaching 20 per cent in some cities . Obesity rates in China have shot up dramatically in a generation as most of the country was in the grip of a famine just 50 years ago .","Fitness classes set up after survey showed 5 per cent of pupils were obese .

"He only started his new job two weeks ago. But Prince William confirmed yesterday that he will take his full fortnight of paternity leave when his second child is born later this month. The future king, 32, became the most senior member of the royal family to work as an ordinary PAYE employee when he became a pilot for East Anglian Air Ambulance. According to Kensington Palace, he plans to take time off to be with his wife and new baby, just like he did when his son, Prince George, was born in 2013. Dash: Prince William faces a two-hour hospital dash to be at his wife's side when she goes into labour . The second in line to the throne will be working throughout April in three sites – Cambridge, Norwich and Gloucestershire Airport. The Duchess of Cambridge, meanwhile, will largely be based at their London home Kensington Palace. Royal staff have already ruled out using a helicopter to transport William back to London, meaning the prince faces a two-hour ‘blues and twos’ dash back to the capital. He could even risk missing the birth if their second child arrives more quickly than expected, although aides acknowledge that the scenario is unlikely. On maternity leave: The Duchess won't be seen in public again until she leaves hospital with the new baby . Frenetic: The scenes outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital during Prince George's birth . There will be no Lindo Wing fervour like there was for George – as the Press and public are banned from the street outside. Sources said the couple, who do not know the baby’s sex, were ‘grateful’ for interest in their new arrival – who will be fourth in line to the throne – but want to avoid a ‘media circus’. They have also vowed not to make a public announcement until at least 8am the next day if the baby is born after 10pm, and not before they have informed their families – including Prince Harry, who is likely to be in Australia when the baby arrives. They also made clear that Kate, who has been staying at the couple’s new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall, plans to return to the capital soon and intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to £10,000. Her team will be led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household. The doctor, who says he likes to ‘keep things simple’ by ‘offering honest advice’, specialises in pre-natal diagnosis, deliveries and ultrasound. He graduated from Cambridge University in 1984 and worked at King’s Hospital in London before becoming a consultant in foetal medicine at Chelsea and Westminster in 1996. Safety first: Contingency plans have been put in place in case Kate is outside of London when labour starts . Crazy: Preparations for a media pen outside the Lindo Wing ahead of the April 25th birth are underway . Not long to go: The Duchess, seen here at events last month, still doesn't know the sex of her child . Contingency plans have been put in place at other hospitals – Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge and the Royal Berkshire, close to Kate’s parents – should the Duchess, 33, go into labour outside of the capital. Kate, whose public duties ended last month, has not specified how much maternity leave she intends to take. But sources have told the Mail that she will return to Kensington Palace to recuperate before travelling to Norfolk to set up home at Anmer Hall. An aide said: ‘Her focus will be on her family over the summer.’ With an imminent General Election, aides were also asked whether they might time their announcement around the campaign, but one quipped: ‘Babies arrive when they arrive!’ Excited: Prince George is apparently looking forward to the impending birth according to his parents . Delighted: The couple also revealed their delight at receiving warm wishes from around the world . A spokesman for the couple added yesterday they were touched by the public reaction to the birth of their new baby, who will be fourth in line to the throne. In a statement about the impending royal arrival, he said: ‘The Duke and Duchess are hugely grateful for the warm wishes they have received from people throughout the UK and indeed around the world over the last few months. ‘They know that people are excited Prince George will soon have a little brother or sister and it means a great deal to them that so many will be celebrating this important moment for their family. ‘They are very appreciative that so many people share their excitement as they await the arrival of their second baby.’","Kensington Palace has revealed details of plans in place for royal birth .

"A trespasser carrying a suspicious package jumped over the White House railings last night - the latest in a string of embarrassing security breaches to hit the US capital. The intruder was arrested after climbing into the grounds of the President's home at 10.25pm. Brian Leary of the United States Secret Service - the federal agency in charge of protecting the President - said the unnamed person was in custody in Washington DC and charges were pending. He added that the intruder, whose gender or age has not been released, had been 'immediately' apprehended by officers in the uniformed division of the Secret Service. Scroll down for video . A member of the Secret Service uniformed division and his K-9 dog patrol the perimeter of the White House . The package was examined and 'deemed to be harmless', according to a report by CNN. It is not known what it contained or why the fence was climbed. The trespasser entered the south side of grounds, which face the National Mall. Last September, a knife-wielding man managed to scale the fence on the north side and get into White House itself via an unlocked door. That incident prompted a review of the building's security. Just last week US officials announced that temporary steel spikes may be put on the tips of the railings. The 8ft-tall fence  is due to be replaced in the longer term with a permanent, more secure barrier, the details of which are still under discussion. Security fears: The 8ft-tall railings surrounding the President's residence are set to be replaced . Security in Washington DC in general has been the focus of much attention in recent months. Last Wednesday an illicit gyrocopter was able to land on the west lawn of the US Capitol. Its pilot Doug Hughes, a Florida mail worker, said he was protesting against the way political campaigns are funded. He is currently under house arrest and faces up to four years in prison if he is found guilty of unlawfully operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national defence airspace. Recent breach: A bomb-squad worker examines the gyrocopter that landed on the Capitol lawn last week . House arrest: The gyrocopter's pilot Doug Hughes . The 61-year-old told reporters outside his home: 'I had expected to be intercepted on the way.' He said when he flew over the capital city, 'people were not frightened at all. That part of it was surreal.' A full-scale security review in Washington was launched in the wake of the breach. The city's Secret Service is being investigated in a separate probe after two senior agents drove their car into a White House barrier on March 4. Mark Connolly, who is second in command of Barack Obama’s security detail, and George Ogilvie had allegedly been drinking when they crashed the government vehicle. They are  subject to an internal investigation. Earlier this month, a senior Secret Service supervisor was suspended over allegations of unwanted sexual advances toward a co-worker. And a uniformed division officer assigned to the Foreign Missions branch was recently charged with destroying property, according to NBC News.","Trespasser managed to get into grounds of presidential residence .

"They're the fastest-growing nutrition bar in the U.S. with sales topping $100 million. But the FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be. Investigators found that a number of flavors were labeled 'healthy' - brimming with fiber, protein and antioxidants, while being low in fat and sodium. However, upon closer inspection, it was found that 'none of the products met the requirements to make such content claims' and were in fact 'misbranded'. Mislabeled? The FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be . Indeed, Daily Mail Online calculated that one KIND bar flavor - not included in the FDA investigation - contains more calories, fat and sodium than a Snickers bar. A 40g Honey Smoked BBQ KIND Bar - marketed as 'bold and all-natural' - contains 230 calories, 16gms of fat and 125mgs of sodium. Meanwhile, an equivalent serving of Snickers contains 190 calories, 9gms of fat and 91mgs of sodium. In response, a spokesperson for KIND highlighted that nuts are to blame for the imbalance. 'Nuts, key ingredients in many of our snacks and one of the things that make fans love our bars, contain nutritious fats that exceed the amount allowed under the FDA’s standard. 'This is similar to other foods that do not meet the standard for use of the term healthy, but are generally considered to be good for you like avocados, salmon and eggs.'. However, New York University nutritionist Marion Nestle told Today.com that said the problem is not nuts and it's the 'hidden' sugary ingredients that have to change. KIND Bar: Honey Smoked BBQ (40g) Calories: 230 . Fat: 16gm . Sodium:125mg . Protein: 10g . Snickers Bar (40g) Calories: 190 . Fat: 9gm . Sodium: 91mg . Protein: 3g . 'KIND bars are candy bars making health claims, and thereby marketing them as healthy snacks,'  Nestle said. The four KIND bars highlighted in the FDA case include the Almond & Apricot, Almond & Coconut, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate  and Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew. On April 14 KIND posted a note on its website stating that it was 'moving quickly to comply' with the FDA's request. 'We're also taking it upon ourselves to conduct a thorough review of all of our snack food labels and website information to ensure that they're compliant,' the message continued. While labeling readjustments will be made to certain bars, KIND reassures fans that recipes will remain the same. It added: 'We couldn’t be more proud of our snack foods and their nutritional benefits. 'Our entire line of delicious snacks made with high quality ingredients like whole grains, nuts and seeds will continue to be available wherever KIND is sold.' KIND bars,  the brainchild of New York salesman Daniel Lubetzky, first hit the market in 2004. The clear-packaged snacks quickly became a hit with consumers and sales soared from $15 million in 2008 to nearly $120 million in 2012, according to Fortune. In a bid to expand into the health food market further, Lubetzky came up with a granola-like cereal called 'healthy grain clusters'.. There's said to be 'a multitude of new recipes' in the pipeline too.","FDA Investigators found that a number of flavors were labeled 'healthy' - brimming with fiber and antioxidants, while being low in fat and sodium .

"In Custody: Doug Hughes was put under arrest for his gyro-copter stunt . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has admitted that a gyro-copter flew 80 miles undetected and under the radar from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to the lawn of the US Capitol on Wednesday. Reacting to the latest embarrassing security lapse at the White House and Capitol, Johnson pleaded for calm and resisted calls for sweeping changes. 'I want to know all the facts before I reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future,' he said. Johnson confirmed that the pilot, Florida postal worker Doug Hughes, was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago. He said the Secret Service passed along the information from that interview to 'all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.' Johnson said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask, 'What's a gyrocopter?' The tiny, open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone, but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, right up to the Capitol. Hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and deliver letters to all 535 members of Congress on the topic. 'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. 'And so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this, but then again, you don't want to overreact, either.' Scroll Down for Video . Approach: The small gyro-copter (circled in red) lands on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington as members of the public walk by . Practice run: Doug Hughes flies his gyrocopter near the Wauchula Municipal Airport in Wauchula, Florida prior to his 'insane' stunt on Wednesday . Preparation: Doug Hughes loads his gyro-copter onto a trailer before he flew it from Gettysburg to Washington D.C. Johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over Washington, D.C., federal buildings and monuments. 'We've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission,' he said. Just the day before, Hughes caused a major security scare when he landed his gyro-copter on the US Capitol lawn - coming just seconds from being shot out of the sky. House Homeland Security panel Chairman Michael McCaul revealed that Capitol authorities had Doug Hughes, 61, in their sights and were prepared to open fire. 'Had it gotten any closer to the speaker's balcony they have long guns to take it down, but it didn't. It landed right in front,' McCaul said about the flight which was undetected until authorities actually saw the craft approach. Practice: Doug Hughes flys his gyro-copter  near the Wauchula Municipal Airport in Wauchula, Florida in March during a trial-run for his US Capitol stunt . Protest flight: Doug Hughes took off from an undisclosed location in Washington D.C. and landed his gyro-copter on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . Rush: A member of a bomb squad checks Doug Hughes' gyro-copter after he had landed on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . However, Hughes claims he informed the Secret Service and Capitol police of his potentially lethal stunt into the no-fly zone, which was designed to draw attention to campaign finance reform and government corruption. Speaking prior to the flight and just days after a man shot himself dead in front of the Capitol on Saturday causing panic, Hughes appeared confident he would survive his 'insane' protest. 'I don't believe that the authorities are going to shoot down a 61-year-old mailman in a flying bicycle,' said Hughes of the latest embarrassment for White House and Capitol security. Indeed, NORAD reported that they did not scramble any assets and were not informed of the flight until it had landed. And local Washington D.C. response helicopter units designed to deal with slow moving targets admitted they did not react either. Doug Hughes' close friend Mike Shanahan, said today that the Hughes is not a terrorist and did not mean any harm with his protest. Security breach: The small helicopter sits on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington after it landed in front of stunned bystanders on Wednesday afternoon . Furious interest: Members of the media converge near Constitution Avenue on Capitol Hill in Washington . 'I was scared to death they were going to kill him,' Shanahan said to the Tampa Bay Times. 'My thanks goes out to whomever it was who decided not to pull the trigger.' The mailman's flight to raise awareness for campaign finance reform and donation caps caused the Capitol to go into lockdown as stunned members of the public watched him land his single-seat gyro-copter around 2pm and breach the No-Fly 'P56-Zone'. 'He has no weapons or anything else,' said Michael Shanahan to CNN. 'I know him personally. He's like a pitbull when he has an idea. He wants to wake up the country.' Hughes, who has been planning his 'insane' D.C. flight for two years was promptly arrested by police and FBI teams moved in quickly afterwards with bomb disposal robots. Witnesses said the craft approached the Capitol from the west, flying low over the National Mall and the Capitol reflecting pool across the street from the building. It barely cleared a row of trees and a statue of Gen. Ulysses Grant. Evidence: The illegally landed craft  was piloted by Florida mailman Doug Hughes to protest against government corruption and to promote campaign finance reform . Retrieval: People walk past the gyro-copter that was flown onto the grounds of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday . John Jewell, 72, a tourist from Statesville, North Carolina, said the craft landed hard and bounced. An officer was already there with a gun drawn. 'He didn't get out until police officers told him to get out. He had his hands up'' and was quickly led away by the police, Jewell said. 'They snatched him pretty fast.' Elizabeth Bevins, a tourist from Atlanta, said she was standing across the street from the Capitol when the helicopter flew in around 20 or 30 feet high, and it 'just sort of plopped down on the lawn.' Downtown Washington is blanketed by restrictions on air traffic that generally prohibit aircraft from flying over the White House, the Capitol, the national Mall and key buildings without special permission. The Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot hadn't notified it of his plans to enter restricted airspace. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times prior to his flight, Hughes said that he had phoned the Secret Service to tell them he would land in front of the Capitol and that he had emailed Barack Obama's public email too. He said that he flight would serve as a protest against rampant lobby and interest groups controlling the political process and a wake-up call for security.","Florida mailman Doug Hughes landed gyro-copter on Wednesday .

"Ed Miliband last night repeatedly refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs, crime and the effect of tuition fees. Labour has previously confidently predicted that the Coalition's austerity programme would see unemployment and crime soar, and the number of poor students going to university fall. But, in each case, the opposite has happened – and last night the party's leader was challenged over whether this called into question the judgment of him and his team. Scroll down for video . The Labour leader rejected a string of statistics read out by Evan Davis on how the situation in all three cases had improved – saying these facts were not what voters were talking about . Mr Miliband repeatedly refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs, fees and crime . Mr Miliband replied: 'I don't think that's a judgment that people are going to make at the election.' The refusal to accept that he had been proved wrong since the election came in a combative interview with Evan Davis on the BBC's Newsnight. The Labour leader rejected a string of statistics read out by Mr Davis on how the situation in all three cases had improved – saying these facts were not what voters were talking about. Mr Miliband also refused to say how much Labour would be borrowing by the end of the next Parliament, saying: 'The way you get credibility is not by picking out an arbitrary number in six years' time.' And he gave the strongest indication yet that Ed Balls would be Chancellor in a Labour-led government. Mr Davis brought up the subject of Mr Balls' comment four years ago that it was 'fantasy' to think Britain would get job growth with all the cuts being made in the public sector. He asked the Labour leader: 'What's happened to jobs over the last five years?' Mr Miliband replied: 'What Ed Balls was doing was quoting what the Office of Budget Responsibility were saying, which is there'd be a very, very big impact on public sector jobs, and there were deep questions about whether the private sector jobs could make up the shortfall.' The Newsnight presenter challenged Mr Miliband on jobs, crimes and fees - but the Labour leader refused to admit he had got it wrong on each occasion . In the interview, Mr Miliband refused to say how much Labour would be borrowing by the end of the next Parliament . When Mr Davis said he wanted to 'focus on the number of jobs', Mr Miliband had to admit: 'The number of jobs has gone up, but you know, I'm going to let people in this election make the judgment about whether that means the economy's fixed or not.' Mr Davis interjected: 'It's gone up by two million, hasn't it? About a thousand a day.' The presenter then moved on to crime; quoting shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper who said earlier this Parliament that the cuts are 'risking public safety and the fight against crime'. When asked what had happened to crime, Mr Miliband at first answered: 'Violent crime's actually up. So there are worries about violent crime. And there are big questions about what's going to happen to policing in the next parliament.' Mr Davis then asked him twice: 'What's happened to crime overall?', forcing Mr Miliband to reply: 'You're definitely right that there are a number of statistics that the Government cites to say everything's fine in the country and everything's doing well. Certain areas of crime have gone down; certain areas of crime have gone up. But let's go to the big argument of this election.' Mr Miliband gave the strongest indication yet that Ed Balls would be Chancellor in a Labour-led government . Chuka Umunna said he believed one in seven company directors should be from ethnic minority backgrounds – reflecting the population. The shadow business secretary told the London Evening Standard he would support an official target for boardroom diversity. During an LBC Radio phone-in he was asked if he would either stand as a candidate for Labour leader or London Mayor. He said he had 'no interest' in being mayor. Pressed on the leadership, he replied: 'I'm not getting into that conversation at all.' The presenter interrupted him again to point out that the crime survey of England and Wales showed it was at its lowest level since 1981. Mr Davis then moved on to the rise in tuition fees, quoting Chuka Umunna saying in 2010: 'How can these proposals do other than deter people from poor backgrounds from going to university?' Mr Miliband said: 'What I know is that there are 12 times more people from advantaged, privileged backgrounds going to university than disadvantaged backgrounds. And that isn't good enough for me and the country.' After the Labour leader declined twice to say what had actually happened to rates of enrolment from poorer students, Mr Davis told him the number had in fact increased by around a third. Mr Miliband replied: 'There are some more people going to university from different backgrounds. So the problem's fixed is it?' Asked: 'The judgment that was made was wrong?', he replied: 'No, it wasn't wrong. It isn't good enough for me that you're 12 times more likely to get to university from an advantaged compared to a disadvantaged background.' Mr Davis asked: 'So on issues about jobs, crime, social mobility, comments, predictions made by people in your team turn out to have been wrong. These are important areas. 'These are not minor quibbles are they? These are huge issues that have had a large part to play in the last five years.' ■Fuel duty would rise 'in line with inflation' under Labour, climate change spokesman Caroline Flint said yesterday. The last Labour government introduced the fuel duty escalator which saw the price of a litre of unleaded petrol rise by RPI inflation plus one pence. However, under the Coalition it was frozen for a fifth year in succession, allowing the Chancellor to boast that motorists have had '£10 off a tank with the Tories'.","Ed Miliband refused to accept he had been proved wrong in BBC interview .

"A pair of British expats say they are ‘trapped’ in southern Spain amid an ongoing legal battle with the local town hall over a luxury bed and breakfast they once operated. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are attempting to sell the four-bedroom property where they currently reside in Jimena de la Frontera, but it is now on the brink of being torn down. The retired couple told Spain’s Olive Press news website that they have done nothing wrong but face losing the estate over illegal additions made by a previous owner. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are locked in a dispute with the town hall over alterations made by a previous owner . The Jubbs purchased the bed and breakfast in Jimena de la Frontera, in southern Spain, in 2008 . Patrick, 64, told the news website: ‘We are in absolute pieces over this. ‘All we want is to go back to the UK to be with our family and friends, but we can’t. All our money is tied up in the property.’ Patrick, a former engineer from London, and his 63-year-old wife, Valerie, bought the bed and breakfast, La Vina de Linan, in 2008 and closed it a year ago as they moved forward with plans to sell it. They said they had a deal in place to sell the estate for €680,000, but the town hall ruled that the first floor, kitchen and pool were illegally built by previous owners in 1994. The Jubbs said they obtained a certificate that stated there were no infractions when they bought the estate . When the Jubbs tried to sell the town hall ruled that the alterations, including a swimming pool, were illegal . The Jubbs told the Olive Press that the Junta provided a certificate stating there were no planning infractions when they bought the property, and that the alterations were legalised by land registry officials in 2005 – three years before they acquired the estate. In most situations the local authority loses the right to demolish a house that has been illegally altered if it fails to detect the alterations within four years. But in the case of the Jubbs the usual rule does not apply because the property is located inside Los Alcornocales Natural Park in the Andalusian province of Cadiz. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are planning to move back to the UK, but said their money is tied up in the property . Patrick said the alterations never should have been approved in the first place. Online adverts still list the Jubbs’ property for sale, with a guide price of €875,000. With a sparkling rating on TripAdvisor, it is marketed as a secluded and private property with panoramic mountain views. It is located just 25 minutes from Gibraltar and 90 minutes from Malaga airport. The home boasts four en-suite bedrooms, a large sitting room with a fireplace, a dining room and terraces.","Patrick and Valerie Jubb purchased the property in Andalusia in 2008 .

"They took to Reddit in their millions in the hope of pinpointing the suspect or suspects behind the Boston Marathon bombings, which killed two women and a young boy, and injured a further 264. But in the days after the 2013 attack, the users of the subreddit, Find Boston Bombers, hurled false accusations at countless spectators who had been wearing backpacks at the high-profile event. Their claims - based on the analysis of photos and videos of the marathon - even led to 22-year-old Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student who was missing, being wrongly identified as the bomber. Now, the moderator of the subreddit, Chris Ryves, has told of his regrets about the thread - which he says nearly became 'its own beast' in the wake of the April 15 bombings - in a new documentary.

In the documentary, The Thread, which will be released on iTunes on Monday, Ryves explains how Redditors took it upon themselves to theorize about the suspect/suspects' identities on his thread. These theories, which may have appeared harmless at first, then spread into the public domain, sparking the widespread rumor that Tripathi was behind the homemade pressure-cooker bombs. 'People like to make theories,' Ryves says in a trailer for the documentary, explaining how he had initially set several ground rules - such as 'No Racism' - for the thread in a bid to ensure fairness.

After Tripathi was wrongly identified by Reddit commentators (the student was, in fact, found dead in a  Rhode Island river on April 23 after committing suicide), an apology was issued to his family. The apology, written by the then-unidentified moderator of Find Boston Bombers, told Tripathi's relatives that the thread was 'truly sorry' for pinpointing the victim, who went missing on March 16. It read: 'I'd like to extend the deepest apologies to the family of Sunil Tripathi for any part we may have had in relaying what has turned out to be faulty information. We cannot begin to know what you're going through and for that we are truly sorry.

Seconds later, one of two bombs exploded, piercing his body with shrapnel . Erik Martin, the general manager of Reddit, also sent out an email 'to apologize personally for... some of the people on our site's role in the spreading of this false idea about Sunny.'

It features sponge, jam, custard, lamb, peas, onions, whipped cream and is garnished with sprinkles . Neil Killham, a 32-year-old software engineer from Manchester, announced his plans on Twitter with a picture of his clashing ingredients with the caption: 'It's finally time. I'm making The Trifle Out Of Friends.' Giving a running commentary on the social media site, Neil proudly showed off the finished masterpiece which actually looked very respectable - until he cut into it. He told his followers that while it does not taste like feet - as characters on the show claimed - it was still 'f****** horrible'. He added: 'But with enough nice trifle stuff that we keeping eating more of it.' The trifle-shepherds pie combination did not look quite as appetising once it had been sliced into . Friends character Rachel Green (played by Jennifer Aniston) accidentally made the disgusting dessert . Neil posted this picture of a friend attempting a second go at the trifle pie - it doesn't appear to have improved . 'I thought I'd be able to compartmentalise the clashing flavours, but I cannot.' When MailOnline asked how it tasted, Neil, who shared the dish with friends, said: 'It tasted terrible of course - but not so bad that I couldn't finish my slice. 'It's the way you sometimes think you've got lucky and got a nice pure trifle bite and then pow! Lamb!' He said in the last year he has made curry flavoured cupcakes, a chilli cheesecake and a pancake pizza, among other things. 'Usually they kind of work, so I figured it was time to try something that definitely wouldn't,' he said. 'Although when I tried sprouts in marmite that didn't work either, but it wasn't as bad as this. 'A couple of people tried it with me last night and agreed it was terrible. Opinions were mixed on whether the lamb or the onion was the biggest problem. 'Then a couple of people at work also tried it and came to similar conclusions. 'Except for one guy who said ""it wasn't that bad really. Not good, but not the worst"". 'I'm not sure I can trust him any more.' The trifle looked distinctly unappetising when dished up on a plate - and apparently tasted even worse . In the show the dessert was described as half trifle, half shepherd's pie after two pages in the English cookery book Rachel was using stuck together - but the creators mistakenly used beef instead of the lamb which is traditional in the pie. Towards the end of the season six episode the penny finally drops and Rachel says: 'I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!' If for some reason you would like to recreate this Heston Blumenthal-esque clash of flavours and textures, the recipe would appear to be: A layer of sponge, layer of jam, layer of custard, layer of raspberries, another layer of sponge, layer of lamb sautéed with peas and onions, a bit more custard, banana, and a topping of whipped cream garnished with hundreds and thousands .","Friends fan Neil Killham recreated the infamous trifle-shepherds pie .

"You may think that driving goggles belong to the days when cars were rare on the roads and people dressed in flying jackets to go for a quick drive. But the vintage eyewear may be set to make a comeback in a new hi-tech form, because BMW Mini has produced concept smart specs to give drivers super-human powers such as X-ray-like vision. BMW Group’s answer to Google Glass is designed to let drivers of its Mini model see pop-up virtual displays for directions and other features – and the Elvis-esque glasses can also be worn out of the car. Vintage driving goggles may be set to make a comeback, because BMW Mini has produced concept smart specs (pictured) to give drivers super-human powers in the car . It calls them a ‘revolutionary display concept offering enhanced comfort and safety’. The Augmented Vision goggles will go on show at the Auto Shanghai show and generate ‘screens’ showing information that only the wearer can see. For example, the goggles can project navigation information with arrows onto the roads, as well as showing speed limits and even point out local landmarks. BMW Group’s answer to Google Glass is designed to let drivers of its Mini model see pop-up virtual displays for showing maps and other features – and the Elvis-style glasses (pictured) can also be worn out of the car . The goggles can project navigation information with arrows onto the roads, as well as show speed limits (both pictured) and even point out local landmarks . Driving goggles were worn by racing drivers and wealthy motorists who owned early cars, so keep bugs and flying debris out of their eyes. This image from 1924 shows Enzo Ferrari testing an Alfa-Romeo in Italy . Information such as speed and speed limits are shown on the heads-up display so the data is in the driver’s primary field of view and they don’t have to take their eyes off the road. Navigation arrows are shown ‘on’ the road to show drivers the way, and local landmarks labelled too. An icon is shown on the smartphone-linked display when the wearer receives a text message and the message can be read out by the car. An X-ray view lets wearers see external objects concealed by the car, such as high kerbs and small bollards which may be an obstacle when getting out of the car. An ‘Augmented Parking’ feature projects images obtained from a camera on the far side mirror to the glasses to help drivers park close the curb. The idea is that the eyewear shows relevant information in the driver’s direct field of vision, without obscuring other road users in a bid to boost safety. Data such as speed, is shown just above the wheel, near to the physical dashboard they drivers would usually check without the aid of glasses. The goggles are connected to a smartphone so that wearers see an icon when they have a new text message, which can be read out in the car. Users can select a mode to help them park. A setting called Augmented Parking, shows the driver the distance to the curb, by projecting images obtained from a camera on the far side mirror on the glasses. And the glasses also give drivers X-ray-like vision, by letting users  see external objects concealed by the car. The feature could stop people opening their car door into low bollards and high curbs, for example. ‘Mini Augmented Vision gives an insight into how intelligent connectivity between a Mini car and eyewear into which relevant content is projected might work in the future,’ said Dr Jörg Preißinger, project-manager of Mini Augmented Vision, BMW Group research and technology. The Augmented Vision goggles (pictured) will go on show at the Auto Shanghai show and generate ‘screens’ showing information that only the wearer can see . The idea is that the eyewear shows relevant information in the driver’s direct field of vision but without obscuring other road users in a bid to boost safety. The smart specs can be worn outside the car (pictured) too . Free parking spaces are highlighted in the driver’s field of view so they can spot a space more easily, and a setting, called Augmented Parking, shows the driver the distance to the curb so that an ‘X-ray’ view shows them outside the car - this is illustrated above by showing a waiting dog outside the car . ‘Working with several Qualcomm companies, we have created an interlinked system and augmented reality eyewear with a characteristic Mini design that revolutionise the experience both in and outside the vehicle.’ BMW Mini doesn’t reveal much about how the goggles could be used outside the car, but shows an image of a man in art gallery, hinting that extra features could be unlocked together with using a smartphone. They are a prototype created by the car manufacturer and Qualcomm Connected Experiences, and there is no news about whether the goggles will ever go on sale.

"Vaccine critic: Robert F Kennedy Jr spoke at a documentary screening in Sacramento, California on Tuesday. The son of the late Attorney General Robert Kennedy is a vaccine critic and is currently trying to stop a bill in the state that would make childhood immunizations mandatory . Robert F Kennedy Jr sparked controversy Tuesday when he compared childhood vaccinations to a holocaust. At a screening of the documentary Trace Amounts, the nephew of President John F Kennedy spoke out against a proposed bill in California which would make childhood immunizations mandatory - no matter what their parent's personal beliefs on the vaccines. The documentary purports that there is a connection between thimerosal - a chemical found in several childhood vaccines - and a rise in autism among American children - despite the majority of the scientific community dismissing any connection. 'They can put anything they want in that vaccine and they have no accountability for it,' Kennedy said of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Crest Theater stage in Sacramento. 'They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone. This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country,' Kennedy added. Kennedy said that the documentary helped convince lawmakers in Oregon stop a similar measure in that state, and was hoping it would have a similar effect in California. Anti-vaccine advocates delivered free tickets to the screening to every California lawmaker on Monday, and cordoned off three rows in the theater for them on Tuesday that remained empty. Unpopular opinion: The film screened on Tuesday purports that there is a connection between the vaccine chemical thimerosal and autism, though it is a theory the scientific community has mostly dismissed . Advocate: Kennedy speaks with audience members at the Crest Theater in Sacramento on Tuesday . Senate Bill 277 was scheduled to have its first hearing Wednesday in front of the Senate Health Committee. If passed, the law will remove an exemption in the vaccination law that currently allows parents to cite personal beliefs in not vaccinating their children. The anti-vaccination movement has been sweeping the country, and with more parents refusing common immunizations, many long-dormant illnesses like measles and whooping cough are breaking out in schools. Senator Richard Pan, a Democrat from Sacramento and a pediatrician, called Kennedy's endorsement of the anti-vaccine cause as dangerous. 'I think it is dangerous that he is spreading misinformation about something that’s very important for public health,' Senator Pan told the Sacramento Bee. 'Autism rates have continued to rise even though we are not using thimerosal in vaccines for children. We still haven’t figured out exactly what causes autism. We do know it’s not vaccines.'","The nephew of President John F Kennedy attended the screening of a anti-vaccination documentary Tuesday in Sacramento, California .

"A British couple who are believed to have fled their Berkshire home with their four young children in a bid to escape to Syria have reportedly been arrested in Turkey. Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four children were caught on CCTV boarding a cross-Channel ferry from Dover earlier this month. Thames Valley Police believed they arrived in Calais, France, before travelling south down through Europe in a bid to flee to Syria. However, a Turkish official claimed today that the couple had been arrested in Ankara and are currently in custody with their four children - daughter Zoha, seven, and three sons Essa, four, Zakariva, two, and Yahya, one. Photos released by the Turkish government show Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) pushing prams for their young children. They have been arrested by police in Ankara as they tried to go to Syria . Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four young children have reportedly been arrested in Ankara, Turkey. The family of six have been missing from their home in Slough, Berkshire, since April 7 . The family, who were spotted on CCTV at Dover catching a ferry to France on April 8 (pictured), were not reported missing by their relatives until eight days later. Police fear they may have been trying to get to Syria . Malik, 31, who has fled the UK with his family, was pictured at a protest outside the Lebanese embassy in London in May last year holding a pro-ISIS poster. The large poster stated 'Stop Terrorism Against Sunnis' Earlier, British authorities had said that there was no suggestion the family was doing any fighting in Syria, and it was unclear whether they were sympathetic to members of the Islamic State group or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But earlier today, the Mail revealed how Malik was pictured waving a flag in support of ISIS at a demonstration in London last year. The photograph shows Malik - a member of the banned UK extremist group al-Mujahiroun - holding a pro-ISIS sign at a protest against the arrest of hate preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad in May last year. The picture, taken by extremism researcher Jacob Michelson, shows the 31-year-old standing outside the Lebanese embassy in London brandishing a poster which reads 'Islamic State Is Solution', with the first letter of each word highlighted to spell out 'ISIS'. Bakri, who led a number of hate groups in Britain before being kicked out of the UK, was arrested in Lebanon in May, and is believed still to be in detention there. Earlier today Ms Kiran's family made an emotional appeal directly to her, urging her to get in touch so that they know the family is safe. 'We would like to urge you, Sara and Asif, to make contact with us and let us know that you and the children are safe,' relatives said in a statement. 'Sara, we want to let you know that we love you - we miss you, Asif and the grandchildren. You are not in trouble, we are not angry or upset, and we just want you to return home safely.' Thames Valley Police said yesterday that the Malik family were last seen on Tuesday April 7 but were only reported missing to police last Thursday, April 16. Malik (left) and Dhar (right) are pictured at a protest outside outside Regent's Park Mosque in May last year . Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) disappeared from their home in Berkshire this month . Malik and Ms Kiran, who neighbours said usually wore the full Islamic veil, left home without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to family members, which a force spokesman said was 'entirely out of character for this family'. Police said the family boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais at 12.30am on Wednesday, April 8. Neighbours said the alarm was raised after at least one of their four children failed to attend school. Their grandmother was also seen looking for them and knocking on other doors in the modern block of flats where they lived, asking if anyone had seen the family. Neither Malik nor his partner have attempted to contact any family members or friends since, despite taking their mobile phones with them on the trip, police said. Police said the lack of contact led detectives to believe their reason for leaving Britain may not be legitimate. Deputy Chief Constable John Campbell said yesterday: 'Given the online rhetoric from the Islamic State encouraging people to travel to Syria, the direction of travel and concerns voiced by Asif's family, we are concerned the family may be seeking to travel to Syria.' Anjem Choudary confirmed yesterday that Malik had been a member of al-Mujahiroun, and described him as a 'champion for shariah' who regularly attended the group's events and demonstrations. The Malik family's last known address in Slough, Berkshire, was in the block of flats on the left of this image . Siddhartha Dhar posted this picture of himself with a gun and his newborn baby on Twitter shortly after arriving in Syria last year. Dhar fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year . Both Malik and Dhar are believed to be followers of notorious preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured above) Dhar - one of Choudary's top henchmen - fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year while under investigation by Scotland Yard. He was one of nine men who were detained on September 25 last year on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and supporting al-Muhajiroun. Just hours after publicly declaring he had arrived in Syria, Dhar announced he had become a father to a baby boy who was a member of the latest generation of Islamist extremists. He wrote: 'Alhamdulillah, Allah blessed me with a healthy baby boy in the Islamic State. He is another great addition to the Islamic State. And he's definitely not British.' In a picture posted on Twitter at the time, Dhar was seen posing with an AK47 in one hand and his new-born baby in the other while standing in front of a mustard-coloured pickup truck, wearing a thick military style coat and boots. Two other followers of Choudary who have left Britain to join a terror group are Abu Rahin Aziz, from Luton, and former NHS surgeon Mirza Tariq Ali. Aziz skipped bail before he was handed a 36-week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in London's West End, while Ali was arrested for repeatedly assaulting a bystander at a rally and was reported to have been killed while fighting with the Taliban last month.

Ackerman, 32, plans to frame the x-ray and keep the special molar and her mouth free of cavities in the future . Although the hygienist agreed about the sanctified shape, the dentist was substantially less excited and 'started looking at my teeth', Ackerman told the Huffington Post. She said: 'At my dentist, the computer shows the X-rays as soon as they are taken. 'I said to the hygienist, ""That looks crazy! Do you see I what I see?"" 'My mom passed away from breast cancer when I was 17, so when I saw this, I thought, '""That's my guardian angel.''' The dentist didn't find any cavities during the check-up and Ackerman has vowed to keep her mouth, and especially that holy molar, healthy. She's also planning on framing the x-ray.

Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson has agreed to keep quiet about his sacking from the BBC so the Top Gear Live shows (pictured) can go ahead 'in good spirit' BBC Worldwide, which shares ownership rights of Top Gear, feared Clarson would vent his anger at his sacking during the live shows, the Sunday People reported. But he has agreed to keep quiet on his sacking so the shows can go ahead, meaning fans who have already booked tickets, thought to number almost 100,000, will not be disappointed. However the shows have been rebranded from Top Gear Live to Clarkson, Hammond and May Live. They will not feature any Top Gear branding, show any footage from the programmes or feature The Stig. A source said: 'Jeremy, James and Richard agreed to the terms put to them to let the shows go ahead in a good spirit. They were desperate not to let the fans down. 'Part of the deal was that neither the BBC nor the Top Gear brand would be brought into disrepute. 'Effectively this meant gagging Jeremy from mentioning what had gone on. But he agreed to comply.'

It will come to a close on November 29 at the O2 in London, with the futures of co-stars Richard Hammond and James May unclear. The pair's faces, along with Clarkson's, have both been removed from the top of Top Gear website. Meanwhile the two final episodes of Top Gear - which were canned after the hotel bust-up - could be made from footage shot before the controversial presenter left, but insiders say they can never be screened. The programmes are thought to show the presenters racing limousines and driving classic convertibles, but are not likely to ever see the light of day.

"A North Korean propaganda unit said the U.S. ambassador to South Korea could face a 'bigger mishap' than the knife attack to his face last month if he does not stop insulting North Korea with 'laughable' accusations. U.S. envoy Mark Lippert said in a speech on Wednesday that if North Korea improves its human rights record and takes steps to end its nuclear program, it will be rewarded with prosperity and better ties with the outside world, including the United States. The North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said Lippert's remarks were proof that Washington was intent on hostility. Scroll Down for Video .

'Lippert needs to drop the bad habit of rashly engaging in scheming chatter distorting the truth and instigating war by taking issue with us,' the committee said in a commentary published on Thursday on the Uriminzokkiri propaganda web site. 'Otherwise, next time, he could face a bigger mishap than getting cut in the cheek by a South Korean citizen,' it said.

South Korean police charged Lippert's attacker with attempted murder. He was not charged with any North Korea-related crime after being questioned over his multiple visits.

"Britain is in the grip of an allergy epidemic, a report claims today. The number of allergy sufferers is soaring and almost half of those with severe allergies live in daily fear of suffering a potentially fatal reaction. Yet many Britons are unaware of the seriousness of the condition, says the study by charity Allergy UK. Scroll down for video . The number of allergy sufferers is soaring and almost half of those with severe allergies live in daily fear of suffering a potentially fatal reaction . A poll of more than 2,000 adults to mark Allergy Awareness Week reveals that over two thirds would not know how to help if they saw someone suffering an allergic reaction. Two-thirds also don't know how to use an adrenaline pen which can save the lives of those suffering a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. The warning comes as latest figures show hospital admissions for allergies increased by 8 per cent between 2013 and 2014. More than 20,000 people a year are admitted to hospital in England for allergic reactions. A poll of more than 2,000 adults for the charity to mark the start of Allergy Awareness Week reveals that over two thirds of adults (68 per cent) would not know how to help if they saw someone suffering an allergic reaction . Around 21million Britons have some kind of allergy, ranging from hayfever to reactions to food, medication and wasp stings. Nearly all of those living with a severe allergy say their daily life is affected by the condition. There is no consensus on the reasons for the increase in allergies but explanations put forward include a combination of changing diet, genetics and improved hygiene. For example, we now live in a cleaner world, so children are no longer coming into contact with the bacteria that is needed to develop the immune system.","Hospital admissions for allergies rose by 8 per cent between 2013 and 2014 .

"A drunk father-of-two faces hours of agonising laser surgery after mis-spelling his own son's name while giving himself a DIY tattoo. Tom Moffatt, 27, from Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside, Greater Manchester, was meant to ink 'Riley' - the name of his four-year-old son - into his left arm. But instead of the letter 'L', Mr Moffatt started needling the letter P - and had to urgently 'scribble' over the mistake. What was he thi-ink-ing? Tom Moffatt, 27, from Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside, Greater Manchester, inked his son Riley's name into his arm - but accidentally spelled it incorrectly . Error: Instead of 'L', Mr Moffatt started needling 'P' and had to quickly scribble over it (left). He also attempted to mark himself with Riley's nickname 'Sonny Boy' - but ended up scratching 'Sony Boy' instead (right) He also attempted to mark himself with Riley's nickname 'Sonny Boy' - but ended up scratching 'Sony Boy' across his knuckles instead. The makeshift tattoo session took place in Mr Moffatt's living room with a £70 ink gun bought online. The NHS worker was drunk at the time and said he now considers the inkwork a 'nightmare'. He said: 'I'd never picked up a tattoo gun in my life and I got told by my brother not to do, but I just didn't listen. 'Now, my family are always saying ""you're an idiot, Tom"" and there are plenty of jokes at my expense from my mates. I can't repeat what they say about it. 'I have to hide my arm when I go for interviews. Even Riley has started to notice and points at those tattoos and says ""daddy, I don't like those ones"". It's a nightmare.' Among his homegrown tattoos, Mr Moffatt also has a wonky cross on his forearm, which he drew just a few months after Riley's birth in 2012. He has just endured his second hour-long laser removal session in a bid to get rid of the botched needlework.

Painful: But because the ink has gone so deep, Mr Moffatt is unsure how many more sessions he needs to have . He said: 'I've got a long journey ahead of me to get them all off and I pressed it so deep in one that it's going to be very difficult to get it off.' Mr Moffatt, who also has a two-year-old daughter Kya with partner Rachael Higgins, 23, now wants to use his experience to highlight why people should not attempt to draw their own tattoos. He said: 'Once I've got them off, my job isn't done. We want to try and get a campaign going so people like me can't just go out and buy a gun with no questions asked. 'You shouldn't be able to go on the internet as a 15-year-old Joe Bloggs and buy one. I want to get the message out there that tattoos should only be done by professionals.' The owner of the Maria Patricia Tattoo Removals, where he is being treated, says Mr Moffatt's situation is a stark warning against the dangers of unregulated ink work. Maria said: 'There needs to be more regulation. People don't realise the dangers of the buying off tattoo guns and ink off the internet. 'Tom did just that and had to Google the instructions of how to use it. It might seem like a laugh with mates when you're drunk but it's not easy to fix the damage and people can be left with scarring if they're not careful. 'We're all for tattoos but people need to be aware they can wreck lives and make it difficult to get jobs.'

"A kidnapping in South Carolina was thwarted because the would-be abductor couldn't operate a manual stick shift in the victim's car, police said. 27-year-old Demetri Nelson still had his victim's keys in his pocket when he was arrested Tuesday, several hours after the kidnapping attempt, the Sumter County sheriff's office said in a news release. Deputies said Nelson broke into a 53-year-old woman's home and demanded money. The State reported Nelson allegedly broke into a River Birch Drive home where the victim lives and told her to give him a ride to a Manning Avenue home. Scroll down for video .

'He should be considered armed and dangerous.' Deputies found Nelson and charged him with kidnapping and armed robbery. They said he will also be charged with a possession of a firearm during a violent crime charge. 'Nelson was located and taken into custody without incident around 1 p.m. Tuesday,' the sheriff's office later said in another release posted to Facebook. Bunch told WFSB of the stick-up 'It's got to be incredibly difficult for somebody to deal with that, especially at 1:00 in the morning.'

"A middle-aged punk who fled Britain with her 10-year-old son to join Islamic State extremists  is believed to have been filmed leading women fighters in a hate-filled chanting session in Syria. Sally Jones, 45, who once played in a female punk band, ran away from her home in Chatham, Kent, to wage jihad with her toyboy husband in Raqqa, Syria, the terror group's de facto capital. A video has now emerged which appears to show the mother-of-two leading members of the al-Khanssaa Brigade - the all-women contingent set up by ISIS - in a series of chants expressing the fighters' commitment to jihad. Scroll down for video .

The three-minute footage also shows some of the fighters practising their shooting techniques, firing their guns in quick succession out of the camera's view. The footage then cuts to a woman, believed to be Jones, who is seen shouting furiously in Arabic, while punching her hand in the air. Surrounding her in a semi-circle,  her fellow terrorists echo her sickening cries.

"It's every chocoholic's dream come true - a mountain of Easter eggs covering the entire house. But while Lian Marshall - pictured among the treats - does have two chocolate-loving daughters, this incredible bounty is not for them. Ellie, 10, and Taylor, five, lost their eight-year-old brother Harvey last year to a mystery illness, and when Easter approached they decided to donate all their eggs to the patients at Sheffield Children's Hospital where he was cared for. Lian Marshall - pictured among the treats - has two chocolate-loving daughters but this incredible bounty is not for them. Instead the eggs will be donated to Sheffield Children's Hospital . Once the family, from Furness Vale, Derbyshire, posted on Facebook, kind strangers began to send eggs - and now there are more than 1,000. Some donations have come from as far afield as the US, with many from Ireland and Scotland and the length and breadth of England. The girls came up with the inspirational idea after spending three Easters in a row by Harvey's side at the hospital where they were all lucky enough to receive Easter Eggs. Ellie said: 'I thought it was going to be never-ending! It feels really nice to remember him and I don't think the hospital were expecting as many. Ellie Marshall, 10, and Taylor Biggin (both above with mother Lian), five, came up with the idea in memory of their brother Harvey . 'It feels a bit strange at the moment. I've never had this much chocolate in my house before.' Their 29-year-old mother, who was a full-time carer for Harvey and now works as a support worker for disabled children, said: 'I was taken aback by it all. We didn't expect to get the response that we did. It's really touching what the girls are doing. 'They were really close to Harvey, they had a really tight bond. Especially Ellie. The hospital think it's amazing and a really nice thing to do. 'On the second day I thought 72 eggs was an amazing response but when it continued the girls were a bit overwhelmed by it all and a bit speechless. The eggs are still arriving.

"The world's longest ever kidney donation chain linked its final donor to ailing recipient last month when a Wisconsin woman became the 34th person whose life was saved by the record-setting program. Mitzi Neyens, 77, was successfully matched with a Philadelphia man after turning to the National Kidney Registry's paired exchange program--her only option since her age barred her from receiving a deceased donor's organ. When she received the kidney March 26, the operation completed a nationwide chain that linked strangers from San Diego to Boston who have loved ones in need with patients desperately in need of a transplant. 32 lives saved: Mitzi Neyens, 77, (left) was the last link in a chain of 34 kidney transplants--the world's longest such chain to date. She received a kidney because her husband Bill gave his kidney to a patient in need . Unbreakable love: Neyens has suffered from kidney disease for most of her 53-year marriage to Bill. She received a kidney March 26 thanks to his generosity . On the day of Neyen's transplant, eight surgeons in four states linked five hospitals through transplants. Neyen, who's battled kidney disease much of her life, received her kidney after her husband--who was not a match for her--gave his kidney to someone else in need. In turn, Neyen received an organ from Matt Crane, 55, who lives outside of Philadelphia, reports ABC News. Crane's wife Michele's Type 1 diabetes caused her to need a new kidney, which she received thanks to her husband's donation. 'If it took for me to give my kidney to somebody in order to get Michele a good healthy kidney, I'm ready to do it,' Crane told ABC, which will air a story about the record-breaking chain on Nightline on Tuesday evening. The last length of this historic chain began at the University of Medical Center in Baltimore when Latwanya Goslee donated a kidney on behalf of her brother, who'd already received a transplant. Her kidney was driven 250 miles to Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, where it was transplanted into Gary Watson. A friend of Watson's daughter, 44-year-old paralegal Christine Brock, donated the kidney that allowed Watson to receive a transplant. Her organ was flown 368 miles to New Jersey then picked up by a courier and driven to New York City. Starts with altruism: The chain that ended with Neyes receiving a lifesaving transplant began months prior when Minneapolis attorney Kathy Hart gave a kidney without having a loved one in need of a transplant (FILE) A kidney was then taken from New York to Philadelphia and transplanted into Michele Crane. Her husband Matt's kidney was removed and taken to Madison, Wisconsin via a flight to Chicago and a 133-mile drive. That's where Neyen's received it. Et, voila. As ABC notes, these chains can't start without a donor who gives his or her kidney in exchange for nothing. This particular chain began with Kathy Hart, a Minneapolis attorney, who told ABC her unbelievably altruistic choice was an easy one to make. 'I think the fact that it was to a stranger is one of the parts that people have a really hard time grasping. But it actually even makes it easier,' she said. 'From the very beginning I didn't have an attachment to the outcome or any judgment attached to who gets it or who's deserving… I have an opportunity to give, and why wouldn't I?'","The life-saving trend saves lives by allowing donors to give kidneys to strangers in order for a loved one to receive a kidney .

"A mysterious ‘warm blob’ of water off the West coast of the US could explain why states like California are experiencing their worst ever drought, while the East is battered by freezing weather. The blob in the ocean was discovered last year, with temperatures one to four degrees Celsius (two to seven degrees Fahrenheit) above surrounding ‘normal’ water. And the blob has now extended about 1,000 miles (1,600km) offshore, from Mexico up to Alaska, and could herald a warmer summer for some regions. Scroll down for video . A 'blob' of warm water 2,000 miles across is sitting in the Pacific Ocean (shown in diagram). Since last June it has extended from Alaska to Mexico. It has been present since 2013 and causing fish to seek shelter elsewhere. And a new University of Washington study says it could be responsible for droughts . A new study by the University of Washington found that a high-pressure ridge could be causing the blob, by trapping heat in the water. In June of last year, the huge patch of water stretched 1,000 miles (1,600km) in each direction, and was 300ft (90 metres) deep. Dr Nick Bond, a climate scientist at the University of Washington, coined the term ‘the blob’ in June. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state. Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century. And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. Ten months later, the blob is now squashed up against the coast, and Dr Bond says all models point to it continuing through the end of this year. ‘In the fall of 2013 and early 2014 we started to notice a big, almost circular mass of water that just didn't cool off as much as it usually did, so by spring of 2014 it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year,’ said Dr Bond. Researchers said it may have contributed to the state of Washington's mild 2014 winter and might signal a warmer summer. But exactly how this area of warmer water has formed, or how long it will stay, remains a mystery. One thing that can be studied, though, is its effects. As air passes over warmer water and reaches the coast it brings more heat and less snow, which the scientists say helped cause current drought conditions in California, Oregon and Washington. The researchers said that it might not only be causing warmer temperatures on the West coast, but also cooler temperatures on the East coast. It could also be playing a part in circulating cold and wet air to the central and eastern states of the US. California's drought (stock image shown left) is one of the worst on record, while the East coast of the US (Central Park in New York shown right) has seen unusually cold temperatures . It is also having an effect on marine life. Fish have been spotted in unusual places, supporting recent reports that West coast marine ecosystems are suffering and the food web is being disrupted by warm, less nutrient-rich Pacific Ocean water. Dr Bond noted that, while this phenomenon likely wasn’t caused by global warming, it could be a sign of similar weather to come. ‘This is a taste of what the ocean will be like in future decades,’ Dr Bond said. ‘It wasn't caused by global warming, but it's producing conditions that we think are going to be more common with global warming.’ The 'blob' is also having an effect on marine life. Fish, like the Thresher Shark (shown), have been spotted in unusual places, supporting recent reports that West Coast marine ecosystems are suffering and the food web is being disrupted by warm, less nutrient-rich Pacific Ocean water .","A 'blob' of warm water 2,000 miles across is sitting in the Pacific Ocean .

"A police corruption trial in Philadelphia is far from over, but already one trial witness has been handed a losing verdict. Witness Robert Kushner lost his varsity coaching job at a private academy after testifying this week about his years selling marijuana. Kushner, 32, is one of more than a dozen former drug dealers testifying for the federal government about allegations of police wrongdoing. Witness Robert Kushner lost his varsity coaching job at the Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy after testifying this week about his years selling marijuana . He told jurors Tuesday that some of the undercover officers on trial had stolen $81,000 in cash and 7 pounds of marijuana from him during a 2007 arrest. That history came as news to officials at Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy in suburban Bryn Mawr. Kushner had passed a background check when he was hired to coach basketball in 2010, head of school Sharon Levin told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Kushner testified that the 2007 charges were expunged as part of a probationary sentence. On cross-examination, he acknowledged that he was arrested again in 2011 and sentenced to four years of probation. He also pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in 2008. This undated photo combination provided by the Philadelphia Police Department shows from top left to right, Philadelphia Police officers Thomas Liciardello, Brian Reynolds, Michael Spicer, and from bottom left to right, Perry Betts, Linwood Norman and John Speiser, all of whom were arrested and charged in the 26-count indictment include racketeering conspiracy, extortion, robbery, kidnapping and drug dealing . Kushner told the newspaper that he never meant to deceive the school, where he worked as a seasonal employee. And he believes he is innocent of the 2011 charges. 'All of the stuff that happened in 2007, that was eight years ago and was a bad phase of my life that I've moved past and never really looked back,' Kushner said Wednesday. ""I'm very sorry, and I want the best for the kids."" He also coaches in a Narberth summer league, where director Dan Kazanicka described him as an excellent coach who is good with kids. Lawyers for the six former drug squad officers accused of racketeering have said the government case is based on 19 lying drug dealers and a rogue ex-cop.","Witness Robert Kushner lost his varsity coaching job at a private academy after testifying this week about his years selling marijuana .

"A Missouri inmate was executed Tuesday night for killing a man in a fit of rage over child support payments 16 years ago. Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri. His fate was sealed after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down several appeals, including one claiming Cole was mentally ill and unfit for execution. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri and was pronounced dead at 10.24pm, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections wrote in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri . He declined to order a last meal and received the day's inmate tray meal of a turkey and bologna sandwich, a cookie and fruit punch. He did not provide a final written statement, the spokesman said. Department of Corrections Director George A. Lombardi read the following statement from Gov. Jay Nixon: 'Next week marks the observance of Crime Victims’ Rights Week in Missouri, and tonight I ask the people of our state to especially remember Anthony Curtis, murdered by the man whose sentence was carried out tonight. 'Far too often, the names of those who are victims of violent crime, such as Anthony Curtis, are the names that are forgotten. 'Please join us in keeping Anthony Curtis and his loved ones in your thoughts and prayers.' On Tuesday, Gov. Nixon refused a clemency petition that raised concerns about the fact that Cole, who was black, was convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. Cole and his wife, Terri, were married for 11 years and had two children before divorcing in 1995. The couple fought about visitation and he was upset about child support payments, authorities said. By 1998, Cole was $3,000 behind in child support. Attorney General Chris Koster said Cole became angry when he learned that a payroll withholding order was issued to his employer, taking the money out of his check. 'Before I give her another dime, I'll kill (her),' Cole told co-workers, according to Koster. The first deduction appeared on his August 21, 1998, paycheck. Hours later, Cole forced his way into his ex-wife's home by throwing a tire jack through a glass door, Koster said. He was confronted by Curtis, a friend who was visiting. Andre Cole used a kitchen knife to repeatedly stab Curtis, then Terri Cole. Curtis died but Terri Cole survived. Cole fled the state but surrendered 33 days later. He claimed at trial that he did not bring a weapon into Terri Cole's house and that Curtis initiated the attack with a knife. Andre Cole's brother, DeAngelo Cole, 38, of Las Vegas, said the attack was out of character for his sibling. He called it a crime of passion. 'It was a one-time thing,' DeAngelo Cole said. 'He didn't have a history of that kind of behavior.' Cole's attorney, Joseph Luby, said Cole's mental health deteriorated during the more than a decade he spent in prison. He said Cole was plagued by psychosis and constantly heard voices in his head. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (above) in Bonne Terre, Missouri . The courts were not convinced. Both the Missouri Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to halt the execution based on mental health concerns. The U.S. Supreme Court also turned away appeals based on Missouri's secretive method of obtaining the execution drug pentobarbital and over how instructions were given to the jury. The jury itself was the source of the clemency request to Nixon. Advocates for Cole, including the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, said his case was among many in which St. Louis County prosecutors unfairly prohibited black jurors from hearing a death penalty case involving a black suspect. All 12 jurors in Cole's case were white. Kimber Edwards, who was scheduled for execution in May, was also convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. The Missouri Supreme Court, without explanation, canceled the execution orders for Edwards earlier this month. Missouri tied Texas for the most executions in 2014 with 10. Missouri has now executed 15 men since November 2013.","Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri and was executed by lethal injection on Tuesday .

"The terrorist group Al Qaida seized control of a major airport, sea port and oil terminal in southern Yemen today, consolidating its hold on the country's largest province. It came  amid wider chaos pitting Shiite rebels against forces loyal to the exiled president and a Saudi-led air campaign. Military officials and residents said Al Qaida fighters clashed briefly with members of one of Yemen's largest brigades outside Mukalla, a city the militants overran earlier this month and where they freed prison inmates. Protests: Shiite rebels chant slogans as they hold up their weapons during a demonstration against an arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Houthi leaders, in Sanaa, Yemen on Thursday . Today, Shiite rebels were involved in a demonstration on Thursday against an arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday . The militants then seized control of the Riyan airport and moved to secure their hold on the city's main sea port, which is also an oil terminal. Security officials said the leaders of the brigade in charge of protecting the entire area fled. The latest advance marks a major gain for Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, as the Yemeni affiliate is known. The group has exploited the chaos in Yemen, where Shiite rebels, along with allied military units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, captured the capital in September and have been advancing despite a three-week Saudi-led air campaign. The rebels are staunch opponents of Al Qaida but are currently locked in fierce battles with forces loyal to Yemen's internationally recognised President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled to Saudi Arabia last month. The south eastern city of Mukalla is the capital of Yemen's largest province, Hadramawt, where Al Qaida has long maintained a presence despite US drone strikes and Yemeni counter terrorism operations. Nasser Baqazouz, an activist in the city, said the troops guarding the airport put up little resistance. A politician in Mukalla, Ali al-Kathiri, said Al Qaida and local tribal leaders had been negotiating with the brigade commanders to ensure a peaceful handover.

Rebels protesting against the arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Houthi leaders . However, some fighters, suspected of being loyal to Saleh, clashed with the militants. A smaller air defence brigade handed over its camp to Al Qaida, apparently to avoid clashes, al-Kathiri said. A Saudi-led coalition has been striking the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and their allies from the air since March 26, but has carried out no attacks on Mukalla or other Al Qaida-controlled areas. The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said that at least 364 civilians are reported to have been killed since the start of the airstrikes at the end of March, including at least 84 children and 25 women. This is in addition to hundreds of fighters killed. Today, Shiite rebels were involved in a demonstration against an arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.

"The founder and CEO of Chobani has settled a lawsuit filed by his ex-wife, who laid claim to half the $2 billion Greek yogurt empire. Hamdi Ulukaya was once a Turkish immigrant with dreams of making it big in the U.S. food industry. His American-born ex, Dr. Ayse Giray, sued him in 2012 on claims her family lent him $500,000 that helped make his dreams a reality. On April 10, after years of wrangling and a pronouncement by Giray's camp just last month that the parties were no where near an agreement, Ulukaya settled for an unknown sum. Settled: Hamdi Ulukaya, the founder and CEO of Chobani, has settled a lawsuit filed by his ex-wife, who laid claim to half the $2 billion Greek yogurt empire . The settlement came just before Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla was due to rule on whether Giray could retroactively be named a shareholder in Chobani's predecessor company, a feta cheese operation called Euphrates. Giray first sued Ulukaya in 2012 for a 53 percent stake in the company. The two were married just two years in the 1990s and Ulukaya's company was not an issue in their divorce, according to the New York Post. Yogurt boom: Giray first sued Ulukaya in 2012 for a 53 percent stake in the company. The two were married just two years in the 1990s and Ulukaya's company was not an issue in their divorce . However, in early 2015, court documents revealed that Giray was basing at least part of her claim on scribbled handwritten notes her lawyers were 'confirmation that monies were provided.' Ulukaya wrote the notes off as mere 'family expenses.' Nonetheless, his camp settled rather than leave themselves open to losing assets worth $1 billion to Giray. But even with this suit behind him, Ulukaya still has business problems ahead of him. Since early this year, Chobani has been considering replacing him as CEO, the New York Post reported, citing people familiar with the matter. One of the primary reasons for the removal of Ulukaya, who founded the company, is a product recall in 2013 that led to negative EBITDA of $87 million in the fourth quarter, the paper reported, citing internal documents it reviewed. The recall was a result of bad design and layout incorporated during the construction of the company's $450 million Idaho factory, and due to lack of training for workers, the Post reported. Ulukaya, who built the factory, kept a lot of his key executives in the dark as they continued to spend freely amid mounting losses and increasing chaos at the factory, the report said. Private-equity firm TPG invested $750 million in the New Berlin, New York-based company last year to save it from the cash crunch arising as a result of the problems at Idaho.

"Chinese hospitals are harvesting up to 11,000 organs from political prisoners without anaesthetic every year, according to a new documentary. Some patients were still alive as they were secretly placed into incinerators in hospital boiler rooms after parts of their bodies had been removed, it has been claimed. One former medical student revealed how ‘blood was still running’ as he cut through a body while a health worker told how her husband, a surgeon, had removed corneas from 2,000 people while they were still alive. Scroll down for video . Thousands of organs are being harvested from political prisoners in China with the Falungong group a key target, it is claimed. Members of the group are shown mocking up an operation as part of a 2014 protest . The harrowing details were revealed in the SBS Dateline documentary Human Harvest: China's Organ Trafficking which charted an eight year investigation in to what is said to be a multi-billion pound ‘organs-on-demand’ transplant programme. It reveals Red Cross estimations that just 37 people are registered organ donors in China, even though the country has the second highest rate of transplants in the world. Human Rights lawyer and Nobel peace prize nominee David Matas told Leon Lee’s documentary that political prisoners make up the huge difference in the figures – with the banned religious group, the Falun Gong, a key target. ‘Somebody's being killed for the organs. There's no other way to explain what's happening,’ he said. Mr Matas added that this explained the short wait for transplants in the country. Human Rights lawyer David Matas (pictured) claims people are being killed for organs in China - a country where there are only 37 registered organ donors according to the Red Cross . ‘Everywhere else in the world it would be months and years. When you book a transplant in advance, for a heart transplant, and you go to China and you get a transplant within a few days.’ The documentary claims that doctors and medical students in state-run military and civilian hospitals are taking thousands of organs a year from donors while they are still alive. One former health worker is quoted as saying: ‘I testify to the atrocious crime that the hospital committed in removing livers and corneas from living Falun Gong members. ‘Some of them were still alive when they were secretly burnt in the incinerator that was in the boiler room.’ It has been claimed that members of the banned religious group, the Falun Gong, are key targets (file picture) One medical student revealed how he took a liver and two kidneys from one person in an operation that took 30 minutes. Chinese officials have denied the allegations, saying that organs are taken from volunteers, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. SBS quotes Health Minister Jiefu Huang as having said in a previous state television interview: 'The main source of our organs is from death row prisoners.' But China's government last year vowed that this programme would be wound up by August this year. Officials have faced criticism over the use of death row prisoners, but human rights lawyers involved in the investigation want further action with those responsible brought before the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The documentary aired on Tuesday night on SBS Dateline.","Eight year investigation claims thousands had organs removed in China .

"A Frenchman was in custody tonight suspected of killing his British expat neighbour and throwing his body down a well in rural Normandy. David King, 70, and originally from east London, had not been seen for six months in the picturesque hamlet of Pierres, in the Calvados department, south west of Caen. He retired there from his job as an engineer in Britain some 15 years ago. On October 27, he went to tea with friends living close to his home, and is thought to have got into an argument with one, aged 28. Disappeared: David King, 70, had been missing for six months from his home in Normandy, France . Carole Etienne, the Caen prosecutor, said: 'He admitted there was an argument, and to putting the body in the well. In the coming hours we will try to learn more about what caused the death.' Ms Etienne added: 'We're no longer following a missing person's enquiry, but one for manslaughter because of the presence of unusual clues. 'Inconsistent explanations' and DNA analysis all led investigators to 'suspect someone in connection with a killing', said Ms Etienne. 'He has not yet explained the circumstances of the death,' said Ms Etienne. I have the before, I have the after, I don't have the in-between.' Mr King had been living in France for 15 years . Ms Etienne said the suspect had not yet been identified publicly. On Wednesday police sniffer dogs were taken to Mr King's hamlet, and found his corpse at the bottom of the 12ft well. Mr King lived alone, but regularly kept in touch with family, including grandchildren in the UK, said another source close to the investigation. It is believed he has in son in Brighton, East Sussex and a daughter in Australia, who French police initially thought he was visiting after his disappearance last year. He was known to have a heart condition, and there were concerns that he had travelled away without his medication. Other theories included suicide, but his family did not believe it, as they had been looking forward to seeing him at Christmas. It was also suggested that he might have gone to see his daughter in Australia, but this was ruled out too because a passport was found at his home. International organisations including the Lucie Blackman Trust were involved in trying to solve the mystery, posting pictures of Mr King online. His disappearance 'caused a great deal of fear' among British expats living in the area - one which is very beautiful but also extremely isolated, said the source. In February, Mr King's car, a Renault Scenic was found parked in Vire, a nearby town, but there was no sign of any body. A friend told The Independent: 'We had grown used to the idea that we would never see Dave again but this is the worst possible outcome to the mystery.' Mr King was a keen gardener who chose to settle in an area popular with older British expatriates. Autopsy results are expected to be announced on Friday. Discovery: Police had thought he was in his car (pictured), but his body has now been found down a well.

"Taken hundreds of feet in the sky, these spectacular birds-eye photos taken by cameras fixed to manned drones show the stunning beauty of buildings and communities around the world. But attempting to recreate these amazing pictures is now much more difficult - and in some cases impossible - as a result of a clampdown on the use of drones for photographic purposes. New Zealand photographer Amos Chapple travelled the world during the 18 months with a quadcopter in his backpack between 2012 and 2014 when it was easier to take aerial pictures using a drone. Since then restrictive laws and regulations have been implemented across the world, due to privacy concerns, commercial rights and worries about damage to property or crashes in the air with other aircraft. From capturing the street scene in Barcelona to the majestic glory of the Taj Mahel, his photographs of some of the world’s most far-flung and enchanting places could become ‘one of a kind’ as he re-posted them under a new blog post: 'My Aerial Drone Shots Would Be Totally Illegal Today'. ‘There was a window of about 18 months where it was possible to fly these things anywhere and people were excited to see it’, Mr Chapple told Business Insider. ‘I’m glad I made use of that time.’ Scroll down for video .

Terrifying moment: Manuel Delisle (pictured) allegedly threatened a family with a chainsaw in a fit of road rage after the family attempted to follow him to record his license plate because he cut them off . After the video was posted at 7pm on Sunday night to Facebook it has been shared over 30,000 times and has over 1 million views. Delisle was arrested on Monday following the release of the viral video. Children can be heard screaming and crying in the background of the chilling footage. 'In the heat of the moment, I kept filming.... As a mother, I got very angry. I said, ""Before threatening my children, come and see me,""' Cyr told CBC Montreal. The man eventually went back to his car, says Cyr, after noticing that he was being filmed and that Cyr was calling police. 'I think the man noticed that, first of all, I caught it all on video, and he could see on my face that I was terrorized and he saw me call the police,' said Cyr. Scared family: Karine Cyr (center) recorded the confrontation on Sunday as she was vacationing with her husband Alexandre Hermenier (left) and their two children . Cyr said that when the incident occured, her husband Hermenier was driving the car and that her two children were in the back seat. Cyr said that Delisle was driving recklessly and cut them off so her husband Hermenier followed the driver to record his license plate number. The two cars ended up in a dead end road and that's when Hermenier parked his car so that the other car could not leave. Hermenier said that's when Delisle allegedly threatened them with a loud piece of machinery. 'It was a terrifying situation,' Hermenier said. Cyr says that in the future if she sees a driver being reckless, she will not follow him, especially if she is with her children. 'Everyone will react differently, but I would like to say that if you see dangerous driving, do not follow the driver — the mistake that we made with two children in the back seat. We regret it tremendously. If it happens to you, pull over and just call police.' Delisle is scheduled to return to court July 7. He was released for the time being and ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and workplace and told not to communicate with them.

"This is the spectacular moment a goose narrowly avoids a snapping fox’s jaw after the sly animal had given an almighty leap in a bid to take down the large bird. However despite the fox’s best efforts to capture the Canadian goose - it only came away with a single feather. The action-packed photographs were captured by Roger Byng, 67, on the Wetlands surrounding the Severn estuary in Slimbridge, Gloucester. Lunch! The hungry fox races across the grass towards the large Canada goose... Launch! He is poised to take off as his startled prey takes flight ... Mr Byng, from Bristol, was in a hide ‘with the intention of photographing small British birds, such as Bullfinches, Long-tailed Tits and Wrens as part of a relaxing day’s photography.’ However Mr Byng’s relaxing day’s photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye. ‘I suddenly saw it break into a run towards the geese so I quickly moved my camera and lens to focus on the fox,’ explained the married Grandfather-of-nine. ‘I had no time to change any settings on my camera but managed to capture the action as he tried to take down the goose.’ Gotcha! The fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird . Escape: The goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake . The retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey. ‘The fox was on a search for food, evidently being hungry enough to tackle a large goose. ‘It broke into a run in an effort to take one of the geese, who at the last moment caught sight of his approach. ‘Whilst one of the geese clears the grass and rises into the air quite quickly, the other one was slower to rise enabling the fox to get close. Spitting feathers! The unsuccessful fox drops back down to earth . ‘It jumped into the air to make a grab, with jaws open and teeth displayed. It is the good fortune of the goose that he gained just sufficient height that the fox was only able to get a bite on his tail feathers. ‘The fox came away with a single feather, whilst the goose escaped with a squawk!’ The wetlands that the pictures were taken on are managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and can be accessed by paying a small fee or by taking out an annual membership granting you entry to all of the sites in the UK. Mr Byng adds: ‘Slimbridge is a wonderful location for witnessing the activity of a large number of birds and wildlife, including migratory species such as Bewick Swans.’","Photos capture spectacular moment goose narrowly avoids fox's jaw .

"Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to quit because he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news . Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to call time on his 17 year reign because he was becoming increasing depressed by American politics and watching cable news. Speaking for the first time since making his shock decision, Stewart said he was looking forward to not having to watch the 'relentless' 24-hour news networks anymore. 'Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,' Stewart told The Guardian. 'I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don't get turd lung disease.' Asked if he'd ever voluntarily watch Fox News, Stewart said, 'Let's say that it's a nuclear winter, and I have been wandering, and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and I think that light might be a food source that could help my family. 'I might glance at it for a moment until I realize, that's Fox News, and then I shut it off.' Stewart also confessed that his 'moments of dissatisfaction' with the show had started to become more frequent. 'It's not like I thought [The Daily Show] wasn't working any more, or that I didn't know how to do it. It was more, ""Yup, it's working. But I'm not getting the same satisfaction,'"" he said. 'These things are cyclical. You have moments of dissatisfaction, and then you come out of it and it's OK. But the cycles become longer and maybe more entrenched, and that's when you realize, ""OK, I'm on the back side of it now.'"" Scroll down for video . Stewart said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance in 2011 . Even the upcoming 2016 Presidential election campaign couldn't reignite Stewart's passion the way it once did. 'I'd covered an election four times, and it didn't appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,' said Stewart. 'Honestly, it was a combination of the limitations of my brain and a format that is geared towards following an increasingly redundant process, which is our political process. 'I was just thinking, ""Are there other ways to skin this cat?' And, beyond that, it would be nice to be home when my little elves get home from school, occasionally."" Stewart also said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance. The former secretary of defense appeared on The Daily Show in 2011 for an interview, which the comedian says he messed up. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, left, would be taking over . 'He just went into the general gobbledegook,' said Stewart. ""Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah."" I should have pushed, but he's very adept at deflecting.' Rumsfeld, who was on the show to promote his memoir, Known And Unknown, dodged Stewart's questions about faulty U.S. intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, 31, would be taking over. Noah has already had to combat  accusations of anti-Semitism over a series of old tweets. Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, recently calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' The exiting host told The Guardian that one reason for  stepping down early in the presidential election cycle was to give Noah a big story to tackle. Stewart said he felt 'that, for the show, you don't want to leave when the cupboard's bare. So I think it's a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign.'","Two months after announcing he is leaving Stewart has revealed that he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news .

"There is an insufficient supply of whooping cough vaccine in Australia, according to Queensland Health. However, medical professionals insist the resource shortage will not affect the immunisation programs for babies, children and pregnant women. It comes less than a month after the death of 32-day-old Riley who died after contracting whooping cough. His parents Catherine and Greg are now leading a campaign, urging adults to vaccinate themselves and their children to prevent more infant deaths from the terrible disease. The adult whooping cough vaccine will not be available in Australia until July, according to ABC News. However, although whooping cough is less severe in adults, infected adults do pose a serious risk for infants and children who are not vaccinated. Scroll down for video . Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised . Riley's father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his 'darling little angel Riley' 'The one product that is in short supply is not part of the formal national immunisation program, but is a booster dose that's used generally by GPs for adults,' Queensland Health senior medical officer Dr Alun Richards told ABC News. 'We have sufficient stocks to vaccinate children as part of the school-based vaccination program.' On March 15, two days before baby Riley died, his mother Catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough. 'If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done. 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle with it at (Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital). Please keep him in your thoughts!,' she wrote. 'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Riley's father Greg added. Dr Richards could not confirm why the shortage has taken place but told ABC that it is not abnormal. His mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life' 'I don't know whether it's because of increased demand in the world or if it's another issue, but there are vaccination shortages from time to time,' he said. 'There are other preparations on the market [and] they're not all in short supply.' For people opting to be vaccinated against whooping cough, they may be deferred by their GP until more supplies are available. 'These people can return when supplies are again available,' Dr Jeannette Young told ABC News. Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. 'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.' Whooping cough (also known as 'pertussis') is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'. Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother's antibodies do not provide reliable protection. It's very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it's usually not as serious. Symptoms . The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive 'whooping' noise, which is how the condition gets its name. The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include: . These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes. Infants younger than six months may not make the 'whoop' sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing. Information supplied by HealthDirect.gov.au . In 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'. 'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said. The devastated parents have set up a Facebook page that already has over 25,000 likes .","Queensland Health confirms there's a shortage of whooping cough vaccine .

"Aiming high: Nigel Farage visits an Army veterans' centre near Sandwich in Kent today . Nigel Farage last night held out an olive branch to David Cameron as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible Labour government. The Ukip leader called on Conservatives to vote tactically for him in seats where they cannot win in order to help keep the Tory leader as Prime Minister. And in the strongest hint yet that they could work together, Mr Farage dropped his demand that the Tories ditch Mr Cameron before any post election deal. In a direct appeal to Tory voters, Mr Farage said he believed many were in 'their hearts' closer to his position of wanting an EU referendum as soon as possible without any attempted re-negotiation. Mr Farage also revealed that he has already held informal discussions with Tories about potential post-election arrangements. Yesterday, as he launched his party's manifesto, Mr Farage called on Mr Cameron to join with him to lock Ed Miliband and the SNP's Alex Salmond out of Downing Street. Ukip has reduced its list of targets to just ten seats as it has been squeezed in the polls, but Mr Farage believes in seats such as Great Grimsby and Dudley North it has a better chance than the Tories at snatching them from Labour. Asked if it was time that Conservative supporters realised that Ukip could help them stop a Labour government, Mr Farage said they needed to vote tactically. He said: 'One of the things I have completely failed to understand is how the Conservatives would want to say vote Ukip get Labour in constituencies like Grimsby and Rotherham and Dudley North and all those Labour seats in which we are the challenger. I just don't understand it.' He warned that a Labour-led government backed up by the SNP 'would not be a very good thing for the country'. Asked if he and Mr Cameron could 'lock out' Mr Miliband and Mr Salmond from Downing Street, he replied: 'Well if that were possible then we would try and do that.' Farage looks at items being made in the wood craft room as he meets veterans and staff during a visit to the Futures for Heroes centre in Kent . The Ukip leader called on Conservatives to vote tactically for him in seats where they cannot win in order to help keep the Tory leader as Prime Minister . Farage shakes hands with Andrew Ferris, a former soldier with the Princess of Wale's Royal Regiment . Mr Farage previously said that Mr Cameron would need to step down as Tory leader before he could do any sort of post-election deal. But yesterday he said there would be no problem working with Mr Cameron personally. Mr Farage revealed he has already held informal discussions with Tories about potential post-election arrangements . He said: 'Albeit reluctantly, David Cameron has been forced into making a pledge on a referendum. There are circumstances in which we could do a deal with him but the referendum has got to be a proper one and not in 2017.' Mr Cameron a fortnight ago urged Conservative supporters who have defected to Ukip to 'come home' and pleaded with them not to use their vote in the General Election as a 'protest'. Yesterday asked what his message was to Tory voters, Mr Farage called on them to work with him to bring forward the referendum Mr Cameron has promised on EU membership by 2017. He made a reference to comments by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, that any meaningful renegotiation would not be possible until 2019. He said: 'I've said from the start there is no re-negotiation of any value whatsoever and it would appear that my old mate Mr Juncker is backing that up. 'The idea that we would need to wait for two or more years for a referendum is not something that I find acceptable.' Mr Farage said he would also want the Tories to match his commitment to Nato's target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence. He admitted that he had already been involved in 'informal' discussions with those in other parties about possible deals. As well as an early referendum on withdrawal from the EU, the Ukip manifesto promised a radical reduction in immigration, increased spending on defence and an £18billion tax giveaway. A journalist was heckled at UKIP'S manifesto launch after he asked why there was only one black person in the policy document. The party's supporters jeered at the reporter as he noted there were 27 white people pictured, but only one non-white person in the 76-page manifesto. A black woman is shown with Ukip's overseas aid spokesman Nathan Gill in a section setting out how the party would cut up to £11billion a year from the foreign aid budget. The reporter asked Mr Farage: 'Are you happy the only black face is on the overseas aid page?' Mr Farage did not answer as Ukip supporters jeered. A group of black and Asian party activists were then cheered as they stood up in the middle of the event. A journalist who asked about Mr Farage's remarks on stopping foreigners with HIV entering the UK for treatment was also heckled.","Nigel Farage called on Tories to vote tactically in seats they cannot win .

If you're feeling a little daring this season but find ditching your bra slightly daunting, Lydia Jones, who is CEO of online retailer wantherwardrobe.com, has some great tips for feeling confident and sexy in your new dress. - Invest in a pair of nipple covers from your local department store, these are great for creating a smooth look whilst also hiding any embarrassing moments during the colder weather! - Body tape is great for keeping your plunging neckline or open sides in the right places so you feel comfortable and confident all night long - just make sure you invest in a higher market brand so the tape sticks on place . - Avoid light polyester fabrics in colours such as white and cream, these tend to go see-through and are difficult to reduce exposure . - Choose fabrics that have a heavier weight to them such as a crepe or cotton, these will avoid the risk of exposing any nipple covers or body tape and will stay in place much easier . - If you're feeling a little exposed, try a longer hairstyle as this will cover you up slightly .","Trendsetter Rihanna ditched her bra on a visit to Santa Monica on Tuesday .

"The daughter of a paedophile jailed for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl said her father should be hanged for his crimes. Becky Handley, 20, discovered her father, Raymond Handley's grisly crimes against a child in a local newspaper article. He was jailed for 13-and-a-half years at Birmingham Crown Court after details of the repeated assaults emerged. Now his daughter, who was kept from seeing him as a child, has disowned him and vowed to change her name via deed poll. Becky Handley said her father Raymond Handley should be 'hanged' for sexually assaulting a girl, eight. Miss Handley, a restaurant worker, learned of his crimes after reading about them online . So disgusted with his crimes, Miss Handley said her father deserves the death penalty rather than a prison term. 'I want the death penalty brought back for people like my father. I think he should be hanged for what he has done.' Speaking of the victim, who Miss Handley says she does not know, she added: 'I really feel bad for this young girl and I really hope that she gets through it. 'He has stolen a little girl's innocence and I hope he rots in prison and dies there for what he has done.' Birmingham Crown Court heard how Handley, 62, sexually assaulted his young victim twice before threatening to kill her mother if details of the abuse emerged. Miss Handley now wants to change her name via deed poll . It took the child years to report the incidents to police for fear of him. She is understood to have suffered severe psychological since. Miss Handley was not aware of her father's crimes until her sister showed her a local newspaper article which detailed the case. 'I just saw the name in the headline and I immediately thought ""Oh God, he's dead!"". 'But when I read the headline properly, I just couldn't believe what I was seeing,' added the restaurant worker. 'I felt deeply ashamed to have the Handley name. I want my father to die behind bars.' Miss Handley did not see her father as a child and was discouraged from contacting him by her mother as an adult. She has lived with her mother, Dawn Williams, and stepfather since she was nine. Speaking of her former husband, Ms Williams, 52, said: 'I always had a gut feeling about him. I found out that he was breaking into schools and houses and I kicked him out.' The pair divorced before Becky's first birthday. 'He is a horrible man. He's a real rotten apple and I wish I'd known more about him before I started a relationship with him. 'What he has done is disgusting. I can't even think about what he has done to that poor girl.' Jailing Handley earlier this month, Judge Roderick Henderson, cited the paedophile's threats against his victim's family. 'She was extremely young and can be described as suffering severe psychological harm from what you had done.' Handley denied his crimes, his lawyer saying that of his 90 previous convictions none had been of a sexual nature. Handley was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court (above) where a judge told of the 'severe psychological damage' the attacks inflicted on his victim .","Raymond Handley was jailed for more than 13 years for assaulting child .

"A young man whose former 26-stone bulk drove him to a suicide attempt has lost more than half his bodyweight and become a ripped gym instructor. Nathan Priestley, 21, from Norwich, Norfolk, was once dubbed ‘Jabba the Hutt’ by bullies and became so depressed over his size that he refused to leave his house for a year. He was just 18 when he took an overdose of 30 pills, but survived, ironically, because he hadn’t taken enough to defeat his massive frame. Scroll down for video . From bulk to hulk: Nathan Priestley, 21, from Norwich, Norfolk, pictured before (left) and after (right) his staggering weight loss, was once dubbed ‘Jabba the Hutt’ by bullies . Following his suicide attempt in September 2011, something snapped in Nathan and he made the decision to stop wallowing in self-pity and turn his life around. Within two years, he had shrunk to 14 stone. During the first year, he would only exercise in the dark from fear others would mock his efforts as he struggled to start shedding the pounds. Nathan ran the streets in the dead of night when no-one was around and turned off the lights so he could use a treadmill at his local gym unseen. After a year, Nathan started using weights to tone his slimmed-down figure, and was so successful he landed himself a job as a personal trainer. Nathan, now a trim 13 stone, said: 'I was always overweight as a kid and as I grew up the bullying contributed to that because I tended to comfort eat. 'Others would throw sweets at me when I was on the bus and call me ""fatty"", ""fat mess"" and ""Jabba the Hutt"".

During the first year, he would only exercise in the dark from fear others would mock his efforts as he struggled to start shedding the pounds . 'It was at that period in high school where I started to become really self-conscious about my weight. 'I didn’t leave the house for a year and the only time I would leave my room would be to go downstairs to get food.' Nathan added: 'My parents were really worried about me and tried to tell me to go and see somebody for help. 'After the failed suicide I realised that I needed to turn my life around and I started to diet. 'It was scary going outside and I was too afraid to leave the house because I thought people would be judging me. Before his lifestyle overhaul, Nathan was a sugar addict who gorged on bacon and egg butties, chocolate bars and greasy takeaways. He then went cold turkey and cut out junk food, chocolate, crisps and alcohol, and said he was left suffering from flu-like symptoms as a result. Nathan snacked on cashew nuts and went on a strict low-carb diet which helped him lose a stone a month for eight months. In progress: Nathan said, 'I never went to the gym at the beginning because I had no confidence, so for the first month it was purely diet' He added, 'When I did eventually start going to the gym, I used to run in a darkened room which was there for people with low self-esteem' 'I never went to the gym at the beginning because I had no confidence so for the first month it was purely diet.

"Kentucky judge Olu Stevens is facing calls to be sacked after he criticized a couple's victim impact statements . A Kentucky judge is facing calls to be sacked after he criticized a couple's victim impact statements and accused them of fostering racist stereotypes in their 3-year-old daughter. Judge Olu Stevens was sentencing Gregory Wallace to five years' probation after he and his accomplice, Marquis McAfee, robbed Tommy and Jordan Gray's Louisville home in April 2013. Police report that the thieves pointed a gun in the face of the couple's three-year-old before making off with $1,100 in cash, a cell phone, wallet and small amount of marijuana belong to the couple. In victim impact statement's prepared for the sentencing of Wallace, the couple called for him to be sent to prison and Jordan wrote that her daughter was still 'in constant fear of black men.' 'Whenever we are running errands, if we come across a black male, she holds me tight and begs me to leave,' the mother said. Tommy Gray also wrote that since the crime, his daughter had been terrified of black males and that probation was not sufficient punishment for Wallace, 27, who had pleaded guilty to robbery. 'If holding a little girl at gunpoint gets you probation, then our system is flawed,' Gray said. But when the case appeared before Stevens on February 4 in Jefferson Circuit Court, it was the parents, not Wallace, who suffered Judge Stevens' wrath, reports the Courier Journal. At the sentencing for Gregory Wallace, Stevens accused the Grays of fostering racist stereotypes in their 3-year-old daughter's mind . 'I am offended. … I am deeply offended that they would be victimized by an individual and express some kind of fear of all black men,' he said. 'This little girl certainly has been victimized, and she can't help the way she feels,' he said. 'My exception is more with her parents and their accepting that kind of mentality and fostering those type of stereotypes.' Despite the family's protests, Stevens granted probation to Wallace, who had no prior convictions for violent crimes and had received strong support from his family and friends. Judge Stevens said Wallace deserved the opportunity to redeem himself and said his thoughts about the Gray's victim impact statements had no bearing on his judgement. He later expanded his opinion writing on Facebook: 'Do three year olds form such generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions of others? Judge Stevens granted Wallace, left, probation because he had no prior convictions for violent crimes and said his thoughts about the Gray's victim impact statements had no bearing on his judgement . 'Had the perpetrator been white, I doubt it would have resulted in such gross generalizations,' wrote Stevens afterwards on Facebook . Marquis McAfee was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the crime . 'I think not. Perhaps the mother had attributed her own views to her child as a manner of sanitizing them.' Stevens also posted a photo showing young black and white children playing together. Friends and family of the Grays say they are outraged by his comments and are calling for him to be removed. 'Judge Stevens blamed and shamed the victims,' said the girl's paternal grandmother, Dawn Renee Bryant. 'It is very disturbing to be called something you are not.' Attorney Tom Wine said the statements made by the victims in this case 'were not intended to be and were not' racist. Facebook pages has been launched both supporting and calling for Judge Stevens to be sacked. He remains adamant that he has done nothing wrong either in court or on social media. 'I was cautioning the parents against allowing racial stereotypes to impact their behavior and that of their child,' he said. The other robber, McAfee, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was on probation for a prior crime at the time of the crime. Court brought it front and center this week. The case involved a burglary and the victims were a young couple and their three year-old child. The written victim impact statement on behalf of the child read that as a result of the offense committed against her parents in her presence, the child is in 'constant fear of black men.' The statement, written by her mother, continues that the child clings to her parent when in the presence of any black man. The incident, the mother concluded, 'has even affected our relationship with our African-American friends.' I read this statement aloud in open court. For a reason. It was of little surprise to me that neither parent nor the child was present in court for the sentencing. After all, the defendant and the judge are amongst the individuals the three year old has fear of as a result of the crime. Do three year olds form such generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions of others? I think not. Perhaps the mother had attributed her own views to her child as a manner of sanitizing them. Let me be clear. The statement played absolutely no role in the sentencing decision and the commonwealth disavowed the statement. Needless to say, I was deeply offended, however, that this statement was put forth for the purpose of persuading me to impose a lengthy prison sentence. Had the perpetrator been white, I doubt it would have resulted in such gross generalizations. The race of a perpetrator of a crime is not a reason or an excuse to fear an entire race of people. We must stand against it in whatever form. As a judge I do my work without regard to race. It is incumbent on me to confront and dispose of language based on racism and stereotypes. We should all do our part to eradicate such nonsense. And let me be clear, silence does nothing to contribute. It simply sends a message that such views are acceptable and fear somehow excuses wrong. Jordan Gray, mother . Q: Has the crime had a psychological impact on you? My husband works nights and there are many nights I still can't sleep. Even with a security system I don't feel safe in my own home. I'm nervous about when random people walk down the street and constantly have our doors locked. Q: Has this crime effected the lifestyle of you or your family? Due to the impact it has had on my 5-year-old daughter we have to consider the area in which we go. While my daughter and I used to play outside, we are hesitant to do so now by ourselves. Q: If you have any additional information, please feel free to attach it to this form. (i.e, recommended sentence). This incident has had the most impact on my daughter. She is in constant fear of black men. When we are running errands, if we come across a black male, she holds me tight and begs me to leave. If (she) is playing in a room and I walk into another, she freaks out. It has affected her friendships at school and our relationship with African American friends. Tommy Gray, father . Q: Has the crime had a psychological impact on you? For months after this crime I couldn't sleep. I would relive this incident every night before bed. I would constantly see their faces every time I closed my eyes. Q: Has this crime effected the lifestyle of you or your family? Since the crime occurred my daughter is terrified of black males. Where ever we go, we are constantly reminded of her fears. She brings up the crime and can't be left alone in our own home because she is afraid someone will bust in the door.' Q: Has this crime resulted in any damages or loss of property? My wife's cell phone and vacation fund of about $1000. Q: If you have any additional information, please feel free to attach it to this form. (i.e, recommended sentence). I don't have a recommended sentence but I feel like probation is not enough. This crime will effect my daughter for the rest of her life and Mr. Wallace deserves to serve time.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton took aim at Republicans on Monday for latching on to a new book that details sweetheart deals she allegedly made between foreign governments and the U.S. State Department in exchange for speaking fees and donations to her family foundation. 'It is, I think, worth noting that the Republicans seem to be talking only about me,' she told reporters in the liberal New Hampshire bastion of Keene. 'Hopefully we'll get on to the issues.'

She is making her first campaign visit this year to New Hampshire, a state beloved by the Clinton family for giving both her faltering 2008 effort and her husband's struggling 1992 campaign a second wind.

Rand Paul, a 2016 GOP candidate, said that would make people 'question whether she ought to run for president.' Republicans have spent months talking about financial dealings of the Clinton Foundation to raise questions about Hillary Clinton's character. She stepped down from the organization's board within hours of announcing her campaign. The foundation has come under scrutiny for accepting foreign contributions, including from Middle Eastern nations that deny equal rights for women. Some also are on the front lines in the fight against terrorism. Last week, the foundation revised its policy to permit donations from six U.S. allies in Europe, Australia, and North America but to bar giving from other nations. The charity supports public health, climate change and anti-poverty programs. Clinton campaign aides and supporters moved quickly to discredit Schweizer after word of his book emerged, casting him as a Republican operative working to defeat her. SCOOBY SIGHTING: Clinton's campaign van made an appearance in Concord, NH on Tuesday morning . A FEW TAKERS: Clinton shook hands with staffers at Kristin's Bistro and Bakery on Monday in Keene, NH – but some kitchen workers didn't want to come out to meet her . Schweizer is president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative organization, and has advised Republican politicians on foreign policy. 'He's cherry picked information that's been disclosed and woven a bunch of conspiracy theories about it,' Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said on PBS. Though nearly two dozen Republicans are competing for their party's nomination, the GOP candidates have largely focused their criticism on Clinton. In New Hampshire on the weekend, they mocked her campaign stops, charged her with being overly secretive and even brought up her husband's affair with a White House intern.","'Republicans seem to be talking only about me,' Hillary told reporters in New Hampshire .

"The skeleton of a new species of giant predatory bird that terrorised the Earth 3.5 million years ago has been discovered and is helping to reveal how these creatures would have sounded. Palaeontologists say the four feet (1.2 metres) tall bird is  the most complete skeletons of a 'terror bird' - a group of flightless prehistoric meat-eating birds - to be discovered. The South American bird has been named Llallawavis scagliai - meaning Scaglia's Magnificent Bird after one of Argentina's famous naturalists Galileo Juan Scaglia. Scroll down for video . Llallawavis scagliai (shown in the reconstruction above) would have had powerful jaws but limited hearing . It was so well preserved that scientists have been able to study part of the bird's auditory system and its trachae. They say that while it had a terrifying apperance, its hearing was probably below average compared to birds living today. A giant prehistoric ‘terror bird’ - once thought to have been a ruthless predator which snapped the necks of mammals with its enormous beak - was actually a vegetarian, according to one study. The two-metre gastornis was a flightless creature which lived in Europe between 40 and 55 million years ago. Because of its size and ominous appearance, it was thought to be a top carnivore. But a team of German researchers, who studied fossilised remains of the beasts found in a former open cast coal mine, say they believe it was actually not a meat eater. Palaeontologists in the US have also found footprints believed to belong to the American cousin of gastornis, and these do not show the imprints of sharp claws, used to grapple prey, that might be expected of a raptor. Also, the bird’s sheer size and inability to move fast made some believe it couldn’t have preyed on early mammals - though others claim it might have ambushed them. They claim that the animal probably also had a limited vocal range that was quite low frequency. It has also raised the prospect that the bird may have even used low frequency sounds to help detect its prey. Dr Federico Degrange, a palaeontologist at the Centre for Research in Earth Sciences and the University of Córdoba in Argentina, said: 'The mean hearing estimated for this terror bird was below the average for living birds. 'This seems to indicate that Llallawavis may have had a narrow, low vocalization frequency range, presumably used for intraspecific acoustic communication or prey detection.' Terror birds, or phorusracids as they are also known, were a group of carnivorous birds that grew up to 10 feet tall and had large hooked beaks. They were the dominant predators in South America during the Cenozoic age which started with the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Although smaller than some of the species discovered, Llallawavis scagliai, was one of the last terror birds to prowl the Earth before they died out around 2.5 million years ago. It was discovered by Fernando Scaglia, from the Lorenzo Scaglia Municipal Museum of Natural Sciences, along with Matias Taglioretti and Alejandro Dondas at La Estafeta Beach south of Mar del Plata city in the Buenos Aires province of Argentina in 2010. Scientists used 3D scanning of the long skull of Llallawavis scagliai (above) to examine its hearing ability . Dr Scaglia is the grandson of Galileo Juan Scaglia who was director of the museum between 1940 and 1980. Due to incoming tides which were damaging the cliff, the team had to work quickly to excavate the entire fossil in one day. The fossilised skeleton (above) was found in a cliff on a beach south of Mar del Plata city in Argentina . However, despite this they were able to retrieve a skeleton that is around 90 per cent complete. In a study published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the researchers were able to reconstruct the structure of the bird's inner ear using 3D computed tomography. They found that Llallawavis would have had an average hearing range of around 3,800Hz and a sensitivity of around 2,300Hz. The human ear, by contrast, can detect sounds with frequencies between 20Hz and 20,000Hz, but is best at around 4,000-5,000Hz. This suggests that Llallawavis would have been better at detecting lower frequency sounds than humans are. Dr Degrange told Mail Online the bird had a tracheobronchial syrinx - the structure that produces sound in birds - that was mainly made of cartilage and so it did not survived. He said: 'It is not possible then through this to know exactly what kind of sounds terror birds were capable of produce. 'However, based on the hearing frequencies that we know that they were able to hear, it is possible to state that Llallawavis may have produced sound of low frequency.' The researchers have also been able to better understand the some of the birds other features based on the palate and bones around the eye that were also preserved. Dr Degrange said the bird would have had powerful muscles around its jaws but they were still conducting studies on the eyes to discover whether the bird was active during the day, at night or in the twilight hours. La Estafeta Beach (above) near Mar del Plata in Argentina where the fossil was found has strong tides that threatened to wash the skeleton away forcing palaeontologists to work fast to excavate it to save it from harm . He said: 'The palate is a big area of jaw muscle attacment in birds. So, we are able to state how much developed were some of the jaw muscles in Llallawavis. 'The sclerotic ring will give us an idea of the eye shape and size. This will allow us to infer if terror birds were diurnal, nocturnal or crepuscular.' He added that the fossil may also help scientists unpick what caused the giant birds to eventually die out. He said: 'The discovery of this species reveals that terror birds were more diverse in the Pliocene than previously thought. 'It will allow us to review the hypothesis about the decline and extinction of this fascinating group of birds.' Dr Claudia Tambussi, another author of the study at Argentina's Centre for Research in Earth Sciences, added: 'The discovery of this new species provides new insights for studying the anatomy and phylogeny of phorusrhacids and a better understanding of this group's diversification.'","The four feet tall species of terror bird has been named Llallawavis scagliai .

"If you want to stay healthy, try saying 'thank you' more often. Feeling grateful can improve the health of our hearts, according to a new study. Researchers found that heart patients who expressed gratitude for the positive things in their life had improved mental, and ultimately physical, health. The study involved men and women who had been diagnosed with Stage B heart failure. Heart patients who expressed gratitude for the positive things in their life had better mental and physical health, a study found . Stage B is where patients have developed structural heart disease - they may, for example, have had a heart attack that damaged the heart - but do not show symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath or fatigue. It is important to make beneficial lifestyle changes at this stage because patients are at a high risk of progressing to Stage C heart failure - where risk of death is five times higher - the researchers said. The 186 patients were assessed for their levels of gratitude using standard psychological tests. These scores were then compared with the patients’ scores for depressive symptoms, sleep quality, fatigue, self-efficacy (belief in our ability to deal with a situation) and inflammatory markers. Inflammation can often worsen heart failure. ‘We found that more gratitude in these patients was associated with better mood, better sleep, less fatigue and lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers related to cardiac health,’ said Professor Paul Mills, from the University of California. Patients who were more grateful had lower markers of inflammation, which can worsen heart failure . To further test their findings, the researchers asked some of the patients to write down three things for which they were thankful most days of the week for eight weeks. Both groups continued to receive their normal clinical care during that time. ‘We found that those patients who kept gratitude journals for those eight weeks showed reductions in circulating levels of several important inflammatory biomarkers, as well as an increase in heart rate variability while they wrote,’ said Professor Mills. ‘Improved heart rate variability is considered a measure of reduced cardiac risk. ‘It seems that a more grateful heart is indeed a more healthy heart, and that gratitude journaling is an easy way to support cardiac health.’ The research was published in the journal Spirituality in Clinical Practice.","Heart patients who were more grateful had improved physical health .

"In this constantly connected digital world, the chirping of a mobile phone beside the bed is rarely a pleasant way to be woken in the morning. But the team behind a new app clearly feel that the tiny rendition of a rumba blaring from your mobile is not enough to drag you from beneath the covers. Instead they have developed an alarm that will only turn off if you physically get out of bed and scan a bar code in another part of your house. Scroll down for video . The I'm UP Alarm can be set to go off the night before (left) and will then only turn off by scanning a QR code (pictured right) on a mug or magnet that can be kept in another room, forcing you to get out of bed to do so . Michael Smagon, the New York-based inventor of the I'm Up Alarm, said: 'We all hit the snooze, toss and turn, and fall back asleep. Then we do the morning dash because we lose those coveted morning minutes. 'I’m Up is a mobile app alarm clock that is linked to a QR code that may be anywhere in your home, not in arms reach form bed, and the alarm does not go off until your scan the code, hence getting out of bed.' Smartphone users will be able to download the app onto their phone from June. Each device is paired with a specific QR code that can be printed out and stuck somewhere else in the house. The app developers also say they will be able to print the code onto mugs or magnetic buttons so they can be left in the kitchen to scan while you make your morning coffee. The alarm is set to go off at a certain time the night before and will make a noise until the QR code is scanned. The app uses a Quick Response code, or QR code, which is a form of barcode that the cameras of mobile phones are able to detect. Under Mr Smagon's concept, a code matched specifically to your app can be printed on your favourite mug or a fridge magnet. When the alarm goes off at the designated time, the only way to then get it to stop making a noise is to get out of bed and scan the code. For those who really need an extra couple of minutes, Mr Smagon says the app does have a snooze function, but only for a set number of occasions. He is currently seeking funding on the crowd-funding site Kickstarter to help him test the device. The app is due to be released in June June and and will come as a free version with adverts or an ad-free version which will cost less than $8, or £5.48. The alarm app will have a snooze function but it will only allow users to delay getting up a set number of times . Mugs and magnetic business cards and buttons with the codes printed on them can also be purchased and shipped worldwide or a free code can be printed from the company's website. I'm Up will be available on Apple and Android phones and a version for Windows phones is being developed. Mr Smagon said: 'In the evening you set your alarm for 6am and you have the best intention to wake up at this time, but in the morning everything looks different. 'Every excuse you come up with just to stay those five extra minutes in bed wins. We all know that those five minute snoozes quickly add up and all of a sudden we are late again. 'I'm Up alarm was invented to help people who are not one of those early birds to start the day.' The QR code can be printed onto coffee cups so users can turn off the alarm while making their morning drink .","I'm Up Alarm is designed to help those who have trouble getting out of bed .

'It’s early days but we’re excited to get going and we know we’ll learn a lot along the way.' Autism is a neurological disorder that affects how a person communicates, and relates to, other people. It can also affect how they make sense of the world around them. People with autism typically have trouble communicating, looking people in the eye, and can get upset by loud noises or bright lights. They may also have a sensitivity to touch, tastes, smells and colours. In particular, many autistic people like order and predictability. Autism is a spectrum condition, which means that while all people with autism share certain difficulties, their condition affects them in different ways. Some people with autism, for example, are able to live relatively independent lives but others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need specialist support. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism and people with the syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence. They have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language. Specialisterne is based in Denmark and the UK and specialises in recruiting people with autism across varies industries.

Technology industries are said to be suited to people with autism because of how they respond to gadgets and software. At a young age, for example, experts are finding that simple, carefully constructed apps are enabling affected children to feel safe and communicate more readily because the software is more predictable and ordered than human interaction. Rhiannan Walton, 32, from West London has been a speech and language therapist for eight years. She began using technology in her therapy sessions with autistic children approximately 18 months ago. ‘Technology responds in the same way every time; you press a button and it responds how you expect it to,' Walton told MailOnline. 'This particularly appeals to autistic children who can become scared and confused by unpredictability.'

"'Double wife killer' Harold Henthorn wants to use a $1.5million life insurance pay out from a policy taken out on his second wife to pay for the defense in his trial for her murder. Henthorn was charged with the murder of second wife, Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have since reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife some 20 years earlier. Both women died in 'freak accidents' to which Henthorn, 59, was the sole witness. Dr Toni Jill Bertolet plunged 140 ft to her death shortly before their 12th wedding anniversary while hiking with Henthorn in a remote stretch of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. First wife, Lynn Rishell, was crushed to death under Henthorn's jeep when, according to Henthorn, the jack gave way as she reached beneath the vehicle for a lug nut while changing a flat tire at night on an isolated highway near the couple's Colorado home. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Henthorn was charged with the murder of Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife, Lynn Rishell, some 20 years earlier . Lynn Rishell - Henthorn's first wife - was crushed to death under the front of Henthorn's Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark . In both cases Henthorn was the sole beneficiary of the women's substantial life insurance policies totalling $500,000 in the case of his first wife and $4.5million in the case of his second. Now, newly filed documents have revealed that he is fighting for a $1.5million pay out from the policy taken out in July 2001 on the grounds that he needs the money to pay for his attorney for the forthcoming murder trial scheduled to begin next month. The documents, filed yesterday and seen by Daily Mail Online, are part of a bitter civil case being fought in Douglas County .They note that, just weeks before he is due to stand trial, Henthorn is 'focused solely on his own desire to have the insurance proceeds disbursed to himself without any meaningful process.' They go onto state: 'Should Henthorn truly be able to substantiate an inability to afford counsel in the criminal matter, those matters are properly addressed in the criminal case pending in this District.' They point out: 'The Colorado Supreme Court has said: ""Killers cannot receive life insurance proceeds from their victims"" and insurers cannot disburse proceeds ""prematurely"", ….when law enforcement is still investigating or a prosecution is pending.' The next named beneficiary is his nine-year-old daughter with Dr Bertolet, Hayley. Dr Bertolet died on 29 September, 2012. The autopsy report, dated 18 December 2012, stated that she 'died as the result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff while hiking.' It concluded, 'homicide cannot be excluded.' But when her husband submitted a claim for the life insurance death benefit policy almost exactly a year later, on September 27, 2013 he gave her cause of death as 'Accidental Fall.' At the time Henthorn was unaware that he was already the subject of an FBI investigation that lasted two years and scrutinized every aspect of the widower's life, culminating in his arrest last November. But despite facing murder charges Henthorn has not relinquished the claim his claim to the substantial insurance pay out on his wife's death. Shockingly, not only is he fighting for the pay out to fund his own defense, documents filed in a separate motion in March show that he fought his late wife's family to have funds from Dr Bertolet's estate released into his possession. Last February the District Court of Douglas County, Colorado found in Dr Bertolet's family's favor and barred Henthorn from accessing his late wife's estate on the grounds that allowing him to do so posed an 'imminent risk of substantial harm..to [its] financial interests.' Both ‘freak accidents’ occurred at remote locations with Henthorn the lone witness. Both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and Henthorn, pictured here with his first wife, Rishell, told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Henthorn and Lynn Rishell when he was a new geology graduate from Virginia. The couple moved to Colorado, where after 12 years of marriage, she died in a 'freak accident', now said to be murder . Henthorn (left), pictured with Grace (center) and Lynn (right) Rishell, was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totaling $500,000 on the death of his first wife and $4.5million on the death of his second after they both died in what appeared to be freak accident . Henthorn attempted to overturn this decision as recently as December and only finally failed when a court denied him access to the funds and demanded that he appoint a forensic accountant to detail the contents of his late wife's estate. In March Daily Mail Online revealed that, in 2009 Henthorn took out a life insurance policy on his former sister-in-law, Grace Rishell. Grace was going through a divorce and 'concerned for her financial stability,' when she initially agreed to Henthorn's suggestion that she take out a policy that would pay $50,000 to Grace's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $250,000. According to prosecutors in Dr Bertolet's murder case, 'the evidence will show that Henthorn had a romantic interest in Rishell.' But she had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through. Instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer. Yet unbeknownst to her, 'her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well,' with Henthorn making payments on the policy until December 2012 and listing himself as the sole beneficiary. The policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that Henthorn had no insurable interest in RIshell. But the very fact of its existence raises the specter that Henthorn had Rishell in his sights as a third potential victim. Henthorn was denied bail by US District Attorney Judge Kathleen Latoyfa who described him as a 'danger' and said, 'there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second.' She pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by Henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was 'hiding funds.' Henthorn's trial is scheduled to begin in September. He has entered a plea of not guilty.","Harold Henthorn is charged with murdering his second wife and being investigated over the similar death of his first wife .

"The Duchess of Cambridge is a modern-day suffragette who has done more to advance the cause of women than anyone else in recent years. Or so says actress Patsy Kensit, who made the comments in an interview with this week's Stylist magazine. Miss Kensit, 47, appeared in the magazine's regular 'Queen of Everything' feature and said the Duchess of Cambridge would be her 'regal inspiration'. Feminist icon: Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' Charity work: The Duchess is famous for philanthropy but not, until now, feminism . She added: 'She's so fabulous on every level. She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana. Suffragette: Emily Wilding Davison is pictured throwing herself in front of the King's horse in 1913 . Votes for women: Campaigners lobbying for votes for women became known as suffragettes . Critics: The Duchess was dubbed a 'machine made princess' by Hilary Mantel and 'drab' by Margaret Atwood . ‘I think she’s watching her back,' continued the 75-year-old author. 'I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. 'I don’t think she’s become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she’s probably doing that advisably, wouldn’t you say?’ Miss Atwood isn't the only writer to criticise the Duchess, who is due to give birth to her second child later this month, in public. Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as being like a ‘shop window mannequin’ and a ‘machine-made’ princess who has been ‘designed by committee’. Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig caused outrage when she said the Duchess doesn’t have a ‘single opinion’ of her own, while Joan Smith produced a similar storm by labelling Kate ‘unambitious and bland’.","Miss Kensit said the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette'

"Walmart is coming under fire following a recent incident in Tuscon, Arizona where a thief was able to shoot of rounds from a weapon after stealing it from their store. Mario Valencia took a rifle from the super store on February 19 and was able to start firing it as soon as he left, something that should have been impossible due to the gun locks that are required on all weapons. This after he demanded bullets from a woman inside the store guarding the ammunition case, who did as instructed and then immediately notified authorities. Scroll down for video . Mario Valencia (above) took a rifle from a Walmart in Tuscon, Arizona on February 19 and was able to start firing it as soon as he left . The stolen weapon should have still been locked and police chasing the men were told he could not fire the loaded gun . Police were even told the gun was locked by employees at the store as they pursued Valencia, but just seconds later he began firing into the air according to CNN. He even pointed the weapon at an officer at one point. When the gun was later recovered, after Valencia was taken down by Officer Michael Rapiejko, it was discovered the wire was loose, and only wrapped through the gun's barrel and lock just once, not twice as is standard, allowing the weapon to be used as soon as it was taken. Walmart meanwhile claims the rifle had been properly locked, and that it may have been affected by the hard blow caused by the police car . He was later taken out by an officer who hit him with his vehicle . The gun was found to be locked with loose wire that was not wrapped enough when police recovered it from the scene . Video of the incident, which emerged last week, shows Rapiejko, 34, running into  Valencia to take the man down after he began firing the weapom. A police officer in one of the patrol cars says: 'One round just went out. He's definitely loaded.' He then tells his colleague, Rapiejko, in the other vehicle: 'Stand off, the gun is loaded.' Valencia is facing several felony charges for his alleged crime spree . But apparently ignoring his advice, Rapiejko overtakes the officer's car, before speeding straight toward Valencia. Seconds later, his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect's body. Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris. The other officer can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down.' Valencia was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in serious condition following the crash and was eventually booked into jail two days later. Sergeant Chris Warren said at the time that Valencia 'was a dangerous felon who'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning'. This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at, vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple, a home invasion and theft of a car. It culminated with the alleged theft of a rifle from Walmart, after which he was hit by Rapiejko's police vehicle. Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash, but soon reinstated after the Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing. Valencia is facing several felony charges for his alleged crime spree.","Mario Valencia took a rifle from a Walmart in Tuscon, Arizona on February 19 and was able to start firing it as soon as he left .

The Brisbane-based company came under fire last year after over 120,000 Australians petitioned to have slogans eliminated from the fleet, prompting the company's CEO John Webb to promise in July last year to remove the slogans within six months. Over 120,000 people signed the petition to remove the offensive slogans in 2014 . Members of the Wicked Pickets protest group have started painting over slogans which they say are offensive . Wicked Pickets, a community action group, decided to take justice into their own hands after the company failed to live up to its promise, painting over slogans they have slammed as misogynistic and violent. 'We just want to make the point that sexist slogans like the ones on Wicked Campers might seem funny but actually contribute to sexual and physical violence against women,' Wicked Picket's spokesperson, Liz Upham, told Daily Mail Australia. Slogans found on the vans include, 'A wife: An attachment you screw on the bed to get the housework done',  'I wouldn't trust anything that bleeds for five days and doesn't die', and 'Your thighs won't touch if my head's between them'. The vans also feature cartoon paintings of novelty penises, breasts with the slogan 'Random Breast Testing', and sexualised images of men and women. Wicked Camper's CEO John Webb apologised for the offense the vans had caused many members of the community, and invited 'anybody who feels strongly offended by a slogan to either paint or tape over it'. Up to 150 women attended the rally in Brisbane on Saturday afternoon to protest the company's slogans . The women have started arming themselves with spray paint and removing the slogans . The members of Wicked Pickets have taken this literally, arming themselves with spray cans and painting over Wicked Camper slogans as they find them. 'I guess it’s illegal but we continually quote the fact that Webb invited us to paint the vans, which is our reasoning, along with trying to make a statement that these are not acceptable slogans,' said Ms Upham. '30 women have died at the hands of male partners this year so far. It might seem like long bow to draw but when there are vans driving around saying that a wife is attachment to screw in the bedroom and suggesting it’s all right to kidnap a women, it is really making a subtle suggestion that women are only good for sex and getting housework done,' she said. 'The fact that Wicked Campers are still driving around with slogans that encourage rape and violence doesn't seem possible. I'm appalled that there is no law to control this.' Ms Upham, who attended the rally on Saturday with her daughter, said that the slogans were extremely harmful for young people and female backpackers who were driving the vans. She said that the slogans were so offensive that emails she and the other organisers had been exchanging which contained the phrases had been continually blocked. 'It's is outrageous that these slogans are so offensive that they cannot be sent and cannot be expressed without starring in word form in the media, and yet they are out in public for anyone to see,' she said. Some of the slogans include 'I can already imagine the gaffa tape on your mouth', and 'Flash your t**s at the driver'. This Wicked Campers van said 'Random Breast Testing' on the side . A vigilante spray painted over the offensive slogan after CEO John Webb invited those angered to take action . Wicked Camper's CEO John Webb invited 'anybody who feels strongly offended by a slogan to either paint or tape over it'- . She said that she had been forced to explain to her daughter some of the concepts of the slogans, which were very adult and inappropriate for her daughter's age. 'Female backpackers are really at risk as they pre-book the vans and then drive around with these slogans for men to read about them. I think it’s putting all women at risk both locally and those from overseas,' she said. She said that she was afraid members of the community would see the activism as 'women being wowsers', but that if people looked closely at the slogans they were shocked. 'I want to make the point that we are completely supportive of fun slogans on vans that aren’t sexist, demeaning, offensive or violent,' Ms Upham said. 'When people  read the slogans on the vans they are horrified.' Mr Webb said in his statement that the brand was a 'strong proponent of free speech and pushing the limits of humour – we are a ‘cash for chaos’ kind of company.' 'We are a small company, with eclectic, creative and multi-cultural staff. It is impossible for us to conceive that a throw-away message written on a van could have such far-reaching implications for the community at large,' he said. The Australian Advertising Standards Board have upheld complaints but have not been able to demand the ads be removed . Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie said that a parliamentary inquiry had been set up 'to look into current regulation of outdoor advertising in Queensland' 'Bear in mind however, many of the images presented in the media of our vehicles are from up to 8 years ago, and the vehicles simply do not exist anymore.' Ms Upham said that despite the claims that many of the offending vans were not circulating, members of Wicked Pickets had painted over vans, only to see them restored and on the roads at a later stage. 'One of our supporters painted over an offensive slogan and it was put back again,' she said. Ms Upham said that the group's next move would be to seek a meeting with Queensland Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath to begin the process of introducing a law to ban the slogans. While Mr Webb voluntarily announced his decision to remove the slogans, there is no law to enforce the removal, as the Australian Advertising Standards Board have upheld complaints but have not been able to demand the ads be removed. Last year Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie said that a parliamentary inquiry had been set up 'to look into current regulation of outdoor advertising in Queensland'. It would look 'whether reform is needed to protect children from being exposed to sexually explicit and inappropriate outdoor advertising', Mr Bleijie told The Sunshine Coast Daily.","Women in Brisbane are protesting offensive slogans on Wicked Campers .

"A 14-year-old boy who hanged himself five months after his mother lost her battle with cancer would wear her favourite bandana and spray her perfume round the house after she died. William Smith wanted to remind himself of his mother, Alison Overton, following her death from leukaemia. The teenager from Grimsby died in August last year, just four months after seeing his mother succumb to the disease. WilliamSmith died four months after his mother Alison Overton (pictued together above with his younger brothers) lost her battle with cancer . The teenager from Grimsby wore his mother's favourite bandana around the house and sprayed her perfume to remind himself of her after she died . William's father, Dean Smith (pictured with his late mother) said the family had begun recovering from the loss and were planning their future . An inquest into his death heard how William had been settling in well after returning to school following his mother's death. Months later, while his grandmother was looking after him, he stayed home while she took his younger brothers out, asking her to bring him back chicken nuggets as a lunchtime treat. When Susan Overton returned she was horrified to find her grandson had died. Coroner Paul Kelly said the teenager had likely not intended to take his life. 'She could not believe what was seeing. She thought he was messing about because that was the kind of thing he did,' he said at an inquest. 'It took her a while to take in what she was looking at.' It was more likely the case the teenager was trying to play a prank on his siblings and had not anticipated the consequences, he added. On the day of his death, William told his grandmother to bring him home some chicken nuggets as a lunchtime treat . The 14-year-old had 'settled back in well' at school following his mother's death, an inquest heard . The teenager pictured with one of his younger brothers. His grandmother, Susan Overton, told of how William 'made his mother proud' 'I push to one side that he intended to take his life. What is more likely is that, awaiting his grandmother and brothers, he decided to play a prank or experiment, not thinking what the consequences would be. 'That venture turned into a misadventure.' William's father, Dean Smith, told how his son had been 'very brave' following the death of his mother. 'We sat down and spoke often. We were getting on with things. 'We were making plans, looking forward to the new football season and to Christmas,' he said. On another occasion his grandmother told him how he 'made his mother proud'. Recording a conclusion of misadventure, Mr Kelly said: 'I wish I could find some words to console the family. 'There is nothing I can say apart from condolences.' While William had missed his mother, his father said he had been 'very brave' in coping with her death . The teenager was buried just four months after his mother.

"Grappling on the sand and roared on by a vociferous sell-out crowd, these two powerhouses of Senegalese wrestling trade mighty blows with one another. The two famous wrestlers, Balla Gaye 2 and Eumeu Sene, competed in the crunch match dubbed 'Le Choc' at Demba Diop Stadium in the capital of Dakar. After a brutal and closely fought encounter under the hot sun, the burly Sene emerged victorious. Scroll down for video . Heavyweights: Balla Gaye (left) grapples with the bulky frame of Eumeu Sene at Dakar's Demba Diop stadium during 'Le Choc' In the zone: Heavyweight Balla Gaye 2 arrives to a ritual before the bout - but he lost to Eumeu Sene in 'Le Choc' yesterday . Fever: Supporters of Balla Gaye 2 dance and perform to the packed out stadium before his bruising encounter with Eumeu Sene . Thud: A wrestler grimaces as he digs his face into the muscular shoulder of his opponent in the tussle as part of yesterday's event . Prior to the showdown event, other athletes - dressed in colourful loin cloths - took to the arena for a series of bruising combats. This form of wrestling - which involves strikes - is only practised in Senegal and has boomed in popularity as their football team has struggled since their remarkable run at the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan. Wrestling with strikes allows punches to the face or head and can end with a knockout blow. A fight typically lasts between ten seconds and four minutes. The winner is whoever puts his opponent on the ground, whether on his back, rear, stomach, or a combination of hands and knees. Crash: A wrestler dumps his opponent with a full-blooded tackle on to the sand - spelling the end of the fight . Power: A wrestler prepares to land a strong right hand to the head of his struggling opponent in the Demba Diop Stadium, Dakar . Full blooded: Wrestlers block off their opponents' punches in a closely fought bout in yesterday's gripping spectacle in Dakar . Ready: A wrestler pours a bottle of 'potion' over himself - these include ingredients such as hair from lions and hyenas, gazelle milk and the roots of sacred and secret trees and are deemed to provide good fortune . Victorious: Dressed in a green loin cloth, a wrestler defeats his opponent by pushing him to the sand . Wrestling's popularity in the north-western African country make it a lucrative business. For the sport's superstars, such as Balla Gaye 2 and Eumeu Sene, the rewards can be huge with the potential to earn up to $200,000 per contest. In a country where unemployment is pushing 50 per cent and the average annual income is $980, some see it as a way to escape poverty. Star wrestlers become lords of entire districts, privileged with providing for their friends and rewarded with unflinching loyalty. Their hordes of fans become the equivalent of neighborhood gangs and brawls between rivals are common in and out of the stadium. Similarly to the 'weigh-in' in boxing, tensions are inflamed at the pre-match promotion where both the competitors and their fans square up to one another in front of television cameras. A recent 'face à face' between Yékini and Balla Gaye 2 descended into a brawl and riot police had to break up the scuffle.

"One million men are now actively choosing to work part-time as they become more involved in childcare or retire gradually. Official figures show there has been a stark 14 per cent rise in the number of men opting to work part-time in the last two years. This compares to a 4 per cent rise in women choosing part-time work over the same period, according to the Office for National Statistics. One million men have chosen to work part-time as they become more involved in childcare or are retiring gradually . There are now 1.02million men in the UK who have opted to work reduced hours, compared to 4.58million women – who more commonly work part-time to care for children or family. It follows a sharp rise in the number of stay-at-home fathers, with the latest figures showing a 6 per cent annual rise, compared to a 28 per cent fall in the number of stay-at-home mothers. Men now make up one in 10 parents who care for their children or family full-time. But recruitment experts said the rise in part-time male workers also signalled an increase in pre-tirement – a trend where older gradually reduce their hours rather than suddenly retiring. Out of the 8.2million part-time workers in the UK, 5.6million have chosen to work shorter hours, 1.35million cannot find full-time work, 200,000 are ill or disabled and 1.02million are students. Karen Mattison, of Timewise – a company which helps people find flexible work – said: ‘In the past, discussions about flexible work have tended to focus more on women – and particularly mothers – rather than on men. ‘The challenge we face, is debunking the myth of the outdated perception of what flexible working means and for who. ‘Just as there is ‘no one reason’ for needing flexibility, there is no one ‘gender’ who needs it either. ‘Out of the 5.6 million people now choosing to work part time in the UK, the number of men now doing this has now hit the one million mark. ‘This is the future of work as we know it, and it is refreshing. Those who choose to work flexibly – be it reducing their hours or increasing their home working – are shaking up the status quo for both businesses and employees.’ There are now 1.02million men in the UK who have decided to reduce their hours compared to 4.58million women . Patrick Foley, Lloyds Banking Group’s chief economist, is one of a growing number of executives opting for part-time work. He is one of the most senior leaders at the group, yet works three days a week. He said that opting for part-time after many years of full-time work had enabled him to write a book and compete in Ironman triathlon races. Mr Foley said: ‘Having started working part time, I only wish I had done this earlier. It has brought new balance into my life without impacting my contribution in the office.’","Only 4% more women have chosen to go part-time over the last two years .

"A picture, believed to be the only image of the Civil War ironclad, the CSS Georgia has been revealed to be a fake created in a teenage hoax using a 2ft model. John Potter, from Savannah, has admitted forging the picture with his brother in the 1980s and placing it in a frame which now holds a picture of his dead dog. He then passed on the image on to the Georgia Historical Society and the photo became an unofficial part of the ship's history even though it was never authenticated. Scroll down for video . John Potter (pictured), from Savannah, has admitted forging the picture with his brother in the 1980s and placing the picture in a frame which now holds a picture of his dead dog . In 1986 he fibbed that he was at a yard sale when he found the photograph in an antique frame.Inscribed on the back of the frame, he claimed, was 'CSS Georgia.' He told historians that he didn't have the $175 the owner wanted . The picture Mr Potter handed over to the society was actually a picture of a picture. In 1986 he fibbed that he was at a yard sale when he found the photograph in an antique frame. Inscribed on the back of the frame, he claimed, was 'CSS Georgia.' He told historians that he didn't have the $175 the owner wanted, so he took a photo of it and then mailed it to historical groups in Savannah. Potter has now admitted the sham and explained how he falsified the image. When he was a teenager in Savannah, Potter, his brother Jeffrey and a friend shot a short 8mm movie about the building — and destruction — of the CSS Georgia in a fictional battle with Union troops. For the movie, they built an 18-foot long boat of plywood and Styrofoam, as well as a smaller 2-foot model. They based the design, in part, on his grandfather's recollections of details passed down by word of mouth through generations of their family. Potter also used an illustration of the ironclad he found on a postcard. To create the fake image Potter's younger brother put on a coat and straw hat went out to a marsh with a cane fishing pole and Potter took a photo. He took another photo of the 2-foot model and cut out the boat's image, glued it onto the photo of his brother, then used dirt and glue to create the illusion of a photo faded by age and stained by water or chemicals. Evidence of the hoax: All elements of the fakery were snapped by Potter at one time. The small model boat here appears alongside the false picture, polaroids of it and a 1984 copy of Mad Magazine . He bought an old picture frame and beat it up even further. He put the photo in it. Then he drove 120 miles to a yard sale in Waycross, Georgia, put the picture down and took a Polaroid of it. He laughs now, when he remembers that it had seemed so important that he actually do this at a yard sale, so at least that part would be true. 'Who knows what goes through the mind of a kid,' he said. The US Army Corps of Engineers appealed for information about the picture as it embarked on a project to raise the ironclad . Potter sent out the photo to historical groups, setting off the sporadic, and fruitless, search for a CSS Georgia photo that he now says never existed. As the Army Corps of Engineers embarked this year on a $14 million project to raise the wreckage of the real CSS Georgia from the river, archaeologists publicised the image online and in news stories hoping to track down the original photo. 'Wanted: A Photo Of This Confederate Battleship,' read the headline above the image on the Army Corps website. 'There are a lot of characteristics in the photograph that lead us to believe it is the CSS Georgia,' Julie Morgan, the Army Corps archaeologist in charge of raising the ironclad's remains, said in a February interview. 'On the other side, there are some skeptics who believe it's a complete fake.' Robert Holcombe, former curator of the National Civil War Naval Museum in Columbus, Georgia, said in February that while the original photograph would be needed to confirm if the image was authentic, he believed it was real. 'Most people seem to think so,' he said. 'Or else it's an awfully good fake'. The peeling gilt frame that once held the disputed photo, is now filled with a portrait of Potter's deceased pug, Puggy Van Dug. He never became a successful special effects artist with the exception of the one faked photo.

"Three more political parties have vowed to teach lifesaving skills in schools, backing The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to add first aid to the curriculum. Charities last night welcomed the move to create a new generation of lifesavers, saying it could prevent hundreds of deaths every year. Previously, only the Liberal Democrats had promised to add the crucial lessons to the school curriculum. But last week Labour, Ukip and the Green Party added their support as they unveiled their Election manifestos. Three more political parties have backed The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to add first aid to the curriculum . It means the Conservatives are the only major party not to make the same manifesto pledge. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told The Mail on Sunday that the issue was ‘close to his heart’. He said: ‘One of my constituents, a very fit 16-year-old called Daniel Young, collapsed and died on the football pitch ten years ago. It really touched me – as a parent, the trauma of losing a child in those circumstances is incomprehensible. ‘Our manifesto pledge is about making sure all children are taught basic CPR skills before leaving school. We want to empower a generation of children, and potentially save hundreds of lives. This is about community resilience and people looking after each other.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham (pictured left) said the issue was ‘close to his heart’ The Mail on Sunday is campaigning to make sure all schools teach basic first-aid techniques. The skills can also be taught by older children to their younger peers. The campaign has support from Schools Minister David Laws, teachers, doctors and leading charities. Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan believes schools should not be forced to teach first-aid skills as part of an overcrowded curriculum . However, Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insists that while first-aid skills are important, schools should not be forced to teach them as part of an overcrowded curriculum. She will instead modernise sex education lessons to include advice on ‘revenge porn’ and internet safety. St John Ambulance has launched a ‘promise portal’ to encourage all Election candidates to register their support for the campaign. Richard Fernandez, the charity’s head of public affairs, said: ‘We have been calling for first aid to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum, so that every child has the chance to learn to be a lifesaver. 'This is a policy that has had backing from individuals in all parties, but it has yet to become reality. ‘We’re delighted that Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Ukip and the Greens have now adopted this policy and included it in their General Election manifestos. 'We are continuing to call on all candidates from the other parties to give their individual support.’ For more information, visit thepromise.sja.org.uk.","Parties back The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to add first aid to curriculum .

"More than 100,000 people on the coast of the Pacific Northwest are in the path of a potentially deadly tsunami that could be similar to the one in 2011 that ravaged parts of Japan. The new study highlights the areas in Washington, Oregon and California that would require more time to successfully evacuate for higher ground in the case of the next natural disaster. It calculated that 94,872 residents and 42,424 employees live within the tsunami hazard zones of the three states. Also in danger are 486 public venues, 440 dependent care facilities and 2,314 businesses with a 'significant customer presence'. Scroll down for video . A tsunami evacuation route sign  in Nehalem, Oregon, just one of the Pacific Northwest communities in the path of a potentially deadly tsunami that could be similar to the one in 2011 that ravaged parts of Japan . Seventy-seven percent of the communities lying in the risk zone are equipped with the kind of geography and location to allow them the 15 to 25 minutes required for successful tsunami evacuation after a large-magnitude earthquake hits. And some communities can increase their chance of survival simply by walking faster. According to the analysis, 21,562 residents, more than 50 percent of which live in Washington, would not have time to evade the tsunami's waves if they were walking on foot at 2.2 mph. But if they adjusted their pace to 3.5 mph, the number of people at risk drops below 16,000. And 90 per cent of the 20,000 people who live in the two communities most at-risk, Aberdeen and Hoquiam in Washington,  could reach safety by just walking at a normal pace. 'Just by getting people to move faster, you can save thousands of lives,' Nathan Woods, US Geological Survey geographer and lead author of the study, told the Seattle Times. Wood said these communities would most benefit by making sure residents have studied the best tsunami evacuation routes. But there are the coastal towns who wouldn't have the time to evacuate on foot, no matter how fast they walk or run, according to the analysis, conducted by the US Geological Survey, the University of Colorado, Boulder and California State University, Sacramento. This graph ranks the chances of the 73 communities considered to be in the tsunami danger zone for a successful evacuation. The third class is considered 'unlikely to have successful evacuations' Washington communities Ocean Shores, Grays Harbor County, Pacific County and Long Beach, as well as Oregon town Seaside, are listed as 'unlikely to have successful evacuations'. According to Wood, these specific communities need to instead work toward designing and constructing tsunami evacuation structures so that reaching higher ground isn't necessary. But the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, warns that successful evacuations are not guaranteed for any community - no matter where its located. 'Individuals still need to understand the threat, recognize signs of imminent waves and take self-protective action,' it concludes. Wood told CBS News that any community on the coast of the Pacific Northwest was 'vulnerable to varying degrees' to a tsunami. 'Having a better sense of how a community is specifically vulnerable provides officials with the ability to develop outreach, preparedness, and evacuation plans that are tailored to local conditions and needs.'","Also in danger are over 400 public venues and dependent care facilities .

"Heathrow airport are threatening to strip Qantas of their eight valuable landing spots after they continually arrived late, according to internal memos. The Australian airline could also be facing a massive £20,000 fine, that's more than AU$38,000, for every time the A380 flights set down more than fifteen late on the English tarmac. Delayed: Qantas have been  told they could loose thier eight Heathrow landing strips after continuously arriving late to the busy airport . Fairfax published an internal a memo sent by Captain Martin Gardiner, manager of base operations at Sydney, that details the airlines failings while insisting can staff improve their waning performance. 'As a result of our performance, London airport has given Qantas an official warning; meaning that we could be fined £20,000 [$AU38,336] for each non-compliance of our slot time, or worse lose our slot.' 'We have been asked to advise Heathrow what our plans are to improve this performance. All areas of the business including flight operations are now monitoring the performance of these services very closely so that we can improve our performance and retain our landing slots in [London].' Qantas have slipped to an on time ranking of 75 out of 80 airlines that use Heathrow airport . While Qantas' on time performance rating at Heathrow dropped to 75th out of 80 in the month of February, they are at serious risk of losing their landing spots at Heathrow before next flying season. Captain Gardiner reportedly said changes in flight times in the last 12 months had 'placed some additional stress on our network and turn-around times'. A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that there are a number of factors that can impact our arrival time into London and because of the way scheduling works, small delays on a long journey have a cumulative knock on affect. 'One of the biggest impacts is air traffic delays to get into Heathrow, which is a particular issue because we arrive at one of the most popular times and the airport is now at about 100 per cent capacity.' He said Qantas will be trying to increase the speed of A380 flights to ensure they make it to Heathrow in time.

"Tony Blair was branded 'out of touch' last night after claiming that he is 'absolutely not' in 'the league of the super-rich'. The former prime minister also suggested he has left British politics behind, declaring that he has 'done British' and is now more interested in working at a 'global level'. Claiming the money he generates pays for the 'infrastructure' around him, Mr Blair said: 'I could not do what I do unless I was also able to generate income'. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has denied he is super-rich after joined the election campaign for Labour . He added: 'Am I better off than most people? Yeah, I'm very lucky. Am I in the league of the super-rich? Absolutely not, though you will have to make up your own mind about that.' Mr Blair, who entered the general election fray for Labour this week, spoke about his multi-million pound earnings in an interview with Newsweek magazine. Mr Blair earns millions of pounds a year from his consultancy roles and charges fees of £250,000 for public speaking. Tony Blair spoke about his multi-million pound earnings in an interview with Newsweek magazine . Since leaving Number Ten in 2007, he has established up a complex network of companies, which make it impossible to calculate his exact earnings. He rarely discusses his wealth, though he has dismissed reports he has amassed £100 million as 'greatly exaggerated', and his allies say he has given millions of pounds to charity. Mr Blair has suggested that in fact, he is worth less than £20million, though he and his family are thought to own property worth at least £30million. His five-storey central London home, and its accompanying mews house is thought to be worth at least £5million, while his Grade I-listed manor house in Buckinghamshire, once owned by Sir John Gielgud, is thought to be worth a similar amount. He and wife Cherie own a further seven properties. Mr Blair, who has been criticised for accepting advisory roles to foreign governments with dubious human rights records, insisted: 'I decided a long time ago that it's whether I'm doing the right thing or the wrong thing. 'If it's the right thing I'm doing, then I should be doing it even if I am being attacked for it.' Asked why he works mainly outside his home country, Mr Blair said: 'I've done British. I suppose where I think I can make most difference is a global level, working on things that had interested me as Prime Minister but was not able to devote myself to in the same way.' Tony Blair bought this Grade II listed Georgian town house in 2004 in central London worth more than £6m . The family purchased the mews house at the rear of their central London property worth approximately £1m . Mr Blair and his wife bought this Grade I listed mansion South Pavilion in Wooton Underwood in Buckinghamshire, once owned by Sir John Gielgud which has ncreased in value to almost £8 million . In what may be interpreted as criticism of Mr Miliband, as well as other political leaders, he warned that the 'centre ground is not leading strongly'. As well as the buy-to-let flats in the North West, the Blairs have a considerable portfolio of private homes for themselves and their children. One of Tony and Cherie’s two London properties is a £8 million five-storey Georgian townhouse, which they bought in 2004. Three years later they snapped up the £800,000 mews house behind it – and have since paid off the mortgage. In 2008 they bought a £5.75million Grade I listed Buckinghamshire manor house - now worth in the region of £8 million. A £1.35million four-storey Georgian property in the capital was bought for son Nicky, 28, last year – paid for in cash. And the couple also paid £600,000 in cash for a three-bedroom cottage in Buckinghamshire for Mr Blair’s sister Sarah the same year. They also purchased a £3.62million townhouse in the capital for Euan and his wife Suzanne. The £1.2million mews property behind it was bought for daughter Kathryn. 'Then you get what I would say are basically quack remedies being peddled by the more extreme versions of left or right. Practical evidence-based solutions get squeezed out in favour of policy positions that can be emotionally attractive but practically foolish or even dangerous,' he added. 'You can see this in the debates around immigration, particularly…. Patriotism is a great thing, but nationalism, especially of the narrow, partisan sort, always has real danger lurking underneath it… . 'One of the attractions of what I would call a Putin model of leadership is that in an era where the political leaders [are] to be hesitant about big positions, you've got somebody who is taking big positions. 'Now, I would not agree with those positions. But the attraction of that as a model, which is why a lot of these people like [Marine] le Pen and [Nigel] Farage and people praise him, is that there appears to be certainty about the solution. It's not a solution I would agree with. But it's interesting to reflect upon that.' Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke said: 'First we had 'Two Kitchens Miliband' lecturing people from his £2 million mansion and now multi-millionaire Tony Blair declaring he doesn't think he is ""super-rich"". 'It shows just how out of touch the champagne socialists at the top of the Labour Party are.' As well as the townhouse the Blairs purchased in 2004 and the country estate the couple bought in 2008, the family own at least four other large properties around London. They have made an estimated £5million from increases in the values of their properties, as well as around £100,000-a-year in rent from the flats they own in Manchester and Bristol. The Blairs bought the second of two flats in Bristol for £265,000 in 2002 with help of  Peter Foster . The two Victorian villas in Urmston, Manchester, have been converted into flats and sold to Mrs Blair and her son for £650,000 .","Tony Blair has claimed his personal wealth does not make him 'super-rich'

"A New York man who won three marathons in eight days last month said that his winnings will go toward the medical bills of his infant son, who has spina bifida, a developmental congenital disorder. Bryan Morseman, 29, from Bath, New York, started his streak at the Montgomery Marathon in Alabama on March 14. He ran the Tobacco Road Marathon in Cary, North Carolina, the next morning because it was one the way home to New York. A week later he placed first at the Yeungling Shamrock Marathon in Virginia Beach. Bryan Morseman, 29, of Bath, New York, ran three marathons in eight days in hopes of raising money to pay for Leeim's medical bills . Leeim was born with spina bifida, a developmental congenital disorder that starts in the womb when a baby's spine doesn't form properly . In total, the full-time precious metal clerk earned $5,750 in winnings from the races, all of which will go toward medical treatment for his nine-month-old son Leeim, who has spina bifida. 'Every time I'm in a race I think of him and how my pain is nothing compared to what he has gone through,' Morseman told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. 'He gives me the energy shot to pick me up and carry me through to the finish.' Since his first 26.2-mile race in 2008, Morseman has won 23 of the 42 marathons he's participated in. And he takes each race as it comes, not training for a specific race. 'I don't like putting all my eggs in one basket,' he said. 'When you only run a few, you waste time, training and money if it doesn't go well.' Bryan Morseman (right), pictured with his wife Sarah and son Leeim in 2014, has been running marathons since 2008. He has won 23 of the 42 26.2-mile races he has participated in . And last spring, Morseman and his wife Sarah were told their unborn sun was diagnosed with spina bifida, a condition that develops in the womb when a baby's spinal column doesn't form properly. If the condition is untreated, it can lead to brain damage, loss of leg usage and other heath problems. Following a series of doctor's appointments, Morseman, his pregnant wife, and their now two-year-old son went to Philadelphia so Sarah could undergo prenatal surgery, which led to Leeim being born on June 20. Nearly ten months later, Leeim does physical therapy three times a week, but it is  unknown as to whether or not he will be able to walk. Leeim was born prematurely because if spina bifida is left untreated, it can lead to brain damage and loss of leg usage . Morseman said that knowing he's raising money for his son give him 'the energy shot' he needs to win races . As for Morseman, he trains for his races during his lunch breaks and late at night after his sons are asleep. When it's dark, his wife follows him in the car. The life-long runner's personal best is 2:19:57 at the Pocono Marathon Run for Red Mountain, which he's won four times, last May. He ran his three March races in 2:24:40 in Alabama, 2:32:39 in North Carolina and 2:24:10 in Virginia. As an ultimate goal he'd hope to qualify for the U.S. Olympic Marathon Trails, which has a standard of 2:18 to get in. But Morseman has other things on his mind. 'We'll see,' he told the Democrat and Chronicle. 'Other things happen in life. Right now, my family is far more important than qualifying.' The Morseman family has created a GoFundMe page to help pay for medical bills. Morseman said his family is very supportive of him running marathons. He trains during his lunch breaks and late at night when his sons are asleep .","Bryan Morseman, of Bath, New York, won marathons on March 14, 15 and 22 .
